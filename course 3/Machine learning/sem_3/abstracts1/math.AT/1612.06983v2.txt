The study of higher tangential structures, arising from higher connected covers of Lie groups (String, Fivebrane, Ninebrane structures), require considerable machinery for a full description, especially for connections to geometry and applications. With utility in mind, in this paper we study these structures at the rational level and by considering Lie groups as a starting point for defining each of the higher structures, making close connection to $p_i$-structures. We indicatively call these (rational) Spin-Fivebrane and Spin-Ninebrane structures. We study the space of such structures and characterize their variations, which reveal interesting effects whereby variations of higher structures are arranged to systematically involve lower ones. These patterns turn out to arise in applications, which we demonstrate within M-theory and string theory. We also study the homotopy type of the gauge group corresponding to bundles equipped with the higher rational structures that we define.
