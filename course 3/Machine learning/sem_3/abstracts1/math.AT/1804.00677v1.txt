We investigate topological T-duality in the framework of non-abelian gerbes and higher gauge groups. We show that this framework admits the gluing of locally defined T-duals, in situations where no globally defined ("geometric") T-duals exists. The gluing results into new, higher-geometrical objects that can be used to study non-geometric T-duals, alternatively to other approaches like non-commutative geometry.
