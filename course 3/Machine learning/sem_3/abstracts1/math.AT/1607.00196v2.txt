We consider three a priori totally different setups for Hopf algebras from number theory, mathematical physics and algebraic topology. These are the Hopf algebras of Goncharov for multiple zeta values, that of Connes--Kreimer for renormalization, and a Hopf algebra constructed by Baues to study double loop spaces. We show that these examples can be successively unified by considering simplicial objects, cooperads with multiplication and Feynman categories at the ultimate level. These considerations open the door to new constructions and reinterpretation of known constructions in a large common framework.
