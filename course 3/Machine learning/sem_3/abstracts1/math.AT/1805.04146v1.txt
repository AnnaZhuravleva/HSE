We construct a geometric model for complex analytic equivariant elliptic cohomology for all compact Lie groups $G$. Cocycles are functions on a rigorously defined space of dimensionally reduced classical fields for the two-dimensional gauged $\sigma$-model with $\mathcal{N} = (0, 1)$ supersymmetry. This connection to physics provides means of constructing privileged cocycles. Given a representation $R$ of a group $G$, the partition function of an $R$-valued free fermion theory (made rigorous by $\zeta$-regularization) yields a cocycle representative of the equivariant elliptic Euler class. For $G=U(n)$ and $R$ its standard $n$-dimensional representation, we identify this Euler cocycle with the character of the level 1 loop group representation of $LU(n)$. Finally, in the special case of $G = U(1)$, the Euler cocycle encodes the group law of the (dual) elliptic curve. This provides a geometric and physical manifestation of the elliptic formal group law central to the homotopy theoretic construction of elliptic cohomology.
