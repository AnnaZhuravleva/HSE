Starting from a biased definition of a properad, we describe explicitly algebras over the cobar construction of a properad. Equivalent description in terms of solutions of generalized master equations, which can be interpreted as homological differential operators, are explained from the properadic point of view. This is parallel to the Barannikov's theory for modular operads. In addition to well known IBL-homotopy algebras, the examples include their associative analogues, which we call $IBA$-homotopy algebras, and a combination of the above two.
