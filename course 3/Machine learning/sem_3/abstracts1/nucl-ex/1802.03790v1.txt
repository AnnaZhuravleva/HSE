We studied the production of neutron-rich nuclides in multinucleon transfer collisions of stable and radioactive beams in the mass range A=40-60. We first presented our experimental cross section data of projectile fragments from the reaction of 40Ar(15 MeV/nucleon) with 64Ni, 58Ni and 27Al. We then compared them with calculations based on either the deep-inelastic transfer (DIT) model or the constrained molecular dynamics (CoMD) model, followed by the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). An overall good agreement of the calculations with the experimental data is obtained. We continued with calculations of the reaction of 40Ar (15 MeV/nucleon) with 238U target and then with reactions of 48Ca (15 MeV/nucleon) with 64Ni and 238U targets. In these reactions, neutron-rich rare isotopes with large cross sections are produced. These nuclides, in turn, can be assumed to form radioactive beams and interact with a subsequent target (preferably 238U), leading to the production of extremely neutron-rich and even new isotopes (e.g. 60Ca) in this mass range. We conclude that multinucleon transfer reactions with stable or radioactive beams at the energy of around 15 MeV/nucleon offer an effective route to access extremely neutron-rich rare isotopes for nuclear structure or reaction studies.
