The spatial and temporal characteristics of particle emitting source produced in particle and/or nuclear collisions can be measured by using two-particle femtoscopic correlations. These correlations arise due to quantum statistics, Coulomb and strong final state interactions. In this paper we report on the calculations of like-sign pion femtoscopic correlations produced in p+p, p+Au, d+Au, Au+Au at top RHIC energy using Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics Model (UrQMD). Three-dimensional correlation functions are constructed using the Bertsch-Pratt parametrization of the two-particle relative momentum. The correlation functions are studied in several transverse mass ranges. The emitting source radii of charged pions, Rout , Rside , Rlong , are obtained from Gaussian fit to the correlation functions and compared to data from the STAR and PHENIX experiments.
