We present the results of precision mass measurements of neutron-rich cadmium isotopes. These nuclei approach the $N=82$ closed neutron shell and are important to nuclear structure as they lie near doubly-magic $^{132}$Sn on the chart of nuclides. Of particular note is the clear identification of the ground state mass in $^{127}$Cd along with the isomeric state. We show that the ground state identified in a previous mass measurement which dominates the mass value in the Atomic Mass Evaluation is an isomeric state. In addition to $^{127/m}$Cd, we present other cadmium masses measured ($^{125/m}$Cd and $^{126}$Cd) in a recent TITAN experiment at TRIUMF. Finally, we compare our measurements to new \emph{ab initio} shell-model calculations and comment on the state of the field in the $N=82$ region.
