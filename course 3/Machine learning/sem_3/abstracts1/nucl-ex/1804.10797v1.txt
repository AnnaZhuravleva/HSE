An experiment for $p(^{14}\rm{C}$,$^{14}\rm{C}^{*}\rightarrow^{10}\rm{Be}+\alpha)\mathit{p}$ inelastic excitation and decay was performed in inverse kinematics at a beam energy of 25.3 MeV/u. A series of $^{14}\rm{C}$ excited states, including a new one at 18.3(1) MeV, were observed which decay to various states of the final nucleus of $^{10}\rm{Be}$. A specially designed telescope-system, installed around the zero degree, played an essential role in detecting the resonant states near the $\alpha$-separation threshold. A state at 14.1(1) MeV is clearly identified, being consistent with the predicted band-head of the molecular rotational band characterized by the $\pi$-bond linear-chain-configuration. Further clarification of the properties of this exotic state is suggested by using appropriate reaction tools.
