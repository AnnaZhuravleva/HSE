The bulk motion of nuclear matter at the ultra-high temperatures created in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider is well described in terms of nearly inviscid hydrodynamics, thereby establishing this system of quarks and gluons as the most perfect fluid in nature. A revolution in the field is underway, spearheaded by the discovery of similar collective, fluid-like phenomena in much smaller systems including p+p, p+A, d+Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions. We review these exciting new observations and their implications.
