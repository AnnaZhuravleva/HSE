We present precision measurements of the 3He + 4He --> 7Be reaction in the range ECM = 0.33 to 1.23 MeV using a small gas cell and detection of both prompt gamma rays and 7Be activity. Our prompt and activity measurements are in good agreement within an experimental uncertainty of several percent. We find S(0) = 0.595 +/- 0.018 keV b from fits of the Kajino theory to our data. We compare our results with published measurements, and we discuss the consequences for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and for solar neutrino flux calculations.
