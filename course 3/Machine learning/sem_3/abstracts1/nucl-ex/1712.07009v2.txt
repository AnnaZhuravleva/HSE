We present new data probing short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei through the measurement of electron scattering off high-momentum nucleons in nuclei. The inclusive 4He/3He cross section ratio is observed to be both x and Q2 independent for 1.5 < x < 2, confirming the dominance of two- nucleon (2N) short-range correlations (SRCs). For x > 2, our data do not support a previous claim of three-nucleon (3N) correlation dominance. While contributions beyond those from stationary 2N- SRCs are observed, our data show that isolating 3N-SRCs is more complicated than for 2N-SRCs.
