We describe an experimental search for deviations from the inverse square law of gravity at the nanometer length scale using neutron scattering from noble gases on a pulsed slow neutron beamline. By measuring the neutron momentum transfer ($q$) dependence of the differential cross section for xenon and helium and comparing to their well-known analytical forms, we place an upper bound on the strength of a new interaction as a function of interaction length $\lambda$ which improves upon previous results in the region $\lambda < 0.1\,$nm, and remains competitive in the larger $\lambda$ region. A pseudoexperimental simulation developed for this experiment and its role in the data analysis described. We conclude with plans for improving sensitivity in the larger $\lambda$ region.
