In the frame of a systematical study of light ion induced nuclear reactions on platinum, activation cross sections for deuteron induced reactions were investigated. Excitation functions were measured in the 20.8 - 49.2 MeV energy range for the natPt(d,xn)191,192,193,194,195,196m2,196g,198g,199Au, natPt(d,x)188,189,191,195m,197m,197gPt and natPt(d,x)189,190,192,194m2Ir reactions by using the stacked foil irradiation technique. The experimental results are compared with previous results from the literature and with the theoretical predictions in the TENDL-2014 and TENDL-2015 libraries. The applicability of the produced radio-tracers for wear measurements has been presented.
