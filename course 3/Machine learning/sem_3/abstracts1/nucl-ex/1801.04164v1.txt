We present the invariant yield and elliptic flow of D$_{\rm_{S}}$ as a function of transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The nuclear modification factors of D$_{\rm_{S}}$ are found to be systematically higher than those of K$^{0}_{\rm_{S}}$ . The ratio between the yields of strange and non-strange open charm mesons is shown. We find that such a ratio in 0-40$\%$ central Au+Au collisions is higher than the fragmentation baseline. Our measurement indicates a substantial enhancement of D$_{\rm_{S}}$ production in Au+Au collisions with respect to p+p collisions as compared to non-strange D mesons. The elliptic flow of D$_{\rm_{S}}$ is also measured and compared to that of D$^{0}$ as well as model calculations.
