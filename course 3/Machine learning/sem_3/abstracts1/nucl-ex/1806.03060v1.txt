The results of the experimental search for two-neutrino $2K$-capture in $^{124}$Xe with a large copper proportional counter obtained by processing the data for an exposure of 37.7 kg$\times$day are presented. The experimental setup is located at the Underground Low-Background Laboratory of the Baksan Neutrino Observatory at a depth of 4900 m w.e. The combination of methods of selection of useful signals with a unique set of characteristics and the event topology taken into account allowed us to suppress the background in the energy region of interest. A new half-life limit for $2K(2\nu)$-capture in $^{124}$Xe was determined: T$_{1/2}\geq7.7\cdot10^{21}$ yrs (90\%   C.L.).
