Excitation functions were measured for the $^{nat}$Ag(d,x)$^{105,104}$Cd, $^{110m,108m,106m,105g,104g}$Ag and $^{101}$Pd, $^{105,101m}$Rh reactions over the energy range 33 50 MeV by using the stacked foil activation technique and subsequent high-resolution gamma spectrometry. We present the first experimental cross section data above 40 MeV for all of these reactions and the first experimental cross section data for $^{nat}$Ag(d,x)$^{108m,104g}$Ag and $^{105,103}$Rh. The experimental data are compared with results of the model calculations performed with the ALICE D, EMPIRE D theoretical nuclear reaction model codes and with the TALYS code results as available in the TENDL2014 and 2015 on-line libraries.
