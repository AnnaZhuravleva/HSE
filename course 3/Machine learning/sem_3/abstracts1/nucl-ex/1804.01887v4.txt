Prospects of experimental studies of argon and chlorine isotopes located far beyond the proton drip line are studied by using systematics and cluster models. The deviations from the widespread systematics observed in $^{28,29}$Cl and $^{29,30}$Ar have been theoretically substantiated, and analogous deviations predicted for the lighter chlorine and argon isotopes. The limits of nuclear structure existence are predicted for $^{26}$Ar and $^{25}$Cl in the respective isotopic chains. By simultaneous measurements of protons and $\gamma$-rays following decays of such systems as well as their $\beta$-delayed emission, an interesting synergy effect may be achieved, which is demonstrated by the example of $^{30}$Cl and $^{31}$Ar ground state studies. Such synergy effect may be provided by the new EXPERT setup (EXotic Particle Emission and Radioactivity by Tracking), being operated inside the fragment separator and spectrometer facility at GSI, Darmstadt.
