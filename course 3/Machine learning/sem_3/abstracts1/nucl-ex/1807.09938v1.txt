In these proceedings, an overview of recent quarkonium measurements in nuclear collisions carried out at both RHIC and LHC is presented. In p+p collisions, despite theoretical progresses made in understanding the production mechanisms for quarkonia, a complete picture is still yet to be achieved. In p+A collisions where measurements are done to quantify the cold nuclear matter effects, significant suppression of quarkonium production is observed for low transverse momentum region at both forward- and mid-rapidities. Furthermore, results from A+A collisions show the interplay of dissociation and regeneration contributions for charmonium at different collision energies, while a correspondence between the suppression level and the binding energy is observed for bottomonium family. Comparisons to experimental data provide stringent tests to model calculations, and help constrain the temperature of the deconfined medium created in heavy-ion collisions.
