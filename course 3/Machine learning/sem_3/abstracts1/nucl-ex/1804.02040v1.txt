The $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction plays a central role in astrophysics, but its cross section at energies relevant for astrophysical applications is only poorly constrained by laboratory data. The reduced $\alpha$ width, $\gamma_{11}$, of the bound $1^-$ level in $^{16}$O is particularly important to determine the cross section. The magnitude of $\gamma_{11}$ is determined via sub-Coulomb $\alpha$-transfer reactions or the $\beta$-delayed $\alpha$ decay of $^{16}$N, but the latter approach is presently hampered by the lack of sufficiently precise data on the $\beta$-decay branching ratios. Here we report improved branching ratios for the bound $1^-$ level and for $\beta$-delayed $\alpha$ emission. In the case of the $\beta$-delayed $\alpha$ branch, we find a $5\sigma$ deviation from the literature value. With our new branching ratios, the constraints imposed on $\gamma_{11}$ by the $\beta\alpha$-decay and $\alpha$-transfer data are of similar precision and, for the first time, in good agreement. The weighted average of the two gives a robust and precise determination of $\gamma_{11}$, which may permit the $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)$ cross section to be constrained within $10\%$ in the energy range relevant to hydrostatic He burning.
