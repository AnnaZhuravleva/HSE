Hadronic resonances are unique probes that allow the properties of heavy-ion collisions to be studied. Topics that can be studied include modification of spectral shapes, in-medium energy loss of parsons, vector-meson spin alignment, hydrodynamic flow, recombination, strangeness production, and the properties of the hadronic phase. Measurements of resonances in p+p, p+A, and d+A collisions serve as baselines for heavy-ion studies and also permit searches for possible collective effects in these smaller systems. These proceedings present a selection of results related to these topics from experiments at RHIC, LHC, and other facilities, as well as comparisons to theoretical models.
