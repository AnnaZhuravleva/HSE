Hard splittings in the evolution of a jet may be modified by the presence of a dense strongly interacting medium. Grooming procedures can be used to isolate such hard components of a jet and allows one to focus on the two subjets resulting from a sufficiently hard partonic splitting. Measurements of the symmetry parameter ($z_{\rm{g}}$), angular separation ($R_{\rm{g}}$) and number of splittings ($n_{\rm{SD}}$) of Soft Drop groomed jets are reported as measured with the ALICE Detector in pp and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV respectively. The use of recursive splittings and their mappings to identify interesting regions of phase space are also discussed.
