In the present work, we report our in depth study of 12C(p,p'gamma)12C reaction both experimentally and theoretically with proton beam energy ranging from 8 MeV to 22 MeV. The angular distributions were measured at six different angles. We discuss the gamma angular distributions, total cross sections values for 4.438, 9.64, 12.7 and 15.1 MeV states. We also describe the theoretical interpretation of our measurements using optical model analysis. We also report the branching ratios from our measurements. For the first time, we have measured the the cross section and branching ratio for the 9.64 MeV state.
