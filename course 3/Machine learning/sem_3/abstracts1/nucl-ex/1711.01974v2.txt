We measured the g_1 spin structure function of the deuteron at low $Q^{2}$, where QCD can be approximated with chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT). The data cover the resonance region, up to an invariant mass of $W \approx 1.9$ GeV. The generalized Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum, the moment $\Gamma_{1}^{d}$ and the spin polarizability $\gamma_{0}^{d}$ are precisely determined down to a minimum $Q^2$ of 0.02 GeV$^2$ for the first time, about 2.5 times lower than that of previous data. We compare them to several $\chi$PT calculations and models. These results are the first in a program of benchmark measurements of polarization observables in the$\chi$PT domain.
