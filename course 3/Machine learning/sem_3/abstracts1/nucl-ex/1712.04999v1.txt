An increasing number of experimental data indicates the breaking of axial symmetry in many heavy nuclei already in the valley of stability: Multiple Coulomb excitation analysed in a rotation invariant way, gamma transition rates and energies in odd nuclei, mass predictions, the splitting of Giant Resonances (GR), the collective enhancement of nuclear level densities and Maxwellian averaged neutron capture cross sections. For the interpretation of these experimental observations the axial symmetry breaking shows up in nearly all heavy nuclei as predicted by Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations [1] ; this indicates a nuclear Jahn-Teller effect. We show that nearly no parameters remain free to be adjusted by separate fitting to level density or giant resonance data, if advance information on nuclear deformations, radii etc. are taken from such calculations with the force parameters already fixed. The data analysis and interpretation have to include the quantum mechanical requirement of zero point oscillations and the distinction between static vs. dynamic symmetry breaking has to be regarded.
