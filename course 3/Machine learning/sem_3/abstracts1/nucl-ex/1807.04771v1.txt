We report on the first evidence for a non-zero rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_{1}$) for $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ mesons in 10-80\% centrality Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200~GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC. The slope of the $v_1$ rapidity dependence ($dv_{1}/dy$) averaged over $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ is about 20 times larger (2.9$\sigma$ significance) than that for charged kaons and the sign of $dv_{1}/dy$ is the same for averaged $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ mesons and charged kaons. Models indicate that the large $dv_{1}/dy$ of $D^{0}$ mesons is sensitive to the initially tilted source. We also present a new measurement of the $D^{0}$ meson elliptic flow ($v_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200~GeV with an improved precision relative to previously published results. The $D^{0}$ $v_{2}$ results are compared to those of light-flavor hadrons to test the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling. Both the $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ results are compared to recent hydrodynamic and transport model calculations.
