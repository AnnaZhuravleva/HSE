The $^{22}$Ne($\alpha,n$)$^{25}$Mg reaction is an important source of neutrons for the s-process. Due to the difficulty in directly measuring the cross section of this reaction and the competing $^{22}$Ne($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg reaction, indirect methods are frequently used to try to instead calculate the relevant reaction rates. Uncertainty, however, persists in the number and properties of the pertinent excited states of $^{26}$Mg.   In this paper, the results of proton and deuteron scattering from $^{26}$Mg are presented, giving a list of levels in $^{26}$Mg. In addition, level assignments in $^{26}$Mg are discussed, including some possible changes to the previously accepted assignments in $^{26}$Mg.
