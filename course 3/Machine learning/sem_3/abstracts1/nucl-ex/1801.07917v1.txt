Experimental isomeric yield ratios for the 113In({\gamma},n)112m,gIn reactions on the betatron B25/30 bremsstrahlung gamma beam of energy range 12-25 MeV are measured. Effective cross-sections of ({\gamma},n)-reactions with 112mIn and 114mIn isomers output are calculated. The Penfold-Leiss and Tikhonov methods are applied to solve the Volterra integral equation. The obtained experimental cross-sections are compared with theoretical calculations using the TALYS-1.6 code.
