Exclusive measurements of the quasi-free $pp \to pp\pi^+\pi^-$ reaction have been carried out at WASA@COSY by means of $pd$ collisions at $T_p$ = 1.2 GeV. Total and differential cross sections have been extracted covering the energy region $T_p = 1.08 - 1.36$ GeV, which is the region of $N^*(1440)$ and $\Delta(1232)\Delta(1232)$ resonance excitations. Calculations describing these excitations by $t$-channel meson exchange are at variance with the measured differential cross sections and underpredict substantially the experimental total cross section. An isotensor $\Delta N$ dibaryon resonance with $I(J^P) = 2(1^+)$ produced associatedly with a pion is able to overcome these deficiencies.
