Quark interactions with topological gluon fields in QCD can yield local $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{CP}$ violations which could explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our universe. Effects of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{CP}$ violations can result in charge separation under a strong magnetic field, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Experimental measurements of the CME-induced charge separation in heavy-ion collisions are dominated by physics backgrounds. Major theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted to eliminating or reducing those backgrounds. We review the current status of these efforts in the search for the CME in heavy-ion collisions.
