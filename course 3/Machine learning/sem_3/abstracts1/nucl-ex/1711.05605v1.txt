Charged pion two-particle correlation functions were measured in 0-30% centrality 200 GeV Au+Au collisions with the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. The measured correlation functions can be statistically well described based on the assumption of Levy-shaped source distributions. In this proceedings paper we present the Levy parameters of the measured correlation functions: correlation strength parameter lambda, Levy index alpha and Levy scale parameter R as a function of pair transverse mass mT, in 31 bins from 228 to 871 MeV, separately for positive and negative pion pairs. We discuss the physical interpretation of the mT dependence of the parameters.
