We present the measurements related to global polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons and spin alignment of $\mathrm{K^{*0}}~$ vector mesons at mid-rapidity for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~$= 2.76 TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. The global polarization measurements are carried out with respect to the first order event plane while the spin alignment measurements are carried out with respect to the production plane. No global polarization signal for $\Lambda$ is observed for 5-15\% and 15-50\% central Pb-Pb collisions. The spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ is found to have values slightly below 1/3 at low transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) for $\mathrm{K^{*0}}~$ mesons, while it is consistent with 1/3 (no spin alignment) at higher $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. No spin alignment is observed for $\mathrm{K^{*0}}~$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and for the spin zero hadron $\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}~$ in 20-40\% Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~$ = 2.76 TeV.
