Global spin alignment of vector mesons is a sensitive probe of system vorticity and particle production mechanism in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The measurement of global spin alignment is gaining increasing interest and deserves careful considerations. In this paper, we lay out a few practical issues that need to be taken care of when measuring global spin alignment of vector mesons. They are, the correction for event plane resolution, reconciling measurements made with different event planes, the correction for the effect of finite acceptance in pseudorapidity, and the consideration for measuring the azimuthal angle dependence. Insights and methodologies offered in this paper will help experiments to measure the global spin alignment properly and accurately.
