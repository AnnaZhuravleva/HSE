The half-life of the $^{20}$F ground state has been measured using a radioactive beam implanted in a plastic scintillator and recording $\beta\gamma$ coincidences together with four CsI(Na) detectors. The result, $T_{1/2} = 11.0011(69)_{\rm stat}(30)_{\rm sys}$~s, is at variance by 17 combined standard deviations with the two most precise results. The present value revives the poor consistency of results for this half-life and calls for a new measurement, with a technique having different sources of systematic effects, to clarify the discrepancy.
