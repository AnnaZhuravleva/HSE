Investigation of femtoscopic correlation functions in relativistic heavy ion reactions is an important tool to access the space-time structure of particle production in the sQGP. The shape of the correlation functions is often assumed to be Gaussian, but a detailed analysis reveals that the statistically correct assumption could be the so-called L\'evy distribution. The detailed analysis of correlation functions in various systems may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. It could also reveal if there is partially coherent pion production or could indicate the possible in-medium mass modification of the $\eta'$ meson due to the (partial) restoration of the $U_A(1)$ axial symmetry. In this paper we present the status of the centrality dependent measurements of two-pion L\'evy Bose-Einstein correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at PHENIX.
