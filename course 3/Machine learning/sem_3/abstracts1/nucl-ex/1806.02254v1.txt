A first dedicated measurement of the quenching of the weak axial-vector coupling strength $g_{\rm A}$ was performed by the COBRA collaboration. The $\beta$-electron spectrum shape of the fourfold forbidden non-unique decay of $^{113}$Cd strongly depends on the effective value of $g_{\rm A}$. Using an array of CdZnTe semiconductor detectors, 45 independent spectra were obtained and interpreted in the context of three different nuclear models. The resulting effective mean values are $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{ISM}) = 0.915 \pm 0.021$, $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{MQPM}) = 0.911 \pm 0.009$ and $\overline{g}_{\rm A}(\text{IBFM-2}) = 0.943 \pm 0.090$. The measurement proves that the weak axial-vector constant in nuclei deviates significantly from the free value.
