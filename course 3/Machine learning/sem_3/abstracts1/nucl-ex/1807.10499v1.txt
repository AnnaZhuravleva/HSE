Low lying states of $^{198}$Hg have been investigated via $^{197}$Au($^{7}$Li, $ \alpha $2n$ \gamma $)$ ^{198} $Hg reaction at E$ _{\text{beam}} $ = 33 MeV and 38 MeV and the members of $ \gamma $-vibrational band have been identified. Results are compared with the systematic of this mass region and found in agreement. Observed band structures have been interpreted using the theoretical framework of microscopic triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach and it is shown that TPSM results are in fair agreement with the observed energies.
