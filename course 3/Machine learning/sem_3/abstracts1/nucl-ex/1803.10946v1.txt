The `lithium problem' in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) has recently focused on the reactions involving $^7$Be. The $^6$Li($p, \gamma$)$^7$Be reaction can provide us not only the information for destroying $^6$Li but also the information for producing $^7$Be. In the present work, the proton spectroscopic factor in $^7$Be was extracted to be 0.70 $\pm$ 0.17 from the angular distribution of $^7$Be($d$, $^3$He)$^6$Li at $E_\mathrm{c.m.}$ = 6.7 MeV. The value was then used to compute the direct component of the astrophysical $^6$Li($p, \gamma$)$^7$Be$_\mathrm{g.s.}$ S(E) factors and determine the resonance parameters from the total S(E) factors.
