A recent analysis of experimental ternary fission fragment yields using a nucleation moderated statistical equilibrium model reproduced observed yields with fairly good accuracy. In the present work, the same approach is applied to neck emission in peripheral and mid-peripheral 124Sn+112,124Sn collisions at 26A MeV. The model can reasonably reproduce the yields of lithium to silicon isotopes with realistic time and temperature values. A comparison is made between equilibrium constants derived from the present data and those previously obtained for ternary fission of 242Pu.
