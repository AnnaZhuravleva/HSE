Activation cross sections of the natEr(d,x)163,165,166,167,168,170Tm and natEr(d,x)171,161Er nuclear reactions have been measured in the 32-50 MeV energy range, above 40 MeV for the first time. The activation method with stacked foil irradiation technique and gamma-ray spectroscopy were used. The experimental cross sections were compared with the theoretical predictions in the TENDL-2015 library.
