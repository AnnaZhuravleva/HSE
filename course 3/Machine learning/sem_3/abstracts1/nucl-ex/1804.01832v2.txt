Fragment mass distributions produced in the fission of excited $^{178}$Pt -- synthesized in a complete fusion reaction $^{36}$Ar + $^{142}$Nd, at beam energies of 155, 170 and 180 MeV -- have been deduced. The data are indicative of a mixture of the mass-asymmetric and mass-symmetric fission modes associated with different kinetic energies of the fragments. This constitutes the first observation of a multimodal fission in the sub-lead region. The measured fragment yields are dominated by asymmetric mass splits, with the symmetric mode contributing at the level of $\approx1/3$. The experimental fragment-mass asymmetry of the asymmetric mode, $A_{L}/A_{H}\approx 79/99$, is well reproduced by nuclear density functional theory. According to theory, the lower-energy symmetric mode is associated with very elongated fission fragments, which is consistent with the total kinetic energy/fragment mass correlation.
