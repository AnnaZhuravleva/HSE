Recently, three successful antineutrino experiments (Daya Bay, Double Chooz, and RENO) measured the neutrino mixing angle theta_13; however, significant discrepancies were found, both in the absolute flux and spectral shape. In this study, the antineutrino spectra were calculated by using the updated nuclear database, and we found that the four isotopes antineutrino spectrum have all contribution to the 5--7 MeV bump with ENDF/B-VII.1 fission yield. The bump can be explained well using the updated library and more important isotopes contribution to the bump were also given. In the last, the fission yield correlation coefficient between the four isotopes were discussed, and found that the correlation coefficients are very large.
