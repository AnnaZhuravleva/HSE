Studies of longitudinal correlations of the charged-particle multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions have provided insights into the asymmetry and fluctuations of the initial-state collision geometry. In addition to the expansion of the medium in the transverse direction, commonly quantified using Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$), the initial geometry and resulting longitudinal expansion as a function of azimuthal angle enable us to better understand the full 3-dimensional picture of heavy-ion collisions. In these proceedings, azimuthal correlations of the longitudinal structure of charged-particle multiplicity are reported for Pb-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The azimuthal angle distribution is divided into regions of in-plane and out-of-plane with respect to the second-order event plane, and the coefficients of Legendre polynomials are estimated from a decomposition of the longitudinal structure of the charged-particle multiplicity at midrapidity ($|\eta| < 0.8$) on an event-by-event basis in each azimuthal region for different centralities. Correlations between the coefficients of various orders in different azimuthal regions are studied and exhibit collective features of longitudinal structure in the azimuthal direction. The results are compared with HIJING and AMPT simulations.
