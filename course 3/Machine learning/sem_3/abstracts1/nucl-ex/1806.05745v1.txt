The last decades of high energy physics revealed, that in ultra-relativistic ion-ion collisions, a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created. Varying the collision energy allows for the investigation of the phase diagram of QCD matter. The nature of the quark-hadron transition can be studied via femtoscopy, as the investigation of momentum correlations in heavy ion reactions reveals the space-time structure of the hadron production of the sQGP. Going beyond the Gaussian assumption the shape of this source may be described by L\'evy distributions. In this paper we report on recent femtoscopic measurements of PHENIX, utilizing L\'evy sources.
