The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to charge separation along a strong magnetic field of single-handed quarks, caused by interactions with topological gluon fields from QCD vacuum fluctuations. A major background of CME measurements in heavy-ion collisions comes from resonance decays coupled with elliptical flow anisotropy. These proceedings present two new studies from STAR to shed further light on the background issue: (1) small system p+Au and d+Au collisions where the CME signal is not expected, and (2) pair invariant mass dependence where resonance peaks can be identified.
