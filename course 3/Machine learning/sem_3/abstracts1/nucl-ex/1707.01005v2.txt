The azimuthal anisotropy coefficient $v_2$ of prompt D$^0$, D$^+$, D$^{*+}$ and D$_s^+$ mesons was measured in mid-central (30-50% centrality class) Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The D mesons were reconstructed via their hadronic decays at mid-rapidity, $|y|<0.8$, in the transverse momentum interval $1<p_{\rm T}<24$ GeV/$c$. The measured D-meson $v_2$ has similar values as that of charged pions. The D$_s^+$ $v_2$, measured for the first time, is found to be compatible with that of non-strange D mesons. The measurements are compared with theoretical calculations of charm-quark transport in a hydrodynamically expanding medium and have the potential to constrain medium parameters.
