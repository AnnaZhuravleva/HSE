A search for the double beta decay transition of $^{94}$Zr into the first excited state of $^{94}$Mo has been performed at the Felsenkeller underground laboratory in Dresden, Germany. A 341.1 g zirconium sample with natural isotopic composition has been measured for 43.9 d in an ultra low background gamma spectroscopy setup. No signal has been observed and a new best lower half-life limit is set as $5.2\times10^{19}$ yr (90% CI). This limit is valid for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ and $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay into excited states of $^{94}$Mo but cannot distinguish between the two modes. Existing limits are improved by 50%.
