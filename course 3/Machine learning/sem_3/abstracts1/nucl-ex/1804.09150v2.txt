We examined several low-$Q^2$ elastic $ep$ and $ed$ scattering data sets using various models to extract the proton and deuteron rms radii and developed a comprehensive algorithm for estimating the systematic bias of each extracted radius. In each case, we chose the model and upper bound for $Q^2$ that minimized the variance and bias of the extracted radius. We attribute the discrepancy between small ($\approx 0.84$~fm) and large ($\approx 0.88$~fm) proton radius fits to the absence of data that can accurately isolate the linear and quadratic contributions to the form factor at low-$Q^2$. In light of this ambiguity, we determined the proton and deuteron radii by finding the most likely radius value in a distribution of many possible fits. These values were 0.840(1)~fm for the proton and 2.092(35)~fm for the deuteron.
