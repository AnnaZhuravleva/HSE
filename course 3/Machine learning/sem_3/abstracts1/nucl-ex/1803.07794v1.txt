Excitation functions were measured in the 31 - 49.2 MeV energy range for the natPd(d,xn)111,110m,106m,105,104g,103Ag, natPd(d,x) 111m,109,101,100Pd, natPd(d,x), 105,102m,102g,101m,101g,100,99m,99gRh and natPd(d,x)103,97Ru nuclear reactions by using the stacked foil irradiation technique. The experimental results are compared with our previous results and with the theoretical predictions calculated with the ALICE-D, EMPIRE-D and TALYS (TENDL libraries) codes.
