Jets and direct photons are used to probe the formation and the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) by the ALICE Collaboration. The results shown here will present the measurements obtained from Pb$-$Pb and p$-$Pb collisions. It is observed that in Pb$-$Pb collisions jets are collimated and hadron yields ($\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$) at high transverse momentum undergo strong suppression due to the interaction of the patrons with the QGP. On the other hand, photons do not show any suppression in this region, and, in addition, an excess attributed to a thermal emission is observed at low transverse momentum. No hints of medium modifications are observed for the p$-$Pb results, for which a jet quenching limit of $-$0.4 GeV/$c$ is calculated.
