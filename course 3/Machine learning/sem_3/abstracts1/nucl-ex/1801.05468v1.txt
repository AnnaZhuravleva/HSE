In this work we present some results of the interaction of high energy muons with emulsion nuclei. The interaction results in emission of a number of fragments as a consequence of electromagnetic dissociation of the excited target nuclei. This excitation is attributed to absorption of photons by the target nuclei due to the intense electric field of the very fast incident muon particles. The interactions take place at impact parameters that allows ultra-peripheral collisions to take place, leading to giant resonances and hence multi-fragmentation of emulsion targets. Charge identification, range, energy spectra, angular distribution and topological cross-section of the produced fragments are measured and evaluated
