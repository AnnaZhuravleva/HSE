High-spin structure of $^{109}$In has been investigated with the $^{100}$Mo($^{14}$N, 5$n$)$^{109}$In reaction at a beam energy of 78 MeV using the in-beam $\gamma$ spectroscopic method. The level scheme of $^{109}$In has been modified considerably and extended by 46 new $\gamma$-rays to the highest excited state at 8.979 MeV and $J^{\pi}$=(45/2$^{+}$). The new level scheme consists of eight bands, six of which are identified as dipole bands. The configurations have been tentatively assigned with the help of the systematics of neighboring odd-$A$ indium isotopes and the experimental aligned angular momenta. The dipole bands are then compared with the titled axis cranking calculation in the framework of covariant density function theory (TAC-CDFT). The results of theoretical calculation based on the configurations, which involve one proton hole at the $g_{9/2}$ orbital and two or four unpaired neutrons at $g_{7/2}$, $d_{5/2}$ and $h_{11/2}$ orbitals, show that the shape of $^{109}$In undergoes an evolution on both $\beta$ and $\gamma$ deformations and possible chirality is suggested in $^{109}$In.
