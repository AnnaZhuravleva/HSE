Fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon, electric charge and strangeness number, are sensitive observables in heavy-ion collisions to search for the QCD phase transition and critical point. In this paper, we performed a systematical analysis on the various cumulants and cumulant ratios of event-by-event net-strangeness distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV from UrQMD model. We performed a systematical study on the contributions from various strange baryons and mesons to the net-strangeness fluctuations. The results demonstrate that the cumulants and cumulant ratios of net-strangeness distributions extracted from different strange particles show very different centrality and energy dependence behavior. By comparing with the net-kaon fluctuations, we found that the strange baryons play an important role in the fluctuations of net-strangeness. This study can provide useful baselines to study the QCD phase transition and search for the QCD critical point by using the fluctuations of net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions experiment. It can help us to understand non-critical physics contributions to the fluctuations of net-strangeness.
