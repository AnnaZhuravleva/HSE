Two-particle correlations on two-dimensional transverse momentum ($p_{t1},p_{t2}$) constructed from the particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions allow unique access to soft, semi-hard and hard-scattering processes in these systems. Only a few measurements of this type are reported in the literature and phenomenological models, which facilitate physical interpretation of the correlation structures, are non-existent. On-going effort at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) will provide a significant volume of these correlation measurements in the future. In this work two phenomenological models which describe 2D correlations on transverse momentum are developed and the results are compared to available data. One model is based on a collision event-by-event fluctuating blast wave. The other is based on an event-by-event fluctuating color-string plus jet fragmentation approach. Both models are shown to be capable of accurately describing the measured single-particle $p_t$ distributions for minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV as a function of collision centrality. Both models are then applied to estimates of preliminary, charged-particle correlation measurements on 2D transverse momentum. The capabilities of the two models for describing the overall structure of these correlations and the stability of the fitting results with respect to centrality dependence are evaluated. Overall, both of these new, phenomenological approaches are capable of qualitatively describing the expected correlation structures on transverse momentum and will provide useful tools for interpreting the centrality trends in the forthcoming correlation data from the RHIC. Predictions of an event-by-event hydrodynamical model EPOS and a purely fragmentation-based model HIJING are compared to each other and to the preliminary correlation data.
