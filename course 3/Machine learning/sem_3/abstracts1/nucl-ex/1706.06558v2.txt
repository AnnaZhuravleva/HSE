The probability density functions of net-proton multiplicity distributions are constructed from the Beam Energy Scan results of the STAR experiment using the Pearson curve method for two different transverse momentum windows. The $6^{th}$ and $8^{th}$ order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions are estimated from the constructed probability density functions. The beam energy dependence of $C_{6}/C_{2}$ and $C_{8}/C_{2}$ are found to be sensitive to the acceptance window. This method provides a unique opportunity to study the O(4) criticality near the chiral crossover transition and estimating the higher-order cumulants. In general, it is useful to determine the probability density function uniquely of a frequency data if the first four cumulants are known.
