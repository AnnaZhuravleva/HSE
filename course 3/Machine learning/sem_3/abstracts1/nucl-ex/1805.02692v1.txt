Highlights of news from Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in the period July 2016-2017 are presented. 2017 was the 70th birthday of Brookhaven National Laboratory which was built starting in 1947 on Camp Upton, a military base in 1917 for World War I and in September 1944 for World War II. Highlights in 70 years of research at BNL are presented, which include 6 Nobel Prizes as well as other important discoveries and inventions. RHIC is the world's only polarized proton collider and a review of the establishment of the Riken BNL Research Center with research focus on spiin physics at RHIC is presented. Discoveries at RHIC in Jet Quenching and the Quark Gluon Plasma are reviewed as well as new ideas on flow in small systems including a measurement of the vorticity of the QGP via polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons. An attempt at measuring the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ of the Quark Gluon Plasma from azimuthal broadening of high $p_T$ di-hadron pairs is presented.
