We report the first measurements of the $E$ beam-target helicity asymmetry for the $\vec{\gamma} \vec{n} \to K^{0}\Lambda$, and $K^{0}\Sigma^{0}$ channels in the energy range of 1.70$\leq W\leq$2.34 GeV. The CLAS system at Jefferson Lab used a circularly polarized photon beam and a target consisting of longitudinally polarized solid molecular hydrogen deuteride (HD) with low background contamination for the measurements. Comparisons with predictions from the KaonMAID, SAID, and Bonn-Gatchina models are presented. These results will help separate the isospin $I=0$ and $I=1$ photo-coupling transition amplitudes in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction.
