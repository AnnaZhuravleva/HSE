The GERDA experiment searches for the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{76}$Ge ($^{76}$Ge $\rightarrow$ $^{76}$Se + 2e$^-$) operating bare Ge diodes with an enriched $^{76}$Ge fraction in liquid argon. The exposure for BEGe-type detectors is increased threefold with respect to our previous data release. The BEGe detectors feature an excellent background suppression from the analysis of the time profile of the detector signals. In the analysis window a background level of $1.0_{-0.4}^{+0.6}\cdot10^{-3}$ cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) has been achieved; if normalized to the energy resolution this is the lowest ever achieved in any 0$\nu\beta\beta$ experiment. No signal is observed and a new 90 \% C.L. lower limit for the half-life of $8.0\cdot10^{25}$ yr is placed when combining with our previous data. The median expected sensitivity assuming no signal is $5.8\cdot10^{25}$ yr.
