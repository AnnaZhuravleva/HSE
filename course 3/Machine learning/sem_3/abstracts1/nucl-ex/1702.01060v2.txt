The production of jets in association with Z bosons, reconstructed via the mu+mu- and e+e- decay channels, is studied in pp and, for the first time, in PbPb collisions. Both data samples were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The PbPb collisions were analyzed in the 0-30% centrality range. The back-to-back azimuthal alignment was studied in both pp and PbPb collisions for Z bosons with transverse momentum p[tz] > 60 GeV/c and a recoiling jet with p[tj] > 30 GeV/c. The pt imbalance, x[jz] = p[tj] / p[tz], as well as the average number of jet partners per Z, R[jz], were studied in intervals of p[tz], in both pp and PbPb collisions. The R[jz] is found to be smaller in PbPb than in pp collisions, which suggests that in PbPb collisions a larger fraction of partons, associated with the Z bosons, lose energy and fall below the 30 GeV/c p[tj] threshold.
