We present a calculation of the elliptic flow of electrons from beauty-hadron decays in semi-central Pb--Pb collisions at centre-of-mass energy per colliding nucleon pair, represented as $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, of 2.76 TeV. The result is obtained by the subtraction of the charm quark contribution in the elliptic flow of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in semi-central Pb--Pb collisions at \snn = 2.76 TeV recently made publicly available by the ALICE collaboration.
