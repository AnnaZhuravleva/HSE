In the framework of a systematic study of proton induced nuclear reactions on lanthanides we have measured the excitation functions on natural cerium for the production of 142,139,138m,137Pr, 141,139,137m,137g,135Ce and 133La up to 65 MeV proton energy using the activation method with stacked-foil irradiation technique and high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The cross-sections of the investigated reactions were compared with the data retrieved from the TENDL-2014 and TENDL-2015 libraries, based on the latest version of the TALYS code system. No earlier experimental data were found in the literature. The measured cross-section data are important for further improvement of nuclear reaction models and for practical applications in nuclear medicine, other labeling and activation studies.
