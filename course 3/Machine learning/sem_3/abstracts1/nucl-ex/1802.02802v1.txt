In a recent work, the cross section measurement of the 64Zn(p,alpha)61Cu reaction was used to prove that the standard alpha-nucleus optical potentials used in astrophysical network calculation fail to reproduce the experimental data at energies relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. In the present paper the analysis of the obtained experimental data is continued by comparing the results with the predictions using different parameters. It is shown that the recently suggested modification of the standard optical potential leads to a better description of the data.
