The neutron $\beta$-decay asymmetry parameter $A_0$ defines the correlation between the spin of the neutron and the momentum of the emitted electron, which determines $\lambda = \frac{g_A}{g_V}$, the ratio of the axial-vector to vector weak coupling constants. The UCNA Experiment, located at the Ultracold Neutron facility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, is the first to measure such a correlation coefficient using ultracold neutrons (UCN). Following improvements to the systematic uncertainties and increased statistics, we report the new result $A_0 = -0.12054(44)_{\mathrm{stat}}(68)_{\mathrm{syst}}$ which yields $\lambda \equiv \frac{g_A}{g_V} = -1.2783(22)$. Combination with the previous UCNA result and accounting for correlated systematic uncertainties produces $A_0 = -0.12015(34)_{\mathrm{stat}}(63)_{\mathrm{syst}}$ and $\lambda \equiv \frac{g_A}{g_V} = -1.2772(20)$.
