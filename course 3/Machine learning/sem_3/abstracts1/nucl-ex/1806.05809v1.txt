In nuclear astrophysics, the experimental scenario is still unclear for BBN relevant energies from 30-300 keV. Here, we report our measurements of cross section and astrophysical S(E) factor for pd capture reaction using proton beam energies 66 keV, 116 keV and 166 keV. Realistic GEANT4 simulations were carried out in order to estimate the energy dependent efficiency of the detector. The measured cross section and astrophysical S(E) factor for three new incident proton energies are found to be in good agreement, within the errors, with the values reported in the literature.
