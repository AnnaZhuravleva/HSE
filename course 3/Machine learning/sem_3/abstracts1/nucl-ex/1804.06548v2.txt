A stack of thin Nb foils was irradiated with the 100 MeV proton beam at Los Alamos National Laboratory's Isotope Production Facility, to investigate the $^{93}$Nb(p,4n)$^{90}$Mo nuclear reaction as a monitor for intermediate energy proton experiments and to benchmark state-of-the-art reaction model codes. A set of 38 measured cross sections for $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x) and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x) reactions between 40-90 MeV, as well as 5 independent measurements of isomer branching ratios, are reported. These are useful in medical and basic science radionuclide productions at intermediate energies. The $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{56}$Co, $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{62}$Zn, and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{65}$Zn reactions were used to determine proton fluence, and all activities were quantified using HPGe spectrometry. Variance minimization techniques were employed to reduce systematic uncertainties in proton energy and fluence, improving the reliability of these measurements. The measured cross sections are shown to be in excellent agreement with literature values, and have been measured with improved precision compared with previous measurements. This work also reports the first measurement of the $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x)$^{82\text{m}}$Rb reaction, and of the independent cross sections for $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x)$^{52\text{g}}$Mn and $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x)$^{85\text{g}}$Y in the 40-90 MeV region. The effects of $^{\text{nat}}$Si(p,x)$^{22,24}$Na contamination, arising from silicone adhesive in the Kapton tape used to encapsulate the aluminum monitor foils, is also discussed as a cautionary note to future stacked-target cross section measurements. \emph{A priori} predictions of the reaction modeling codes CoH, EMPIRE, and TALYS are compared with experimentally measured values and used to explore the differences between codes for the $^{\text{nat}}$Nb(p,x) and $^{\text{nat}}$Cu(p,x) reactions.
