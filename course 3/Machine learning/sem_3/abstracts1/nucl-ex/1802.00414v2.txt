Studies of $J/$$\psi$ $v_2$ at RHIC and LHC energies have provided important elements towards the understanding on the production mechanisms and on the thermalization of charm quarks. Bottomonia has an advantage since it is a cleaner probe. A brief discussion has been provided for $\Upsilon(1S)$ $v_2$, which can become the new probe for QGP, including the necessity of studies for small systems.
