Measurements of open heavy flavour production in p--A collisions allow the investigation of Cold Nuclear Matter effects. In addition they are an important tool for a complementary investigation of the long-range correlations found in small systems in the light flavour sector. In this work, production measurements of D mesons, reconstructed via their hadronic decays, at mid-rapidity in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are reported. The ratio of the yields in central and peripheral collisions for D mesons is also presented. Production yields are also reported for the heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons at central rapidity at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV. The elliptic flow ($v_{\rm 2}$) of heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, obtained using correlations with charged particles, is found to be positive with a significance larger than $5 \sigma$.
