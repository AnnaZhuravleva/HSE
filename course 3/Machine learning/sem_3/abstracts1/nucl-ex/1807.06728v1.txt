Excited states in the $T_z=-1$ nucleus $^{70}$Kr have been populated using inelastic scattering of a radioactive $^{70}$Kr beam as well as one- and two-neutron removal reactions from $^{71,72}$Kr at intermediate beam energies. The level scheme of $^{70}$Kr was constructed from the observed $\gamma$-ray transitions and coincidences. Tentative spin and parity assignments were made based on comparison with the mirror nucleus $^{70}$Se. A second $2^+$ state and a candidate for the corresponding $4^+_2$ state suggest shape coexistence in $^{70}$Kr.
