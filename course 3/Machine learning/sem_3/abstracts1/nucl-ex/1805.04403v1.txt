The elliptic flow of inclusive and direct photons was measured at mid-rapidity in two centrality classes 0-20% and 20-40% in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =2.76 TeV by ALICE. Photons were detected with the highly segmented electromagnetic calorimeter PHOS and via conversions in the detector material with the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs reconstructed in the central tracking system. The results of the two methods were combined and the direct photon elliptic flow was extracted in the transverse momentum range $0.9 < p_{\rm T} < 6.2$ GeV/$c$. We test the hypothesis $v_{2}^{\gamma,\rm{dir}} \equiv 0$ for $0.9 < p_{\rm T} < 2.1$ GeV/$c$ and obtain a significance of $1.4\sigma$ for the 0-20% class and $1.0\sigma$ for the 20-40% class. A comparison to RHIC data shows a similar magnitude of the measured elliptic flow, while hydrodynamic and transport model calculations predict a smaller flow than observed.
