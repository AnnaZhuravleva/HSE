In both the Sun and the early universe, the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction plays a key role. The rate of this reaction is the least certain nuclear input needed to calculate both the primordial 7Li abundance in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the solar neutrino flux. Taking advantage of several recent highly precise experiments, we analyse modern 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be data using a robust and minimally model dependent approach capable of handling discrepant data sets dominated by systematic rather than statistical errors. We find S34(0)=0.580 pm 0.043(0.054) keV b at the 68.3(95.4)% confidence level.
