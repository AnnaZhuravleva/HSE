Heavy-flavour measurements give an important contribution to the understanding of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are effective probes for the QGP and understanding their interaction with the medium can give insights into its transport properties. The ALICE Collaboration investigates heavy-flavour production by measuring leptons from heavy-flavour decays and by reconstructing hadronic decays of D mesons and charmed baryons. In this proceeding, recent results from ALICE as well as the direction of future heavy-flavour measurements are discussed.
