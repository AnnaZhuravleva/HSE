The proton elastic form factor ratio can be measured either via Rosenbluth separation in an unpolarized beam and target experiment, or via the use of polarization degrees of freedom. However, data produced by these two approaches show a discrepancy, increasing with $Q^2$. The proposed explanation of this discrepancy---two-photon exchange---has been tested recently by three experiments. The results support the existence of a small two-photon exchange effect but cannot establish that theoretical treatment at the measured momentum transfers are valid. At larger momentum transfers, theory remains untested. This paper investigates the possibilities of measurements at DESY and Jefferson Lab to measure the effect at larger momentum transfers.
