Recent STAR measurements of the anisotropic flow coefficients, v$_{n}$, are presented for Au+Au collisions spanning the beam energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 - 200$~GeV. The measurements indicate dependences on harmonic number, $n$, transverse momentum ($p_T$), pseudorapidity ($\eta$), collision centrality ($\mathrm{cent}$) and beam energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) which could serve as important constraints to test different initial-state models and to aid precision extraction of the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity.
