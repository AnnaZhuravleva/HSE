Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) model calculations for of $\mathrm{^{96}_{44}Ru +\, ^{96}_{44}Ru}$ and $\mathrm{^{96}_{40}Zr +\, ^{96}_{40}Zr}$ collisions ($\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ GeV) are used in concert with a charge-sensitive correlator, to test its ability to detect and characterize the charge separation difference expected from the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in these isobaric collisions. The tests indicate a larger charge separation for $\mathrm{^{96}_{44}Ru +\, ^{96}_{44}Ru}$ than for $\mathrm{^{96}_{40}Zr +\, ^{96}_{40}Zr}$ collisions, and a discernible CME-driven difference of $\sim 10$\% in the presence of realistic non-CME backgrounds. They also indicate a strategy for evaluating the relative influence of the background correlations, present for each isobar. These results suggest that charge separation measurements for these isobaric species could serve to further constrain unambiguous identification and characterization of the CME in upcoming measurements at RHIC.
