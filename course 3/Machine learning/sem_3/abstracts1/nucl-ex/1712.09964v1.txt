Measurement of femtoscopic correlations in heavy-ion collisions can provide information about spatial and temporal parameters of the particle emission region at kinetic freeze-out. In this work we present the measurement of two-pion and two-kaon femtoscopic correlations in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The collision centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the three-dimensional radii, $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$ and $R_{long}$ is discussed.
