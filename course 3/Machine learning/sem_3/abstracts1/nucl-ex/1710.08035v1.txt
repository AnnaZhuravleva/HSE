Current status of experimental investigations of rare single beta decays (48Ca, 50V, 96Zr, 113Cd, 113mCd, 115In, 123Te, 180mTa, 222Rn) is reviewed. Nuclei which decay through single beta decay very often constitute backgrounds in studies of rare effects like double beta decay, solar neutrinos or dark matter. Summary of correction factors used in description of forbidden beta decays is also briefly given.
