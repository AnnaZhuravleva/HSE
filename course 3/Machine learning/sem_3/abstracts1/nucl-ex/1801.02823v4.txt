The masses of the exotic isotopes $^{210-214}$Ac and $^{210-214}$Ra have been measured with a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph. These isotopes were obtained in flight as fusion-evaporation products behind the gas-filled recoil ion separator GARIS-II at RIKEN. The new direct mass measurements serve as an independent and direct benchmark for existing $\alpha$-$\gamma$ spectroscopy data in this mass region. Further, new mass anchor points are set for U and Np nuclei close to the $N=126$ shell closure for a future benchmark of the $Z=92$ sub-shell for neutron-deficient heavy isotopes. Our mass results are in general in good agreement with the previously indirectly-determined mass values. Together with the measurement data, reasons for possible mass ambiguities from decay-data links between ground states are discussed.
