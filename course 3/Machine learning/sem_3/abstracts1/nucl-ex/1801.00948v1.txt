The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement. These goals are to be achieved by performing a two dimensional phase diagram $(T-\mu_B)$ scan by measurements of hadron production properties in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and system size. In this contribution, the results on two-particle correlations in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle will be presented for the first time for Be+Be interactions at beam momenta: 20, 30, 40, 75 and 150 GeV/c per nucleon. The NA61/SHINE results will be compared with the already presented results of proton-proton collisions at similar beam momenta as well as to the EPOS model results
