Inclusive jet spectra from pp and PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, are presented. Jets are reconstructed with three different distance parameters (R = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) for transverse momentum (pT) greater than 70 GeV and pseudorapidity abs(eta) < 2. Next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamic calculations with non-perturbative corrections are found to over-predict jet production cross sections in pp for small distance parameters. The jet nuclear modification factors for PbPb compared to pp collisions, show a steady decrease from peripheral to central events, along with a weak dependence on the jet pT. They are found to be independent of the distance parameter in the measured kinematic range.
