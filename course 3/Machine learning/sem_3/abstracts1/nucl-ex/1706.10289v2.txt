We present the results of our final analysis of the full data set of g_1^p(Q^2), the spin structure function of the proton, collected using CLAS at Jefferson Lab in 2000-2001. Polarized electrons with energies of 1.6, 2.5, 4.2 and 5.7 GeV were scattered from proton targets (15^NH_3 dynamically polarized along the beam direction) and detected with CLAS. From the measured double spin asymmetries, we extracted virtual photon asymmetries A_1^p and A_2^p and spin structure functions g_1^p and g_2^p over a wide kinematic range (0.05 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 5 GeV^2 and 1.08 GeV < W < 3 GeV), and calculated moments of g_1^p. We compare our final results with various theoretical models and expectations, as well as with parameterizations of the world data. Our data, with their precision and dense kinematic coverage, are able to constrain fits of polarized parton distributions, test pQCD predictions for quark polarizations at large x, offer a better understanding of quark-hadron duality, and provide more precise values of higher-twist matrix elements in the framework of the Operator Product Expansion.
