The compression-mode giant resonances, namely the isoscalar giant monopole and isoscalar giant dipole modes, are examples of collective nuclear motion. Their main interest stems from the fact that one hopes to extrapolate from their properties the incompressibility of uniform nuclear matter, which is a key parameter of the nuclear Equation of State (EoS). Our understanding of these issues has undergone two major jumps, one in the late 1970s when the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) was experimentally identified, and another around the turn of the millennium since when theory has been able to start giving reliable error bars to the incompressibility. However, mainly magic nuclei have been involved in the deduction of the incompressibility from the vibrations of finite nuclei. The present review deals with the developments beyond all this. Experimental techniques have been improved, and new open-shell, and deformed, nuclei have been investigated. The associated changes in our understanding of the problem of the nuclear incompressibility are discussed. New theoretical models, decay measurements, and the search for the evolution of compressional modes in exotic nuclei are also discussed.
