It is understood from the recent experimental studies that prompt/resonant breakup, and transfer followed by breakup in the weakly bound $^{6,7}$Li-induced reactions play a significant role in the complete-incomplete fusion (CF-ICF), suppression/enhancement in the fusion cross section around the Coulomb barrier. Investigation of ICF over CF was done by measuring cross sections of the populated residues in the $^{7}$Li-induced reaction on $^{\text{nat}}$Nb target within 3--6.5 MeV/nucleon energy region. Measured excitation functions of different channels were compared with different equilibrium (EQ) and preequilibrium (PEQ) models. The enhancement in cross sections in the proton ($\sim$ 20--30 MeV) and $\alpha$-emitting channels, which may be ascribed to ICF, was observed in the measured energy range when compared to the Hauser-Feshbach and exciton model calculations using EMPIRE, which satisfactorily reproduces the neutron channels, compared to the Weisskopf-Ewing model and Hybrid Monte Carlo calculations. The increment of the incomplete fusion fraction was observed with rising projectile energy.
