New precise unpolarised differential cross sections of deuteron-proton elastic scattering have been measured at 16 different deuteron beam momenta between $p_d = 3120.17\;\textrm{MeV}/c$ and $p_d =3204.16\;\textrm{MeV}/c$ at the COoler SYnchrotron COSY of the Forschungszentrum J\"ulich. The data, which were taken using the magnetic spectrometer ANKE, cover the equivalent range in proton kinetic energies from $T_p = 882.2\;\textrm{MeV}$ to $T_p = 918.3\;\textrm{MeV}$. The experimental results are analysed theoretically using the Glauber diffraction model with accurate nucleon-nucleon input. The theoretical cross section at $T_p = 900\;\textrm{MeV}$ agrees very well with the experimental one at low momentum transfers $|t| <0.2\;(\textrm{GeV}/c)^2$.
