Photoneutron cross sections were measured for $^{58}$Ni, $^{60}$Ni, $^{61}$Ni, and $^{64}$Ni at energies between the one-neutron and two-neutron thresholds using quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beams produced in laser Compton-scattering at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility. The new photoneutron data are used to extract the $\gamma$-ray strength function above the neutron threshold complementing the information obtained by the Oslo method below the threshold. We discuss radiative neutron capture cross sections and the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections for Ni isotopes including $^{63}$Ni, a branching point nucleus along the weak s-process path. The cross sections are calculated with the experimentally constrained $\gamma$-ray strength functions from the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov plus quasi-particle-random phase approximation based on the Gogny D1M interaction for both $E1$ and $M1$ components and supplemented with the $M1$ upbend.
