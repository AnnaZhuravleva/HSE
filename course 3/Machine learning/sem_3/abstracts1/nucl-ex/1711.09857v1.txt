The discrepancy between polarized and unpolarized measurements of the proton's electromagnetic form factors is striking, and suggests that two-photon exchange (TPE) may be playing a larger role in elastic electron-proton scattering than is estimated in standard radiative corrections formulae. While TPE is difficult to calculate in a model-independent way, it can be determined experimentally from asymmetries between electron-proton and positron-proton scattering. The possibility of a polarized positron beam at Jefferson Lab would open the door to measurements of TPE using polarization observables. In these proceedings, I examine the feasibility of measuring three such observables with positron scattering. Polarization-transfer, specifically the $\epsilon$-dependence for fixed $Q^2$, is an excellent test of TPE, and the ability to compare electrons and positrons would lead to a drastic reduction of systematics. However, such a measurement would be severely statistically limited. Normal single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) probe the imaginary part of the TPE amplitude and can be improved by simultaneous measurements with electron and positron beams. Beam-normal SSAs are too small to be measured with the proposed polarized positron beam, but target-normal SSAs could be feasibly measured with unpolarized positrons in the spectrometer halls. This technique should be included in the physics case for developing a positron source for Jefferson Lab.
