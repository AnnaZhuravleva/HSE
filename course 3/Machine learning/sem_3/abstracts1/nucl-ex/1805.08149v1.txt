We report the first detection of the second-forbidden, non-unique, $2^+\rightarrow 0^+$, ground-state transition in the $\beta$ decay of $^{20}$F. A low-energy, mass-separated $^{20}\rm{F}$ beam produced at the IGISOL facility in Jyv\"askyl\"a, Finland, was implanted in a thin carbon foil and the $\beta$ spectrum measured using a magnetic transporter and a plastic-scintillator detector. The branching ratio inferred from the observed $\beta$ yield is $[ 1.10\pm 0.21\textrm{(stat)}\pm 0.17\textrm{(sys)}^{+0.00}_{-0.11}\textrm{(theo)}] \times 10^{-5}$ corresponding to $\log ft = 10.47(11)$, making this the strongest known second-forbidden, non-unique transition. The experimental result is supported by shell-model calculations and has important astrophysical implications.
