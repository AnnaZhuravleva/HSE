[Background] Two-photon exchange contributions have become a necessary ingredient in theoretical calculations trying to precisely calculate hydrogen elastic scattering cross sections. This correction typically modifies the cross section at the few percent level. In contrast, dispersive effects can cause significantly larger changes from the Born approximation. [Purpose] The purpose of this experiment is to measure the carbon-12 elastic cross section around the first diffractive minimum, where the Born term contributions to the cross section are small to maximize the sensitivity to dispersive effects. [Methods] This experiment used the high resolution Jefferson Lab Hall A spectrometers to measure the cross sections near the first diffraction minimum of $^{12}$C at 362~MeV and 685~MeV. [Results] The results are in very good agreement with previous world data. The average deviation from a static charge distribution expected from linear and quadratic fits indicate a 38.8\% contribution of these effects to the cross section at 1~GeV. [Conclusions] The magnitude of the dispersive effects near the first diffraction minimum of $^{12}$C has been confirmed to be large with a strong energy dependence and could account for a large fraction of the magnitude for the observed quenching of the longitudinal nuclear response. These effects could also be important for nucleon radii extracted from parity violating asymmetries measured near a diffractive minimum.
