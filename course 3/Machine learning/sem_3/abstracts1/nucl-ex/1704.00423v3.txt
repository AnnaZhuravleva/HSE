We studied the acceptance dependence of proton cumulants (up to fourth order) and correlation functions in 0--5\% most central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV from UrQMD model. We found that high order proton cumulants show suppressions at large acceptance. By decomposing the proton cumulants into linear combination of multi-proton correlation functions, we observed the two-proton correlation functions always show negative values due to the effects of baryon number conservations. The three and four-proton correlation functions are close to zero and show negligible acceptance dependence. We further observed that the proton cumulants and correlation functions follow similar trends and show a scaling behavior when plotting the results versus mean number of protons. The comparisons between experimental data and the UrQMD calculations show that the non-monotonic energy dependence of proton correlation functions measured by STAR experiment cannot be described by the UrQMD model. The UrQMD calculations can provide us baselines for the experimental studies of the proton cumulants and correlation functions. Finally, we propose to measure the rapidity dependence of the reduced proton correlation functions to search for the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions.
