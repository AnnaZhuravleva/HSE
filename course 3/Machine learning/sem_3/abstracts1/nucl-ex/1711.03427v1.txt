The capture of K$^-$ mesons on nucleons bound in nuclei offer a chance to study the $\Sigma \pi$ pairs below the kinematic threshold of the $\bar{\mathrm{K}}$N systems. Various hyperon-pion charged combination are presently under investigation by AMADEUS. These data allow to test both isospin 0 and 1 amplitudes giving the possibility to detect the structure of resonant $\Lambda$(1405) state. Contrasted against similar electro-production data, it is possible to detect changes of $\Lambda$(1405) in nuclear media. Expected spectra and their uncertainties are calculated.
