Recent studies have shown that the per-nucleon number of Short-Range Correlated (SRC) pairs in nuclei and the strength of the EMC effect are linearly correlated, increasing from light nuclei up to iron and then saturating. This paper shows that the per-proton number of SRC pairs and the strength of the EMC effect are linearly correlated and increase from light to heavy asymmetric neutron-rich nuclei without saturation. These quantities, calculated per neutron, are also linearly related, but saturate (have constant value) remarkably early, starting with 12C. We propose that the observed phenomenological relationships indicate an isospin dependence of the EMC effect which is associated with the dominance of SRCs by neutron-proton pairs from 3He to heavy asymmetric neutron-rich nuclei.
