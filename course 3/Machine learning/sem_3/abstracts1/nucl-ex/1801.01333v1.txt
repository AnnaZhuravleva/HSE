The space and time configurations of the dissociation of $^8$He into $^6$He+$n$+$n$, on C and Pb targets, have been explored simultaneously for the first time. The final-state interactions in the $n$-$n$ and $^6$He-$n$ channels are successfully described within a model that considers independent emission of neutrons from a Gaussian volume with a given lifetime. The dissociation on C target exhibits a dominant sequential decay through the ground state of $^7$He, consistent with neutrons being emitted from a Gaussian volume of $r_{nn}^{\rm{rms}}\!=\,$7.3$\pm$0.6 fm with a $n$-$n$ delay in the sequential channel of 1400$\pm$400 fm/$c$, in very good agreement with the lifetime of $^7$He. The lower-statistics data on Pb target correspond mainly to direct breakup, and are well described using the $n$-$n$ volume measured, without any $n$-$n$ delay. The validity of the phenomenological model used is discussed.
