Modifications of the properties of jets in PbPb collisions, relative to those in pp collisions, are studied at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV via correlations of charged particles with the jet axis in relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta \eta$), relative azimuth ($\Delta \phi$), and relative angular distance from the jet axis $\Delta \mathrm{r} = \sqrt{{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}}$. This analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 404 $\mu$b$^{-1}$ and 27.4 pb$^{-1}$ for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively. Charged particle number densities, jet fragmentation functions, and jet shapes are presented as a function of PbPb collision centrality and charged-particle track transverse momentum, providing a differential description of jet modifications due to interactions with the quark-gluon plasma.
