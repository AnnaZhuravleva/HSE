Pendell\"{o}sung interference fringes of a single silicon crystal were observed by using pulsed cold neutrons. The nuclear scattering length of silicon was obtained as (4.159\pm0.003(stat.)\pm0.028(syst.)) fm using the observed Pendell\"{o}sung fringes. This indicates the applicability of pulsed neutron beam to observe the Pendell\"{o}sung fringes by using the time-of-flight analysis.
