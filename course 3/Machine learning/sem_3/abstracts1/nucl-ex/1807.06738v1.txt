We present recent results from Al(beam)+Au(target) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.9$ GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5$\kern 0.16667em GeV from the STAR fixed-target (FXT) program. We report transverse mass spectra of protons, $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda$, rapidity density distributions of $\pi^\pm$, $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda$, directed flow of protons, $\pi^\pm$, $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda$, and elliptic flow of protons and $\pi^{\pm}$. These are the first measurements of pion directed and elliptic flow in this energy range at RHIC. Pion and proton elliptic flow show mass ordering. Measurements are compared with the published results from AGS and RHIC. These results demonstrate that STAR has good performance in the FXT configuration. The implications of these results for future STAR FXT runs are discussed.
