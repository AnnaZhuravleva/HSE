The LIGO-Virgo collaboration ground-breaking detection of the binary neutron-star merger event, GW170817, has intensified efforts towards the understanding of the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter. In this letter, we compare directly the density-pressure constraint on the EoS obtained from a recent analysis of the neutron-star merger event to density-pressure constraints obtained from nuclear physics experiments. To relate constraints from nuclear physics to the radii and the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars, we use a large collection of Skyrme density functionals that describe properties of nuclei to calculate properties of 1.4 solar maass neutron stars. We find that restricting this set of Skyrme equations of state to density functionals that describe nuclear masses, isobaric analog states, and low energy nuclear reactions does not sufficiently restrict the predicted neutron-star radii and the tidal deformabilities. Including pressure constraints on the EoS around twice saturation density, obtained from high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions, does constrain predicted radii and tidal deformabilities to be consistent with the results obtained from the analysis of GW170817. We discuss how new measurements of nucleus-nucleus collisions can improve these constraints on the EoS to be more restrictive than the current constraints from the GW170817 merger event.
