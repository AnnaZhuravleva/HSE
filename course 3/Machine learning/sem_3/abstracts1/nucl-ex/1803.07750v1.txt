Additional experimental cross sections were deduced for the long half-life activation products (172Hf and 173Lu) from the alpha particle induced reactions on ytterbium up to 38 MeV from late, long measurements and for 175Yb, 167Tm from a re-evaluation of earlier measured spectra. The cross-sections are compared with the earlier experimental datasets and with the data based on the TALYS theoretical nuclear reaction model (available in the TENDL-2014 and 2015 libraries) and the ALICE-IPPE code.
