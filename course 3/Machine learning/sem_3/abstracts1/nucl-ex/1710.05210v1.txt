Anisotropic flow is sensitive to the shear $(\eta/s)$ and bulk ($\zeta/s$) viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions, as well as the initial state of such collisions and hadronization mechanisms. In these proceedings, elliptic ($v_2$) and higher harmonic ($v_3, v_4$) flow coefficients of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p$(\overline{\rm{p}})$ and the $\phi$-meson, are presented for Pb-Pb collisions at the highest-ever center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Comparisons to hydrodynamic calculations (IP-Glasma, MUSIC, UrQMD) are shown to constrain the initial conditions and viscosity of the medium.
