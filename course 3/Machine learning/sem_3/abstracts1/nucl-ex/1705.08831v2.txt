A future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) will be able to provide collisions of polarized electrons with protons and heavy ions over a wide range of center-of-mass energies (20 $\mathrm{GeV}$ to 140 $\mathrm{GeV}$) at an instanteous luminosity of $10^{33} - 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. One of its promising physics programs is the study of the partonic structure of quasi-real photons. Measuring di-jets in quasi-real photoproduction events, one can effectively access the underlying parton dynamics of the photons. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of tagging resolved photon processes and measuring the di-jet cross section as a function of jet transverse momentum in the range of $0.01<x_{\gamma}^{rec}<1$ at an EIC. It will be shown that both unpolarized and polarized parton distributions in the photon can be extracted, and that the flavor of the parton can be tagged at an EIC.
