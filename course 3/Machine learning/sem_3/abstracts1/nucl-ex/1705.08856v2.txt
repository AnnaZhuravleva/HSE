Medium effects on the production of high-$p_{\rm T}$ particles in nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions are generally quantified by the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$), defined to be unity in absence of nuclear effects. Modeling particle production including a nucleon-nucleon impact parameter dependence, we demonstrate that $R_{\rm AA}$ at midrapidity in peripheral AA collisions can be significantly affected by event selection and geometry biases. Even without jet quenching and shadowing, these biases cause an apparent suppression for $R_{\rm AA}$ in peripheral collisions, and are relevant for all types of hard probes and all collision energies. Our studies indicate that calculations of jet quenching in peripheral AA collisions should account for the biases, or else they will overestimate the relevance of parton energy loss. Similarly, expectations of parton energy loss in light-heavy collision systems based on comparison with apparent suppression seen in peripheral $R_{\rm AA}$ should be revised. Our interpretation of the peripheral $R_{\rm AA}$ data would unify observations for lighter collision systems or lower energies where significant values of elliptic flow are observed despite the absence of strong jet quenching.
