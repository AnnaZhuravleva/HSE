For half a century, the Roper resonance has defied understanding. Discovered in 1963, it appears to be an exact copy of the proton except that its mass is 50% greater. The mass is the first problem: it is difficult to explain with any theoretical tool that can validly be used to study quantum chromodynamics [QCD]. In the last decade, a new challenge has appeared, viz. precise information on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors, reaching $Q^2\approx 4.5\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which hard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form factor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a problem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper resonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a description of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed understanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the transition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly complete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year international effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has presented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's first radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a meson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially alters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the proton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which enabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is unambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and opportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models and QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature of the Roper resonance.
