The increase of hard probe production as a function of the charged particle multiplicity in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions is considered to be an interesting observable for the study of multiple parton interactions. In the present work, the correlation between J/$\psi$ production and charged particle multiplicity has been reviewed in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 13 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at mid- and forward rapidities. The J/$\psi$ measurement in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using events triggered by the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeter at midrapidity is discussed in this report, too. An increment of the relative J/$\psi$ yields has been observed as a function of the multiplicity. The results have also been compared to theoretical model predictions.
