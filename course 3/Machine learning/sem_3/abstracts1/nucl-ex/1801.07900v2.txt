Differential cross sections and photon-beam asymmetries for the gamma p -> pi- Delta++(1232) reaction have been measured for 0.7<cos(theta)<1 and Egamma=1.5-2.95 GeV at SPring-8/LEPS. The first-ever high statistics cross section data are obtained in this kinematical region, and the asymmetry data for 1.5<Egamma(GeV)<2.8 are obtained for the first time. This reaction has a unique feature for studying the production mechanisms of a pure $u\bar{u}$ quark pair in the final state from the proton. Although there is no distinct peak structure in the cross sections, a non-negligible excess over the theoretical predictions is observed at Egamma=1.5-1.8 GeV. The asymmetries are found to be negative in most of the present kinematical regions, suggesting the dominance of pi-exchange in the t-channel. The negative asymmetries at forward meson production angles are different from the asymmetries previously measured for the photoproduction reactions which produce a $d\bar{d}$ or an $s\bar{s}$ quark pair in the final state. Advanced theoretical models introducing nucleon resonances and additional unnatural parity exchanges are needed to reproduce the present data.
