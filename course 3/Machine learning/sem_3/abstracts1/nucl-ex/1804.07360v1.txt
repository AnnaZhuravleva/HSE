We report on the in-beam gamma spectroscopy of $^{102}$Sn and $^{100}$Cd produced via two-neutron removal from carbon and CH$_2$ targets at about 150 MeV/nucleon beam energy. New transitions assigned to the decay of a second 2$^+$ excited state at 2470(60) keV in $^{102}$Sn were observed. Two-neutron removal cross sections from $^{104}$Sn and $^{102}$Cd have been extracted. The enhanced cross section to the 2$^+_2$ in $^{102}$Sn populated via the $(p,p2n)$ reaction is traced back to an increase of shell-model structure overlaps, consistent with the hypothesis that the proton-induced two-deeply-bound-nucleon removal mechanism is of direct nature.
