A high-precision half-life measurement for the superallowed Fermi $\beta^+$ emitter $^{22}$Mg was performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility using a 4$\pi$ proportional gas counter. The result of $T_{1/2} = 3.87400 \pm 0.00079$ s is a factor of 3 more precise than the previously adopted world average and resolves a discrepancy between the two previously published $^{22}$Mg half-life measurements.
