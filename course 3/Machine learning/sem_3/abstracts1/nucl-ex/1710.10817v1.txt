The rearrangements of protons and neutrons amongst the valence single-particle orbitals during double {\beta} decay of 100Mo have been determined by measuring cross sections in (d,p), (p,d), (3He,{\alpha}) and (3He,d) reactions on 98,100Mo and 100,102Ru targets. The deduced nucleon occupancies reveal significant discrepancies when compared with theoretical calculations; the same calculations have previously been used to determine the nuclear matrix element associated with the decay probability of double {\beta} decay of the 100Mo system.
