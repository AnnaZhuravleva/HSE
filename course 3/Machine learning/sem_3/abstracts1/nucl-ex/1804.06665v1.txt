The proton elastic form factor ratio is accessible in unpolarized Rosenbluth-type experiments as well as experiments which make use of polarization degrees of freedom. The extracted values show a distinct discrepancy, growing with $Q^2$. Three recent experiments tested the proposed explanation, two-photon exchange, by measuring the positron-proton to electron-proton cross section ratio. In the results, a small two-photon exchange effect is visible, significantly different from theoretical calculation. Theory at larger momentum transfer remains untested. This paper discusses the possibilities for future measurements at larger momentum transfer.
