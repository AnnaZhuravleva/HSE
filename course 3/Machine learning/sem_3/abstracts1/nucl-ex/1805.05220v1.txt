ATLAS measurements of the production of muons from heavy-flavor decays in $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions and $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV $pp$ collisions at the LHC are presented. Integrated luminosities of 0.14 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ and 570 $\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ are used for the Pb+Pb and $pp$ measurements, respectively, which are performed over the muon transverse momentum range $4 < p_{\mathrm{T}} < 14$ GeV and for five Pb+Pb centrality intervals. Backgrounds arising from in-flight pion and kaon decays, hadronic showers, and mis-reconstructed muons are statistically removed using a template-fitting procedure. The heavy-flavor muon differential cross-sections and per-event yields are measured in $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions, respectively. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ obtained from these is observed to be independent of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, within uncertainties, and to be less than unity, which indicates suppressed production of heavy-flavor muons in Pb+Pb collisions. For the 10% most central Pb+Pb events, the measured $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ is approximately 0.35. The azimuthal modulation of the heavy-flavor muon yields is also measured and the associated Fourier coefficients $v_n$ for $n =$ 2, 3 and 4 are given as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and centrality. They vary slowly with $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and show a systematic variation with centrality which is characteristic of other anisotropy measurements, such as that observed for inclusive hadrons. The measured $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ and $v_n$ values are also compared with theoretical calculations.
