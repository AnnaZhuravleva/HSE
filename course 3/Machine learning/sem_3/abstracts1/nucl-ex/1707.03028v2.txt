We report the measurement of the beam-vector and tensor asymmetries $A^V_{ed}$ and $A^T_d$ in quasielastic $(\vec{e}, e^{\prime}p)$ electrodisintegration of the deuteron at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator Center up to missing momentum of 500~MeV/c. Data were collected simultaneously over a momentum transfer range $0.1< Q^2<0.5$~(GeV/c)$^2$ with the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid using an internal deuterium gas target, polarized sequentially in both vector and tensor states. The data are compared with calculations. The beam-vector asymmetry $A^V_{ed}$ is found to be directly sensitive to the $D$-wave component of the deuteron and have a zero-crossing at a missing momentum of about 320~MeV/c, as predicted. The tensor asymmetry $A^T_d$ at large missing momentum is found to be dominated by the influence of the tensor force in the neutron-proton final-state interaction. The new data provide a strong constraint on theoretical models.
