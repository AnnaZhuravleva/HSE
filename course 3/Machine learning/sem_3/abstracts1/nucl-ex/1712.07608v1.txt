We report on the first observation of $\gamma$ rays emitted from an $sd$-shell hypernucleus, $\rm ^{19}_{\Lambda}F$. The energy spacing between the ground state doublet, $1/2^{+}$ and $3/2^{+}$ states, of $\rm ^{19}_{\Lambda}F$ is determined to be $\rm 315.5 \pm 0.4 (stat) ^{+0.6}_{-0.5} (syst)~keV$ by measuring the $\gamma$-ray energy from the $M1(3/2^{+} \rightarrow 1/2^{+})$ transition. In addition, three $\gamma$-ray peaks were observed and assigned as $E2(5/2^{+} \rightarrow 1/2^{+})$, $E1(1/2^{-} \rightarrow 1/2^{+})$, and $E1(1/2^{-} \rightarrow 3/2^{+})$ transitions. The excitation energies of the $5/2^{+}$ and $1/2^{-}$ states are determined to be $\rm 895.2 \pm 0.3 (stat) \pm 0.5 (syst)~keV$ and $\rm 1265.6 \pm 1.2 (stat) ^{+0.7}_{-0.5} (syst)~keV$, respectively. It is found that the ground state doublet spacing is well described by theoretical models based on existing $s$- and $p$-shell hypernuclear data.
