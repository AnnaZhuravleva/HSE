Excitation functions were measured for the production of the 101,100Pd, 102m, 102g,101m,101g,100,99m,99gRh and 97Ru radionuclides by bombardment of 103Rh targets with proton beams up to 70 MeV, some of them for the first time. The new results are compared with the earlier experimental data and with the theoretical nuclear model code calculations from ALICE-IPPE, EMPIRE and TALYS 1.6. Thick target yields were deduced and possible application of the new data for production of medically relevant 101m,101gRh and 97Ru are discussed.
