Excitation functions were measured for the natSr(d,x)88,87m,87g,86g,85gY, 87m,85g,83g,82Sr, 86g,84g,83,82m, 81gRb reactions by the stacked foil activation technique and high-resolution gamma-spectrometry up to 50 MeV. We present the first experimental activation cross section data for all investigated reactions. Our experimental data are compared with the TALYS code results as available in the TENDL-2015 on-line library. Use of deuteron induced reactions on Sr for production of medical isotopes is discussed.
