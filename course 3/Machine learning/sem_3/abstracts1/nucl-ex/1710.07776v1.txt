The GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment located at the INFN Gran Sasso Laboratory (Italy), is looking for the neutrinoless double beta decay of Ge76, by using high-purity germanium detectors made from isotopically enriched material. The combination of the novel experimental design, the careful material selection for radio-purity and the active/passive shielding techniques result in a very low residual background at the Q-value of the decay, about 1e-3 counts/(keV kg yr). This makes GERDA the first experiment in the field to be background-free for the complete design exposure of 100 kg yr. A search for neutrinoless double beta decay was performed with a total exposure of 47.7 kg yr: 23.2 kg yr come from the second phase (Phase II) of the experiment, in which the background is reduced by about a factor of ten with respect to the previous phase. The analysis presented in this paper includes 12.4 kg yr of new Phase II data. No evidence for a possible signal is found: the lower limit for the half-life of Ge76 is 8.0e25 yr at 90% CL. The experimental median sensitivity is 5.8e25 yr. The experiment is currently taking data. As it is running in a background-free regime, its sensitivity grows linearly with exposure and it is expected to surpass 1e26 yr within 2018.
