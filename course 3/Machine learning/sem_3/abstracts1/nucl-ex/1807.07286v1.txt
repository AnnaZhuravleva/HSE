We present recent result on strange and non-strange D-meson production measured with ALICE in Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC. In addition, the measurements of the $\Lambda_{{\rm c}}^+$-baryon production and of the $\Lambda_{{\rm c}}^+/{\rm D^0}$ ratio in pp, p--Pb, and, for the first time ever, Pb--Pb collisions are reported.
