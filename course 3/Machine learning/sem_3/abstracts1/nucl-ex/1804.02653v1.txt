Lifetime measurements of b -decaying highly charged ions have been performed in the storage ring CSRe by applying the isochronous Schottky mass spectrometry. The fully ionized 49Cr and 53Fe ions were produced in projectile fragmentation of 58Ni primary beam and were stored in the CSRe tuned into the isochronous ion-optical mode. The new resonant Schottky detector was applied to monitor the intensities of stored uncooled 49Cr24+ and 53Fe26+ ions. The extracted half-lives T1/2(49Cr24+) = 44.0(27) min and T1/2(53Fe26+) = 8.47(19) min are in excellent agreement with the literature half-life values corrected for the disabled electron capture branchings. This is an important proof-of-principle step towards realizing the simultaneous mass and lifetime measurements on exotic nuclei at the future storage ring facilities.
