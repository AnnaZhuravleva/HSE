Potassium-40 (${}^{40}$K) is a background in many rare-event searches and may well play a role in interpreting results from the DAMA dark-matter search. The electron-capture decay of ${}^{40}$K to the ground state of ${}^{40}$Ar has never been measured and contributes an unknown amount of background. The KDK (potassium decay) collaboration will measure this branching ratio using a ${}^{40}$K source, an X-ray detector, and the Modular Total Absorption Spectrometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
