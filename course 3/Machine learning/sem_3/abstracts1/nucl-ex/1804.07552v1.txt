In nuclear thermodynamics, the determination of the excitation energy of hot nuclei is a fundamental experimental problem. Instrumental physicists have been trying to solve this problem for several years by building the most exhaustive 4Pi detector arrays and perfecting their calorimetry techniques. In a recent paper, a proposal for a new calorimetry, called "3D calorimetry", was made. It tries to optimize the separation between the particles and fragments emitted by the Quasi-Projectile and the other possible contributions. This can be achieved by determining the experimental probability for a given nucleus of a nuclear reaction to be emitted by the Quasi-Projectile. It has been developed for the INDRA data. In the present work, we wanted to dissect and validate this new method of characterization of a hot Quasi-Projectile. So we tried to understand and control it completely to determine these limits. Using the HIPSE event generator and a software simulating the functioning of INDRA, we were able to achieve this goal and provide a quantitative estimation of the quality of the QP characterization.
