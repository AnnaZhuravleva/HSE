Fission fragment angular distributions can provide insights into the quantum mechanical state of the transition nucleus at the saddle point and are therefore an important constraint on fission theory. Available anisotropy data is sparse, especially at neutron energies above 5 MeV. For the first time, a three-dimensional tracking detector is employed to study fragment emission angles and provide a direct measurement of angular anisotropy. The Neutron Induced Fission Fragment Tracking Experiment (NIFFTE) collaboration has deployed the fission time projection chamber (fissionTPC) to measure nuclear data with unprecedented precision. The fission fragment anisotropy of $^{235}$U has been measured over a wide range of incident neutron energies from 180 keV to 200 MeV. Sources of systematic uncertainty are evaluated and the results compared with existing measurements.
