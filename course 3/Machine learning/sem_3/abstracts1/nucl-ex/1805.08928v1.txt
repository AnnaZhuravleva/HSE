Coherent double neutral-pion photoproduction on the deuteron, $\gamma d\to \pi^0\pi^0d$, has been experimentally studied at incident photon energies from 0.75 to 1.15 GeV. The total cross section as a function of the $\gamma{d}$ center-of-mass energy shows resonance-like behavior peaked at around 2.47 and 2.63 GeV. The measured angular distribution of deuteron emission is rather flat, which cannot be reproduced by kinematics for quasi-free $\pi^0\pi^0$ production with deuteron coalescence. In $\pi^0d $ invariant-mass distributions, a clear peak is observed at $2.15{\pm}0.01$ GeV$/c^2$ with a width of $0.11{\pm}0.01$ GeV$/c^2$. The spin-parity of this state is restricted to $1^+$, $2^+$ or $3^-$ from the angular distributions for the two $\pi^0$s. The present work shows strong evidence for the existence of an isovector dibaryon resonance with a mass of 2.15 GeV$/c^2$. The $2^+$ assignment is consistent with the theoretically predicted ${\cal{D}}_{12}$ state, and also with energy dependence of the $\pi{d}$ partial-wave amplitude $^3\!P_2$ for the $\pi^{\pm}d\to\pi^{\pm}d$ and $\pi^+d\to{pp}$ reactions.
