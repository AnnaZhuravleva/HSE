The excited states of the proton emitter $^{151}$Lu were reinvestigated in a recoil-decay tagging experiment at the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a (JYFL). The level scheme built on the ground state of $^{151}$Lu was updated with five new $\gamma$-ray transitions. Large-scale shell model calculations were carried out to interpret the experimental level scheme. It is found that the excitation energies of states above the $27/2^-$ and $23/2^+$ isomeric levels can be sensitive to excitations from $g_{7/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$ to single-particle orbitals above $N=Z=64$.
