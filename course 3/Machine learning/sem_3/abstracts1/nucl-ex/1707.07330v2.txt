A detailed study of energy dependence of positive kaon to pion, negative kaon to pion and total kaon to pion multiplicity ratio have been carried out in pp collisions at 6.3, 17.3, 62.4, 200 and 900 GeV and also at root s =2.76 TeV and 7 TeV in the framework of UrQMD and DPMJET III model. Energy dependence of positive kaon to pion and negative kaon to pion show different behavior in case of UrQMD and DPMJET III model. The presence of the horn like structure in the variation of positive kaon to pion and negative kaon to pion ratio with energy for the experimental data is supported by the DPMJET III model. Experimentally it has been observed that as energy increases, the total kaon to pion multiplicity ratio increases systematically for pp collisions at lower energies and becomes independent of energy in LHC energy regime. Our analysis on total kaon to pion multiplicity ratio with UrQMD data is well supported by the experimental results obtained by different collaborations in different times. In case of DPMJET III data, the saturation of kaon to pion ratio at LHC region has not been observed.
