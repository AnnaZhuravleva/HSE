Quarkonia suppression in nucleus-nucleus collisions is a powerful tool to probe the density and temperature of the medium created in heavy ion collisions. Forward rapidity measurements in $p(d)$+Au collisions are essential to understand how quarkonia states are affected by initial state effects, formation time, and local particle multiplicity. Earlier measurements in Au+Au collisions showed a stronger suppression of forward $J/\psi$ compared to mid-rapidity results, indicating the possibility of a smaller contribution of regenerated quarkonia states at forward rapidity. These proceedings report on the latest quarkonia studies performed by the PHENIX collaboration in the rapidity range $1.2<|y|<2.2$.
