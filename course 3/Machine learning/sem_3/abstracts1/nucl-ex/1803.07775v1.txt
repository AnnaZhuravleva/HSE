Activation cross sections of the natLa(p,x)139,137m,137g,135,134,133mCe, natLa(p,x)135,134,133La and 133m,133g,131Ba nuclear reactions have been measured experimentally, for the first time (except 139Ce). Cross-sections in the 34-64 MeV energy range were obtained through an activation method combining the stacked foil irradiation technique and gamma-ray spectrometry. The experimental cross sections were compared with the theoretical prediction in the TENDL-2014 and TENDL-2015, TALYS based libraries. Applications in the field of medical radionuclides production is discussed.
