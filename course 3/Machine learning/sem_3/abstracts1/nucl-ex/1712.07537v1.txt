The two reactions $\gamma p\to K^+\Lambda$ and $\pi^-p\to K^0\Lambda$ are analyzed to determine the leading photoproduction multipoles and the pion-induced partial wave amplitudes in slices of the invariant mass. The multipoles and the partial-wave amplitudes are simultaneously fitted in a multichannel Laurent+Pietarinen model (L+P model), which determines the poles in the complex energy plane on the second Riemann sheet close to the physical axes. The results from the L+P fit are compared with the results of an energy-dependent fit based on the Bonn-Gatchina (BnGa) approach. The study confirms the existence of several poles due to nucleon resonances in the region at about 1.9\,GeV with quantum numbers $J^P = 1/2^+$, $3/2^+, 1/2^-, 3/2^-, 5/2^-$.
