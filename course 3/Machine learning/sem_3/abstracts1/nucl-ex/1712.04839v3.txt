A new type nuclear reaction on 159Tb with neutrons and protons in the incident channels and a bound dineutron (2n) in the output channel is considered based on available experimental observations. The dineutron is assumed to be separated from the volume but not from the potential well of the residual nucleus. Such configuration represents a nuclear system with a satellite dineutron located at few fm distances from the surface of the residual nucleus. Due to dineutron disintegration the decay products may react with the residual nuclei, leading to their transformations much faster than expected.
