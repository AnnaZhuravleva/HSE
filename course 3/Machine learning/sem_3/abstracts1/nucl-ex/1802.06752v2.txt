A study of multifractality and multifractal specific heat has been carried out for the produced shower particles in nuclear emulsion detector for 16O-AgBr, 28Si-AgBr and 32S-AgBr interactions at 4.5AGeV/c in the framework of Renyi entropy. Experimental results have been compared with the prediction of Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. Our analysis reveals the presence of multifractality in the multiparticle production process in high energy nucleus-nucleus interactions. Degree of multifractality is found to be higher for the experimental data and it increases with the increase of projectile mass. The investigation of quark-hadron phase transition in the multiparticle production in 16O-AgBr, 28Si-AgBr and 32S-AgBr interactions at 4.5 AGeV/c in the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory from the concept of multifractality has also been presented. Evidence of constant multifractal specific heat has been obtained for both experimental and UrQMD simulated data.
