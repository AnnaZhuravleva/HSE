Precise measurements of the proton form factor ratio mu*GE/GM from Rosenbluth separation measurements can be combined with Polarization based extractions to provide significant constraints on two-photon exchange contributions to the elastic e-p cross section. We present an overview of JLab experiment E05-017, the high-precision Super-Rosenbluth measurements of the proton form factor taken in Hall C of Jefferson Lab. We then examine what precision could be obtained for Super-Rosenbluth measurements using a low-intensity positron beam at Jefferson Lab.
