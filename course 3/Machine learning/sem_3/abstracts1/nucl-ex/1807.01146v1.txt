Nuclear beta decays between (J^pi,T) = (0^+,1) analog states yield the best value for the Vud element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Current world data establish the corrected Ft values of 14 separate superallowed transitions to a precision of order 0.1% or better. The validity of the small theoretical correction terms is confirmed by excellent consistency among the 14 Ft values and by recent measurements that compare pairs of mirror superallowed transitions. With consistency established, the results now yield |Vud| = 0.97420(21). This value is consistent with the considerably less precise results obtained from beta decays of the neutron, the pion and T=1/2 mirror nuclei, which are hampered by experimental challenges.
