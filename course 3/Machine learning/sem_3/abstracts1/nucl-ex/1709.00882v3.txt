A study of multiplicity distribution of singly charged, doubly charged, multi charged projectile fragments and shower particles have been carried out for the peripheral collisions in 16O-emulsion,22Ne-emulsion and 28Si-emulsion interactions at an incident momentum of (4.1-4.5) AGeV/c. Events having no target fragments have been designated as peripheral collision events. Percentage of peripheral events has been found to increase with the increase of projectile mass. Dispersion of the multiplicity distribution and its dependence on projectile mass for projectile fragments and shower particles has also been investigated. Dependence of average multiplicity of projectile fragments and shower particles on the mass of the projectile beam has been studied. Study of different fragmentation mode during the emission of multi charged projectile fragments has also been carried out.
