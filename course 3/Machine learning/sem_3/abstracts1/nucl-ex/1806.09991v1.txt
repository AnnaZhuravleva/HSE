A novel technique for extracting the $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) and nuclear level density (NLD) from inverse kinematics experiments is presented, which allows for measurements of these properties, across a vast range of previously inaccessible nuclei. Proton-$\gamma$ coincidence events from the $\mathrm{d}(^{86}\mathrm{Kr}, \mathrm{p}\gamma)^{87}\mathrm{Kr}$ reaction were measured at iThemba LABS, and the $\gamma$SF and NLD in $^{87}$Kr obtained with the Oslo Method. The $\gamma$SF and NLD are important input parameters to Hauser-Feshbach calculations to constrain $(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ cross sections of nuclei for which these cannot be measured directly. The extracted $\gamma$SF and NLD are used to constrain the $^{86}\mathrm{Kr}(\mathrm{n},\mathrm{\gamma})^{87}\mathrm{Kr}$ cross section which is an important reaction for the $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ production in the $s$-process. The nature of the low-energy region of the $\gamma$SF is explored through comparison to shell model calculations.
