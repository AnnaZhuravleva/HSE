Glauber models based on nucleon--nucleon interactions are commonly used to characterize the initial state in high-energy nuclear collisions, and the dependence of its properties on impact parameter or number of participating nucleons. In this paper, an extension to the Glauber model is presented, which accounts for an arbitrary number of effective sub-nucleon degrees of freedom, or active constituents, in the nucleons. Properties of the initial state, such as the number of constituent participants and collisions, as well as eccentricity and triangularity, are calculated and systematically compared for different assumptions of how to distribute the sub-nuclear degrees of freedom and for various collision systems. It is demonstrated that at high collision energy the number of produced particles scales with an average number of sub-nucleon degrees of freedom of between $3$ and $5$. The source codes for the constituent Monte Carlo Glauber extension, as well as for the calculation of the overlap area and participant density in a standard Glauber model, are made publicly available.
