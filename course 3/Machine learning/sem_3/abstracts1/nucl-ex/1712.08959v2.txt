The nuclear modification factors of J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) mesons are measured in PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.02 TeV. The analysis is based on PbPb and pp data samples collected by CMS at the LHC in 2015, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 464 $\mu$b$^{-1}$ and 28 pb$^{-1}$, respectively. The measurements are performed in the dimuon rapidity range of $|y| <$ 2.4 as a function of centrality, rapidity, and transverse momentum (p$_\mathrm{T}$) from p$_\mathrm{T}=$ 3 GeV/$c$ in the most forward region and up to 50 GeV/$c$. Both prompt and nonprompt (coming from b hadron decays) mesons are observed to be increasingly suppressed with centrality, with a magnitude similar to the one observed at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 2.76 TeV for the two J/$\psi$ meson components. No dependence on rapidity is observed for either prompt or nonprompt J/$\psi$ mesons. An indication of a lower prompt J/$\psi$ meson suppression at p$_\mathrm{T} >$ 25 GeV/$c$ is seen with respect to that observed at intermediate p$_\mathrm{T}$. The prompt $\psi$(2S) meson yield is found to be more suppressed than that of the prompt J/$\psi$ mesons in the entire p$_\mathrm{T}$ range.
