In this talk I address two high impact physics programs that require the use of polarized and unpolarized positron beams in addition to using electron beams of the same energy. First, I address what will be gained from using positron beams in addition to electron beams in the extraction of the Compton Form Factors (CFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) on a proton target. As a second high impact science program I discuss an experimental scenario using unpolarized positrons to measure elastic scattering on protons in an effort to determine definitively the 2-photon exchange contributions in order to resolve a longstanding discrepancy in the determination of the proton's electric and magnetic form factors.
