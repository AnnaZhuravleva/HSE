Experimental cross sections are presented for the 159Tb(p,xn)153,155,157,159Dy, 152,153,155,156m2,m1,g,158Tb and 153,151Gd nuclear reactions up to 65 MeV. The experimental results are compared with the recently reported experimental data and with the results of the nuclear reaction codes ALICE-IPPE, EMPIRE and TALYS as reported in the TENDL-2015 on-line library. Integral thick-target yields are also derived for the reaction products used in practical applications and production routes are discussed.
