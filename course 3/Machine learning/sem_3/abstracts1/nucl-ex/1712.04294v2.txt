The authors of the letter "Test of the Brink-Axel Hypothesis for the Pygmy Dipole Resonance" [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 182503 (2017)] claim a violation of the Brink-Axel hypothesis by (gamma,gamma') data from gELBE for 96Mo [Phys. Rev. C 79, 061302 (2009)]. This violation cannot be concluded from the (gamma,gamma') data and is not at all discussed in that work. The comparison of the (g,g') data with the new (p,p') data in the letter does not give any hint to such a violation.
