Tomographic representation of an arbitrary nature signal is considered. Comparison of a tomographic representation and a fractional Fourier transform is carried out. Application of tomogram representation or identical to it the Radon transform for processing medical ECG signals is illustrated. The first results show that in contrast to routine Fourier analysis, the Radon transform revealed an additional information for patients with the early signs of ischemic heart disease (IHD) with respect to healthy persons.
