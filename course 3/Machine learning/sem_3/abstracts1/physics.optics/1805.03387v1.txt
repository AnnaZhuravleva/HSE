We present an oxide aperture microcavity with embedded quantum dots that utilizes a three contact design to independently tune the quantum dot wavelength and birefringence of the cavity modes. A polarization splitting tuning of $\sim$5 GHz is observed. For typical microcavity polarization splittings, the method can be used to achieve perfect polarization degeneracy that is required for many polarization-based implementations of photonic quantum gates. The embedded quantum dot wavelength can be tuned into resonance with the cavity, independent of the polarization tuning.
