Spectral-temporal shaping of quantum light has important applications in quantum communications and photonic quantum information processing. Electro-optic temporal lenses have recently been recognized as a tool for noise-free, efficient spectral bandwidth manipulation of single-photon wavepackets. However, standard electro-optic time lenses based on single-tone modulation exhibit limited compression factors due to material limitations on phase modulation amplitude. Here we numerically investigate the use of complex electro-optic temporal phase modulation patterns for bandwidth compression of light over multiple orders of magnitude and show the feasibility of their use in photonic interfaces for quantum network applications.
