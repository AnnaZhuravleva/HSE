Photonic hyper-crystals combine the most interesting features of hyperbolic metamaterials and photonic crystals. Since the dispersion law of extraordinary photons in hyperbolic metamaterials does not exhibit the usual diffraction limit, photonic hyper-crystals exhibit light localization on deep subwavelength scales, leading to considerable enhancement of nonlinear photon-photon interaction. Therefore, similar to their conventional photonic crystal counterparts, nonlinear photonic hyper-crystals appear to be very promising in classical and quantum optical computing applications. Quantum mechanics of photonic hyper-crystals may be formulated in such a way that one of the spatial coordinates would play a role of effective time in a 2+1 dimensional optical spacetime describing light propagation in the hyper-crystal. Mapping the conventional quantum computing onto nonlinear optics of photonic hyper-crystals results in a quantum hyper-computing scheme, which makes computations nearly instantaneous.
