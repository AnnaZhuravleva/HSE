Levitation optomechanics exploits the unique mechanical properties of trapped nano-objects in vacuum in order to address some of the limitations of clamped nanomechanical resonators. In particular, its performance is foreseen to contribute to a better understanding of quantum decoherence at the mesoscopic scale as well as to lead to novel ultra-sensitive sensing schemes. While most efforts have so far focused on optical trapping of low absorbing silica particles, further opportunities arise from levitating objects with internal degrees of freedom like color centers. Nevertheless, inefficient heat dissipation at low pressures poses a challenge, as most nano-objects, even with low absorbing materials, experience photo-damage in an optical trap. Here, by using a Paul trap, we demonstrate levitation in vacuum and center-of-mass feedback cooling of a nanodiamond hosting a single nitrogen-vacancy center. The achieved level of motion control enables us to optically interrogate and characterize the emitter response. The developed platform is applicable to a wide range of other nano-objects and represents a promising step towards coupling internal and external degrees of freedom.
