We study the Floquet edge states in arrays of periodically curved optical waveguides described by the modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Beyond the bulk-edge correspondence, our study explores the interplay between band topology and periodic modulations. By analysing the quasi-energy spectra and Zak phase, we reveal that, although topological and non-topological edge states can exist for the same parameters, \emph{they can not appear in the same spectral gap}. In the high-frequency limit, we find analytically all boundaries between the different phases and study the coexistence of topological and non-topological edge states. In contrast to unmodulated systems, the edge states appear due to either band topology or modulation-induced defects. This means that periodic modulations may not only tune the parametric regions with nontrivial topology, but may also support novel edge states.
