The atom-photon entanglement using the Laguerre-Gaussian beams is studied in the closed-loop three-level $V$-type quantum systems. We consider two schemes with degenerated and non-degenerated upper levels: in the first, the effect of the quantum interference due to the spontaneous emission is taken into account and in the second, a microwave plane wave is applied to the upper levels transition for non-degenerated scheme. It is shown that the atom-photon entanglement in both schemes depends on the intensity profile as well as the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of applied fields so that the various spatially dependent entanglement patterns can be generated by Laguerre-Gaussian beams with different OAMs. However, no entanglement appears in the center of optical vortex beams, because of the zero intensity. As a result, the entanglement between atoms and its spontaneous emissions in different points of the atomic cell can be controlled by the OAM of the applied fields. Moreover, our numerical results show that the number of the local maximum degree of entanglement peaks are determined by the OAM of the applied fields. It seems that the present results would greatly facilitate the determination of the OAM and may find the broad applications in quantum information processing.
