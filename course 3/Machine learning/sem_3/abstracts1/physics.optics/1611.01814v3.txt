Strong coupling between light and matter occurs when the two interact strongly enough to form new hybrid modes called polaritons. Here we report on the strong coupling of both the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom to an ultrafast terahertz (THz) frequency electromagnetic wave. In our system, optical phonons in a slab of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) are strongly coupled to a THz electric field to form phonon-polaritons, which are simultaneously strongly coupled to magnons in an adjacent slab of canted antiferromagnetic erbium orthoferrite (ErFeO$_3$) via the THz magnetic field. The strong coupling leads to the formation of new magnon-phonon-polariton modes, which we experimentally observe in the wavevector-frequency dispersion curve as an avoided crossing and in the time-domain as a normal-mode beating. Our simple yet versatile on-chip waveguide platform provides a promising avenue by which to explore both ultrafast THz spintronics applications and the quantum nature of the interaction.
