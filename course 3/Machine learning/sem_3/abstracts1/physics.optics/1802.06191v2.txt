In organic photodiodes (OPDs) light is absorbed by excitons, which dissociate to generate photocurrent. Here, we demonstrate a novel type of OPD in which light is absorbed by polaritons, hybrid light-matter states. We demonstrate polariton OPDs operating in the ultra-strong coupling regime at visible and infrared wavelengths. These devices can be engineered to show narrow responsivity with a very weak angle-dependence. More importantly, they can be tuned to operate in a spectral range outside that of the bare exciton absorption. Remarkably, we show that the responsivity of a polariton OPD can be pushed to near infrared wavelengths, where few organic absorbers are available, with external quantum efficiencies exceeding those of a control OPD.
