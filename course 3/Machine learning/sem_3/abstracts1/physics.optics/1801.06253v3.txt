We study the electromagnetic (EM) field in the shadow cast by a large opaque sphere. For this, we consider the scattering of a high frequency monochromatic EM wave by the large sphere and develop a Mie theory that accounts for the presence of this obscuration. Applying fully absorbing boundary conditions, we find a solution for the Debye potentials, which we use to determine the EM field in the shadow in the wave zone at large distances from the sphere. We use the standard tools available from the nuclear scattering theory to develop the wave-optical treatment of the problem. Based on this treatment, we demonstrate that there is no EM field deep in the shadow, except for the field that is diffracted into the shadow by the edges of the sphere, as anticipated.
