In the past decade, the concept of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, originally introduced in non-Hermitian extensions of quantum mechanical theories, has come into thinking of photonics, providing a fertile ground for studying, observing, and utilizing some of the peculiar aspects of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in optics. Together with related concepts of non-Hermitian physics of open quantum systems, such as non-Hermitian degeneracies (exceptional points) and spectral singularities, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry represents one among the most fruitful ideas introduced in optics in the past few years. Judicious tailoring of optical gain and loss in integrated photonic structures has emerged as a new paradigm in shaping the flow of light in unprecedented ways, with major applications encompassing laser science and technology, optical sensing, and optical material engineering. In this perspective, I review some of the main achievements and emerging areas of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermtian photonics, and provide an outline of challenges and directions for future research in one of the fastest growing research area of photonics.
