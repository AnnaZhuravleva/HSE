We propose an incident direction free wave propagation generated by unidirectional destructive interference, which is a consequence of the appropriate match of synthetic magnetic flux and the incident wave vector. Single-direction lasing and one-way propagation are feasible without breaking reciprocity or introducing nonlinearity. Unidirectional destructive interference enables a unidirectional laser and a unidirectional perfect absorber. When they are combined in a parity-time symmetric manner, the spectral singularities vanish with bounded reflection and transmission. Our findings provide insights into light modulation and will shed light on the exploration of desirable asymmetric features of non-Hermitian systems in fundamental research and practical applications.
