Single photon, emitted in a transition between two states, has a frequency distribution of intensity, which is given by Lorentzian if the transition is only naturally broadened and the period of observation $T$ is long compared to the lifetime $T_{1}$ of the excited state. However, when the observation time $T$ is short or comparable to $T_{1}$, the frequency spectrum is appreciably broadened. If only the delayed part of the emitted radiation field is detected, then the radiation spectrum does not change. However, if the radiation field is transmitted through a resonant absorber and then detected, the absorption/transmission spectrum of the delayed radiation field is narrowed. We show that this narrowing is due to the interference of the spectral components of the field. Experimental spectra of absorption of M\"{o}ssbauer radiation, obtained by coincidence technique, confirm this conclusion.
