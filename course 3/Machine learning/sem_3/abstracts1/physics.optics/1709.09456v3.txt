We study modal characteristics of a customized ridge waveguide in Lithium Niobate designed to generate twin photons at telecom wavelength. A quantum analysis of SPDC predicts the possible down conversion processes and optimizes the input beam parameters for fundamental mode emission. Further, a Joint Spectral Amplitude (JSA) analysis ensures the generation of signal/idler at 1550 nm in the customized LN waveguide. A calculation of the parametric down conversion (PDC) signal power shows a dependence of L^(3/2) for a waveguide compared to a linear dependence in case of bulk crystal.
