Ultracompact nonlinear optical devices utilizing two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanostructures are becoming an integral part of optoelectronic and photonic circuits. Integration of the nonlinear material into a subwavelength cavity or waveguide leads to a strong enhancement of the nonlinear processes and compensates for a small interaction volume. The generic feature of such devices which makes them especially challenging for analysis is strong dissipation of both the nonlinear polarization and highly confined modes of a subwavelength cavity. Here we solve a quantum-electrodynamic problem of the spontaneous and stimulated parametric decay in a nonlinear quasi-2D waveguide or cavity. We develop a rigorous Heisenberg-Langevin approach which includes dissipation and fluctuations in the electron ensemble and in the electromagnetic field of a cavity on equal footing. Our approach does not depend on any particular model of a dissipative reservoir and can be applied to any dissipation mechanism. Moreover, we derive closed-form analytic results for all relevant quantities such as the threshold for parametric instability and the parametric signal power. We find a strong reduction in the parametric instability threshold for quantum wells and other 2D nonlinear materials in a subwavelength cavity.
