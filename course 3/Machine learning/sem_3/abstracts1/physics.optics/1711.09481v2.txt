Ultrafast emission rates obtained from quantum emitters coupled to plasmonic nanoantennas have recently opened fundamentally new possibilities in quantum information and sensing applications. Plasmonic nanoantennas greatly improve the brightness of quantum emitters by dramatically shortening their fluorescence lifetimes. Gap plasmonic nanocavities that support strongly confined modes are of particular interest for such applications. We demonstrate single-photon emission from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds coupled to nanosized gap plasmonic cavities with internal mode volumes about 10 000 times smaller than the cubic vacuum wavelength. The resulting structures features sub-nanosecond NV excited-state lifetimes and detected photon rates up to 50 million counts per second. Analysis of the fluorescence saturation allows the extraction of the multi-order excitation rate enhancement provided by the nanoantenna. Efficiency analysis shows that the NV center is producing up to 0.25 billion photons per second in the far-field.
