A nonrelativistic Hamiltonian describing interaction between a mechanical degree of freedom and radiation pressure is commonly used as an ultimate tool for studying system behavior in opto-mechanics. This Hamiltonian is derived from the equation of motion of a mechanical degree of freedom and the optical wave equation with time-varying boundary conditions. We show that this approach is deficient for studying higher order nonlinear effects in an open resonant opto-mechanical system. Opto-mechanical interaction induces a large mechanical nonlinearity resulting from a strong dependence of the power of the light confined in the optical cavity on the mechanical degrees of freedom of the cavity due to coupling with electromagnetic continuum. This dissipative nonlinearity cannot be inferred from the standard Hamiltonian formalism.
