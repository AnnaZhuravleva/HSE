Color centers in diamond are promising candidates for quantum nanosensing applications. The efficient collection of the optical signal is the key to achieving high sensitivity and resolution, but it is limited by the collection optics. Embedding the color centers in diamond microstructures can help to enhance the collection efficiency, but often require challenging fabrication and integration. Here we investigate the photoluminescence (PL) of silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in commercially available atomic force microscope (AFM) diamond pyramid (DP) tips. We find that the DP geometry efficiently channels PL emitted at the DP apex towards the base, where we experimentally demonstrate an enhanced PL collection of up to 8 times higher compared to other directions. Our experimental observations are in good agreement with numerical simulations using a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Our results indicate that AFM tips could be an economical, efficient and straightforward way of implementing color-center-based nanosensing as they provide enhanced sensitivity and easy integration with existing AFM platforms.
