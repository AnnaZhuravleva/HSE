In this paper, we propose an effective model including a macroscopic Hamiltonian to describe the interactions between a two-level atom and scattered light in a 1-D dielectric waveguide. The proposed formalism allows us to incorporate the effect of changing optical media inside the continuum while demonstrating a non-classical derivation of Fresnel Law. We obtain the transport characteristics of the two-level system, explore its high-Q bandreject filter property and discuss the implications of radiative and non-radiative dissipation. In addition, we apply our formalism to a modified Fabry-P\'{e}rot interferometer and show the variation in its spontaneous emission characteristics with changing interferometer length. Finally, we conclude with further remarks on the link between the waveguide and cavity quantum electrodynamics.
