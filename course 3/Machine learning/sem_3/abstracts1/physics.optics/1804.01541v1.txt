We experimentally investigate the propagation of optical pulses through a fast-light medium with competing absorption and gain. The combination of strong absorption and optical amplification in a potassium-based four-wave mixing process results in pulse peak advancements up to $88\%$ of the input pulse width, more than $35 \times$ that which is achievable without competing absorption. We show that the enhancement occurs even when the total gain of the four-wave mixer is unity, thereby rendering the medium transparent. By varying the pulse width, we observe a transition between fast and slow light, and show that fast light is optimized for large pulse widths.
