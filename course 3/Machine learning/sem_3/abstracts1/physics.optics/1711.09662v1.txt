In a diffraction pattern of a laser beam on a sharp edge of a half-plane two characteristic regions are noticeable. In the central region, one can notice the diffraction of laser light in the region of geometric shadow, while intensity oscillations are observed in the non-obstructed area. There are also, on both sides of the edge, very long light traces along the normal to the edge of the obstacle. The theoretical explanation is based on the Fresnel-Kirchhoff diffraction theory applied to the Gaussian beam propagation behind the obstacle.
