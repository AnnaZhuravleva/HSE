Quantum states of light with multiple spatial modes are fundamental for quantum imaging and parallel quantum information processing. Thus, their characterization, which can be achieved through measurements of the coherence area, is an important area of research. We present a comparative study between two different measurement techniques for the coherence area of bright entangled twin beams of light generated with a four-wave mixing process in a hot rubidium vapor cell. The first one provides a direct characterization of the size of the coherence area and is based on correlation measurements between spatial intensity fluctuations of the twin beams with an electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device camera. The second one provides an indirect measure and is based on a noise analysis of different spatial regions of the twin beams in the temporal domain with a single photodiode. We show that the indirect technique, which can be implemented with a significantly less complicated measurement scheme, gives an estimate of the size of the coherence area consistent with the direct measurement technique performed in the spatial domain.
