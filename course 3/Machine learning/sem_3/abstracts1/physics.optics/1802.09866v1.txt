The concept of gauge field is a cornerstone of modern physics and the synthetic gauge field has emerged as a new way to manipulate neutral particles in many disciplines. In optics, several schemes have been proposed to realize Abelian synthetic gauge fields. Here, we introduce a new platform for realizing synthetic $SU(2)$ non-Abelian gauge fields acting on two-dimensional optical waves in a wide class of anisotropic materials and discover new phenomena. We show that a virtual non-Abelian Lorentz force can arise from the material anisotropy, which can induce wave packets to travel along wavy "Zitterbewegung" trajectories even in homogeneous media. We further propose an interferometry scheme to realize the non-Abelian Aharonov--Bohm effect of light, which highlights the essential non-Abelian nature of the system. We also show that the Wilson loop of an arbitrary closed optical path can be extracted from a series of gauge fixed points in the interference fringes.
