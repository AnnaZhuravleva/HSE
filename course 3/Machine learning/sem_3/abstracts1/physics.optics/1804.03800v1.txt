We proved that ghost imaging technique has the ability to realize the imaging for an occluded object. In this work, theoretical analyses were made and the numerical simulations were carried out to verify our theoretical results. It was found that, in order to obtain the image of the occluded object, the distance between the target object and the occluding object should be far enough. Furthermore, a better image could be obtained by increasing the wavelength of the light source.
