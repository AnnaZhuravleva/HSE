We found that the measurement sensitivity of an optical integrating gyroscope is fundamentally limited due to ponderomotive action of the light leading to the standard quantum limit of the rotation angle detection. The uncorrelated quantum fluctuations of power of clockwise and counterclockwise electromagnetic waves result in optical power-dependent uncertainty of the angular gyroscope position. We also show that, on the other hand, a quantum back action evading measurement of angular momentum of a gyroscope becomes feasible if proper measurement strategy is selected. The angle is perturbed in this case. This observation hints on fundamental inequivalency of integrating and rate gyroscopes.
