Orbital angular momentum entanglement is one of the most intriguing topics in quantum physics. A broad range of research have been dedicated either to unravel its underlying physics or to expand the entanglement dimensions and degrees. In this paper, we present a theoretical study on the orbital angular momentum entanglement by employing the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to quantum position correlation within the azimuthal region. In this study, we decompose the pump light into a set of pump cone states characterized by their radii. The OAM entanglement can be manipulated by controlling the radius of the pump cone state, the length of the nonlinear crystal and the OAM carried by the pump field,which is followed by a detailed discussion. We expect that our research will bring us a deeper understanding of the OAM entanglement, and will do help to the high-dimensional quantum information tasks based on OAM entanglement.
