The ability to characterize the complete quantum state of light is essential for both fundamental and applied science. For single photons the quantum state is provided by the mode that it occupies. The spectral temporal mode structure of light has recently emerged as an essential means for quantum information science. Here we experimentally demonstrate a self-referencing technique to completely determine the pulse-mode structure of single photons by means of spectral shearing interferometry. We detail the calibration and resolution of the measurement and discuss challenges and critical requirements for future advances of this method.
