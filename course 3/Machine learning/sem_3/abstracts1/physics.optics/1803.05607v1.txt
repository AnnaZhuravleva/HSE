We study entanglement of the cavity modes in a double-cavity optomechanical system in strong-coupling regime. The system consists of two optomechanical systems coupled by a single photon hopping between them. With the radiation pressure of the photon, entanglement of the cavity modes can be generated. The concurrence between the cavity modes is at least twice larger than that between the mechanical modes. Moreover, when we change the ratio between coupling strength and resonant frequency of mechanical modes, the entanglement in cavity and mechanical modes are influenced differently.
