It is shown that two fundamentally different phenomena, the bound states in continuum and the spectral singularity (or time-reversed spectral singularity), can occur simultaneously. This can be achieved, in particular, in a rectangular core dielectric waveguide with embedded active (or absorbing) layer. In such a system a two-dimensional bound state in a continuum is created in the plane of a waveguide cross section and it is emitted or absorbed along the waveguide core. The idea can be used for experimental implementation of a laser or a coherent-perfect-absorber for photonic bound state that resides in a continuous spectrum.
