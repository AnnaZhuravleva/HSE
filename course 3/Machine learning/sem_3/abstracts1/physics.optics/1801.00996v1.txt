Stable and phase-locked emission in an extended topological supermode of coupled laser arrays, based on concepts of non-Hermitian and topological photonics, is theoretically suggested. We consider a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of coupled microring resonators and show that application of a synthetic imaginary gauge field via auxiliary passive microrings leads to all supermodes of the chain, except one, to become edge states. The only extended supermode, that retains some topological protection, can stably oscillate suppressing all other non-topological edge supermodes. Numerical simulations based on a rate equation model of semiconductor laser arrays confirm stable anti-phase laser emission in the extended topological supermode and the role of the synthetic gauge field to enhance laser stability.
