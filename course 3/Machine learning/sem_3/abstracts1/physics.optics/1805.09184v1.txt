Two-photon Rabi splitting in a cavity-dot system provides a basis for multi-qubit coherent control in quantum photonic network. Here we report on two-photon Rabi splitting in a strongly coupled cavity-dot system. The quantum dot was grown intentionally large in size for large oscillation strength and small biexciton binding energy. Both exciton and biexciton transitions couple to a high quality factor photonic crystal cavity with large coupling strengths over 130 $\mu$eV. Furthermore, the small binding energy enables the cavity to simultaneously couple with two exciton states. Thereby two-photon Rabi splitting between biexciton and cavity is achieved, which can be well reproduced by theoretical calculations with quantum master equations.
