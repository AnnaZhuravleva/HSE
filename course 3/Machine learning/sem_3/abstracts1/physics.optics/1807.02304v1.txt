We analyze different factors which influence the negative refraction in solids and multi-atom molecules. We find that this negative refraction is significantly influenced by simultaneous multi-electron transitions with the same transition frequency and dipole redistribution over different eigenstates. We show that these simultaneous multi-electron transitions and enhanced transition dipole broaden the bandwidth of the negative refraction by at least one order of magnitude. This work provides additional connection between metamaterials and Mobius strips.
