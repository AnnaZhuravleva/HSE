We generalize the notion of the Franhoufer diffraction from a single slit to the case of partially temporal coherent and quasimonochromatic light. The problem is studied analytically and the effect of coherence length on the diffraction pattern is investigated. In this case the far-field distribution of the irradiance depends on the newly introduced parameter i.e. the slit decoherence parameter which governs the deviation of the diffraction pattern from the usual one. Numerical study of the effect of the slit decoherence parameter on the Far-field diffraction pattern is performed. The results show that it is important to select the appropriate optical devices and stabilization scheme in applications where the temporal coherence is important for system operation.
