Assembly of quantum nanophotonic systems with plasmonic resonators are important for fundamental studies of single photon sources as well as for on-chip information processing. In this work, we demonstrate controllable nanoassembly of gold nanospheres with ultra-bright quantum emitters in 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We utilize an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip to precisely position gold nanospheres to close proximity of the quantum emitters and observe the resulting emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetime reduction. A fluorescence enhancement of over 300% is achieved experimentally for quantum emitters in hBN, with a radiative quantum efficiency of up to 40% and a saturated count rate in excess of 5 million counts/s. Our results are promising for future employment of quantum emitters in hBN for integrated nanophotonic devices and plasmonic based nanosensors.
