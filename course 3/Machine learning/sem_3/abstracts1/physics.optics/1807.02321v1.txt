The bulk-edge correspondence guarantees that the interface between two topologically distinct insulators supports at least one topological edge state that facilitates scattering-free transport along the interface and is robust against static perturbations. Here, we address the question how spatially local dynamic perturbations of the interface affect the robustness of topological edge states and illuminate the generalization of the bulk-edge correspondence for Floquet systems for the special case of a static bulk. As model systems we consider two photonic implementations of the Su-Schriefer-Heeger model based on coupled plasmonic and dielectric waveguides. Time-periodic perturbations of the interface create Floquet replicas of the topological edge mode. Our experiments and Floquet analysis show that if the driving frequency is in the range for which the first Floquet replicas cross the static bands, the topological edge state couples to bulk states and the topological protection is destroyed. Otherwise the topological protection is conserved.
