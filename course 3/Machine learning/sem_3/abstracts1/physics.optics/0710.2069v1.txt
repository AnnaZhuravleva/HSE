In this paper we present the results of extensive studies of scintillators for hybrid phototubes with luminescent screens. The results of the developments of such phototubes with a variety of scintillators are presented. New scintillator materials for such kind of application are discussed. The requirements for scintillators to use in such hybrid phototubes are formulated. It is shown that very fast and highly efficient inorganic scintillators like ZnO:Ga will be ideal scintillators for such kind of application.
