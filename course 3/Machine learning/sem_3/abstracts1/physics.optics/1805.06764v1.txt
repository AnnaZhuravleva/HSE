The control of quantum states of light at the nanoscale has become possible in recent years with the use of plasmonics. Here, many types of nanophotonic devices and applications have been suggested that take advantage of quantum optical effects, despite the inherent presence of loss. A key example is quantum plasmonic sensing, which provides sensitivity beyond the classical limit using entangled N00N states and their generalizations in a compact system operating below the diffraction limit. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the excitation and propagation of a two-plasmon entangled N00N state (N=2) in a silver nanowire, and assess the performance of our system for carrying out quantum sensing. Polarization entangled photon pairs are converted into plasmons in the silver nanowire, which propagate over a distance of 5 um and re-convert back into photons. A full analysis of the plasmonic system finds that the high-quality entanglement is preserved throughout. We measure the characteristic super-resolution phase oscillations of the entangled state via coincidence measurements. We also identify various sources of loss in our setup and show how they can be mitigated, in principle, in order to reach super-sensitivity that goes beyond the classical sensing limit. Our results show that polarization entanglement can be preserved in a plasmonic nanowire and that sensing with a quantum advantage is possible with moderate loss present.
