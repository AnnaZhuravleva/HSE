We use blow-up solutions of nonlinear Helmholtz equations to introduce a nonlinear resonance effect that is capable of amplifying electromagnetic waves. To achieve this, we propose a scattering setup consisting of a Kerr slab with a negative (defocusing) Kerr constant placed next to a linear slab in such a way that a left-incident coherent TE wave with a specific incidence angle and intensity realizes a blow-up solution of the corresponding Helmholtz equation whenever its wavenumber $k$ take a certain critical value, $k_\star$. For these values, the solution blows up at the right-hand boundary of the Kerr slab. For $k<k_\star$, the setup defines a scattering system with a transmission coefficient $|T|^2$ that tends to $\infty$ for $k\to k_\star$; more specifically $|T^l|^2\propto (k-k_\star)^{-4}$. We show that by tuning the distance between the slabs we can use this setup for amplification of coherent waves with a wavelength in an extremely narrow spectral band. The setup serves as a filter for coherent waves having a nearby wavelength not belonging to this band.
