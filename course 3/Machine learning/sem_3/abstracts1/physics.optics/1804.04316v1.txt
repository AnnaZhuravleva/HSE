The competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem is related to social issues such as maximizing total social benefits while preserving equality among individuals by overcoming conflicts between individual decisions, which could seriously decrease social benefits. The study described herein provides experimental evidence that entangled photons physically resolve the CMAB, maximizing the social rewards while ensuring equality. Moreover, by exploiting the requirement that entangled photons share a common polarization basis, we demonstrated that deception, or delaying the other player receiving a greater reward, cannot be accomplished in a polarization-entangled-photon-based system, while deception is achievable in systems based on classical or polarization-correlated photons. Autonomous alignment schemes for polarization bases were also experimentally demonstrated based on decision conflict information. This study provides the foundation for collective decision making based on polarization-entangled photons and their polarization and value alignment, which is essential for utilizing quantum light for intelligent functionalities.
