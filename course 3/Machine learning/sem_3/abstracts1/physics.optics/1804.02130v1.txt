Single crystal diamond membranes that host optically active emitters are highly attractive components for integrated quantum nanophotonics. In this work we demonstrate bottom-up synthesis of single crystal diamond membranes containing the germanium vacancy (GeV) color centers. We employ a lift-off technique to generate the membranes and perform chemical vapour deposition in a presence of germanium oxide to realize the insitu doping. Finally, we show that these membranes are suitable for engineering of photonic resonators such as microring cavities with quality factors of 1500. The robust and scalable approach to engineer single crystal diamond membranes containing emerging color centers is a promising pathway for realization of diamond integrated quantum nanophotonic circuits on a chip.
