Given a compact manifold $M$ and $g\in C^{\infty}(M,U(l;\mathbb{C}))$ we construct a Chern character $\mathrm{Ch}^-(g)$ which lives in the odd part of the equivariant (entire) cyclic Chen-normalized bar complex $\underline{\mathscr{C}}(\Omega_{\mathbb{T}}(M\times \mathbb{T}))$ of $M$, and which is mapped to the odd Bismut-Chern character under the equivariant Chen integral map. It is also shown that the assignment $g\mapsto \mathrm{Ch}^-(g)$ induces a well-defined group homomorphism from the $K^{-1}$ theory of $M$ to the odd homology group of $\underline{\mathscr{C}}(\Omega_{\mathbb{T}}(M\times \mathbb{T}))$
