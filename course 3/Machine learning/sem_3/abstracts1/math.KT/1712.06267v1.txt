In this paper we introduce exotic twisted $\mathbb T$-equivariant K-theory of loop space $LZ$ depending on the (typically non-flat) holonomy line bundle ${\mathcal L}^B$ on $LZ$ induced from a gerbe with connection $B$ on $Z$. We also define exotic twisted $\mathbb T$-equivariant Chern character that maps the exotic twisted $\mathbb T$-equivariant K-theory of $LZ$ into the exotic twisted $\mathbb T$-equivariant cohomology as defined in an earlier paper of ours, and which localises to twisted cohomology of $Z$.
