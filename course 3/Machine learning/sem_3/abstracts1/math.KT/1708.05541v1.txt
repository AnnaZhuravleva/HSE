This paper explores further the computation of the twisted K-theory and K-homology of compact simple Lie groups, previously studied by Hopkins, Moore, Maldacena-Moore-Seiberg, Braun, and Douglas, with a focus on groups of rank 2. We give a new method of computation based on the Segal spectral sequence which seems to us appreciably simpler than the methods used previously, at least in many key cases.
