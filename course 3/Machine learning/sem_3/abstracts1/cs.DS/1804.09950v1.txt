In this paper, we present Quantum Dynamic Programming approach for problems on directed acycling graphs (DAGs). The algorithm has time complexity $O(\sqrt{\hat{n}m}\log \hat{n})$ comparing to a deterministic one that has time complexity $O(n+m)$. Here $n$ is a number of vertexes, $\hat{n}$ is a number of vertexes with at least one outgoing edge; and $m$ is a number of edges. We show that we can solve problems that have OR, AND, NAND, MAX and MIN functions as the main transition step. The approach is useful for a couple of problems. One of them is computing Boolean formula that represented by DAG with AND and OR boolean operations in vertexes. Another one is DAG's diameter search.
