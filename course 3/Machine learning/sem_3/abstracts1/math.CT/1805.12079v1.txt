We define a higher-order generalisation of the CPM construction based on arbitrary finite abelian group symmetries of symmetric monoidal categories. We show that our new construction is functorial, and that its closure under iteration can be characterised by seeing the construction as an algebra for an appropriate monad. We provide several examples of the construction, connecting to previous work on the CPM construction and on categorical probabilistic theories, as well as upcoming work on higher-order interference and hyper-decoherence.
