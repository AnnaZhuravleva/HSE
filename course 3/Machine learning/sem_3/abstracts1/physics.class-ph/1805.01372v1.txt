Angular momentum balance is examined in the context of the electrodynamics of a spinning hollow sphere of charge, which is allowed to possess any variable angular velocity. We calculate the electric and magnetic fields of the sphere, and express them as expansions in powers of $\tau/t_c \ll 1$, the ratio of the light-travel time $\tau$ across the sphere and the characteristic time scale $t_c$ of variation of the angular velocity. From the fields we compute the self-torque exerted by the fields on the sphere, and argue that only a piece of this self-torque can be associated with radiation reaction. Then we obtain the rate at which angular momentum is radiated away by the shell, and the total angular momentum contained in the electromagnetic field. With these results we demonstrate explicitly that the field angular momentum is lost in part to radiation and in part to the self-torque; angular momentum balance is thereby established. Finally, we examine the angular motion of the sphere under the combined action of the self-torque and an additional torque supplied by an external agent.
