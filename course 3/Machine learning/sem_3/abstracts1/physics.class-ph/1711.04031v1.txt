A uniformly accelerated point charge which moves neither in a straight line nor in a circle, but in a cusp, is investigated. We find the angular distribution of the Larmor radiation, the constant power, and the intensity in the maximal direction. It is found that the intensity of uniformly accelerated cusp motion scales like non-uniformly accelerated synchrotron radiation. We confirm the exact vacuum excitation spectra of quantized field detectors on the world line.
