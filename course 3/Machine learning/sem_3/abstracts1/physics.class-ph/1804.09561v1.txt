Exceptional points (EPs) associated with a square-root singularity have been found in many non-Hermitian systems. In most of the studies, the EPs found are isotropic meaning that the same singular behavior is obtained independent of the direction from which they are approached in the parameter space. In this work, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally the existence of an anisotropic EP in an acoustic system that shows different singular behaviors when the anisotropic EP is approached from different directions in the parameter space. Such an anisotropic EP arises from the coalescence of two square-root EPs having the same chirality.
