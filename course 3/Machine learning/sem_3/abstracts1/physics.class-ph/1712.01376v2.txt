In an extension of speculations that physical space-time is a fractal which might itself be embedded in a high-dimensional continuum, it is hypothesized to "compensate" for local variations of the Hausdorff dimension by instead varying the metric in such as way that the dimensionality of the fractal remains an integer. Conversely, it is suggested that any variation of the metric from its Euclidean (or Minkowskian) form can be "shifted" to nontrivial fractal topology. Thereby "holes" or "gaps" in spacetime could give rise to (increased) curvature.
