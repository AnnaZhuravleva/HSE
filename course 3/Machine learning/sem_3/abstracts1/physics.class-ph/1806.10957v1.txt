We consider the problem of heat diffusion in branched systems and networks on the basis of a model described in terms of heat equation on metric graphs. Using the explicit analytical solutions of the latter, evolution of the temperature profile and heat flow on each branch are computed. Extension of the study for nonlinear regime is considered using a nonlinear heat equation on metric graphs. It is found that in nonlinear regime is more intensive than that in linear case.
