General relativistic quantum dynamics of twisted (vortex) Dirac particles is constructed. The Hamiltonian and equations of motion in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation are derived for a twisted relativistic electron in arbitrary electric and magnetic fields. A critical experiment for a verification of the results is proposed. The new important effect of a radiative orbital polarization of a twisted electron beam in a magnetic field resulting in a nonzero average projection of the intrinsic orbital angular momentum on the field direction is predicted.
