The frequency of oscillation of the Doppler shifted electromagnetic field expected to accompany a massive composite photon consisting of two oppositely-charged circulating constituent particles is shown to be related to the photon energy in accordance with the Planck-Einstein law \(E = h \nu\), where \(h\) is the Planck constant, apart from a factor of approximately one-half. It is proposed a photon energy-frequency relation \(E = h \nu/2\) is necessary for consistency with Planck's blackbody spectrum, because the latter is based on quantization of the energy of standing wave modes necessarily lacking momentum, while a photon has nonvanishing momentum. Therefore two photons are required to account for each energy quantum of the Planck spectrum. Some implications of these observations are discussed, including a semiclassical resolution of the spin-orbit coupling anomaly that does not involve the Thomas precession.
