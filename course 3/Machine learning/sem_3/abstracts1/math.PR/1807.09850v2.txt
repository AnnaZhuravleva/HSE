We derive for the first time in the literature a rate of convergence in the hydrodynamic limit of the Kawasaki dynamics for a one-dimensional lattice system. We use an adaptation of the two-scale approach. The main difference to the original two-scale approach is that the observables on the mesoscopic level are described by a projection onto splines of second order, and not by a projection onto piecewise constant functions. This allows us to use a more natural definition of the mesoscopic dynamics, which yields a better rate of convergence than the original two-scale approach.
