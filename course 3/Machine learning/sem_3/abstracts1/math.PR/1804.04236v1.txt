We consider Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) in a two-dimensional wedge. We prove that if the angle of the wedge is smaller than $\pi/4$, there is some $a>2$ such that almost surely, for all $R$ large enough, after time $R^a$ all new particles attached to the DLA will be at distance larger than $R$ from the origin. This means that DLA stabilizes in growing balls, thus allowing a definition of the infinite DLA in a wedge via a finite time process.
