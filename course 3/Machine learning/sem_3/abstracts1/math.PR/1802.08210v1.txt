Macdonald processes are measures on sequences of integer partitions built using the Cauchy summation identity for Macdonald symmetric functions. These measures are a useful tool to uncover the integrability of many probabilistic systems, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and a number of other models in its universality class. In this paper we develop the structural theory behind half-space variants of these models and the corresponding half-space Macdonald processes. These processes are built using a Littlewood summation identity instead of the Cauchy identity, and their analysis is considerably harder than their full-space counterparts.   We compute moments and Laplace transforms of observables for general half-space Macdonald measures. Introducing new dynamics preserving this class of measures, we relate them to various stochastic processes, in particular the log-gamma polymer in a half-quadrant (they are also related to the stochastic six-vertex model in a half-quadrant and the half-space ASEP). For the polymer model, we provide explicit integral formulas for the Laplace transform of the partition function. Non-rigorous saddle point asymptotics yield convergence of the directed polymer free energy to either the Tracy-Widom GOE, GSE or the Gaussian distribution depending on the average size of weights on the boundary.
