The complex elliptic Ginibre ensemble is a complex Gaussian matrix interpolating between the Gaussian unitary ensemble and the Ginibre ensemble. Its eigenvalues form a determinantal point process in the complex plane, however, until recently singular values have been proved to build a Pfaffian point process by Kanazawa and Kieburg (arXiv:1804.03985). In this paper we turn to consider an extended elliptic Ginibre ensemble with correlated rows and columns, which connects GUE and the spiked Wishart matrix. We prove that the singular values still build a Pfaffian point process with correlation kernel expressed by a contour integral representation, and further observe a crossover transition of local eigenvalue statistics at the origin.
