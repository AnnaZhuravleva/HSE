We prove edge universality for a general class of correlated real symmetric or complex Hermitian Wigner matrices with arbitrary expectation. Our theorem also applies to internal edges of the self-consistent density of states. In particular, we establish a strong form of band rigidity which excludes mismatches between location and label of eigenvalues close to internal edges in these general models.
