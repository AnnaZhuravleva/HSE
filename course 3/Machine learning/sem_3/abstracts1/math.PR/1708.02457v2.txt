In two papers Franz, Leone and Toninelli proved bounds for the free energy of diluted random constraints satisfaction problems, for a Poisson degree distribution [5] and a general distribution [6]. Panchenko and Talagrand [16] simplified the proof and generalized the result of [5] for the Poisson case. We provide a new proof for the general degree distribution case and as a corollary, we obtain new bounds for the size of the largest independent set (also known as hard core model) in a large random regular graph. Our proof uses a combinatorial interpolation based on biased random walks [21] and allows to bypass the arguments in [6] based on the study of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model.
