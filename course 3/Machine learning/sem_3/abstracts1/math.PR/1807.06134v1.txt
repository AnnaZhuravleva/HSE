There is a unique unitarily-invariant ensemble of $n\times n$ Hermitian matrices with a fixed set of real eigenvalues $a_1 > \dots > a_N$. The joint eigenvalue distribution of the $(n - 1)$ top-left principal submatrices of a random matrix from this ensemble is called the orbital unitary process. There are analogous matrix ensembles of symmetric and quaternionic Hermitian matrices that lead to the orbital orthogonal and symplectic processes, respectively. By extrapolation, on the dimension of the base field, of the explicit density formulas, we define the orbital beta processes. We prove the universal behavior of the virtual eigenvalues of the smallest $m$ principal submatrices, when $m$ is independent of $N$ and the eigenvalues $a_1 > \dots > a_N$ grow approximating a limit profile. The limiting object is the Gaussian beta corners process. As a byproduct of our approach, we prove a theorem on the asymptotics of multivariate Bessel functions.
