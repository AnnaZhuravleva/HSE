We consider Boltzmann random triangulations coupled to the Ising model on their faces, under Dobrushin boundary conditions and at the critical point of the model. The first part of this paper computes explicitly the partition function of this model by solving its Tutte's equation, extending a previous result by Bernardi and Bousquet-M\'elou to the model with Dobrushin boundary conditions. We show that the perimeter exponent of the model is $7/3$ instead of the exponent $5/2$ for uniform triangulations. In the second part, we show that the model has a local limit in distribution when the two components of the Dobrushin boundary tend to infinity one after the other. The local limit is constructed explicitly using the peeling process along an Ising interface. In particular, we show that the main interface in the local limit touches the (infinite) boundary almost surely only finitely many times, a behavior opposite to that of the Bernoulli percolation on uniform maps. Some scaling limits closely related to the perimeters of clusters are also obtained.
