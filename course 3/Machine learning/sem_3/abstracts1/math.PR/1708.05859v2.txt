We show that under a low complexity condition on the gradient of a Hamiltonian, Gibbs distributions on the Boolean hypercube are approximate mixtures of product measures whose probability vectors are critical points of an associated mean-field functional. This extends a previous work by the first author. As an application, we demonstrate how this framework helps characterize both Ising models satisfying a mean-field condition and the conditional distributions which arise in the emerging theory of nonlinear large deviations, both in the dense case and in the polynomially-sparse case.
