We study the stochastic six vertex model and prove that under weak asymmetry scaling (i.e., when the parameter $\Delta\to 1^+$ so as to zoom into the ferroelectric/disordered phase critical point) its height function fluctuations converge to the solution to the KPZ equation. We also prove that the one-dimensional family of stochastic Gibbs states for the symmetric six vertex model converge under the same scaling to the stationary solution to the stochastic Burgers equation. We achieve this through a new Markov duality method which shows how duality can be leveraged to prove previously inaccessible results in hydrodynamics and SPDE limits.   Our starting point is an exact microscopic Hopf-Cole transform for the stochastic six vertex model which follows from the model's known one-particle Markov self-duality. Given this transform, the crucial step is to establish self-averaging for specific quadratic function of the transformed height function. We use the model's two-particle self-duality to produce explicit expressions (as Bethe ansatz contour integrals) for conditional expectations from which we extract time-decorrelation and hence self-averaging in time. The crux of the Markov duality method is that the entire convergence result reduces to precise estimates on the one-particle and two-particle transition probabilities.
