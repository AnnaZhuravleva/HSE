We consider random Schr\"odinger operators with Dirichlet boundary conditions outside lattice approximations of a smooth Euclidean domain and study the behavior of its lowest-lying eigenvalues in the limit when the lattice spacing tends to zero. Under a suitable moment assumption on the random potential and regularity of the spatial dependence of its mean, we prove that the eigenvalues of the random operator converge to those of a deterministic Schr\"odinger operator. Assuming also regularity of the variance, the fluctuation of the random eigenvalues around their mean are shown to obey a multivariate central limit theorem. This extends the authors' recent work where similar conclusions have been obtained for bounded random potentials.
