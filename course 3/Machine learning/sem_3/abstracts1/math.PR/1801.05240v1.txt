We introduce a general framework for de Finetti reduction results, applicable to various notions of partially exchangeable probability distributions. Explicit statements are derived for the cases of exchangeability, Markov exchangeability, and some generalizations of these. Our techniques are combinatorial and rely on the "BEST" theorem, enumerating the Eulerian cycles of a multigraph.
