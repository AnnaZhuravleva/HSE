In this paper we present rigorous results on the critical behavior of the Activated Random Walk model. We conjecture that on a general class of graphs, including $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and under general initial conditions, the system at the critical point does not reach an absorbing state. We prove this for the case where the sleep rate $\lambda$ is infinite. Moreover, for the one-dimensional asymmetric system, we identify the scaling limit of the flow through the origin at criticality. The case $\lambda < + \infty$ remains largely open, with the exception of the one-dimensional totally-asymmetric case, for which it is known that there is no fixation at criticality.
