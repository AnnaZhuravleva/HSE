We propose a new approach to the construction of the $\Phi^4_{3}$ Euclidean field theory on a periodic domain. The key ingredient is a variational formula for the partition function involving a stochastic control problem along the flow of a scale regularization parameter. Techniques originating from the analysis of singular SPDEs give uniform bounds allowing to prove the boundedness of the variational functional as the cutoff is removed. The control problem reveals itself as a rigorous and efficient version of Wilson's continous renormalization group.
