In a series of papers [22-24] by Bufetov and Gorin, Schur generating functions as the Fourier transforms on the unitary group $U(N)$, are introduced to study the asymptotic behaviors of random $N$-particle systems. We introduce and study the Jack generating functions of random $N$-particle systems. In special cases, this can be viewed as the Fourier transforms on the Gelfand pairs $(GL_N(\mathbb R), O(N))$, $(GL_N(\mathbb C), U(N))$ and $(GL_N(\mathbb H), Sp(N))$. Our main results state that the law of large numbers and the central limit theorems for such particle systems, is equivalent to certain conditions on the germ at unity of their Jack generating functions. Our main tool is the Nazarov-Sklyanin operators [50], which have Jack symmetric functions as their eigenfunctions. As applications, we derive asymptotics of Jack characters, prove law of large numbers and central limit theorems for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients of zonal polynomials, and show that the fluctuations of the height functions of a general family of nonintersecting random walks are asymptotically equal to those of the pullback of the Gaussian free field on the upper half plane.
