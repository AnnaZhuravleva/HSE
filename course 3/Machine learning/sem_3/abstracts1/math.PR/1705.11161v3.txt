We prove that the Tutte embeddings (a.k.a. harmonic/barycentric embeddings) of certain random planar maps converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized matings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\gamma$ ranges from $0$ to $2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated space-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa =16/\gamma^2$ (in the annealed sense) and that simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the quenched sense). Our arguments also yield analogous statements for the Smith (square tiling) embedding of the mated-CRT map. This constitutes the first proof that discrete conformal embeddings of random planar maps converge to LQG.   To prove our results, we consider an a priori embedding of the mated-CRT map into the plane which arises from the theory of SLE and LQG and show that the simple random walk on the mated-CRT map under this a priori embedding converges to Brownian motion modulo time parameterization. This is done using a general scaling limit result for random walk in certain spatially inhomogeneous random environments which was proven in a separate work.
