We give estimates of the critical parameter for random loop models that are related to quantum spin systems. A special case of the model that we consider is the interchange- or random-stirring process. We consider here the model defined on regular trees of large degrees, which are expected to approximate high spatial dimensions. We find a critical parameter that indeed shares similarity with existing numerical results for the cubic lattice. In the case of the interchange process our results improve on earlier work by Angel and by Hammond, in that we determine the second-order term of the critical parameter.
