The Polaron measure is defined as the transformed path measure   $$   \widehat{\mathbb P}_{\alpha,T}= Z_{\alpha,T}^{-1}\,\, \exp\bigg\{\frac{\alpha}{2}\int_{-T}^T\int_{-T}^T\frac{e^{-|t-s|}}{|\omega(t)-\omega(s)|} \, d s \, d t\bigg\}\,\,d\mathbb P   $$   with respect to $\mathbb P$ which governs the law of the increments of the three dimensional Brownian motion on a finite interval $[-T,T]$, and $ Z_{\alpha,T}$ is the partition function or the normalizing constant and $\alpha>0$ is a constant. The Polaron measure reflects a self attractive interaction. According to a conjecture of Pekar that was proved in [DV83]   $$   \gamma=\lim_{\alpha \to\infty}\frac{1}{\alpha^2}\bigg[\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{\log Z_{\alpha,T}}{2T}\bigg]   $$   exists and has a variational formula. In this article we show that when $\alpha>0$ is sufficiently small or sufficiently large, the limit ${\widehat{\mathbb P}}_{\alpha}=\lim_{T\to\infty}\widehat{\mathbb P}_{\alpha,T}$ exists and identify it explicitly.   As a corollary we deduce the central limit theorem for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2T}}(\omega(T)-\omega(-T))$ under $\widehat{\mathbb P}_{\alpha,T}$ and obtain an expression for the limiting variance.
