We consider the free energy of the bipartite spherical Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model. We find the critical temperature and prove the limiting free energy for all non-critical temperature. We also show that the law of the fluctuation of the free energy converges to the Gaussian distribution when the temperature is above the critical temperature, and to the GOE Tracy--Widom distribution when the temperature is below the critical temperature. The result is universal, and the analysis is applicable to a more general setting including the case where the disorders are non-identically distributed.
