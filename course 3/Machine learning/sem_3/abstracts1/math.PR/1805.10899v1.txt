We consider a space-time continuous directed polymer in random environment. The path is Brownian and the medium is Poissonian. We review many results obtained in the last decade, and also we present new ones. In this fundamental setup, we can make use of fine formulas and strong tools from stochastic analysis for Gaussian or Poisson measure, together with martingale techniques. These notes cover the matter of a course presented during the Jean-Morlet chair 2017 of CIRM "Random Structures in Statistical Mechanics and Mathematical Physics" in Marseille.
