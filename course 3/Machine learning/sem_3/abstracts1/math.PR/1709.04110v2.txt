In last passage percolation models lying in the KPZ universality class, long maximizing paths have a typical deviation from the linear interpolation of their endpoints governed by the two-thirds power of the interpolating distance. This two-thirds power dictates a choice of scaled coordinates, in which these maximizers, called polymers, now cross unit distances with unit-order fluctuations. In this article, we consider Brownian last passage percolation in these scaled coordinates, and prove that the probability of the presence of $k$ disjoint polymers crossing a unit-order region has a superpolynomial tail in $k$, uniformly in the scaling parameter. This result yields understanding of the uniform nature of the coalescence structure of polymers, and plays a foundational role in [Ham17c] in proving comparison on unit-order scales to Brownian motion for polymer weight profiles from general initial data. The present paper also contains an on-scale articulation of the two-thirds power law for polymer geometry: polymers fluctuate by $\epsilon^{2/3}$ on short scales $\epsilon$.
