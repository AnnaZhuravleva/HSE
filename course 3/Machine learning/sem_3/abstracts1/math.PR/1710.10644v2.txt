We prove a Russo-Seymour-Welsh theorem for large and natural perturbative families of discrete percolation models that do not necessarily satisfy the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre condition of positive association. In particular, we prove the box-crossing property for the antiferromagnetic Ising model with small parameter, and for certain discrete Gaussian fields with oscillating correlation function.
