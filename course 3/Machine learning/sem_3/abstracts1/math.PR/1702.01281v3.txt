We review the application of the notion of local convergence on locally finite randomly rooted graphs, known as Benjamini-Schramm convergence, to the calculation of the global eigenvalue density of random matrices from the beta-Gaussian and beta-Laguerre ensembles. By regarding a random matrix as the weighted adjacency matrix of a graph, and choosing the root of such a graph with uniform probability, one can use the Benjamini-Schramm limit to produce the spectral measure of the adjacency operator of the limiting graph. We illustrate how the Wigner semicircle law and the Marchenko-Pastur law are obtained from this machinery.
