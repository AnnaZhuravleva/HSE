We consider a continuous-time random walk which is defined as an interpolation of a random walk on a point process on the real line. The distances between neighboring points of the point process are i.i.d. random variables in the normal domain of attraction of an \alpha-stable distribution with 0 < \alpha < 1. This is therefore an example of a random walk in a L\'evy random medium. Specifically, it is a generalization of a process known in the physical literature as L\'evy-Lorentz gas. We prove that the annealed version of the process is superdiffusive with scaling exponent 1/(\alpha+1) and identify the limiting process. The proofs are based on the technique of Kesten and Spitzer for random walks in random scenery.
