We consider the Ising model at its critical temperature with external magnetic field $ha^{15/8}$ on the square lattice with lattice spacing $a$. We show that the truncated two-point function in this model decays exponentially with a rate independent of $a$. As a consequence, we show exponential decay in the near-critical scaling limit Euclidean magnetization field. For the lattice model with $a=1$, the mass (inverse correlation length) is of order $h^{8/15}$ as $h\downarrow 0$; for the Euclidean field, it equals exactly $Ch^{8/15}$ for some $C$. Although there has been much progress in the study of critical scaling limits, results on near-critical models are far fewer due to the lack of conformal invariance away from the critical point. Our arguments combine lattice and continuum FK representations, including coupled conformal loop and measure ensembles, showing that such ensembles can be useful even in the study of near-critical scaling limits. The coupling we use is novel, even in the discrete lattice setting, and our proofs provide the first substantial application of measure ensembles.
