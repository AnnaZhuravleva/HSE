The mating of trees approach to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) in the random geometry of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) has been recently developed by Duplantier-Miller-Sheffield (2014). In this paper we consider the mating of trees approach to SLE in Euclidean geometry. Let $\eta$ be a whole-plane space-filling SLE with parameter $\kappa>4$, parameterized by Lebesgue measure. The main observable in the mating of trees approach is the contour function, a two-dimensional continuous process describing the evolution of the Minkowski content of the left and right frontier of $\eta$. We prove regularity properties of the contour function and show that (as in the LQG case) it encodes all the information about the curve $\eta$. We also prove that the uniform spanning tree on $\mathbb Z^2$ converges to $\mathrm{SLE}_8$ in the natural topology associated with the mating of trees approach.
