We consider OPE family of the central charge modifications of the Gaussian free field with excursion-reflected/Dirichlet boundary conditions in a doubly connected domain and show that the correlations of fields in the OPE family under the insertion of one-leg operator with marked boundary points are martingale-observables for variants of annulus SLEs. By means of screening, we find Euler integral type solutions to the parabolic partial differential equations for the annulus SLE partition functions introduced by Lawler and Zhan to construct the class of martingale-observables associated with these solutions.
