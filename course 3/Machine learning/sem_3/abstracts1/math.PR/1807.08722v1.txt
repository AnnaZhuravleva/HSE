The random-cluster model with parameters $(p,q)$ is a random graph model that generalizes bond percolation ($q=1$) and the Ising and Potts models ($q\geq 2$). We study its Glauber dynamics on $n\times n$ boxes $\Lambda_{n}$ of the integer lattice graph $\mathbb Z^2$, where the model exhibits a sharp phase transition at $p=p_c(q)$. Unlike traditional spin systems like the Ising and Potts models, the random-cluster model has non-local interactions. Long-range interactions can be imposed as external connections in the boundary of $\Lambda_n$, known as boundary conditions. Blanca and Sinclair proved that when $q>1$ and $p\neq p_c(q)$, the Glauber dynamics on $\Lambda_n$ mixes in optimal $O(n^2 \log n)$ time, for select boundary conditions that do not carry long-range information (namely, wired and free). In this paper, we prove that whenever $q>1$ and $p\neq p_c(q)$, for any boundary condition that is realizable as a configuration on $\mathbb Z^2 \setminus \Lambda_{n}$, the mixing time is at most polynomial in $n$. We then utilize this to prove near-optimal $\tilde O(n^2)$ mixing time for "typical" boundary conditions. As a complementary result, we construct classes of non-realizable (non-planar) boundary conditions inducing slow (stretched-exponential) mixing at $p\ll p_c(q)$.
