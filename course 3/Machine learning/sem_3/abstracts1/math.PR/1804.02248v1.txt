We consider wetting models in $1+1$ dimensions on a shrinking strip with a general pinning function. We show that under diffusive scaling, the interface converges in law to to the reflected Brownian motion, whenever the strip size is $o(N^{-1/2})$ and the pinning function is close enough to critical value of the so-called $\delta$-pinning model of Deuschel, Giacomin, and Zambotti [DGZ05]. As a corollary, the same result holds for the constant pinning strip wetting model at criticality with $o(N^{-1/2})$ strip size.
