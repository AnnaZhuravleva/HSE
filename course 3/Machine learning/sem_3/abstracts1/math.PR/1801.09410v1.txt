We prove local existence for classical solutions of a free boundary problem which arises in one of the biological selection models proposed by Brunet and Derrida, [2] and Durrett and Remenik, [15]. The problem we consider describes the limit evolution of branching brownian particles on the line with death of the leftmost particle at each creation time as studied in [13]. We use extensively results in [5] and [16].
