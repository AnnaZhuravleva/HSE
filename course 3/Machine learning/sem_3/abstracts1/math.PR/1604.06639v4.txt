Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) is a one-parameter family of random planar curves introduced by Oded Schramm in 1999 as the candidates for the scaling limits of the interfaces in the planar critical lattice models. This is the only possible process with conformal invariance and a certain "domain Markov property". In 2010, Chelkak and Smirnov proved the conformal invariance of the scaling limits of the critial planar FK-Ising model which gave the convergence of the interface to SLE$_{16/3}$. We derive the arm exponents of SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa\in (4,8)$. Combining with the convergence of the interface, we derive the arm exponents of the critical FK-Ising model. We obtain six different patterns of boundary arm exponents and three different patterns of interior arm exponents of the critical planar FK-Ising model on the square lattice.
