In this paper we establish eigenvector delocalization and bulk universality for L\'{e}vy matrices, which are real, symmetric, $N \times N$ random matrices $\textbf{H}$ whose upper triangular entries are independent, identically distributed $\alpha$-stable laws. First, if $\alpha \in (1, 2)$ and $E \in \mathbb{R}$ is any energy bounded away from $0$, we show that every eigenvector of $\textbf{H}$ corresponding to an eigenvalue near $E$ is completely delocalized and that the local spectral statistics of $\textbf{H}$ around $E$ converge to those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as $N$ tends to $\infty$. Second, we show for almost all $\alpha \in (0, 2)$, there exists a $c(\alpha) > 0$ such that the same statements hold if $|E| < c (\alpha)$.
