A mated-CRT map is a random planar map obtained as a discretized mating of correlated continuum random trees. Mated-CRT maps provide a coarse-grained approximation of many other natural random planar map models (e.g., uniform triangulations and spanning tree-weighted maps), and are closely related to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) for $\gamma \in (0,2)$ if we take the correlation to be $-\cos(\pi\gamma^2/4)$. We prove estimates for the Dirichlet energy and the modulus of continuity of a large class of discrete harmonic functions on mated-CRT maps, which provide a general toolbox for the study of the quantitative properties random walk and discrete conformal embeddings for these maps.   For example, our results give an independent proof that the simple random walk on the mated-CRT map is recurrent, and a polynomial upper bound for the maximum length of the edges of the mated-CRT map under a version of the Tutte embedding. Our results are also used in other work by the first two authors which shows that for a class of random planar maps --- including mated-CRT maps and the UIPT --- the spectral dimension is two (i.e., the return probability of the simple random walk to its starting point after $n$ steps is $n^{-1+o_n(1)}$) and the typical exit time of the walk from a graph-distance ball is bounded below by the volume of the ball, up to a polylogarithmic factor.
