We consider a system of self-avoiding polygons interacting through a potential that penalizes or rewards the number of mutual touchings and we prove the existence of a localized phase, where the polygon length admits uniformly bounded exponential moments, and a space-filling phase, where the polygons grow with the system size and fill the whole system. We provide non-trivial bounds for the critical curve separating the two regimes and prove that the phase transition is sharp.
