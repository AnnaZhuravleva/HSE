We prove that the interface of critical site percolation on the triangular lattice converges to SLE$_6$ in its natural parametrization. The discrete interface is parametrized such that each edge is crossed in one unit of time, while the limiting curve is parametrized by $\frac 74$-dimensional Minkowski content. We also prove that the scaling limit of counting measure on the pivotal points considered by Garban, Pete, and Schramm (2013), is $\frac 34$-dimensional Minkowski content up to a multiplicative constant.
