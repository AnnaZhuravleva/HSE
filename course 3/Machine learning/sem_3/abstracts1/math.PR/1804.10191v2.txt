We prove that Bernoulli bond percolation on any nonamenable, Gromov hyperbolic, quasi-transitive graph has a phase in which there are infinitely many infinite clusters, verifying a well-known conjecture of Benjamini and Schramm (1996) under the additional assumption of hyperbolicity. In other words, we show that $p_c<p_u$ for any such graph. Our proof also yields that the triangle condition $\nabla_{p_c}<\infty$ holds at criticality on any such graph, which is known to imply that several critical exponents exist and take their mean-field values. This gives the first family of examples of one-ended groups all of whose Cayley graphs are proven to have mean-field critical exponents for percolation.
