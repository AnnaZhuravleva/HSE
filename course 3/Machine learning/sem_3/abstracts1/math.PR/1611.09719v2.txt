We study a general family of space-time discretizations of the KPZ equation and show that they converge to its solution. The approach we follow makes use of basic elements of the theory of regularity structures [M. Hairer, A theory of regularity structures, Invent. Math. 2014] as well as its discrete counterpart [M. Hairer, K. Matetski, Discretizations of rough stochastic PDEs, 2015]. Since the discretization is in both space and time and we allow non-standard discretization for the product, the methods mentioned above have to be suitably modified in order to accommodate the structure of the models under study.
