We give an alternative proof of the fact that, on Zd, the Vertex reinforced jump process is recurrent in strong reinforcement. Consequently, the edge reinforced random walk is recurrent in strong reinforcement, this is first proved separately in [ST15a] and [ACK14]. We give yet an alternative proof, hopefully shorter, using the classic idea of fractional moments [AM93]. As a corollary, we also show that, the operator naturally associated to the VRJP, is localized in strong disorder.
