In the loop $O(n)$ model a collection of mutually-disjoint self-avoiding loops is drawn at random on a finite domain of a lattice with probability proportional to   $$\lambda^{ \# \mbox{ edges} } n^{ \# \mbox{ loops} },$$ where $\lambda, n \in [0, \infty)$. Let $\mu$ be the connective constant of the lattice and, for any $n \in [0, \infty)$, let $\lambda_0(n)$ be the largest value of $\lambda$ such that the loop length admits uniforfmly bounded exponential moments. It is not difficult to prove that $\lambda_0(n) =1/\mu$ when $n=0$ (in this case the model corresponds to the self-avoiding walk) and that for any $n \geq 0$, $\lambda_0(n) \geq 1/\mu$. In this note we prove that, $$ \lambda_0(n) > \frac{1}{\mu} \, \, \, \mbox{ whenever $n >0$}, $$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with $d \geq 2$, and on the hexagonal lattice. Which means, when $n$ is positive (even arbitrarily small), as a consequence of the mutual repulsion between the loops, a phase transition can only occur at a strictly larger critical threshold than in the self-avoiding walk.
