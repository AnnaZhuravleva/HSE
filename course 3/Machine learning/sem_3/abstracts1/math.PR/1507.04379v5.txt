The food web is a directed graph in which nodes label species and directed links represent the predation between species. The cascade model generates random food webs. The continuum cascade model is a Poisson approximation of the cascade model. The recursion to obtain the probability distribution of the longest chain length generated by the continuum cascade model has the solution with traveling wave. We consider a branching random walk to study the asymptotic probability on the position of wave front.
