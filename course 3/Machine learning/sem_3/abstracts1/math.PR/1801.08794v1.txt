We provide a probabilistic representations of the solution of some semilinear hyperbolicand high-order PDEs based on branching diffusions. These representations pave theway for a Monte-Carlo approximation of the solution, thus bypassing the curse ofdimensionality. We illustrate the numerical implications in the context of some popularPDEs in physics such as nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, a simplied scalar versionof the Yang-Mills equation, a fourth-order nonlinear beam equation and the Gross-Pitaevskii PDEas an example of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.
