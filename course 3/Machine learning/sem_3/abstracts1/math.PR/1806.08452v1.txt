We prove annealed scaling relations for planar Voronoi percolation. To our knowledge, this is the first result of this kind for a continuum percolation model. We are mostly inspired by the proof of scaling relations for Bernoulli percolation by Kesten [Kes87]. Along the way, we show an annealed quasi-multiplicativity property by relying on the quenched box-crossing property proved by Ahlberg, Griffiths, Morris and Tassion [AGMT16]. Intermediate results also include the study of quenched and annealed notions of pivotal events and the extension of the quenched box-crossing property of~[AGMT16] to the near-critical regime.
