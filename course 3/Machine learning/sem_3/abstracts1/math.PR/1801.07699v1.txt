This article focuses on the characterization of global multiple Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE). The chordal SLE process describes the scaling limit of a single interface in various critical lattice models with Dobrushin boundary conditions, and similarly, global multiple SLEs describe scaling limits of collections of interfaces in critical lattice models with alternating boundary conditions. In this article, we give a minimal amount of characterizing properties for the global multiple SLEs: we prove that there exists a unique probability measure on collections of pairwise disjoint continuous simple curves with a certain conditional law property. As a consequence, we obtain the convergence of multiple interfaces in the critical Ising and FK-Ising models.
