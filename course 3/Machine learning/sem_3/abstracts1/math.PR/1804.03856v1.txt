Multivariate Bessel processes associated with root systems describe the stochastic dynamics of interacting particle systems of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland type. By the work of Andraus, Katori, and Miyashita, the explicit distributions of these processes $(X_{t,k})_{t\ge0}$ of type $A_{N-1}$ on the associated Weyl chamber $C_N^A$ with a fixed starting distribution yield a weak limiting law in the freezing regime, that is, for the multiplicities $k\to\infty$, namely $X_{t,k}/\sqrt k\to\sqrt{2t}\cdot z$ where the entries of the vector $z$ are the zeros of the classical Hermite polynomial $H_N$ of order $N$. Here, we use the stochastic differential equation for $(X_{t,k})_{t\ge0}$ and derive a corresponding limiting theorem for starting points of the form $\sqrt k\cdot x$ for $x$ in the interior of $C_N^A$. This limit is locally uniform in $t$ almost surely with a strong rate of convergence. In addition, we present corresponding freezing results for the root systems of type $B_N$ and $D_N$. For one freezing regime of type $B_N$ as well as for type $D_N$, the zeros of classical Laguerre polynomials appear. We also discuss associated central limit theorems for some cases. The results are also related to the work of Dumitriu and Edelman for $\beta$-Hermite and $\beta$-Laguerre ensembles.
