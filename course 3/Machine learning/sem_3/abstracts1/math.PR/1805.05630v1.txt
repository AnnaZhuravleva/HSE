We consider the spherical spin glass model defined by a combination of the pure 2-spin spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian and the ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss Hamiltonian. In the large system limit, there is a two-dimensional phase diagram with respect to the temperature and the coupling strength. The phase diagram is divided into three regimes; ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and spin glass regimes. The fluctuations of the free energy are known in each regime. In this paper, we study the transition between the ferromagnetic regime and the paramagnetic regime in a critical scale.
