We consider asymptotic problems concerning the motion of interface separating the regions of large and small values of the solution of a reaction-diffusion equation in the media consisting of domains with different characteristics (composites). Under certain conditions, the motion can be described by the Huygens principle in the appropriate Finsler (e.g., Riemannian) metric. In general, the motion of the interface has, in a sense, non-local nature. In particular, the interface may move by jumps. We are mostly concerned with the nonlinear term that is of KPP type. The results are based on limit theorems for large deviations.
