The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) has a persistent shock (jump discontinuity) in its macroscopic particle density if the initial density is an appropriate step function. It serves as a microscopic model of shocks in Burgers' equation.   This paper studies fluctuations of the shock in KPZ setting, or soft shock, whereby the step size is tuned with time in KPZ space-time scaling. In the double limit of large time followed by step size, the fluctuation of a particle at the soft shock converges to the maximum of two independent GOE Tracy-Widom random variables. More generally, joint fluctuations of particles near the soft shock are aptly combined maxima of these two random variables.   The fluctuations of the hard shock are expectedly the same and will be subject of future work. Proofs rely on determinantal formulae for TASEP and the KPZ fixed point.
