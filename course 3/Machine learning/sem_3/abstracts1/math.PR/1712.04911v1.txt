Let $G$ be the product of finitely many trees $T_1\times T_2 \cdots \times T_N$, each of which is regular with degree at least three. We consider Bernoulli bond percolation and the Ising model on this graph, giving a short proof that the model undergoes a second order phase transition with mean-field critical exponents in each case. The result concerning percolation recovers a result of Kozma (2013), while the result concerning the Ising model is new.   We also present a new proof, using similar techniques, of a lemma of Schramm concerning the decay of the critical two-point function along a random walk, as well as some generalizations of this lemma.
