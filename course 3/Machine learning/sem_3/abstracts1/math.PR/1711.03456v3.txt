We study the central limit theorem in the non-normal domain of attraction to symmetric $\alpha$-stable laws for $0<\alpha\leq2$. We show that for i.i.d. random variables $X_i$, the convergence rate in $L^\infty$ of both the densities and distributions of $\sum_i^n X_i/(n^{1/\alpha}L(n))$ is at best logarithmic if $L$ is a non-trivial slowly varying function. Asymptotic laws for several physical processes have been derived using central limit theorems with $\sqrt{n\log n}$ scaling and Gaussian limiting distributions. Our result implies that such asymptotic laws are accurate only for exponentially large $n$.
