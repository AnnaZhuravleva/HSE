We consider TASEP in continuous time with non-random initial conditions and arbitrary fixed density of particles rho. We show GOE Tracy-Widom universality of the one-point fluctuations of the associated height function. The result phrased in last passage percolation language is the universality for the point-to-line problem where the line has an arbitrary slope.
