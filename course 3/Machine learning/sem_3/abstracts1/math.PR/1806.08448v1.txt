In [AGMT16], Ahlberg, Griffiths, Morris and Tassion prove that, asymptotically almost surely, the quenched crossing probabilities for critical planar Voronoi percolation do not depend on the environment. We prove an analogous result for arm events; in particular, we prove that the variance of the quenched probability of an arm event is at most a constant times the square of the annealed probability. The fact that the arm events are degenerate and non-monotonic add two major difficulties. Our main tools are a martingale estimate in the spirit of [AGMT16] and estimates on pivotal events from [Van18]. As an application, we prove that there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that the following holds for the annealed percolation function $\theta^{an}$: \[ \forall p > 1/2 ,\, \theta^{an}(p) \geq \epsilon (p-1/2)^{1-\epsilon} \, . \] This is the analogue of the estimate proved by Kesten and Zhang [KZ87] for Bernoulli percolation. We also explain why our main result is important for the study of noise sensitivity of Voronoi percolation. To this purpose, we introduce a random continuous point process inspired by the work of Garban, Pete and Schramm [GPS10] which we call the annealed spectral sample of Voronoi percolation.
