We study the branching tree of the perimeters of the nested loops in critical $O(n)$ model for $n \in (0,2)$ on random quadrangulations. We prove that after renormalization it converges towards an explicit continuous multiplicative cascade whose offspring distribution $(x_i)_{i \ge 1}$ is related to the jumps of a spectrally positive $\alpha$-stable L\'evy process with $\alpha= \frac{3}{2} \pm \frac{1}{\pi} \arccos(n/2)$ and for which we have the surprisingly simple and explicit transform $$ \mathbb E\left[\sum_{i \ge 1} (x_i)^\theta \right] = \frac{\sin(\pi (2-\alpha))}{\sin (\pi (\theta - \alpha))} \quad \mbox{for }\theta \in (\alpha, \alpha+1).$$ An important ingredient in the proof is a new formula of independent interest on first moments of additive functionals of the jumps of a left-continuous random walk stopped at a hitting time. We also identify the scaling limit of the volume of the critical $O(n)$-decorated quadrangulation using the Malthusian martingale associated to the continuous multiplicative cascade.
