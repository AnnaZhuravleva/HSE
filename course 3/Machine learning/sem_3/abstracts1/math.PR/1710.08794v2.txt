We study the relation between particular classes of P\'olya frequency functions and three kinds of polynomial ensembles of derivative type which we propose to call P\'olya ensembles. These ensembles correspond to the multiplicative convolution of complex square matrices and to the additive convolution of Hermitian, real anti-symmetric, Hermitian anti-self-dual and complex rectangular matrices. All random matrices have to be isotropic, e.g. unitarily invariant for Hermitian matrices or bi-unitarily invariant for complex matrices, such that our results are applicable. P\'olya ensembles have the nice property that they only depend on a single one-point weight. The multiplicative convolution of complex square matrices and the additive convolution of Hermitian matrices were already dealt with in former works. One goal will be to generalize and unify the ideas to the other kinds of convolutions. Here we consider convolutions in the same class as well as convolutions with the more general class of polynomial ensembles. The second goal is to relate the P\'olya ensembles with P\'olya frequency functions which are better characterized. The third goal will be the derivation of some general group integrals which are similar to the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integral. For illustration we give some explicit examples for our results.
