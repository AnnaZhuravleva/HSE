We consider the fractional stochastic heat type equation \begin{align*} \partial_t u_t(x)=-(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}u_t(x)+\xi\sigma(u_t(x))\dot{F}(t,x),\ \ \ x\in D, \ \ t>0, \end{align*} with nonnegative bounded initial condition, where $\alpha\in (0,2]$, $\xi>0$ is the noise level, $\sigma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a globally Lipschitz function satisfying some growth conditions and the noise term behave in space like the Riez kernel and is possibly correlated in time and $D$ is the open ball of radius $R>0$, centered at the origin. When the noise term is not correlated in time, we establish a change in the growth of the solution of these equations depending on the noise level $\xi$. On the other hand when the noise term behaves in time like the fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in (1/2,1)$, We also derive explicit bounds leading to a well-known weakly $\rho$-intermittency property.
