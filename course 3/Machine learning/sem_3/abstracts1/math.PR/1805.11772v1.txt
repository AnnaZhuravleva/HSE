We study a spatial model of random permutations on trees with a time parameter $T>0$, a special case of which is the random stirring process. The model on trees was first analysed by Bj\"ornberg and Ueltschi[BU16], who established the existence of infinite cycles for $T$ slightly above a putatively identified critical value but left open behaviour at arbitrarily high values of $T$. We show the existence of infinite cycles for all $T$ greater than a constant, thus classifying behaviour for all values of $T$ and establishing the existence of a sharp phase transition. Numerical studies [BBBU15] of the model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ have shown behaviour with strong similarities to what is proven for trees.
