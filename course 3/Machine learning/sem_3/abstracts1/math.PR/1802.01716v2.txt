The Dean-Kawasaki model consists of a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation describing the evolution of the density function for a system of finitely many particles governed by Langevin dynamics. This equation is formally obtained, in a Schwartz distribution setting, on the hydrodynamic scale. We derive and analyse a suitably regularised Dean-Kawasaki model in one space dimension, thus resolving formal mathematical issues associated with the distributional setting of the original Dean-Kawasaki model. We further prove a high-probability result for the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions to this regularised Dean-Kawasaki model.
