Mott variable-range hopping is a fundamental mechanism for electron transport in disordered solids in the regime of strong Anderson localization. We give a brief description of this mechanism, recall some results concerning the behavior of the conductivity at low temperature and describe in more detail recent results (obtained in collaboration with N. Gantert and M. Salvi) concerning the one-dimensional Mott variable-range hopping under an external field.
