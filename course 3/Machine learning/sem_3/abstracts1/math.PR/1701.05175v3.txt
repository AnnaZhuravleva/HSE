Let $Q$ be a free Boltzmann quadrangulation with simple boundary decorated by a critical ($p=3/4$) face percolation configuration. We prove that the chordal percolation exploration path on $Q$ between two marked boundary edges converges in the scaling limit to chordal SLE$_6$ on an independent $\sqrt{8/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity disk (equivalently, a Brownian disk). The topology of convergence is the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov-uniform topology, the natural analog of the Gromov-Hausdorff topology for curve-decorated metric measure spaces. We also obtain an analogous scaling limit result for face percolation on the uniform infinite half-plane quadrangulation with simple boundary. Our method of proof is robust and, up to certain technical steps, extends to any percolation model on a random planar map which can be explored via peeling.
