In this paper, we survey and discuss various surface phenomena such as prewetting, layering and faceting for a family of two- and three-dimensional low-temperature models of statistical mechanics, notably Ising models and (2+1)-dimensional solid-on-solid (SOS) models, with a particular accent on scaling regimes which lead or, in most cases, are conjectured to lead to Ferrari-Spohn type diffusions.
