We study the asymptotics of the global fluctuations for the difference between two adjacent levels in the $\beta$--Jacobi corners process (multilevel and general $\beta$ extension of the classical Jacobi ensemble of random matrices). The limit is identified with the derivative of the $2d$ Gaussian Free Field. Our main tools are integral forms for the (Macdonald-type) difference operators originating from the shuffle algebra.
