Symmetric random walks in $R^d$ and $Z^d$ are considered. It is assumed that the jump distribution density has moderate tails, i.e., several density moments are finite, including the second one. The global (for all $x$ and $t$) asymptotic behavior at infinity of the transition probability (fundamental solution of the corresponding parabolic convolution operator) is found. Front propagation of ecological waves in the corresponding population dynamics models is described.
