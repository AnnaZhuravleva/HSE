This is the set of lecture notes for a course delivered at the 2017 PIMS-CRM Summer School in Probability. The text provides a gentle introduction to the subject of two-dimensional Discrete Gaussian Free Field with particular emphasis paid to scaling limits of the level sets at heights of order of, or approximately at, the absolute maximum. The bulk of the text is based on recent joint papers with O. Louidor and with J. Ding and S. Goswami. New proofs of the tightness and distributional convergence of the centered absolute maximum are presented that by-pass the use of the modified Branching Random Walk.
