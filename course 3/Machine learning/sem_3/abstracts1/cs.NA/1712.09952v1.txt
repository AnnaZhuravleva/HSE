Spectral methods provide an elegant and efficient way of numerically solving differential equations of all kinds. For smooth problems, truncation error for spectral methods vanishes exponentially in the infinity norm and $L_2$-norm. However, for non-smooth problems, convergence is significantly worse---the $L_2$-norm of the error for a discontinuous problem will converge at a sub-linear rate and the infinity norm will not converge at all. We explore and improve upon a post-processing technique---optimally convergent mollifiers---to recover exponential convergence from a poorly-converging spectral reconstruction of non-smooth data. This is an important first step towards using these techniques for simulations of realistic systems.
