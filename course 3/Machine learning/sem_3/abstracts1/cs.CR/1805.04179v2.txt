In this paper we discuss the Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) in relation to post-quantum group-based cryptography. We review the relationship between HSP and other computational problems discuss an optimal solution method, and review the known results about the quantum complexity of HSP. We also overview some platforms for group-based cryptosystems. Notably, efficient algorithms for solving HSP in such infinite group platforms are not yet known.
