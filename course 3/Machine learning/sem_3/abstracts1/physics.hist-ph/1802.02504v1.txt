The radical changes in the concepts and approach in Physics at the turn of the Nineteenth century were so deep, that is acknowledged as a revolution. However, in 1970 Thomas Kuhn's careful reconstruction of the researches on the black body problem, the concept itself of the revolution seemed to vanish in his diluted discussion of every details. In the present paper, after an examination of the limitations of Kuhn's response to his critics, I put forward the idea, although it is not new, that these changes in Physics cannot be reduced to a point-like event, but happened instead through multiple successive (and even contradictory) changes in the course of decades. Such as the old quantum hypothesis, wave mechanics, orthodox quantum mechanics. In fact, the innovative perspectives started in the 1980s have been considered as a third quantum revolution. My basic argument is that these changes, in order to be really understood, must be interpreted not as mere specific changes in Physics, but framed in the context of the deep social, cultural, and economic changes during those turbulent years. The main steps are outlined.
