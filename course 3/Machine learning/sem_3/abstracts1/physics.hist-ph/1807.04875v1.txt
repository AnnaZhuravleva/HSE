We explore the issue of spacetime emergence in quantum gravity, by articulating several levels at which this can be intended. These levels correspond to the reconstruction moves that are needed to recover the classical and continuum notion of space and time, which are progressively lost in a progressively deeper sense in the more fundamental quantum gravity description. They can also be understood as successive steps in a process of widening of the perspective, revealing new details and new questions at each step. Each level carries indeed new technical issues and opportunities, and raises new conceptual issues. This deepens the scope of the debate on the nature of spacetime, both philosophically and physically.
