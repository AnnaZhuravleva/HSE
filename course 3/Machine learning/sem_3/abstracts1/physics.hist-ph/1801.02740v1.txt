This paper aims to recall some of the main contributions of Roberto Petronzio to physics, with a particular regard to the period we have been working together. His seminal contributions cover an extremely wide range of topics: the foundation of the perturbative approach to QCD, various aspects of weak interaction theory, from basic questions (e.g. the mass of the Higgs) to lattice weak interaction, lattice QCD from the beginning to most recent computations.
