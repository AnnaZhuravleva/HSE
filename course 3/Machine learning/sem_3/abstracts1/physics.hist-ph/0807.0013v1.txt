In an article published by Mauricio Nirenstein in 1925, a few months after the visit of Albert Einstein to Argentina, the author wrote various comments and references relative to the scientist's visit. In particular, Nirenstein mentioned a personal conversation he had with Einstein in which the sage expressed many interesting ideas on the epistemology of physical sciences. In a note to that article, it was indicated that Einstein would have left in the hands of Nirenstein some notes of a speech he wanted to deliver at the University of Buenos Aires. From 1931 onwards there appeared in a few journals of this city, different versions of what became known as the "inedito" of Einstein. In this paper we discuss both the facts and the individuals. We analyse briefly the "inedito" and we compare it with the two introductory lectures Einstein delivered at the University of Buenos Aires and at the Faculty of Science.
