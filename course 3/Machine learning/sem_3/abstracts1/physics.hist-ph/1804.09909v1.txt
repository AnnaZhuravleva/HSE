I recall my "first hour" events following on my meeting in Fall 1968 in the classroom with my academic teacher and thesis mentor Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. multiple Walter Greiner. My comments focus on the creation of the new "strong fields" domain of physics in Frankfurt. I argue that this was the research field closest to Walter's heart during his lustrous academic career. I will describe the events that lead on to Greiner's course books, Walters actions leading to the rise of Frankfurt School of Theoretical Physics, and show how a stability principle defined his science.
