Closed timelike curves, or time machines, are objects within General Relativity. Such objects bring a myriad of unsolved paradoxes. Convincing and general arguments against time machines and their paradoxes are missing today in physics and philosophy. In this article, a philosophical argument against time machines is given. According to the presented argument, the unconscious belief in the principle of individuation motivates the belief in time machines. Then, assuming a process of individuation instead of a principle of individuation, one denies any type of human travel into the past.
