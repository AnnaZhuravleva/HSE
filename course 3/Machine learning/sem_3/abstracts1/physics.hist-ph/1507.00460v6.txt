The vanishing of the spatial curvature observed in the current standard model of cosmology is interpreted under the assumption that it does not result from an accidental compensation mechanism between the contributions of visible matter and an unknown component called dark matter, but rather from a foundational principle relating matter to the vacuum, the principle of the relativity of inertia, or Mach's principle. The dark universe (dark energy and dark matter) is thus interpreted as emerging together with ordinary matter, from the vacuum, as it is understood in the framework of quantum field theory, namely a quantum vacuum. It will be shown that this interpretation may lead to a reasonable agreement between the current understanding of the quantum vacuum in quantum field theory and current observations of dark energy and dark matter, and that dark matter can be interpreted as emerging from the QCD vacuum, as a Bose-Einstein gluon condensate, with an energy density relative to the baryonic energy density that agrees with observations.
