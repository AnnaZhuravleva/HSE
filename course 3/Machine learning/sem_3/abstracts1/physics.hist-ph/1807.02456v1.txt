The theoretical motivations that led Tullio Regge to investigate the analytical properties of the scattering amplitude of the collision process between two particles in terms of complex energy and complex angular momentum are briefly reviewed and set in the context of the S-matrix theory that was developed in the late Fifties and early Sixties of the last century, in an attempt to unravel the properties of the strong interaction.
