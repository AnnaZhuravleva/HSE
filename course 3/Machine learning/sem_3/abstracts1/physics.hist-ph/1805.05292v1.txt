This year is 50 anniversary of the first experimental observation of ultracold neutrons (UCN). I present my reminiscences of the first experiment in Dubna, first encounter with F.L. Shapiro -- pioneer of the UCN investigations, and the early stage of the UCN experiments. Present status of investigations with UCN is shortly reviewed.
