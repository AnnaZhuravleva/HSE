The cosmological constant, usually named Lambda, was introduced by Einstein in 1917 and abandoned by him as his biggest "blunder". It currently seems to make a spectacular comeback in the framework of the new cosmological standard model. One will explain why, together with the Planck's constant, the Boltzmann's constant, the celerity of light and the Newton's constant, also considered by Einstein, the cosmological constant may play a foundational role in the conceptual framework, an in the metrological framework a role comparable with the one attributed to Avogadro constant
