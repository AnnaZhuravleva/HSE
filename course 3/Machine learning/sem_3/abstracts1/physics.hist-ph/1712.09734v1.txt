We present a brief review of the impact that Albert Einstein's visit to Argentina had on the scientific community and on the general public. Among other particularities, his visit was, at a certain point, somewhat disconcerting: not only because of the complexity of his ideas, but also because of his appearance, which did not fit with the image of the wise visitor firmly seated in the minds of his interlocutors. His openness and tendency to ironize, especially in his first interviews with the press, first disorientated journalists and later also some members of his intellectual audience. Einstein, then, forced a revision of both the image of the wise man and that of spacetime.
