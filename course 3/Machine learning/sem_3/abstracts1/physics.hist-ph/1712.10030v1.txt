In this paper I will present a short scientific biography of Guido Altarelli, briefly describing some of his most important seminal works. I will analyze in great details the paper of the $q^2$ evolution of the effective quark distribution: I will put this paper in a historical perspective, describing our theoretical understanding at that time and the reasons why the paper was so successful.
