We study two aspects of Hecke symmetry in this note. First, we build evidence for and conjecture a generalization of the Ramanujan identities to the case of automorphic forms of Hecke groups. Second, motivated by the appearance of Hecke symmetry in an example of low-orders/low-orders resurgence, we conjecture a generalization of an inversion formula from the theory of elliptic functions.
