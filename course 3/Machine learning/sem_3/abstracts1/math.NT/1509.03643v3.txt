The aim of this article is to investigate how various Riemann Hypotheses would follow only from properties of the prime numbers. To this end, we consider two classes of $L$-functions, namely, non-principal Dirichlet and those based on cusp forms. The simplest example of the latter is based on the Ramanujan tau arithmetic function. For both classes we prove that if a particular trigonometric series involving sums of multiplicative characters over primes is $O(\sqrt{N})$, then the Euler product converges in the right half of the critical strip. When this result is combined with the functional equation, the non-trivial zeros are constrained to lie on the critical line. We argue that this $\sqrt{N}$ growth is a consequence of the series behaving like a one-dimensional random walk. Based on these results we obtain an equation which relates every individual non-trivial zero of the $L$-function to a sum involving all the primes. Finally, we briefly mention important differences for principal Dirichlet $L$-functions due to the existence of the pole at $s=1$, in which the Riemann $\zeta$-function is a particular case.
