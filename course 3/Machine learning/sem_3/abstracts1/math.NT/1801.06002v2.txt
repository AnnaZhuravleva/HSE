We review recent development of short uniform random walks, with a focus on its connection to (zeta) Mahler measures and modular parametrisation of the density functions. Furthermore, we extend available "probabilistic" techniques to cover a variation of random walks and reduce some three-variable Mahler measures, which are conjectured to evaluate in terms of $L$-values of modular forms, to hypergeometric form.
