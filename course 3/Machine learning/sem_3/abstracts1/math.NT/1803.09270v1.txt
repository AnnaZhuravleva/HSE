Topologically twisted $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory has a partition function that counts Euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces. On the manifold $\mathbb{P}^2$ and with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(3)$ this partition function has a holomorphic anomaly which makes it a mock modular form of depth two. We employ the Circle Method to find a Rademacher expansion for the Fourier coefficients of this partition function. This is the first example of the use of Circle Method for a mock modular form of a higher depth.
