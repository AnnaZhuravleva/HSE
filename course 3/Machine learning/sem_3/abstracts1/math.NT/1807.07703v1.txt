We study Hecke operators on vector-valued modular forms for the Weil representation $\rho_L$ of a lattice $L$. We first construct Hecke operators $\mathcal{T}_r$ that map vector-valued modular forms of type $\rho_L$ into vector-valued modular forms of type $\rho_{L(r)}$, where $L(r)$ is the lattice $L$ with rescaled bilinear form $(\cdot, \cdot)_r = r (\cdot, \cdot)$, by lifting standard Hecke operators for scalar-valued modular forms using Siegel theta functions. The components of the vector-valued Hecke operators $\mathcal{T}_r$ have appeared in [1] as generating functions for D4-D2-D0 bound states on K3-fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. We study algebraic relations satisfied by the Hecke operators $\mathcal{T}_r$. In the particular case when $r=n^2$ for some positive integer $n$, we compose $\mathcal{T}_{n^2}$ with a projection operator to construct new Hecke operators $\mathcal{H}_{n^2}$ that map vector-valued modular forms of type $\rho_L$ into vector-valued modular forms of the same type. We study algebraic relations satisfied by the operators $\mathcal{H}_{n^2}$, and compare our operators with the alternative construction of Bruinier and Stein in [5, 22].
