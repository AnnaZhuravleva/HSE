We show that mock automorphic forms obtained from weak harmonic Maa{\ss} forms give rise to nontrivial $(\mathfrak g,K)$-cohomology, providing evidence for replacing the `holomorphic' condition with `cohomological' when generalizing to general reductive groups. We note that such a candidate allows for growing Fourier coefficients, in contrast to automorphic forms under the Miatello-Wallach conjecture. The second part of this note surveys the connection with BPS black hole counts as a physical motivation for introducing mock automorphic forms.
