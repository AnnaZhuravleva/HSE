Given a PPT state $A=\sum_{i=1}^nA_i\otimes B_i \in M_k\otimes M_k$ and a vector $v\in\Im(A)\subset\mathbb{C}^k\otimes\mathbb{C}^k$ with tensor rank $k$, we provide an algorithm that checks whether the positive map $G_A:M_k\rightarrow M_k$, $G_A(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n tr(A_iX)B_i$, is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map. This procedure is based on the search for Perron eigenvectors of completely positive maps and unique solutions of, at most, $k$ unconstrained quadratic minimization problems. As a corollary, we can check whether this state can be put in the filter normal form. This normal form is an important tool for studying quantum entanglement. An extension of this procedure to PPT states in $M_k\otimes M_m$ is also presented.
