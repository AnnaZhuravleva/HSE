Given a representation of a $C^*$-algebra together with an isometry, one obtains an operator state on the algebra via restriction using the adjoint action given by the isometry. We show that Stinespring's construction furnishes a left adjoint of this restriction. This is an extension of previous work that showed the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction can be viewed as a 2-categorical adjunction. We apply this perspective to analyze Kraus decompositions and properties of the Radon-Nikodym derivative.
