We show that there exist factorizable quantum channels in each dimension $\ge 11$ which do not admit a factorization through any finite dimensional von Neumann algebra, and do require ancillas of type II$_1$. We give a simplified proof of a result by Dykema, Paulsen and Prakash that the set of synchronous quantum correlations $C_q^s(5,2)$ is non-closed. Employing a trick of Regev, Slofstra and Vidick, we use this result to show that the set of correlation matrices arising from unitaries in finite dimensional von Neumann algebras is non-closed, in each dimension $\ge 11$, from which we derive our main result.
