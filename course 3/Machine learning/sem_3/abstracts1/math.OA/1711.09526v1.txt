We prove an infinite Ramsey theorem for noncommutative graphs realized as unital self-adjoint subspaces of linear operators acting on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, we prove that if V is such a subspace, then provided there is no obvious obstruction, there is an infinite rank projection P with the property that the compression PVP is either maximal or minimal in a certain natural sense.
