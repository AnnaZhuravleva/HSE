We examine the noncommutative index theory associated to the dynamics of a Delone set and the corresponding transversal groupoid. Our main motivation comes from the application to topological phases of aperiodic lattices and materials, and covers invariants from tilings as well. Our discussion concerns semifinite index pairings, factorisation properties of Kasparov modules and the construction of unbounded Fredholm modules for lattices with finite local complexity.
