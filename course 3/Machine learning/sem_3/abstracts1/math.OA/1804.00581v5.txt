A quantum set is defined to be simply a set of nonzero finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Together with quantum binary relations, essentially those of Weaver, quantum sets form a dagger compact category; this class of categories is at the heart of categorical quantum mechanics. Quantum functions are certain quantum binary relations that can be characterized in terms of this dagger compact structure, and the resulting category of quantum sets and quantum functions generalizes the category of ordinary sets and ordinary functions in the manner of noncommutative mathematics. In particular, this category is dual to a subcategory of von Neumann algebras. The theory is developed thoroughly, with the noncommutative dictionary in mind, and with an eye to convenient application. As a motivating example, a notion of quantum graph coloring is derived within this framework, and it is shown to be equivalent to the notion that appears in the quantum information theory literature.
