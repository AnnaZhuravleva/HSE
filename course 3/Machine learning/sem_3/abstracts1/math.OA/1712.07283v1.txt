By using Araki's relative entropy, Lieb's convexity and the theory of singular integrals, we compute the mutual information associated with free fermions, and we deduce many results about entropies for chiral CFT's which are embedded into free fermions, and their extensions. Such relative entropies in CFT are here computed explicitly for the first time in a mathematical rigorous way. Our results agree with previous computations by physicists based on heuristic arguments; in addition we uncover a surprising connection with the theory of subfactors, in particular by showing that a certain duality, which is argued to be true on physical grounds, is in fact violated if the global dimension of the conformal net is greater than $1.$
