We investigate the structure of the relative bicentralizer algebra ${\rm B}(N \subset M, \varphi)$ for inclusions of von Neumann algebras with normal expectation where $N$ is a type ${\rm III_1}$ subfactor and $\varphi \in N_*$ is a faithful state. We first construct a canonical flow $\beta^\varphi : \mathbf R^*_+ \curvearrowright {\rm B}(N \subset M, \varphi)$ on the relative bicentralizer algebra and we show that the W$^*$-dynamical system $({\rm B}(N \subset M, \varphi), \beta^\varphi)$ is independent of the choice of $\varphi$ up to a canonical isomorphism. In the case when $N=M$, we deduce new results on the structure of the automorphism group of ${\rm B}(M,\varphi)$ and we relate the period of the flow $\beta^\varphi$ to the tensorial absorption of Powers factors. For general irreducible inclusions $N \subset M$, we relate the ergodicity of the flow $\beta^\varphi$ to the existence of irreducible hyperfinite subfactors in $M$ that sit with normal expectation in $N$. When the inclusion $N \subset M$ is discrete, we prove a relative bicentralizer theorem and we use it to solve Kadison's problem when $N$ is amenable.
