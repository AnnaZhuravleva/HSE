In this paper, we present a new way to associate a spectral triple to a higher-rank graph $\Lambda$. Moreover, we prove that this spectral triple has a close connection to the wavelet decomposition of the infinite path space of $\Lambda$ which was introduced by Farsi, Gillaspy, Kang, and Packer in 2015. We first introduce the concept of stationary $k$-Bratteli diagrams, to associate a family of ultrametric Cantor sets to a finite, strongly connected higher-rank graph $\Lambda$. Then we show that under mild hypotheses, such Cantor sets are $\zeta$-regular in the sense of Pearson and Bellissard. Consequently, one can compute the Dixmier trace associated to the Pearson-Bellissard spectral triples of these Cantor sets. We show that in this setting, the measure $\mu$ induced by the Dixmier trace agrees with the measure $M$ on the infinite path space $\Lambda^\infty$ of $\Lambda$ which was introduced by an Huef, Laca, Raeburn, and Sims. Finally, we investigate the eigenspaces of a family of Laplace-Beltrami operators associated to the Dirichlet forms of the spectral triples. We show that these eigenspaces refine the wavelet decomposition of $L^2(\Lambda^\infty, M)$ which was constructed by Farsi et al.
