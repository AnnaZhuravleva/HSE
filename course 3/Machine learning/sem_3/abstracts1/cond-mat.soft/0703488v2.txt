This paper investigates the properties of a three dimensional shear flow overpassing a hemispherical droplet resting on a plane wall. The exact solution is computed as a function of the viscosity ratio between the droplet and the surrounding fluid and generalizes the solution for the hemispherical no-slip bump given in an earlier paper by Price (1985). Several expressions including the torque and the force acting on the drop will be considered as well as the importance of the deformations on the surface for small Capillary numbers.
