We investigate the conformations of a semiflexible polymer confined to a square box. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show the existence of a shape transition when the persistence length of the polymer becomes comparable to the dimensions of box. An order parameter is introduced to quantify this behavior. A simple mean-field model is constructed to study the effect of the shape transition on the effective persistence length of the polymer.
