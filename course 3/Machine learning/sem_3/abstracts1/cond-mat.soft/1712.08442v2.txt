Nematic interfaces are thin fluid films, ideally two-dimensional, endowed with an in-plane degenerate nematic order. In this letter we examine a generalisation of the classical Plateau problem to an axisymmetric nematic interface bounded by two coaxial parallel rings. The equilibrium interface shape results from the competition between surface tension, which favours the minimization of the interface area, and the nematic elasticity which instead promotes the alignment of the molecules along a common direction. We find two classes of equilibrium solutions with intrinsically uniform alignments: one in which the molecules are aligned along the meridians, the other along parallels. Depending on two parameters, one geometric and the other constitutive, the Gaussian curvature of the equilibrium interface may be negative, vanishing or positive. The stability of these equilibrium configurations is investigated.
