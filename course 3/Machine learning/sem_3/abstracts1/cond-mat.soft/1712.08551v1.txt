We calculate stationary distribution of force acting on charged particle in plasma environment with magnetic interaction between particle and moving charges taken into account. Obtained result is a generalization of Holtsmark distribution and coincides with it in a limit of zero temperature ($<u^2> = 0$). We suppose, this result to be valuable for spectra broadening calculations and studies of Brownian motion in plasma.
