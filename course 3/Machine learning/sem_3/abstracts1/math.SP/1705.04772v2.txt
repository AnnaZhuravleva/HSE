We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian $H_\gamma$ on a 3D twisted waveguide with random Anderson-type twisting $\gamma$. We introduce the integrated density of states $N_\gamma$ for the operator $H_\gamma$, and investigate the Lifshits tails of $N_\gamma$, i.e. the asymptotic behavior of $N_\gamma(E)$ as $E \downarrow \inf {\rm supp}\, dN_\gamma$. In particular, we study the dependence of the Lifshits exponent on the decay rate of the single-site twisting at infinity.
