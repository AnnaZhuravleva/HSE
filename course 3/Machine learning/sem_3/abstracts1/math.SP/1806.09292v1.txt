We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian in a straight planar strip perturbed by a bounded periodic symmetric operator. We prove the classical Bethe-Sommerfeld conjecture for this operator, namely, this operator has finitely many gaps in its spectrum provided a certain special function written as a series satisfies some lower bound. We show that this is indeed the case if the ratio of the period and the width of strip is less than a certain explicit number, which is approximately equal to 0.10121. We also find explicitly the point in the spectrum, above which there is no internal gaps. We then study the case of a sufficiently small period and we prove that in such case the considered operator has no internal gaps in the spectrum. The conditions ensuring the absence are written as certain explicit inequalities.
