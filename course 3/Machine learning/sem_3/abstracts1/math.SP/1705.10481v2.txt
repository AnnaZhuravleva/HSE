In the junction $\Omega$ of several semi-infinite cylindrical waveguides we consider the Dirichlet Laplacian whose continuous spectrum is the ray $[\lambda_\dagger, +\infty)$ with a positive cut-off value $\lambda_\dagger$. We give two different criteria for the threshold resonance generated by nontrivial bounded solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation $-\Delta u=\lambda_\dagger u$ in $\Omega$. The first criterion is quite simple and is convenient to disprove the existence of bounded solutions. The second criterion is rather involved but can help to detect concrete shapes supporting the resonance. Moreover, the latter distinguishes in a natural way between stabilizing, i.e., bounded but non-descending solutions and trapped modes with exponential decay at infinity.
