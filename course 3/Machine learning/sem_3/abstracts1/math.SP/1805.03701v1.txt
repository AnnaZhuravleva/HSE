We consider the problem of embedding eigenvalues into the essential spectrum of periodic Jacobi operators, using an oscillating, decreasing potential. To do this we employ a geometric method, previously used to embed eigenvalues into the essential spectrum of the discrete Schr\"{o}dinger operator. For periodic Jacobi operators we relax the rational dependence conditions on the values of the quasi-momenta from this previous work. We then explore conditions that permit not just the existence of infinitely many subordinate solutions to the formal spectral equation but also the embedding of infinitely many eigenvalues.
