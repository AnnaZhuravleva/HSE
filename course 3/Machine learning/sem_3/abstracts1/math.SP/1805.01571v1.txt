We are interested in diagonal perturbations of a periodic Jacobi operator that introduce embedded eigenvalues in its essential spectrum. Embedding multiple points in the essential spectrum has been known to be difficult, given that eigenvalues are destroyed easily by small perturbations. However, given a finite or countably infinite set of points within an absolutely continuous band of the original periodic operator (subject only to a very weak non-resonance condition) we are able to construct a diagonal perturbation that preserves the essential spectrum and places eigenvalues in all of those points.
