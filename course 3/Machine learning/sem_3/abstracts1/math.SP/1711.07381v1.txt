Following the proof given by Froese and Herbst in [FH82] with another conjugate operator, we show for a class of real potential that possible eigenfunction of the Schr\"odinger operator has to decay sub-exponentially. We also show that, for a certain class of potential, this bound can not be satisfied which implies the absence of strictly positive eigenvalues for the Schr\"odinger operator.
