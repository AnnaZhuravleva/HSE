We consider the Schr\"odinger operator on a combinatorial graph consisting of a finite graph and a finite number of discrete half-lines, all jointed together, and compute an asymptotic expansion of its resolvent around the threshold $0$. Precise expressions are obtained for the first few coefficients of the expansion in terms of the generalized eigenfunctions. This result justifies the classification of threshold types solely by growth properties of the generalized eigenfunctions. By choosing an appropriate free operator a priori possessing no zero eigenvalue or zero resonance we can simplify the expansion procedure as much as that on the single discrete half-line.
