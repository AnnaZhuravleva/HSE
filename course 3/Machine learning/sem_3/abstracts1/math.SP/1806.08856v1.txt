Matrix-valued measures provide a natural language for the theory of finite rank perturbations. In this paper we use this language to prove some new results in the perturbation theory. First, an analysis of matrix-valued measures and their Cauchy transforms allows us to get a simple proof of the famous Kato--Rosenblum theorem for rank one perturbation; we prove both the unitary equivalence of the absolutely continuous parts and the existence of wave operators.   Second, we develop the Aronszajn--Donoghue theory about the mutual singularity of the singular parts of the spectrum. While simple direct sum type examples would indicate that such a theory is impossible for the finite rank perturbations, we introduced the notion of vector mutual singularity for the matrix-valued measures, and with this notion the Aronszajn--Donoghue theory generalizes to the vector case; namely the singular parts of the matrix-valued measures of the original and the perturbed operators (under non-degenerate perturbation) are vector mutually singular.   As for the scalar spectral measures and the classical mutual singularity, we show that the singular parts are mutually singular for almost all perturbations. One of the ways to prove that is to use a generalization of the Aleksandrov's spectral averaging to the matrix-valued measures, which is also one of the main results of this paper.   Finally, the spectral representation of the perturbed operator is obtained. The matrix Muckenhoupt $A_2$ condition appears naturally there, and it plays an important role in establishing the vector mutual singularity of the spectral measures.
