The main goal of this work is to give the solutions in closed form of the spectral problem $-\Psi''+u\Psi=\lambda \Psi$, when $u$ is a stationary potential of the KdV hierarchy. We describe the centralizer of the Schr\"odinger operator $L=-\partial^2 +u$, and we use differential resultants to obtain the corresponding spectral curves $\Gamma$, in general of arbitrary genus. We define the spectral Picard-Vessiot extension of the operator $L-\lambda$ over the spectral curve $\Gamma$, proving its existence. In this work, we find closed form formulas for the solutions of $L-\lambda$ by means of differential subresultant operators, which allow effective computations. A key ingredient of our contribution is to consider a global parametrization of the spectral curve to provide a one-parameter form of the solutions.
