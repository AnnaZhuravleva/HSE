We show that for general-type self-adjoint and skew-self-adjoint Dirac systems on the semi-axis Weyl functions are unique analytic extensions of the reflection coefficients. New results on the extension of the Weyl functions to the real axis and on the existence (in the skew-self-adjoint case) of the Weyl functions follow. Important procedures to recover general-type Dirac systems from the Weyl functions are applied to the recovery of Dirac systems from the reflection coefficients. We explicitly recover Dirac systems from the rational reflection coefficients as well.
