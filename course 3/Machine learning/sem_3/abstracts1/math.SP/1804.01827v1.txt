We study the influence of certain geometric perturbations on the spectra of self-adjoint Schr\"odinger operators on compact metric graphs. Results are obtained for radially symmetric vertex conditions, which, amongst others, include $\delta$ and $\delta'$-type conditions. We show that adding edges to the graph or joining vertices changes the eigenvalues monotonously. However, the monotonicity properties may differ from what is known for the previously studied cases of Kirchhoff (or standard) and $\delta$-conditions and may depend on the signs of the coefficients in the vertex conditions.
