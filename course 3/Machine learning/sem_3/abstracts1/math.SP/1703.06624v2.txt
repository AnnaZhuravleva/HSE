We consider semi-infinite Jacobi matrices corresponding to a point interaction for the discrete Schr\"odinger operator. Our goal is to find explicit expressions for the spectral measure, the resolvent and other spectral characteristics of such Jacobi matrices. It turns out that their spectral analysis leads to a new class of orthogonal polynomials generalizing the classical Chebyshev polynomials.
