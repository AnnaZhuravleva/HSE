We investigate the bottom of the spectra of infinite quantum graphs, i.e., Laplace operators on metric graphs having infinitely many edges and vertices. We introduce a new definition of the isoperimetric constant for quantum graphs and then prove the Cheeger-type estimate. Our definition of the isoperimetric constant is purely combinatorial and thus improves and extends the corresponding estimate of S.\ Nicaise (Bull.\ Sci.\ Math., II.\ S\'er., {\bf 111}, 401--413 (1987)). Moreover, it establishes connections with the combinatorial isoperimetric constant, one of the central objects in spectral graph theory and in the theory of simple random walks on graphs. The later enables us to prove a number of criteria for quantum graphs to be uniformly positive or to have purely discrete spectrum. We demonstrate our findings by considering trees, antitrees and Cayley graphs.
