We prove and apply two theorems: First, a quantitative, scale-free unique continuation estimate for functions in a spectral subspace of a Schr\"odinger operator on a bounded or unbounded domain, second, a perturbation and lifting estimate for edges of the essential spectrum of a self-adjoint operator under a semi-definite perturbation. These two results are combined to obtain lower and upper Lipschitz bounds on the function parametrizing locally a chosen edge of the essential spectrum of a Schr\"odinger operator in dependence of a coupling constant. Analogous estimates for eigenvalues, possibly in gaps of the essential spectrum, are exhibited as well.
