We perform quantitative spectral analysis of the self-adjoint Dirichlet Laplacian $\mathsf{H}$ on an unbounded, radially symmetric (generalized) parabolic layer $\mathcal{P}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$. It was known before that $\mathsf{H}$ has an infinite number of eigenvalues below the threshold of its essential spectrum. In the present paper, we find the discrete spectrum asymptotics for $\mathsf{H}$ by means of a consecutive reduction to the analogous asymptotic problem for an effective one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator on the half-line with the potential the behaviour of which far away from the origin is determined by the geometry of the layer $\mathcal{P}$ at infinity.
