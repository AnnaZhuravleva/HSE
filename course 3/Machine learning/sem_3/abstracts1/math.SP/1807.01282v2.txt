We study the distribution of the discrete spectrum, embedded eigenvalues and the existence of limiting absorption principles for some non-self-adjoint perturbations of the one-dimensional discrete Schr\"odinger operator. Our results are based on a suitable combination of complex scaling techniques, positive commutators methods, and resonance theory. These strategies can be applied fruitfully to many other models.
