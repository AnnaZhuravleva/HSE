In this work, we study the dynamics of rogue waves in the partially $\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal Davey-Stewartson(DS) systems. Using the Darboux transformation method, general rogue waves in the partially $\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS equations are derived. For the partially $\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS-I equation, the solutions are obtained and expressed in term of determinants. For the partially $\cal{PT}$-symmetric DS-II equation, the solutions are represented as quasi-Gram determinants. It is shown that the fundamental rogue waves in these two systems are rational solutions which arises from a constant background at $t\rightarrow -\infty$, and develops finite-time singularity on an entire hyperbola in the spatial plane at the critical time. It is also shown that the interaction of several fundamental rogue waves is described by the multi rogue waves. And the interaction of fundamental rogue waves with dark and anti-dark rational travelling waves generates the novel hybrid-pattern waves. However, no high-order rogue waves are found in this partially $\cal{PT}$-symmetric nonlocal DS systems. Instead, it can produce some high-order travelling waves from the high-order rational solutions.
