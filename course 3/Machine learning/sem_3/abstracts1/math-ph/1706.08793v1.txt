We consider the classical Calogero-Sutherland system with two types of interacting spin variables. It can be reduced to the standard Calogero-Sutherland system, when one of the spin variables vanishes. We describe the model in the Hitchin approach and prove complete integrability of the system by constructing the Lax pair and the classical $r$-matrix with the spectral parameter on a singular curve.
