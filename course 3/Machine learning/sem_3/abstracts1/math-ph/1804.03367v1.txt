We extend the results of our paper "Attractors for two dimensional waves with homogeneous Hamiltonians of degree 0" written with Laure Saint-Raymond to the case of forced linear wave equations in any dimension. We prove that, in dimension 2,if the foliation on the boundary at infinity of the energy shell is Morse-Smale, we can apply Mourre's theory and hence getthe asymptotics of the forced solution. We also characterize the wavefrontsets of the limit Schwartz distributionusing radial propagation estimates.
