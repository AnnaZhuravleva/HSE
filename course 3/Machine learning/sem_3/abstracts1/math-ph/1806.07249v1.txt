These lecture notes concern information-theoretic notions of entropy. They are intended for, and have been successfully taught to, undergraduate students interested inresearch careers. Besides basic notions of analysis related to convergence that are typically taught in the first or second year of undergraduate studies, no other background is needed to read the notes. The notes might be also of interest to any mathematically inclined reader who wishes to learn basic facts about notions of entropy in an elementary setting.
