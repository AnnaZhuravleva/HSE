Inspired by general relativity, we develop a uniform scheme for long-range potential scattering by introducing tortoise coordinates. In general relativity, the tortoise coordinate transforms the Schwarzschild spacetime into a spacetime with a conformally flat subspacetime. In this letter, we show that the tortoise coordinate can convert long-range potentials to short-range potentials. In scattering theory, there is a uniform scheme for short-range potential scattering, but there is no uniform scheme for long-range potential scattering. Once a long-range potential is converted to a short-range potential, a uniform scheme for long-range potential scattering can be established. We provide an uniform expression of scattering wave functions for long-range potentials and show that the long-range potential scattering wave function is just the short-range potential scattering wave function with a replacement of a common coordinate by a tortoise coordinate. It should be emphasized that such a uniform scheme not only applies to scattering but also applies to potentials possessing only bound states. Furthermore, in terms of tortoise coordinates, we suggest a classification scheme for potentials. Finally, an interesting result found in the present paper is that there exists a duality relation between the tortoise coordinates of different potentials.
