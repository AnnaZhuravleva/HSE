Quasi-periodic solutions of a nonlinear polyharmonic equation for the case $4l>n+1$ in $\R^n$, $n>1$, are studied. This includes Gross-Pitaevskii equation in dimension two ($l=1,n=2$). It is proven that there is an extensive "non-resonant" set ${\mathcal G}\subset \R^n$ such that for every $\vec k\in \mathcal G$ there is a solution asymptotically close to a plane wave $Ae^{i\langle{ \vec{k}, \vec{x} }\rangle}$ as $|\vec k|\to \infty $, given $A$ is sufficiently small.
