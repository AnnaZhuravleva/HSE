A plane algebraic curve whose Newton polygone contains d lattice points can be given by d points it passes through. Then the coefficients of its equation Poisson commute having been regarded as functions of coordinates of those points. It is observed in the work by O.Babelon and M.Talon, 2002. We formulate a generalization of this fact in terms of separation of variables and prove relations implying the Poisson commutativity. The examples of the integrable systems obtained this way include coefficients of the Lagrange and Hermit interpolation polynomials, coefficients of the Weierstrass models of curves.
