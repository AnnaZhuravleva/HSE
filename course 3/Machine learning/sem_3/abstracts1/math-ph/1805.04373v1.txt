Bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians, often called Bogoliubov Hamiltonians, play an important role in the theory of many-boson systems where they arise in a natural way as an approximation to the full many-body problem. In this note we would like to give an overview of recent advances in the study of bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians. In particular, we relate the reported results to what can be called the time-dependent diagonalization problem.
