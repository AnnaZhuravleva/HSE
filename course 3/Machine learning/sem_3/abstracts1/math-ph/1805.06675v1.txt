The power-law random banded matrices and the ultrametric random matrices are investigated numerically in the regime where eigenstates are extended but all integer matrix moments remain finite in the limit of large matrix dimensions. Though in this case standard analytical tools are inapplicable, we found that in all considered cases eigenvector distributions are extremely well described by the generalised hyperbolic distribution which differs considerably from the usual Porter-Thomas distribution but shares with it certain universal properties.
