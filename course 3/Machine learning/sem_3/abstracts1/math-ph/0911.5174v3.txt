In this paper, we introduce and study unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy and quantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy, in particular, our main results of quantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy are established on the separable complex Hilbert spaces. Moreover, the entanglement-measure of states due to the quantum unified $(r,s)$-relative entropy is considered, too. Our results improved a uncorrect statement on the monotone property of entanglement-measure function.
