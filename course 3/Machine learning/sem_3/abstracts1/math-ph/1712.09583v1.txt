In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of a higher-order $\mu$-Camassa-Holm equation. We first establish the Green's function of $(\mu-\partial_{x}^{2}+\partial_{x}^{4})^{-1}$ and local well-posedness for the equation in Sobolev spaces $H^{s}(\mathbb{S})$, $s>\frac{7}{2}$. Then we provide the global existence results for strong solutions and weak solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution map is non-uniformly continuous in $H^{s}(\mathbb{S})$, $s\geq 4$. Finally, we prove that the equation admits single peakon solutions.
