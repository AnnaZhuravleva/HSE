We build systems of imprimitivity (SI) in the context of quantum walks and provide geometric constructions for their configuration space. We consider three systems, an evolution of unitaries from the group SO3 on a low dimensional de Sitter space where the walk happens on the dual of SO3, standard quantum walk whose SI live on the orbits of stabilizer subgroups (little groups) of semidirect products describing the symmetries of 1+1 spacetime, and automorphisms (walks are specific automorphisms) on distant-transitive graphs as application of the constructions.
