We construct a Hamiltonian for a quantum-mechanical model of nonrelativistic particles in three dimensions interacting via the creation and annihilation of a second type of nonrelativistic particles, which are bosons. The interaction between the two types of particles is a point interaction concentrated on the points in configuration space where the positions of two different particles coincide. We define the operator, and its domain of self-adjointness, in terms of co-dimension-three boundary conditions on the set of collision configurations relating sectors with different numbers of particles.
