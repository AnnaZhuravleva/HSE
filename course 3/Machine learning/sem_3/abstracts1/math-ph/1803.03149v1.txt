We consider Berezin-Toeplitz operators on compact Kahler manifolds whose symbols are characteristic functions. When the support of the characteristic function has a smooth boundary, we prove a two-term Weyl law, the second term being proportional to the Riemannian volume of the boundary. As a consequence, we deduce the area law for the entanglement entropy of integer quantum Hall states.
