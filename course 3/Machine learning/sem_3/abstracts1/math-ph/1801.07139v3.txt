We derive a new variational principle, leading to a new momentum map and a new multisymplectic formulation for a family of Euler--Poincar\'e equations defined on the Virasoro-Bott group, by using the inverse map (also called `back-to-labels' map). This family contains as special cases the well-known Korteweg-de Vries, Camassa-Holm, and Hunter-Saxton soliton equations. In the conclusion section, we sketch opportunities for future work that would apply the new Clebsch momentum map with $2$-cocycles derived here to investigate a new type of interplay among nonlinearity, dispersion and noise.
