This paper provides an extension of the constructive loop vertex expansion to stable matrix models with interactions of arbitrarily high order. We introduce a new representation for such models, then perform a forest expansion on this representation. It allows to prove that the perturbation series of the free energy for such models is analytic in a domain uniform in the size N of the matrix. Our method applies equally well to complex (rectangular) matrices and to Hermitian square matrices.
