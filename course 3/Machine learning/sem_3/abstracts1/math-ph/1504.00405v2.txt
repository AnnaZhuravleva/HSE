The homotheties of spherically symmetric spacetimes admitting $G_4$ , $G_6$ and $G_{10}$ as maximal isometry groups are already known, whereas for the space-times admitting $G_3$ as isometry groups, the solution in the form of differential constraints on metric coefficients requires further classification. For a class of spherically symmetric space-times admitting $G_3$ as maximal isometry groups without imposing any restriction on the stress-energy tensor, the metrics along with their corresponding homotheties are found. For the one case the metric is found along with its homothety vector that satisfies an additional constraint and is illustrated with the help of an example of a metric. For another case the metric and the corresponding homothety vector are found for a subclass of spherically symmetric space-times for which the differential constraint is reduced to separable form. Stress-energy tensor and related quantities of the metrics found are given in the relevant section.
