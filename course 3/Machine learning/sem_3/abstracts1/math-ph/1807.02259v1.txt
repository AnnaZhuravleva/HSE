Inspired by Okounkov's work [\emph{Selecta Mathematica}, 7(1):57--81, 2001] which relates KP hierarchy to determinant point process, we establish a relationship between BKP hierarchy and Pfaffian point process. We prove that the correlation function of the shifted Schur measures on strict partitions can be expressed as a Pfaffian of skew symmetric matrix kernel, whose elememts are certain vacuum expectations of neutral fermions. We further show that the matrix integrals solution of BKP hierarchy can also induce a certain Pfaffian point process.
