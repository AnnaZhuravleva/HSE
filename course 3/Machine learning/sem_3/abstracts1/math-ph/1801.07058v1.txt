We propose a general strategy to derive null-homotopy operators for differential complexes based on the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) construction and properties of the de Rham complex. Focusing on the elasticity complex, we derive path integral operators $\mathscr{P}$ for elasticity satisfying $\mathscr{D}\mathscr{P}+\mathscr{P}\mathscr{D}=\mathrm{id}$ and $\mathscr{P}^{2}=0$, where the differential operators $\mathscr{D}$ correspond to the linearized deformation, the linearized curvature and the divergence, respectively. As a special case, we rederive the classical Ces\`aro-Volterra path integral for strain tensors satisfying the Saint Venant compatibility condition, using the path integral for scalar potentials and techniques from homological algebra. The known path-independence of the Ces\`aro-Volterra path integral can thus be seen as a result of the corresponding property of differential 1-forms. In general we derive path integral formulas in the presence of defects.
