We develop a group theoretical formulation of SLE-type growth processes corresponding to Wess-Zumino-Witten theories, which makes it possible to construct stochastic differential equations associated with more general null vectors than ones considered in the most fundamental example in [ABI11]. We also give examples of SLE-type stochastic differential equations associated with null vectors of conformal weight $4$ in the basic representations of $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{2}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{3}$.
