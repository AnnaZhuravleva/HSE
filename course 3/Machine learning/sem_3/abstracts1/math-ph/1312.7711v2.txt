The equations of a relative equilibrium in a pure Yang--Mills gauge theory with the Coulomb gauge fixing are obtained. They are derived as a direct consequence of the results of our previous work on Wong's equations in gauge theory.The obtained equations are similar to the equations of a relative equilibrium in reducible finite-dimensional dynamical systems with a symmetry. In all these equations, the description of the reduced motion is performed by making use of the dependent coordinates.
