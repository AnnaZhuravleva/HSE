This work is devoted to dissipative extension theory for dissipative linear relations. We give a self-consistent theory of extensions by generalizing the theory on symmetric extensions of simmetric operators. Several results on the properties of dissipative relations are proven. Finally, we deal with the spectral properties of dissipative extensions of dissipative relations and provide results concerning particular realizations of this general setting.
