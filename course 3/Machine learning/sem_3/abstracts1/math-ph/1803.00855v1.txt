The partition functions of three-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories on different manifolds can be expressed as q-hypergeometric integrals. By comparing the partition functions of three-dimensional mirror dual theories, one finds complicated integral identities. In some cases, these identities can be written in the form of pentagon relations. Such identities often have an interpretation as the Pachner's 3-2 move for triangulated manifolds via the so-called 3d-3d correspondence. From the physics perspective, another important application of pentagon identities is that they may be used to construct new solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation.
