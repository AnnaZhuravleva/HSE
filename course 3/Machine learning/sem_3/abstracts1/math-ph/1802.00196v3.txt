A parametrization of 3x3 unitary matrices is presented. This mathematical approach is inspired on polarization algebra and is formulated through the identification of a set of three orthonormal three-dimensional Jones vectors representing the respective pure polarization states. This approach leads to the representation of a 3x3 unitary matrix as an orthogonal similarity transformation of a particular type of unitary matrix that depends on six independent parameters, while the remaining three parameters correspond to the orthogonal matrix of the said transformation. The results obtained are applied to determine the structure of the second component of the characteristic decomposition of a 3x3 positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix.
