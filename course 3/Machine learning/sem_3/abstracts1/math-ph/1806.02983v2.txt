The Classical and Quantum mechanical correspondence for constant mass settings is used, along with some nonlocal point transformation, to find the position-dependent mass (PDM) Classical and Quantum Hamiltonians. The comparison between the resulting Quantum PDM-Hamiltonian and the von Roos PDM-Hamiltonian implied that the ordering ambiguity parameters of von Roos are strictly determined. Eliminating, in effect, the ordering ambiguity associated with the von Roos PDM-Hamiltonian. This, consequently, played a vital role in the construction/identification of the PDM-momentum operator. The same recipe is followed to identify the form of the minimal coupling of electromagnetic interactions for the Classical and Quantum PDM-Hamiltonians. It turned out that the minimal coupling of the electromagnetic interactions inherits the usual forms but with PDM-momentum (operator) rather than the usual momentum (operator). Two commonly used vector potential are considered as Illustrative examples.
