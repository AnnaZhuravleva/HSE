The generating function of the Bannai-Ito polynomials is derived using the fact that these polynomials are known to be essentially the Racah or $6j$ coefficients of the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. The derivation is carried in a realization of the recoupling problem in terms of three Dunkl oscillators.
