We show that the averaged equation for a one-frequency fast-oscillating system is the result of symplectic reduction of a certain natural Hamiltonian system with respect to an $S^1$-action. Furthermore, if the reduced configuration space happens to be a group, then under natural assumptions the averaged system is the Euler equation on a central extension of that group. This gives a new explanation of the drift, common in averaged system, as a similar shift is typically present in symplectic reductions and central extensions.
