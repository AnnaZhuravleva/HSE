A streamlined derivation of the Kac-Ward formula for the planar Ising model's partition function is presented and applied in relating the kernel of the Kac-Ward matrices' inverse with the correlation functions of the Ising model's order-disorder correlation functions. Used in the analysis is the formula's minor extension beyond planarity. A shortcut for both is enabled through the Bowen-Lanford graph zeta function relation.
