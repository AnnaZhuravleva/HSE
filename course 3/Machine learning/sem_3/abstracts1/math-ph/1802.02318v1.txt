We analyze the scalar products of the elliptic Felderhof model introduced by Foda-Wheeler-Zuparic as an elliptic extension of the trigonometric face-type Felderhof model by Deguchi-Akutsu. We derive the determinant formula for the scalar products by applying the Izergin-Korepin technique developed by Wheeler to investigate the scalar products of integrable lattice models. By combining the determinant formula for the scalar products with the recently-developed Izergin-Korepin technique to analyze the wavefunctions, we derive a Cauchy formula for elliptic Schur functions.
