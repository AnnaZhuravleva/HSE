In the last years several papers addressed the supposed spin-1 sector of the massive Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation restricted to (1+1) space-time dimensions. In this note we show explicitly that this is a misleading approach, since the DKP algebra in (1+1) dimensions admits only a spin-0 representation. Our result also is useful to understand why several recent papers found coincident results for both spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the DKP theory in (3+1) dimensions when the dynamics is restricted to one space dimension.
