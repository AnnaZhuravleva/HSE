We prove a Wegner estimate for discrete Schr\"odinger operators with a potential given by a Gaussian random process. The only assumption is that the covariance function decays exponentially, no monotonicity assumption is required. This improves earlier results where abstract conditions on the conditional distribution, compactly supported and non-negative, or compactly supported covariance functions with positive mean are considered.
