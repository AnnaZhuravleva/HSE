We study the supersymmetric partners of the harmonic oscillator with an infinite potential barrier at the origin and obtain the conditions under which it is possible to add levels to the energy spectrum of these systems. It is found that instead of the usual rule for non-singular potentials, where the order of the transformation corresponds to the maximum number of levels which can be added, now it is the integer part of half the order of the transformation which gives the maximum number of levels to be created.
