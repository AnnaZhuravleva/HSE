Littlewood-Richardson rule gives the decomposition formula for the multiplication of two Schur functions, while the decomposition formula for the multiplication of two Hall-Littlewood functions or two universal characters is also given by the combinatorial method. In this paper, using the vertex operator realizations of these symmetric functions, we construct the algebraic forms of these decomposition formulas.
