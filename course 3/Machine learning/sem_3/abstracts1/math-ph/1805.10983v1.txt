Lie symmetry method is applied to investigate symmetries of the combined KdV-nKdV equation, that is a new integrable equation by combining the KdV equation and negative order KdV equation. Symmetries which are obtained in this article, are further helpful for reducing the combined KdV-nKdV equation into ordinary differential equation. Moreover, a set of eight invariant solutions for combined KdV-nKdV equation is obtained by using proposed method. Out of the eight solutions so obtained in which two solutions generate progressive wave solutions, five are singular solutions and one multisoliton solutions which is in terms of WeierstrassZeta function.
