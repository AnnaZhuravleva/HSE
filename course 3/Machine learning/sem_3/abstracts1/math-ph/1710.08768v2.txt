The Lie symmetry classification of the known three-component reaction-diffusion system modelling the spread of an initially localized population of farmers into a region occupied by hunter-gatherers is derived. The Lie symmetries obtained for reducing the system in question to systems of ODEs and constructing exact solutions are applied. Several exact solutions of traveling front type are found, their properties are identified and biological interpretation is discussed.
