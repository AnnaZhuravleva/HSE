This study shows how Aronszajn's theory of reproducing kernels allows us to construct the Hilbert spaces of quantum theory. We show that the Feynman propagator is an example of a reproducing kernel under a boundedness condition. To every Lagrangian thus corresponds a Hilbert space that does not need to be postulated \emph{a priori}. For the free non-relativistic particle, we justify mathematically the concept of space-time granularity. Reproducing kernels allow for a functional, rather than distributional, description of the Hilbert spaces of quantum theory, including the Fock space.
