We present a family of unitary irreducible representations of SU(2) realized in the plane, in terms of the Laguerre polynomials. These functions are similar to the spherical harmonics defined on the sphere. Relations with an space of square integrable functions defined on the plane, $L^2(\R^2)$, are analyzed. We have also enlarged this study using rigged Hilbert spaces that allow to work with iscrete and continuous bases like is the case here.
