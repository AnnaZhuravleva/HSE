We give a proof of perturbative renormalizability of SU(2) Yang--Mills theory in four-dimensional Euclidean space which is based on the Flow Equations of the renormalization group. The main motivation is to present a proof which does not make appear mathematically undefined objects (as for example dimensionally regularized generating functionals), which permits to parametrize the theory in terms of {\it physical} renormalization conditions, and which allows to control the singularities of the correlation functions of the theory in the infrared domain. Thus a large part of the proof is dedicated to bounds on massless correlation functions.
