We discuss new results related to the generalized discrete $q$-Hermite II polynomials $ \tilde h_{n,\alpha}(x;q)$, introduced by Mezlini and al in 2014. Our aim is to give a continuous orthogonality relation, a q-integral representation and an evaluation at one of the Poisson Kernel, for these polynomials. Moreover, we give the raising and lowering operator algebra, corresponding to these polynomials. Our results generate a new explicit realization of quantum algebra, using the generators associated with a q-deformed generalized parabose oscillator.
