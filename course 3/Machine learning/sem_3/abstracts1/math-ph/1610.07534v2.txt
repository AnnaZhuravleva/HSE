For a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we derive a simple algorithm for computing logarithmic derivatives of tau-functions of Drinfeld--Sokolov hierarchy of $\mathfrak{g}$-type in terms of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued resolvents. We show, for the topological solution to the lowest-weight-gauge Drinfeld--Sokolov hierarchy of $\mathfrak{g}$-type, the resolvents evaluated at zero satisfy the $\textit{topological ODE}$.
