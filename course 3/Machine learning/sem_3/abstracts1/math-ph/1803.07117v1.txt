We provide an upper bound on the maximal entropy rate at which the entropy of the expected density operator of a given ensemble of two states changes under nonlocal unitary evolution. A large class of entropy measures in considered, which includes Renyi and Tsallis entropies. The result is derived from a general bound on the trace-norm of a commutator, which can be expected to find other implementations. We apply this result to bound the maximal rate at which quantum dynamics can generate entanglement in a bipartite closed system with Renyi and Tsallis entanglement entropy taken as measures of entanglement in the system.
