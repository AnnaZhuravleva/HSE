We consider a nonlinear Schr\"odinger system arising in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with attractive intraspecies interactions and repulsive interspecies interactions in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We get ground states of this system by solving a constrained minimization problem. For some kinds of trapping potentials, we prove that the minimization problem has a minimizer if and only if the attractive interaction strength $a_i (i=1,2)$ of each component of the BEC system is strictly less than a threshold $a^*$. %attractive intraspecies interactions satisfies $a_i< %a^*= \|Q\|_2^2,\ i=1,\,2$, where $Q$ is the unique positive radial solution of $\Delta u-u+u^3=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$; in contrast, there is no minimizer if either $a_i > a^*$ for $i=1$ or $2$, or $a_1=a_2=a^*$. Furthermore, as $(a_1, a_2)\nearrow (a^*, a^*)$, the asymptotical behavior for the minimizers of the minimization problem is discussed. Our results show that each component of the BEC system concentrates at a global minimum of the associated trapping potential.
