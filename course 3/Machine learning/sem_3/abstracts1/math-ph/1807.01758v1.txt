We construct a path integral based on the coupling of the Liouville action and the Mabuchi K-energy on a one-dimensional complex manifold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first rigorous construction of such an object and this is done by means of probabilistic tools. Both functionals play an important role respectively in Riemannian geometry (in the case of surfaces) and K\"ahler geometry. As an output, we obtain a path integral whose Weyl anomaly displays the standard Liouville anomaly plus an additional K-energy term. Motivations come from theoretical physics where these type of path integrals arise as a model for fluctuating metrics on surfaces when coupling (small) massive perturbations of conformal field theories to quantum gravity as advocated by A. Bilal, F. Ferrari, S. Klevtsov and S. Zelditch. Interestingly, our computations show that quantum corrections perturb the classical Mabuchi K-energy and produce a quantum Mabuchi K-energy: this type of correction is reminiscent of the quantum Liouville theory. Our construction is probabilistic and relies on a variant of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC), the Derivative GMC (DGMC for short). The technical backbone of our construction consists in two estimates on (derivative and standard) GMC which are of independent interest in probability theory. Firstly, we show that these DGMC random variables possess negative exponential moments and secondly we derive optimal small deviations estimates for the GMC associated with a recentered Gaussian Free Field.
