In this article we first correct a recent misconception about a topology that was suggested by Zeeman as a possible alternative to his Fine topology. This misconception appeared while trying to establish the causality in the ambient boundary-ambient space cosmological model. We then show that this topology is actually the intersection topology (in the sense of G.M. Reed) between the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}^4$ and the order topology whose order, namely horismos, is defined on the light cone. Last, but not least, we show that the order topology from horismos belongs to the class of Zeeman topologies. These results accelerate the need for a deeper and more systematic study of the global topological properties of spacetime manifolds.
