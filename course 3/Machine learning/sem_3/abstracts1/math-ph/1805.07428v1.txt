Motivated by hyperbolic metamaterials we study the quantum dynamics of a non-relativistic particle restricted to move on a surface $S$ in a three-dimensional medium with Minkowski effective geometry. Like in the well-known Euclidean case, we find an effective geometry-induced potential, $V_S = - \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m} \left(\varepsilon H^2-K\right)$, with the usual dependence on the mean ($H$) and Gaussian ($K$) curvatures of the surface, but with the remarkable difference of a dependence on the causal character of the surface ($\varepsilon$). We make applications to surfaces of revolution and, in particular, present examples where the Schr\"odinger equation is exactly solvable.
