In this paper, we present an eleven invariant isotropic irreducible function basis of a third order three-dimensional symmetric tensor. This irreducible function basis is a proper subset of the Olive-Auffray minimal isotropic integrity basis of that tensor. The octic invariant and a sextic invariant in the Olive-Auffray integrity basis are dropped out. This result is of significance to the further research of irreducible function bases of higher order tensors.
