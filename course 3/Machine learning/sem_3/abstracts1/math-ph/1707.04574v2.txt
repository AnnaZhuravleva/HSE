We consider intertwining relations of the augmented $q$-Onsager algebra introduced by Ito and Terwilliger, and obtain generic (diagonal) boundary $K$-operators in terms of the Cartan element of $U_{q}(sl_2)$. These $K$-operators solve reflection equations. Taking appropriate limits of these $K$-operators in Verma modules, we derive $K$-operators for Baxter Q-operators and corresponding reflection equations.
