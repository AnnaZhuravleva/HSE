We consider the two dimensional focusing Davey-Stewartson II system and construct the global solution of the Cauchy problem for a dense in $L^2(\mathbb C)$ set of initial data. We do not assume that the initial data is small. So, the solutions may have singularities. We show that the blow-up may occur only on a real analytic variety and the variety is bounded in each strip $t \leq T$.
