R. Hirota and K. Kimura discovered integrable discretizations of the Euler and the Lagrange tops, given by birational maps. Their method is a specialization to the integrable context of a general discretization scheme introduced by W. Kahan and applicable to any vector field with a quadratic dependence on phase variables. We report several novel observations regarding integrability of the Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretization. For several of the most complicated cases for which integrability is known (Clebsch system, Kirchhoff system, and Lagrange top),   - we give nice compact formulas for some of the more complicated integrals of motion and for the density of the invariant measure, and   - we establish the existence of higher order Wronskian Hirota-Kimura bases, generating the full set of integrals of motion.   While the first set of results admits nice algebraic proofs, the second one relies on computer algebra.
