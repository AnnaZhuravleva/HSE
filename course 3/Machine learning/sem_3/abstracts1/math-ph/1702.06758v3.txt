We revisit the well known Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS) for a 1-D Pseudo-differential self-adjoint Hamiltonian within the algebraic and microlocal framework of Helffer and Sj\"ostrand; BS holds precisely when the Gram matrix consisting of scalar products of some WKB solutions with respect to the "flux norm" is not invertible. The interest of this procedure lies in its possible generalization to matrix-valued Hamiltonians, like Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. It is simplified in the scalar case by using action-angle variables.
