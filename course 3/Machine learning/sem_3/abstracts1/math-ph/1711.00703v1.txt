We consider the linearized Korteweg-de-Vries equa- tions, sometimes called Airy equation, on general metric graphs with edge lengths bounded away from zero. We show that pro- perties of the induced dynamics can be obtained by studying boundary operators in the corresponding boundary space indu- ced by the vertices of the graph. In particular, we characterize unitary dynamics and contractive dynamics. We demonstrate our results on various special graphs, including those recently treated in the literature.
