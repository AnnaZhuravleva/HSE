In this work, we present stability results for breather solutions of the 5th and 7th order mKdV equations. We show that these higher order mKdV breathers are stable in $H^2$, in the same way than classical mKdV breathers. We also show that breather solutions of the 5th and 7th order mKdV equations satisfy the same stationary fourth order nonlinear elliptic equation than the mKdV breather, independently of the order, 5th or 7th, considered.
