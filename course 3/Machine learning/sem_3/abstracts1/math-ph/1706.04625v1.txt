We investigate certain properties of $\mathfrak{su}(N)$-valued two-dimensional soliton surfaces associated with the integrable $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ sigma models constructed by the orthogonal rank-one Hermitian projectors, which are defined on the two-dimensional Riemann sphere with finite action functional. Several new properties of the projectors mapping onto one-dimensional subspaces as well as their relations with three mutually different immersion formulas, namely, the generalized Weierstrass, Sym-Tafel and Fokas-Gel'fand have been discussed in detail. Explicit connections among these three surfaces are also established by purely analytical descriptions and, it is demonstrated that the three immersion formulas actually correspond to the single surface parametrized by some specific conditions.
