In this paper we study factorization formulae for the Lax matrices of the classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider and Calogero-Moser models. We review the already known results and discuss their possible origins. The first origin comes from the IRF-Vertex relations and the properties of the intertwining matrices. The second origin is based on the Schlesinger transformations generated by modifications of underlying vector bundles. We show that both approaches provide explicit formulae for $M$-matrices of the integrable systems in terms of the intertwining matrices (and/or modification matrices). In the end we discuss the Calogero-Moser models related to classical root systems. The factorization formulae are proposed for a number of special cases.
