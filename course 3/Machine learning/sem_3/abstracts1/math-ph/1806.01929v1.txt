This work is concerned about introducing two new 1D and 3D confined potentials and presenting their solutions using the Tridiagonal Representation Approach (TRA). The wavefunction is written as a series in terms of square integrable basis functions which are expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials. Moreover, the expansion coefficients are written in terms of new orthogonal polynomials that were introduced recently by Alhaidari as discussed in the main text. However, the analytical properties of those polynomials are yet to be derived. Moreover, we have computed the numerical eigen energies for both potentials by considering different choice of the potential parameters as in tables.
