We make a systematic study of standard $f$-divergences in general von Neumann algebras. An important ingredient of our study is to extend Kosaki's variational expression of the relative entropy to an arbitary standard $f$-divergence, from which most of the important properties of standard $f$-divergences follow immediately. In a similar manner we give a comprehensive exposition on the R\'enyi divergence in von Neumann algebra. Some results on relative hamiltonians formerly studied by Araki and Donald are improved as a by-product.
