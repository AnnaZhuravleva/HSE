Let us consider a many-body Boson system where the particles experience a short-range two-body interparticle interaction given by $v_N(x) = N^{3\beta}v(N^\beta x)$ with $v \in C^\infty_0$, without specifying a definite sign on $v$, for some range of the scaling parameter $\beta$. Our main goal is to extend the results of Grillakis, Machedon, and Kuz in Commun. Math. Phys., (2013) and Differential Integral Equations, (2017) regarding the second-order correction to mean field evolution of coherent states in the Fock space to the case of attractive interaction for $0<\beta<\frac{1}{2}$. The two key ingredients in our extension to this case of indefinite sign potentials are the proofs of the uniform existence of global solutions to a family of Hartree-type equations and the corresponding $L^\infty$-decay estimates on the solutions. Inspired by the recent works of X. Chen \& J. Holmer, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., (2016) and Int. Math. Res. Notices, (2016), we also provided both a derivation of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) in $3$D from the many-body Boson system and a rate of convergence toward mean-field. In particular, we provided two derivations of the focusing NLS using both the pair excitation method and a method introduced by Pickl. For the latter method, we prove a regularity condition for the solution to the NLS which subsequently feeds into the works of Pickl, J. Stat. Phys., (2010) and Lett. Math. Phys. (2011).
