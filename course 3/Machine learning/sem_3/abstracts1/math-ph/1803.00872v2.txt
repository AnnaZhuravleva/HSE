We construct Hamiltonians for systems of nonrelativistic particles linearly coupled to massive scalar bosons using abstract boundary conditions. The construction yields an explicit characterisation of the domain of self-adjointness in terms of boundary conditions that relate sectors with different numbers of bosons. We treat both models in which the Hamiltonian may be defined as a form perturbation of the free operator, such as Fr\"ohlich's polaron, and renormalisable models, such as the massive Nelson model.
