We show that the Heun confluent equation admits infinitely many solutions in terms of the confluent generalized hypergeometric functions. For each of these solutions a characteristic exponent of a regular singularity of the Heun confluent equation is a non-zero integer and the accessory parameter obeys a polynomial equation. Each of the solutions can be written as a linear combination with constant coefficients of a finite number of either the Kummer confluent hypergeometric functions or the Bessel functions.
