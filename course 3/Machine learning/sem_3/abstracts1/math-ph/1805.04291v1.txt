The defining characteristic of an exceptional point (EP) in the parameter space of a family of operators is that upon encircling the EP eigenstates are permuted. As permutations of three or more objects form a non-abelian group, the question arises whether one can experimentally demonstrate this non-commutative behavior. This requires at least two EPs of a family of operators that have at least 3 eigenstates. Encircling two or more EPs poses the question of how to compose and combine the permutations. We address this problem using the theory of fundamental groups which also has a simple generalization to higher dimensional degeneracy structures like exceptional lines in a three-dimensional parameter space. A concrete implementation in a recently proposed $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric waveguide system is suggested as an example of how to experimentally show the non-abelian nature of non-hermitian systems with multiple EPs.
