Notions and results from quantum harmonic analysis, such as the convolution between functions and operators or between two operators, is identified as the appropriate setting for Berezin quantization and Berezin-Lieb inequalities. Based on this insight we provide a rigorous approach to generalized phase-space representation introduced by Klauder-Skagerstam and their variants of Berezin-Lieb inequalities in this setting. Hence our presentation of the results of Klauder-Skagerstam gives a more conceptual framework, which yields as a byproduct an interesting perspective on the connection between Berezin quantization and Weyl quantization.
