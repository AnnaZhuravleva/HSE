The Lie group generated by the Lie algebra of $\kappa$-Minkowski space is considered. The condition of invariance under diffeomorphisms induced by group multiplication singles out a unique metric associated to this group. This metric is identified as the metric of de Sitter space-time in planar coordinates. The matrix basis of the Hilbert-Schmidt operators in the irreducible representation of the group associated to $\kappa$-Minkowski space is established and used for the construction of the non-commutative (matrix) variant of de Sitter space-time.
