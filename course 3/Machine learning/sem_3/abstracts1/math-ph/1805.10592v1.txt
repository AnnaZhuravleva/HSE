A geometric description of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is proposed. This MCMC method mimics an extended MCMC method, and consists of a continuous-time dynamical system expressing time-development of observables. Here such observables are expectation values of quantities and parameters including temperature. To geometrize this MCMC method, information geometry is used for expressing equilibrium states or equivalently target states, and contact geometry is used for expressing nonequilibrium states. Here time-developments of the observables are identified with contact Hamiltonian vector fields. Also, it is shown that the convergence rate of this MCMC method is exponential.
