In this article, we study the Kapustin-Witten equations on a closed, simply-connected, four-manifold. We using a compactness theorem due to Taubes to prove that if $(A,\phi)$ is a solution of Kapustin-Witten equations and the connection $A$ is closed to a $generic$ ASD connection $A_{\infty}$, then $(A,\phi)$ must be a trivial solution. We also prove that the moduli space of the solutions of Kapustin-Witten equations is non-connected if the connections on the compactification of moduli space of ASD connections are all $generic$. As one application, we extend the ideas of Kapustin-Witten equations to other equations on gauge theory-- Hitchin-Simpson equations and Vafa-Witten on compact K\"{a}hler surface with a K\"{a}hler metric $g$.
