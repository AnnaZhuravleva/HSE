In this paper, we propose an extension of quantum searches on graphs driven by quantum walks to simplicial complexes. To this end, we newly define a quantum walk on simplicial complex which is an alternative of preceding studies by authors. We show that the quantum search on the specific simplicial complex corresponding to the triangulation of $n$-dimensional unit square driven by this new simplicial quantum walk works well, namely, a marked simplex can be found with probability $1+o(1)$ with in a time $O(\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is the number of simplices with the dimension of marked simplex.
