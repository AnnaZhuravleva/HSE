We consider a magnetostatic problem in a 3D "cylindrical" domain of Koch type. We prove existence and uniqueness results for both the fractal and pre-fractal problems and we investigate the convergence of the pre-fractal solutions to the limit fractal one. We consider the numerical approximation of the pre-fractal problems via FEM and we prove a priori error estimates. Some numerical simulations are also shown. Our long term motivation includes studying problems that appear in quantum physics in fractal domains.
