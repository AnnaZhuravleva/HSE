We give an upper bound of the relative entanglement entropy of the ground state of a massive Dirac-Majorana field across two widely separated regions $A$ and $B$ in a static slice of an ultrastatic Lorentzian spacetime. Our bound decays exponentially in $dist (A, B)$, at a rate set by the Compton wavelength and the spatial scalar curvature. The physical interpretation our result is that, on a manifold with positive spatial scalar curvature, one cannot use the entanglement of the vacuum state to teleport one classical bit from $A$ to $B$ if their distance is of the order of the maximum of the curvature radius and the Compton wave length or greater.
