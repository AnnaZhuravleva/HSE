Motivated by Wick-rotations of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, we study real geometric invariant theory (GIT) and compatible representations. We extend some of the results from earlier works \cite{W2,W1}, in particular, we give sufficient and necessary conditions for when pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are Wick-rotatable to other signatures. For arbitrary signatures, we consider a Wick-rotatable pseudo-Riemannian manifold with closed $O(p,q)$-orbits, and thus generalise the existence condition found in \cite{W1}. Using these existence conditions we also derive an invariance theorem for Wick-rotations of arbitrary signatures.
