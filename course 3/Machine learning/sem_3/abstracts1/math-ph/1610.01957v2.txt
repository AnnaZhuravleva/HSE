We analize the Berry-Keating model and the Sierra and Rodr\'iguez-Laguna Hamiltonian within the polymeric quantization formalism. By using the polymer representation, we obtain for both models, the associated polymeric quantum Hamiltonians and the corresponding stationary wave functions. The self-adjointness condition provide a proper domain for the Hamiltonian operator and the energy spectrum, which turned out to be dependent on an introduced scale parameter. By performing a counting of semiclassical states, we prove that the polymer representation reproduces the smooth part of the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula, and introduces a correction depending on the energy and the scale parameter, which resembles the fluctuation behavior of the Riemann zeros.
