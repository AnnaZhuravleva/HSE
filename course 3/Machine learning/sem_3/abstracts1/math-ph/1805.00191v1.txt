We consider a 3D quantum system of $N$ identical bosons interacting via gravitational potential with the attractive interaction strength $a_N/N$. We investigate the blow-up behavior of ground state energy and ground states in the limit $N\to\infty$ when $a_N$ approaches a critical number $a^*$ (Chandrasekhar limit). The blow-up profile of the many-body system is given by optimizers of Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequality.
