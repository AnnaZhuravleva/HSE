We first characterize a set that the solution to the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation for superconductivity belongs to. Each element of the set is smooth and monotone decreasing with respect to the temperature, and also has certain behavior at the transition temperature. Under the condition that the solution belongs to the set, we then deal with the thermodynamic potential and show that the transition to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition. Here we have no magnetic fields. Moreover we obtain the exact and explicit expression for the gap in the specific heat at constant volume at the transition temperature. Without the condition, we show that the BCS-Bogoliubov model hardly leads to the second-order phase transition in superconductivity. In this way we show that the condition above is a sufficient condition for the second-order phase transition in the BCS-Bogoliubov model.
