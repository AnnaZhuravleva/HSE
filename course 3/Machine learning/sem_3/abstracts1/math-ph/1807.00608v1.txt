We analytically study the long time and large space asymptotics of a new broad class of solutions of the KdV equation introduced by Dyachenko, Zakharov, and Zakharov. These solutions are characterized by a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we show arises as the limit $N\nearrow + \infty$ of a gas of $N$-solitons. We establish an asymptotic description for large times that is valid over the entire spatial domain, in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions.
