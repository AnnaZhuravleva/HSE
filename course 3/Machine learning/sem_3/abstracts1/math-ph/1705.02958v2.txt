We propose a simple injective resolution for the Hochschild complex of the Weyl algebra. By making use of this resolution, we derive explicit expressions for nontrivial cocycles of the Weyl algebra with coefficients in twisted bimodules as well as for the smash products of the Weyl algebra and a finite group of linear symplectic transformations. A relationship with the higher-spin field theory is briefly discussed.
