We consider random stochastic matrices $M$ with elements given by $M_{ij}=|U_{ij}|^2$, with $U$ being uniformly distributed on one of the classical compact Lie groups or some of the associated symmetric spaces. We observe numerically that, for large dimensions, the spectral statistics of $M$ (discarding the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue $1$) are similar to those of the Gaussian Orthogonal ensemble for symmetric matrices and to those of the real Ginibre ensemble for non-symmetric matrices. We approach such spectral statistics by using Weingarten functions and establish connections with some difficult enumerative problems involving permutations.
