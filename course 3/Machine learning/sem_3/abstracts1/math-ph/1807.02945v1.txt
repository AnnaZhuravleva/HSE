We show that the closed Dyson-Schwinger equation for the 2-point function of the noncommutative $\lambda \phi^4_2$-model can be rearranged into the boundary value problem $\Psi(a+,b+)\Psi(a-,b-)=\Psi(a+,b-)\Psi(a-,b+)$ for a sectionally holomorphic function $\Psi$. This expresses the 2-point function as Hilbert transform of an angle function which itself satisfies a highly non-linear integral equation. A solution of that equation as formal power series in $\lambda$ shows a surprisingly simple structure. The solution to 10th order is matched by Stirling numbers of the first kind. Its extrapolation to all orders is resummed with the Lagrange-B\"urmann formula to Lambert-W. This leads to an explicit exact formula of the 2-point function, real-analytic at any coupling constant $\lambda>-1/(2\log 2)$, in terms of Lambert-W.
