One encounters iterated elliptic integrals in the study of Hall effect devices, as a result of conformal mappings of Schwarz--Christoffel type. Some of these double elliptic integrals possess amazing symmetries with regard to the physical parameters of the underlying Hall effect devices. We give a unified mathematical treatment of such symmetric double integrals, in the context of Hall effect devices with three and four contacts.
