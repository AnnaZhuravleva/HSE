The asymptotic behavior of the solution of an infinite set of Smoluchowski's discrete coagulation-fragmentation-diffusion equations with non-homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, defined in a periodically perforated domain, is analyzed. Our homogenization result, based on Nguetseng-Allaire two-scale convergence, is meant to pass from a microscopic model (where the physical processes are properly described) to a macroscopic one (which takes into account only the effective or averaged properties of the system). When the characteristic size of the perforations vanishes, the information given on the microscale by the non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is transferred into a global source term appearing in the limiting (homogenized) equations. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the geometric structure of the perforated domain induces a correction in the diffusion coefficients.
