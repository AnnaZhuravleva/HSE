A two body rational Calogero model with balanced loss and gain is investigated. The system yields a Hamiltonian which is symmetric under the combined operation of parity (P) and time reversal (T ) symmetry. It is shown that the system is integrable and exact, stable classical solutions are obtained for particular ranges of the parameters. The corresponding quantum system admits bound state solutions for exactly the same ranges of the parameters for which the classical solutions are stable. The eigen spectra of the system is presented with a discussion on the normalization of the wave functions in proper Stokes wedges. Finally, the Calogero model with balanced loss and gain is studied classically, when the pair-wise harmonic interaction term is replaced by a common confining harmonic potential. The system admits stable solutions for particular ranges of the parameters. However, the integrability and/or exact solvability of the system is obscure due to the presence of the loss and gain terms. The perturbative solutions are obtained and are compared with the numerical results.
