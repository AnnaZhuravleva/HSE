We come up with infinite-dimensional prequantum line bundles and moment map interpretations of three different sets of equations - the generalised Monge-Amp`ere equation, the almost Hitchin system, and the Calabi-Yang-Mills equations. These are all perturbations of already existing equations. Our construction for the generalised Monge-Amp`ere equation is conditioned on a conjecture from algebraic geometry. In addition, we prove that for small values of the perturbation parameters, some of these equations have solutions.
