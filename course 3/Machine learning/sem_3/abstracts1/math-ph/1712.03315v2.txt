This work constructs a class of non-symmetric periodic Schr\"odinger operators on metric graphs (quantum graphs) whose Fermi, or Floquet, surface is reducible. The Floquet surface at an energy level is an algebraic set that describes all complex wave vectors admissible by the periodic operator at the given energy. The graphs in this study are obtained by coupling two identical copies of a periodic quantum graph by edges to form a bilayer graph. Reducibility of the Floquet surface for all energies ensues when the coupling edges have potentials belonging to the same asymmetry class. Two potentials are said to be in the same asymmetry class if their spectral A-functions $a(\lambda)$, defined in the article, are identical. Symmetric potentials have $a(\lambda)\equiv0$. If the potentials of the connecting edges belong to different asymmetry classes, then typically the Floquet surface is not reducible. Bilayer graphene is a notable exception. Its Floquet surface is the zero set of a single composite variable and therefore is always factorable.
