A nonlinear operator equation equivalent to Babenko's equation (see \citealt{KD}) is derived and investigated. Operators of the proposed equation depend on the parameter equal to the mean depth of water, whereas each of its solutions defines a parametric representation of the free surface profile in the problem of two-dimensional, periodic, steady waves on water of finite depth in the absence of surface tension. Bifurcation curves for the equation are obtained.
