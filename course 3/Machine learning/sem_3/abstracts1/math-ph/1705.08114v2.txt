We propose a convenient orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space for the Izergin-Korepin model (or the quantum spin chain associated with the $A^{(2)}_{2}$ algebra). It is shown that the monodromy-matrix elements acting on the basis take relatively simple forms (c.f. acting on the original basis ), which is quite similar as that in the so-called F-basis for the quantum spin chains associated with $A$-type (super)algebras. As an application, we present the recursive expressions of Bethe states in the basis for the Izergin-Korepin model.
