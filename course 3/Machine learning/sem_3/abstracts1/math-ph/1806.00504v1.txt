Non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) describe particularly simple and stationary non-equilibrium situations. A possibility to obtain such states is to consider the asymptotic evolution of two infinite heat baths brought into thermal contact. In this work we generalise corresponding results of Doyon~et.~al. (J.\ Phys.\ A 18 (2015) no.9) for free Klein-Gordon fields in several directions. Our analysis is carried out directly at the level of correlation functions and in the algebraic approach to QFT. We discuss non-trivial chemical potentials, condensates, inhomogeneous linear models and homogeneous interacting ones. We shall not consider a sharp contact at initial time, but a smooth transition region. As a consequence, the states we construct will be of Hadamard type, and thus sufficiently regular for the perturbative treatment of interacting models. Our analysis shows that perturbatively constructed interacting NESS display thermodynamic properties similar to the ones of the NESS in linear models. In particular, perturbation theory appears to be insufficient to describe full thermalisation in non-linear QFT. Notwithstanding, we find that the NESS for linear and interacting models is stable under small perturbations, which is one of the characteristic features of equilibrium states.
