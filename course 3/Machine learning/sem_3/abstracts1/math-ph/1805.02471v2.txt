We apply a relation between matrix-valued complete Bernstein functions and matrix-valued Stieltjes functions to prove that certain convolution equations for matrix-valued functions have unique solutions in a special class of functions. In particular the cases of the viscoelastic duality theorem and the Sonine equation are discussed, with applications in anisotropic linear viscoelasticity and a generalization of fractional calculus.
