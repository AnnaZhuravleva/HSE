The local theory of complex fractal dimensions describes the oscillations in the geometry, spectra and dynamics of fractal strings. Such geometric oscillations can be seen most clearly in the explicit volume formula for the tubular neighborhoods of a $p$-adic fractal string $\mathcal{L}_p$, expressed in terms of the underlying complex fractal dimensions. The general fractal tube formula obtained in this paper is illustrated by several examples, including the nonarchimedean Fibonacci, Cantor and Euler strings.   Moreover, we show that the Minkowski dimension of a $p$-adic fractal string coincides with the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string, as well as with the growth rate of the corresponding geometric counting function. The proof of this new result is applicable to both real and $p$-adic fractal strings and hence, yields a unifying explanation of a key result in the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings, even in the real archimedean case.
