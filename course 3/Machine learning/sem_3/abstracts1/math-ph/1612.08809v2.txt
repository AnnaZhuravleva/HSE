The 1-arm exponent $\rho$ for the ferromagnetic Ising model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the critical exponent that describes how fast the critical 1-spin expectation at the center of the ball of radius $r$ surrounded by plus spins decays in powers of $r$. Suppose that the spin-spin coupling $J$ is translation-invariant, $\mathbb{Z}^d$-symmetric and finite-range. Using the random-current representation and assuming the anomalous dimension $\eta=0$, we show that the optimal mean-field bound $\rho\le1$ holds for all dimensions $d>4$. This significantly improves a bound previously obtained by a hyperscaling inequality.
