We study the interpolation Macdonald functions, remarkable inhomogeneous generalizations of Macdonald functions, and a sequence $A^1, A^2, \ldots$ of commuting operators that are diagonalized by them. Such a sequence of operators arises in the projective limit of finite families of commuting q-difference operators studied by Okounkov, Knop and Sahi. The main theorem is an explicit formula for the operators $A^k$. Our formula involves the family of Hall-Littlewood functions and a new family of inhomogeneous Hall-Littlewood functions, for which we give an explicit construction and identify as a degeneration of the interpolation Macdonald functions in the regime $q \rightarrow 0$. This article is inspired by the recent papers of Nazarov-Sklyanin on Macdonald and Sekiguchi-Debiard operators, and our main theorem is an extension of their results.
