We study topological properties of families of Hamiltonians which may contain degenerate energy levels aka. band crossings. The primary tool are Chern classes, Berry phases and slicing by surfaces. To analyse the degenerate locus, we study local models. These give information about the Chern classes and Berry phases. We then give global constraints for the topological invariants. This is an hitherto relatively unexplored subject. The global constraints are more strict when incorporating symmetries such as time reversal symmetries. The results can also be used in the study of deformations. We furthermore use these constraints to analyse examples which include the Gyroid geometry, which exhibits Weyl points and triple crossings and the honeycomb geometry with its two Dirac points.
