Associated to quantum affine general linear Lie superalgebras are two families of short exact sequences of representations whose first and third terms are irreducible: the Baxter TQ relations involving infinite-dimensional representations; the extended T-systems of Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules. We make use of these representations over the full quantum affine superalgebra to define Baxter operators as transfer matrices for the quantum integrable model and to deduce Bethe Ansatz Equations, under genericity conditions.
