A class of second-order differential equations commonly arising in physics applications are considered, and their explicit hypergeometric solutions are provided. Further, the relationship with the Generalized and Universal Associated Legendre Equations are examined and established. The hypergeometric solutions, presented in this work, will promote future investigations of their mathematical properties and applications to problems in theoretical physics.
