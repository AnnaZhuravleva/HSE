We consider the elastic field perturbation due to an inclusion for the anti-plane elasticity. The Eshelby conjecture asserts that if an inclusion induces a uniform field on the inclusion for probing by a uniform loading, then the inclusion should be an ellipse. In this paper we extend the Eshelby conjecture to domains of general shape. In particular, we show that for each $N\in\mathbb{N}$, an inclusion induces a uniform strain on the inclusion for a harmonic polynomial loading of degree $N$ if and only if the inclusion is a domain of negative order $N$, which is a simply connected bounded domain whose exterior conformal mapping is a Laurent series of a finite negative degree $N$.
