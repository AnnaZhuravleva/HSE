We explain how to perform topological twisting of supersymmetric field theories in the language of factorization algebras. Namely, given a supersymmetric factorization algebra with a choice of a topological supercharge we construct an algebra over the operad of little disks. We also explain the role of the twisting homomorphism allowing us to construct an algebra over the operad of framed little disks. Finally, we give a complete classification of topological supercharges and twisting homomorphisms in dimensions $1$ through $10$.
