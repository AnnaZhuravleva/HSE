We prove sharp spectral transition in the arithmetics of phase between localization and singular continuous spectrum for Diophantine almost Mathieu operators. We also determine exact exponential asymptotics of eigenfunctions and of corresponding transfer matrices throughout the localization region. This uncovers a universal structure in their behavior governed by the exponential phase resonances. The structure features a new type of hierarchy, where self-similarity holds upon alternating reflections.
