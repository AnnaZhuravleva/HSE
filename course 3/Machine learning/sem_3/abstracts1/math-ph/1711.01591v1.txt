The derivation of mean-field limits for quantum systems at zero temperature has attracted many researchers in the last decades. Recent developments are the consideration of pair correlations in the effective description, which lead to a much more precise description of both the ground state properties and the dynamics of the Bose gas in the weak coupling limit. While mean-field results typically allow a convergence result for the reduced density matrix only, one gets norm convergence when considering the pair correlations proposed by Bogoliubov in his seminal 1947 paper. In the present paper we consider an interacting Bose gas in the ground state with slight perturbations. We consider the case where the volume of the gas - in units of the support of the excitation - and the density of the gas tend to infinity simultaneously. We assume that the coupling constant is such that the self-interaction of the fluctuations is of leading order, which leads to a finite (non-zero) speed of sound in the gas. We show that the difference between the N-body description and the Bogoliubov description is small in $L^2$ as the density of the gas tends to infinity. In this situation the ratio of the occupation number of the ground-state and the excitation forming the fluctuations will influence the leading order of the dynamics of the system. In this sense we show the validity of the Bogoliubov time evolution in a situation where the temperature has an effect on the dynamics of the system.
