The invariants of solvable triangular Lie algebras with one nilindependent diagonal element are studied exhaustively. Bases of the invariant sets of all such algebras are constructed using an original algebraic algorithm based on Cartan's method of moving frames and the special technique developed for triangular and related algebras in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 40 (2007), 7557-7572]. The conjecture of Tremblay and Winternitz [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 34 (2001), 9085-9099] on the number and form of elements in the bases is completed and proved.
