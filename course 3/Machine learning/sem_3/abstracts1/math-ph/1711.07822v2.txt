It was shown recently that many of the Gustafson integrals appear in studies of the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ spin chain models. One can hope to obtain a generalization of the Gustafson integrals considering spin chain models with a different symmetry group. In this paper we analyse the spin magnet with the ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry group in case of open and periodic boundary conditions and derive several new integrals.
