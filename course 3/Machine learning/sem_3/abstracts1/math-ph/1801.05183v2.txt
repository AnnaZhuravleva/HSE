This article continues and completes our previous work J. Phys. Commun. 2 (2018) 025007. We present two methods of quantization associated with a linear connection given on a differentiable manifold. One of these is that presented in the mentioned article. In the final section the equivalence between both methods is demonstrated, as a consequence of a remarkable property of the Riemannian exponential.
