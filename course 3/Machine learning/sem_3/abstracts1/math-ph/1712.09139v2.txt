The notion of statistical amoeba of a partition function is extended through the introduction of constraints, so that the allowed choices of signs for exponential terms preserve particular properties. We focus on sums of determinantal type, and main attention is paid to a special class of soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) II equation. A characterization of the signatures preserving the determinantal form, as well as the signatures compatible with the KP II equation, is provided: both of them are reduced to choices of signs for columns and rows of a coefficient matrix, and they satisfy the whole KP hierarchy. Interpretations in term of statistical properties, geometric characteristics, and the relation with tropical limits are discussed.
