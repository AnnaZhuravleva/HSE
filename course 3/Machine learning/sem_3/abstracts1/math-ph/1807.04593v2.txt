In this paper the deformation quantization is constructed in the case of scalar fields on Minkowski space-time. We construct the star products at three level concerning fields, Hamiltonian functionals and their underlying structure called Hamiltonian functions in a special sense. Which mean the star products of fields, functionals, Hamiltonian functions, and ones between the fields and functionals. As bases of star products the Poisson brackets at different level are generalized, constructed and discussed in a systematical way, where the Poisson brackets like canonical and time-equal ones. For both of the star products and Poisson brackets the construction at level of Hamiltonian functions plays the essential role. Actually, the discussion for the case of Hamiltonian functions includes the key information about Poisson brackets and the star products in our approach. All of other Poisson brackets and star products in this paper are based on ones of Hamiltonian functions, and the Poisson brackets and the star products at three level are compatible. To discuss the Poisson brackets and the star products in the case of scalar fields, we introduce the notion of algebra of Euler-Lagrange operators which related to variation calculus closely.
