Representation theorems for both isotropic and anisotropic functions are of prime importance in both theoretical and applied mechanics. For third and fourth order tensors in the three-dimensional physical space, existing results are restricted to integrity bases. In this paper, as the first step to explore irreducible function bases of isotropic invariants of third and fourth order three-dimensional (completely) symmetric tensors, we show that the four invariant Smith-Bao minimal isotropic integrity basis of a third order three-dimensional symmetric and traceless tensor is also an irreducible function basis of that tensor. We further show that among the thirteen invariants of the Olive-Auffray minimal isotropic integrity basis of a third order three-dimensional symmetric tensor, there are six invariants which must be included in any irreducible function basis contained in the Olive-Auffray minimal isotropic integrity basis. Function bases of a fourth order three-dimensional symmetric and traceless tensor and a fourth order three-dimensional symmetric tensor are also studied.
