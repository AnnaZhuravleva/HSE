We consider an infinite chain of coupled harmonic oscillators with a Langevin thermostat at the origin. In the high frequency limit, we establish the reflection-transmission coefficients for the wave energy for the scattering of the thermostat. To our surprise, even though the thermostat fluctuations are time-dependent, the scattering does not couple wave energy at various frequencies.
