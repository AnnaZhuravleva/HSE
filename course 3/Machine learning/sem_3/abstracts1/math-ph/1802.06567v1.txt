Superintegrable systems with monopole interactions in flat and curved spaces have attracted much attention. For example, models in spaces with a Taub-NUT metric are well-known to admit the Kepler-type symmetries and provide non-trivial generalizations of the usual Kepler problems. In this paper, we overview new families of superintegrable Kepler, MIC-harmonic oscillator and deformed Kepler systems interacting with Yang-Coulomb monopoles in the flat and curved Taub-NUT spaces. We present their higher-order, algebraically independent integrals of motion via the direct and constructive approaches which prove the superintegrability of the models. The integrals form symmetry polynomial algebras of the systems with structure constants involving Casimir operators of certain Lie algebras. Such algebraic approaches provide a deeper understanding to the degeneracies of the energy spectra and connection between wave functions and differential equations and geometry.
