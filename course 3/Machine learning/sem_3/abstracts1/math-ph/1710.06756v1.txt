Stabilization, by deformation, of the Poincar\'{e}-Heisenberg algebra requires both the introduction of a fundamental lentgh and the noncommutativity of translations which is associated to the gravitational field. The noncommutative geometry structure that follows from the deformed algebra is studied both for the non-commutative tangent space and the full space with gravity. The contact points of this approach with the work of David Finkelstein are emphasized.
