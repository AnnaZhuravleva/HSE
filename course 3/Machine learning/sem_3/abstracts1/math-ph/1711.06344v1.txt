The purpose of this article is to investigate relations between W-superalgebras and integrable super-Hamiltonian systems. To this end, we introduce the generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov (D-S) reduction associated to a Lie superalgebra $g$ and its even nilpotent element $f$, and we find a new definition of the classical affine W-superalgebra $W(g,f,k)$ via the D-S reduction. This new construction allows us to find free generators of $W(g,f,k)$, as a differential superalgebra, and two independent Lie brackets on $W(g,f,k)/\partial W(g,f,k).$ Moreover, we describe super-Hamiltonian systems with the Poisson vertex algebras theory. A W-superalgebra with certain properties can be understood as an underlying differential superalgebra of a series of integrable super-Hamiltonian systems.
