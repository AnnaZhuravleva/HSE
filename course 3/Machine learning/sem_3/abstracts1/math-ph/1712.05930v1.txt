A general framework of non-perturbative quantum field theory on a curved background is presented. A quantum field theory is in this setting characterised by an embedding of a space of field configurations into a Hilbert space over $\mathbb{R}^\infty$. This embedding, which is only local up to a scale that we interpret as the Planck scale, coincides in the local and flat limit with the plane wave expansion known from canonical quantisation. We identify a universal Bott-Dirac operator acting in the Hilbert space over $\mathbb{R}^\infty$ and show that it gives rise to the free Hamiltonian both in the case of a scalar field theory and in the case of a Yang-Mills theory. These theories come with a canonical fermionic sector for which the Bott-Dirac operator also provides the Hamiltonian. We prove that these quantum field theories exist non-perturbatively for an interacting real scalar theory and for a general Yang-Mills theory, both with or without the fermionic sectors, and show that the free theories are given by semi-finite spectral triples over the respective configuration spaces. Finally, we propose a class of quantum field theories whose interactions are generated by inner fluctuations of the Bott-Dirac operator.
