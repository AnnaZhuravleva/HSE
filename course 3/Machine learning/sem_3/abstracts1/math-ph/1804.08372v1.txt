A mathematical model of autoresonance in nonlinear systems with combined parametric and external chirped frequency excitation is considered. Solutions with a growing amplitude and a bounded phase mismatch are associated with the autoresonant capture. By applying Lyapunov function method we investigate the conditions for the existence and stability of autoresonant modes and construct long-term asymptotics for stable solutions. In particular, we show that unstable regimes become stable when the system parameters pass through certain threshold values.
