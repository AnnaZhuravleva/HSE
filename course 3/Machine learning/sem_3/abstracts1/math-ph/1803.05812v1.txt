In this paper we analyse a family of models for a qubit interacting with a bosonic field. These models have a parity symmetry, which enables them to have a ground state even in some infrared irregular cases. In this paper we investigate this symmetry and consider higher order perturbations of field operators to any even order. We find the domain of selfadjointness and decompose the Hamiltonian into two fiber operators each defined on Fock space. We then prove an HVZ theorem for each operator under minimal conditions, and show that the ground state is always associated with the same fiber operator, while eigenvalues of the other fiber operator corresponds to exited states. Thus the problem of analysing the ground state and exited states is reduced to a simpler problem on Fock space.
