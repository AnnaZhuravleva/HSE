We present a general algorithm constructing a discretization of a classical field theory from a Lagrangian. We prove a new discrete Noether theorem relating symmetries to conservation laws and an energy conservation theorem not based on any symmetry. This gives exact conservation laws for several discrete field theories: electrodynamics, gauge theory, Klein-Gordon and Dirac ones. In particular, we construct a conserved discrete energy-momentum tensor, approximating the continuum one at least for free fields. The theory is stated in topological terms, such as coboundary and products of cochains.
