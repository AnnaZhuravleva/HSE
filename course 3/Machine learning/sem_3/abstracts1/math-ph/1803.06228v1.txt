This paper is a continuation of our previous work "Six-vertex model and non-linear differential equations I. Spectral problem" in which we have put forward a method for studying the spectrum of the six-vertex model based on non-linear differential equations. Here we intend to elaborate on that approach and also discuss properties of the spectrum unveiled by the aforementioned differential formulation of the transfer matrix's eigenvalue problem. In particular, we intend to demonstrate how this differential approach allows one to study continuous symmetries of the transfer matrix's spectrum through the Lie groups method.
