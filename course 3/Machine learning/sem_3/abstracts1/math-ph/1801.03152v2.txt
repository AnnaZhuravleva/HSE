We construct invariant measures associated to the integrals of motion of the periodic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNLS) for small data in $L^2$. For each integral of motion, we study the pull-back of the associated Gibbs measure through a suitable gauge transformation and show it is invariant along the conjugate flow map. This allows us to associate to each integral of motion a probability measure invariant along the DNLS flow.
