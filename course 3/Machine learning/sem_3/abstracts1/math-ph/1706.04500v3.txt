The photon diffusion equation is solved making use of the Born series for the Robin boundary condition. We develop a general theory for arbitrary domains with smooth enough boundaries and explore the convergence. The proposed Born series is validated by numerical calculation in the three-dimensional half space. It is shown that in this case the Born series converges regardless the value of the impedance term in the Robin boundary condition.
