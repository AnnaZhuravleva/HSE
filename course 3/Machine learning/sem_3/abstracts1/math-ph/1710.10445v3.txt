In this paper, classical perturbations against a stationary solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the general form of nonlinearity are examined. It is shown that in order to obtain correct (in particular, conserved over time) nonzero expressions for the basic integrals of motion of a perturbation, it is necessary to consider nonlinear equations of motion for the perturbations. It is also shown that, despite the nonlinearity of the perturbations, the additivity property is valid for the integrals of motion of different nonlinear modes forming the perturbation.
