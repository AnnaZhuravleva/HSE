The purpose of the present paper is to study the exceptional eigenvalues of the asymmetric quantum Rabi models (AQRM), specifically, to determine the degeneracy of the exceptional eigenstates. Exceptional eigenvalues are labelled by certain integers and are considered to be remains of the eigenvalues of the uncoupled bosonic mode (i.e. the quantum harmonic oscillator). There are two kind of exceptional eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H^{\epsilon}_{\text{Rabi}}$ of the AQRM: the Juddian, associated with polynomial, or quasi-exact, eigensolutions, and the non-Juddian exceptional. Here, $H^{\epsilon}_{\text{Rabi}}$ is defined by adding the fluctuation term $\epsilon \sigma_x$, with real $\epsilon$ and $\sigma_x$ being the Pauli matrix, to the Hamiltonian of the quantum Rabi model (QRM), breaking its $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry. An eigenvalue which is not exceptional is called regular and is always non-degenerate. We describe the constraint relations for allowing the model to have exceptional eigenvalues. The study of these relations helps us to obtain crucial information for the spectral degeneracy, in particular, the proof of the conjecture on constraint polynomials proposed by the third author. In fact, we prove that the spectrum of the AQRM possesses a degenerate eigenvalue if and only if the parameter $\epsilon$ is a half integer. Moreover, by an extensive study of constraint relations for the non-Juddian exceptional spectrum we show that the degeneracy occurs only among Juddian solutions, that is, non-Juddian exceptional eigenvalues do not contribute any degeneracy and we characterize exceptional eigenvalues by representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. Upon these results, we draw the whole picture of the spectrum of the AQRM. Furthermore, generating functions of constraint polynomials with their defining sequence from the viewpoints of confluent Heun equations are also discussed.
