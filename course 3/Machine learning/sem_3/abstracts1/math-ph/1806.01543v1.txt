We investigate the propagation of the scalar waves in the FLRW universes beginning with a Big Bang and ending with a Big Crunch, a Big Rip, a Big Brake or a Sudden Singularity. We obtain the sharp description of the asymptotics for the solutions of the linear Klein-Gordon equation, and similar results for the semilinear equation with a subcritical exponent. We prove that the number of cosmological particle creations is finite under general assumptions on the initial Big Bang and the final Big Crunch or Big Brake.
