We present here a novel method of computing spectral distances in doubled Moyal plane in a noncommutative geometrical framework using Dirac eigen-spinors, while solving the Lipschitz ball condition explicitly through matrices. The standard results of longitudinal, transverse and hypotenuse distances between different pairs of pure states have been computed and Pythagorean equality between them have been re-produced. The issue of non-unital nature of Moyal plane algebra is taken care of through a sequence of projection operators constructed from Dirac eigen-spinors, which plays a crucial role throughout this paper. At the end, a toy model of "Higgs field" has been constructed by fluctuating the Dirac operator and the variation on the transverse distance has been demonstrated, through an explicit computation.
