We consider Noether symmetries of the equations defined by the sections of characteristic line bundles of nondegenerate 1-forms and of the associated perturbed systems. It appears that this framework can be used for time-dependent systems with constraints and nonconservative forces, allowing a quite simple and transparent formulation of the momentum equation and the Noether theorem in their general forms.
