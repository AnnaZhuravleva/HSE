We use a Hamiltonian interacting particle system to derive a stochastic mean field system whose McKean-Vlasov equation yields the incompressible Navier Stokes equation. Since the system is Hamiltonian, the particle relabeling symmetry implies a Kelvin Circulation Theorem along stochastic Lagrangian paths. Moreover, issues of energy dissipation are discussed and the model is connected to other approaches in the literature.
