Quantum spaces with $\frak{su}(2)$ noncommutativity can be modelled by using a family of $SO(3)$-equivariant differential $^*$-representations. The quantization maps are determined from the combination of the Wigner theorem for $SU(2)$ with the polar decomposition of the quantized plane waves. A tracial star-product, equivalent to the Kontsevich product for the Poisson manifold dual to $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ is obtained from a subfamily of differential $^*$-representations. Noncommutative (scalar) field theories free from UV/IR mixing and whose commutative limit coincides with the usual $\phi^4$ theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ are presented. A generalization of the construction to semi-simple possibly non simply connected Lie groups based on their central extensions by suitable abelian Lie groups is discussed.
