Basically (2 + 1) dimensional Dirac equation with real deformed Lorentz scalar potential is investi gated in this study. The position dependent Fermi velocity function transforms Dirac Hamiltonian into a Klein-Gordon-like effective Hamiltonian system. The complex Hamiltonian and its real energy spectrum and eigenvectors are obtained analytically. Moreover, the Lie algebraic analysis is performed.
