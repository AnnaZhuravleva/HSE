This paper is concerned with developing an explicit correspondence between the quantum Yang-Baxter equation in star-triangle relation form, and the classical 3D-consistent quad equations in the Adler-Bobenko-Suris (ABS) classification. Each of the 3D-consistent asymmetric $H$-type ABS quad equations, including different $\delta,\varepsilon=0,1$ deformations, are explicitly derived from the quasi-classical expansion of a respective counterpart star-triangle relation. The interpretation of the different star-triangle relations is given in terms of known (hyperbolic/rational/classical) hypergeometric integrals. Limiting relations that exist between various star-triangle relations are given for each case.
