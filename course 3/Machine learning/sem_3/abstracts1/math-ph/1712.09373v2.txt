We consider the weak disorder limit of matrix products that arise in the analysis of disordered statistical mechanics systems, with a particular focus on random transfer matrices. The limit system is a diffusion model for which the leading Lyapunov exponent can be expressed explicitly in terms of modified Bessel functions, a formula that appears in the physical literature on these disordered systems. We provide an analysis of the diffusion system as well as of the link with the matrix products. We then apply the results to the framework considered by Derrida and Hilhorst in 1983, which deals in particular with the strong interaction limit for disordered Ising model in one dimension and that identifies a singular behavior of the Lyapunov exponent (of the transfer matrix), and to the two dimensional Ising model with columnar disorder (McCoy-Wu model). We show that the weak disorder limit sharply captures the Derrida and Hilhorst singularity. Moreover we revisit the analysis by McCoy and Wu and remark that it can be interpreted in terms of the diffusion limit approximation. We provide a mathematical analysis of the diffusive approximation of the free energy of the McCoy-Wu model, confirming the prediction (by McCoy and Wu) that, in this approximation, the free energy of the two dimensional Ising model with columnar disorder is $C^\infty$ but not analytic at the critical temperature.
