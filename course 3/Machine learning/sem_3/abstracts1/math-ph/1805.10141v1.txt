The density of a moderately dense gas evolving in a vacuum is given by the solution of an Enskog equation. Recently we have constructed in [ARS17] the stochastic process that corresponds to the Enskog equation under suitable conditions. The Enskog process is identified as the solution of a McKean-Vlasov equation driven by a Poisson random measure. In this work, we continue the study for a wider class of collision kernels that includes hard and soft potentials. Based on a suitable particle approximation of binary collisions, the existence of an Enskog process is established. In addition, it is shown that any reasonable solution to the Enskog equation is the time-marginal distribution of an Enskog process.
