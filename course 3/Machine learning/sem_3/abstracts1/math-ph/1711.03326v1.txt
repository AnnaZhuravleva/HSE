Following [7,8], we analyze regularity properties of single-site probability distributions of the random potential and of the Integrated Density of States (IDS) in the Anderson models with infinite-range interactions and arbitrary nontrivial probability distributions of the site potentials. In the present work, we study $2$-particle Anderson Hamiltonians on a lattice and prove spectral and strong dynamical localization at low energies, with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, for a class of site potentials featuring a power-law decay.
