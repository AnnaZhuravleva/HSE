We examine the integrability of two models used for the interaction of long and short waves in dispersive media. One is more classical but arguably cannot be derived from the underlying water wave equations, while the other one was recently derived. We use the method of Zakharov and Schulman to attempt to construct conserved quantities for these systems at different orders in the magnitude of the solutions. The coupled KdV-NLS model is shown to be nonintegrable, due to the presence of fourth-order resonances. A coupled real KdV - complex KdV system is shown to suffer the same fate, except for three special choices of the coefficients, where higher-order calculations or a different approach are necessary to conclude integrability or the absence thereof.
