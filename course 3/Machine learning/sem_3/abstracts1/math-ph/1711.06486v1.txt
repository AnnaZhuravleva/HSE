We develop a geometric approach to quantum mechanics based on the concept of the Tulczyjew triple. Our approach is genuinely infinite-dimensional and including a Lagrangian formalism in which self-adjoint (Schroedinger) operators are obtained as Lagrangian submanifolds associated with the Lagrangian. As a byproduct we obtain also results concerning coadjoint orbits of the unitary group in infinite dimension, embedding of the Hilbert projective space of pure states in the unitary group, and an approach to self-adjoint extensions of symmetric relations.
