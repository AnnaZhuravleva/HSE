We study motion of a charged particle confined to Dirichlet layer of a fixed width placed into a homogeneous magnetic field. If the layer is planar and the field is perpendicular to it the spectrum consists of infinitely degenerate eigenvalues. We consider translationally invariant geometric perturbations and derive several sufficient conditions under which a magnetic transport is possible, that is, the spectrum, in its entirety or a part of it, becomes absolutely continuous.
