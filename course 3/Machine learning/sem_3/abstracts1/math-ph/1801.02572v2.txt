We study the spectrum of a Laplacian on a periodic cuboidal (and generally hyperrectangular) lattice graph with $\delta$ couplings in the vertices. We derive the spectral condition, locate the gaps in the spectrum and formulate sufficient conditions for the finiteness of the number of spectral gaps. As the main result, we find an intrinsic connection between the presence of the gaps and the coefficients in a continued fraction associated with the ratio of edge lengths of the lattice. This knowledge enables a straightforward construction of a periodic quantum graph with any required number of gaps in the spectrum and---to some degree---allows to arrange the positions of the gaps; i.e., to partially solve the inverse spectral problem.
