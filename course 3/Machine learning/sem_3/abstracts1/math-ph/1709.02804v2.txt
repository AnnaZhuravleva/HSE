A connection between the unitary quantization scheme suggested by Govorkov and para-Fermi statistics of order 2 is considered. An appropriate extension of Green's ansatz is suggested. The extension made possible to turn the Govorkov bilinear and trilinear commutation relations for the annihilation and creation operators of two different para-Fermi fields $\phi_{a}$ and $\phi_{b}$ into identity. The way of incorporating para-Grassmann numbers $\xi_{k}$ into a general scheme of uniquantization is also offered. For parastatistics of order 2 a new fact is revealed, namely, the trilinear relations containing both the para-Grassmann variables $\xi_{k}$ and the field operators $a_{k}$, $b_{m}$ under a certain invertible mapping go over into the unitary equivalent relations, where commutators are replaced by anticommutators and vice versa. It is shown that the consequence of this circumstance is the existence of two alternative definitions of the coherent state for para-Fermi oscillators. The Klein transformation for Green's components of the operators $a_{k}$ and $b_{m}$ is constructed in an explicit form that enables us to reduce the initial commutation rules for the components to the normal commutation relations of ordinary Fermi fields. A nontrivial connection between the Govorkov trilinear relations and the so-called Lie-supertriple system is analysed. A brief discussion of the possibility of embedding the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory into the unitary quantization scheme is provided.
