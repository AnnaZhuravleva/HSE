We consider the Einstein-flow on a product manifold with one factor being a compact quotient of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space without boundary and the other factor being a flat torus of fixed arbitrary dimension. We consider initial data symmetric with respect to the toroidal directions. We obtain effective Einsteinian field equations coupled to a wave map type and a Maxwell type equation by the Kaluza-Klein reduction. The Milne universe solves those field equations when the additional parts arising from the toroidal dimensions are chosen constant. We prove future stability of the Milne universe within this class of spacetimes, which establishes stability of a large class of cosmological Kaluza-Klein vacua. In particular, this generalizes the Milne stability result by Andersson-Moncrief in the case of three spatial dimensions to a number of Einstein-matter systems. Those include the Einstein-Maxwell system, the Brans-Dicke model, the Einstein-wave-map system and thereby also the massless Einstein-scalar field system. The result can moreover be seen as a generalization of the stability of U(1)-symmetric spacetimes established by Choquet-Bruhat and Moncrief to 3+1-dimensions.
