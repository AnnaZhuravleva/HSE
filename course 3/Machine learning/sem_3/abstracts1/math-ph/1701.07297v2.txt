Our paper is devoted to the oscillator semigroup, which can be defined as the set of operators whose kernels are centered Gaussian. Equivalently, they can be defined as the the Weyl quantization of centered Gaussians. We use the Weyl symbol as the main parametrization of this semigroup. We derive formulas for the tracial and operator norm of the Weyl quantization of Gaussians. We identify the subset of Gaussians, which we call quantum degenerate, where these norms have a singularity.
