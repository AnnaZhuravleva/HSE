We study the two-body Dirac operator in a bounded external field and for a class of unbounded pair-interaction potentials, both repulsive and attractive, including the Coulomb type. Provided the coupling constant of the pair-interaction fulfills a certain bound, we prove existence of a self-adjoint extension of this operator which is uniquely distinguished by means of finite potential energy. In the case of Coulomb interaction, we require as a technical assumption the coupling constant to be bounded by $2/\pi$.
