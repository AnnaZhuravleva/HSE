We consider similarity solutions of the generalized convection-diffusion-reaction equation with both space- and time-dependent convection, diffusion and reaction terms. By introducing the similarity variable, the reaction-diffusion equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation. Matching the resulting ordinary differential equation with known exactly solvable equations, one can obtain corresponding exactly solvable convection-diffusion-reaction systems. Some representative examples of exactly solvable systems are presented. We also describe how an equivalent convection-diffusion-reaction system can be constructed which admits the same similarity solution of another convection-diffusion-reaction system.
