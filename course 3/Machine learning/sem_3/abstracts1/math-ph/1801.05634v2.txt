We analyse the $n$-dimensional superintegrable Kepler-Coulomb system with non-central terms. We find a novel underlying chain structure of quadratic algebras formed by the integrals of motion. We identify the elements for each sub-structure and obtain the algebra relations satisfied by them and the corresponding Casimir operators. These quadratic sub-algebras are realized in terms of a chain of deformed oscillators with factorized structure functions. We construct the finite-dimensional unitary representations of the deformed oscillators, and give an algebraic derivation of the energy spectrum of the superintegrable system.
