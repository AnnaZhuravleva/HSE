We investigate the possibility of inducing the cosmological constant from extra dimensions by embedding our four-dimensional Riemannian space-time into a five-dimensional Weyl integrable space. Following approach of the induced matter theory we show that when we go down from five to four dimensions, the Weyl field may contribute both to the induced energy-tensor as well as to the cosmological constant, or more generally, it may generate a time-dependent cosmological parameter. As an application, we construct a simple cosmological model which has some interesting properties.
