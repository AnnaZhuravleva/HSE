We present a new viewpoint on the construction of pointlike local fields in integrable models of quantum field theory. Rather than exhibiting their $n$-point functions and verifying the Wightman axioms, we establish them as closed operators affiliated with a net of local von Neumann algebras, which is defined indirectly via wedge-local quantities. We also investigate whether these fields have the Reeh-Schlieder property, and in which sense they generate the net of algebras. For these results, we establish sufficient criteria that do not depend on details of the interaction, i.e., on the two-particle scattering matrix, and we complete the construction in the case of the massive Ising model.
