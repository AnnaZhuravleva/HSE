We study three-body Schr\"odinger operators in one and two dimensions modelling an exciton interacting with a charged impurity. We consider certain classes of multiplicative interaction potentials proposed in the physics literature. We show that if the impurity charge is larger than some critical value, then three-body bound states cannot exist. Our spectral results are confirmed by variational numerical computations based on projecting on a finite dimensional subspace generated by a Gaussian basis.
