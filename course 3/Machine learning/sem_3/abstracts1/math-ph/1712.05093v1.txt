In this paper, we firstly give the definition of the coupled Hall-Littlewood function and its realization in terms of vertex operators. Then we construct the representation of the two-site generalized $q$-boson model in the algebra of coupled Hall-Littlewood functions. Finally, we find that the vertex operators which generate coupled Hall-Littlewood functions can also be used to obtain the partition function of the A-model topological string on the conifold.
