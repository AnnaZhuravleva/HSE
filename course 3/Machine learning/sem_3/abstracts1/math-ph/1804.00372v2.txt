We investigate the thermodynamic limit of the one-dimensional ferromagnetic XXZ model with the antiperiodic boundary condition. It is shown that the distribution of the Bethe roots of the inhomogeneous Bethe Ansatz equations (BAEs) at the ground state as well as at the low-lying excited states satisfy the string hypothesis, although the inhomogeneous BAEs are not in the standard product form which has made the study of the corresponding thermodynamic limit nontrivial. We also obtain the twisted boundary energy induced by the non-trivial topological boundary conditions in the thermodynamic limit.
