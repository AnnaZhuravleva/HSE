In Einstein's theory of relativity, the interaction of two collinearly polarized plane gravitational waves can be described by a Goursat problem for the Euler-Darboux equation in a triangular domain. In this paper, using a representation of the solution in terms of Abel integrals, we give a full asymptotic expansion of the solution near the diagonal of the triangle. The expansion is related to the formation of a curvature singularity of spacetime. Our framework allows for boundary data with derivatives which are singular at the corners. This level of generality is crucial for the application to gravitational waves.
