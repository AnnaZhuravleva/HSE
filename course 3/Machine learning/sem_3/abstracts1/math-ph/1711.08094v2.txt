In earlier work (arXiv:1707.04927) the authors obtained formulas for the probability in the asymmetric simple exclusion process that at time $t$ a particle is at site $x$ and is the beginning of a block of $L$ consecutive particles. Here we consider asymptotics. Specifically, for the KPZ regime with step initial condition, we determine the conditional probability (asymptotically as $t\rightarrow\infty$) that a particle is the beginning of an $L$-block, given that it is at site $x$ at time $t$. Using duality between occupied and unoccupied sites we obtain the analogous result for a gap of $G$ unoccupied sites between the particle at $x$ and the next one.
