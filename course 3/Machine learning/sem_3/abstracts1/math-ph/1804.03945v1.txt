A 2-torsion topological phase exists for Hamiltonians symmetric under the wallpaper group with glide reflection symmetry, corresponding to the unorientable cycle of the Klein bottle fundamental domain. We prove a mod 2 twisted Toeplitz index theorem, which implies a bulk-edge correspondence between this bulk phase and the exotic topological zero modes that it acquires along a boundary glide axis.
