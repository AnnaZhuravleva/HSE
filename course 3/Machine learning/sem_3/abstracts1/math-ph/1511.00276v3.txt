The main results of this article provide asymptotics at infinity of the Green's functions near and at the spectral gap edges for "generic" periodic second-order elliptic operators on noncompact Riemannian co-compact coverings with abelian deck groups. Previously, analogous results have been known for the case of $\mathbb{R}^n$ only. One of the interesting features discovered is that the rank of the deck group plays more important role than the dimension of the manifold.
