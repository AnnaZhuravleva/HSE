In this paper, after a brief review of the general theory concerning regularized derivatives and integrals of a function with respect to another function, we provide a peculiar fractional generalization of the $(1+1)$-dimensional Dodson's diffusion equation. For the latter we then compute the fundamental solution, which turns out to be expressed in terms of an M-Wright function of two variables. Then, we conclude the paper providing a few interesting results for some nonlinear fractional Dodson-like equations.
