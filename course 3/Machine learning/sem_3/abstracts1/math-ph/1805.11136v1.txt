Physical realizations of non-standard singular self-adjoint extensions for one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator in terms of the mass-jump are considered. It is shown that corresponding boundary conditions can be realized for the Hamiltonian with the position-dependent effective mass in two qualitatively different profiles of the effective mass inhomogeneity: the mass-jump and the mass-bump. The existence of quantized magnetic flux in a case of the mass-jump is proven by explicit demonstration of the Zeeman-like splitting for states with the opposite projections of angular momentum.
