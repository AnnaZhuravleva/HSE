We discuss the interrelations between symmetry of an Ito stochastic differential equations (or systems thereof) and its integrability, extending in party results by R. Kozlov [J. Phys. A ${\bf 43}$ (2010) \& ${\bf 44}$ (2011)]. Together with integrability, we also consider the relations between symmetries and reducibility of a system of SDEs to a lower dimensional one. We consider both "deterministic" symmetries and "random" ones, in the sense introduced recently by Gaeta and Spadaro [J.Math. Phys. ${\bf 58}$ (2017)].
