By controlling coefficients and decaying order of time-decaying harmonic potentials, the velocity of a quantum particle is decelerated by the effect of harmonic potentials but the particle is non-trapping. In this paper, we consider the quantum system with controlled harmonic potentials. By defining the wave operators for this system and suitable range of these, we can prove the existence and completeness of wave operators with respect to the short-range potentials $V(t,x)$ satisfying $|V(t,x)| = o ((1+|x|)^{-1/(1- \lambda)})$, for some $\lambda$, $0< \lambda < 1/2$.
