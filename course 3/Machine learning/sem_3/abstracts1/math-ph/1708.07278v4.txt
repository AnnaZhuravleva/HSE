We consider a system of $N$-Bosons with a two-body interaction potential $V \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)+L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^3)$, possibly singular than the Coulomb interaction. We show that, with $H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$ initial data, the difference between the many-body Schr\"odinger evolution in the mean-field regime and the corresponding Hartree dynamics is of order $1/N$, for any fixed time. The $N$-dependence of the bound is optimal.
