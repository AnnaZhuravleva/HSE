In this article we study an extension of Smoluchowski's discrete coagulation equation, where particle in- and output takes place. This model is frequently used to describe aggregation processes in combination with sedimentation of clusters. More precisely, we show that the evolution equation is well-posed for a large class of coagulation kernels and output rates. Additionally, in the long-time limit we prove that solutions converge to a unique equilibrium with exponential rate under a suitable smallness condition on the coefficients.
