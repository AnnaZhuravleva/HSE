Radiation reaction against a relativistic electron is of critical importance since the experiment to check this "quantumness" becomes possible soon with an extremely high-intensity laser beam. However, there is a fundamental mathematical quest to apply any laser profiles to laser focusing and superposition beyond the Furry picture of its usual method by a plane wave. To give the apparent meaning of $q(\chi)$ the quantumness factor with respect to a radiation process is absent. Thus for resolving the above questions, we propose stochastic quantization of the classical radiation reaction model for any laser field profiles, via the construction of the relativistic Brownian kinematics with the dynamics of a scalar electron and the Maxwell equation with a current by a Brownian quanta. This is the first proposal of the coupling system between a relativistic Brownian quanta and fields in Nelson's stochastic quantization. Therefore, we can derive the radiation field by its Maxwell equation, too. This provides us the fact that $q(\chi)$ produced by QED is regarded as $\mathscr{P}(\varOmega_{\tau}^{\mathrm{ave}})$ of an existence probability such that a scalar electron stay on its average trajectory.
