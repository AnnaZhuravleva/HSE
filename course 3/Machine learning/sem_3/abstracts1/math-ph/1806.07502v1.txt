Recently new solvable systems of nonlinear evolution equations -- including ODEs, PDEs and systems with discrete time -- have been introduced. These findings are based on certain convenient formulas expressing the $k$-th time-derivative of a root of a time-dependent monic polynomial in terms of the $k$-th time-derivative of the coefficients of the same polynomial and of the roots of the same polynomial as well as their time-derivatives of order less than $k$. These findings were restricted to the case of generic polynomials without any multiple root. In this paper some of these findings -- those for $k=1$ and $k=2$ -- are extended to polynomials featuring one double root; and a few representative examples are reported of new solvable systems of nonlinear evolution equations.
