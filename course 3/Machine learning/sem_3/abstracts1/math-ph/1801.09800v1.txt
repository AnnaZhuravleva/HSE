We concisely summarize a method of finding all rational solutions to an inhomogeneous rational ODE system of arbitrary order (but solvable for its highest order terms) by converting it into a finite dimensional linear algebra problem. This method is then used to solve the problem of conclusively deciding when certain rational ODE systems in upper triangular form can or cannot be reduced to diagonal form by differential operators with rational coefficients. As specific examples, we consider systems of coupled Regge-Wheeler equations, which have naturally appeared in previous work on vector and tensor perturbations on the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime. Our systematic approach reproduces and complements identities that have been previously found by trial and error methods.
