In this paper we use the technique used in \cite{A}-\cite{5b} to deal with delta interactions in a rigorous way in a curved spacetime represented by a cosmic string along the $z$ axis. This mathematical machinery is applied in order to study the discrete spectrum of a point-mass particle confined in an infinitely long cylinder with a conical defect on the $z$ axis and perturbed by delta interactions. We derive a suitable approximate formula for the total energy. As a consequence, we found the existence of a mixing of states with positive or zero energy with the ones with negative energy (bound states). This mixture depends on the radius $R$ of the trapping cylinder. The number of quantum bound states is an increasing function of the radius $R$. It is also interesting to note the presence of states with zero total energy (quasi free states). Apart from the gravitational background, the model presented in this paper can be of interest, for example, in the context of nanophysics and graphene modeling. In particular, the graphene with double layer can be modeled within our model, with the double layer given by delta perturbations and the string on the $z-$axis denoting topological defects of the graphene.
