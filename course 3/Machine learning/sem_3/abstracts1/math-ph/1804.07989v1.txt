In this PhD thesis we study holomorphic and non-holomorphic elliptic analogues of multiple zeta values, namely elliptic multiple zeta values and modular graph functions. Both classes of functions have been discovered very recently, and are involved in the computation of genus one superstring amplitudes. In particular, we obtain new results on the asymptotic expansion of these functions that allow us to perform explicit computations and point out analogies between genus zero and genus one amplitudes.
