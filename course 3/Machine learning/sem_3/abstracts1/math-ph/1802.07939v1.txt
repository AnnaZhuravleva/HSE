We make use of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi (QHJ) theory to investigate conditional quasi-solvability of the quantum symmetric top subject to combined electric fields (symmetric top pendulum). We derive the conditions of quasi-solvability of the time-independent Schroedinger equation as well as the corresponding finite sets of exact analytic solutions. We do so for this prototypical trigonometric system as well as for its anti-isospectral hyperbolic counterpart. An examination of the algebraic and numerical spectra of these two systems reveals mutually closely related patterns. The QHJ approach allows to retrieve the closed-form solutions for the spherical and planar pendula and the Razavy system that had been obtained in our earlier work via Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics as well as to find a cornucopia of additional exact analytic solutions.
