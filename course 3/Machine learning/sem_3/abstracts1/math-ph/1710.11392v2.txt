Using the framework of category theory, we formalize the heuristic principles that physicists employ in constructing the Hamiltonians for open classical systems as sums of Hamiltonians of subsystems. First we construct a category where the objects are symplectic manifolds and the morphisms are spans whose legs are surjective Poisson maps. Using a slight variant of Fong's theory of "decorated" cospans, we then decorate the apices of our spans with Hamiltonians. This gives a category where morphisms are open classical systems, and composition allows us to build these systems from smaller pieces. We repeat this process to construct another category that allows us to study classical systems from a Lagrangian perspective. Finally, using Fong's work, we build a symmetric monoidal functor between the two categories in hopes of studying open classical systems from both a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian perspective.
