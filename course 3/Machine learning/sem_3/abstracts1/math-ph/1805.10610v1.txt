We consider time reparametrisations of the Newton type equations on Riemannian manifolds generalising the Chaplygin multiplier method for $G$-Chaplygin systems. As an example of a time reparametrization, we consider the reduced nonholonomic problem of rolling without slipping and twisting of an $n$-dimensional balanced ball over a fixed sphere and prove complete integrability when the radius of the ball is twice the radius of the sphere.
