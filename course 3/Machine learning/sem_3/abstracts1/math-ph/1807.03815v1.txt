In this paper we show the existence of the generalized Eberlein decomposition for Fourier transformable measures with Meyer set support. We prove that each of the three components is also Fourier transformable and has Meyer set support. We obtain that each of the pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous components of the Fourier transform is a strong almost periodic measure, and hence is either trivial or has relatively dense support. We next prove that the Fourier transform of a measure with Meyer set support is norm almost periodic, and hence so is each of the pure point, absolutely continuous and singular continuous components. We complete the paper by discussing some applications to the diffraction of weighted Dirac combs with Meyer set support.
