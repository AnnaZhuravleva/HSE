We consider closed XXX spin chains with broken total spin $U(1)$ symmetry within the framework of the modified algebraic Bethe ansatz. We study multiple actions of the modified monodromy matrix entries on the modified Bethe vectors. The obtained formulas of the multiple actions allow us to calculate the scalar products of the modified Bethe vectors. We find an analog of Izergin--Korepin formula for the scalar products. This formula involves modified Izergin determinants and can be expressed as sums over partitions of the Bethe parameters.
