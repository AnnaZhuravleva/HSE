In this article, we establish a Hitchin-Kobayashi type correspondence for generalised Seiberg-Witten monopole equations on Kahler surfaces. We show that the "stability" criterion we obtain, for the existence of solutions, coincides with that of the usual Seiberg-Witten monopole equations. This enables us to construct a map from the moduli space of solutions to the generalised equations to effective divisors.
