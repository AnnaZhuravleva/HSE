In a multidimensional infinite layer bounded by two hyperplanes, the Poisson equation with the polynomial right-hand side is considered. It is shown that the Dirichlet boundary value problem and the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem with polynomial boundary conditions have a unique solution in the class of functions of polynomial growth and it solution is a polynomial. An algorithm for constructing this polynomial solution is given and examples are considered.
