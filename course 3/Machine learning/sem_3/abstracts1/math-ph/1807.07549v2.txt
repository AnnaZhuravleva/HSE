We consider the six-vertex model in an L-shaped domain of the square lattice, with domain wall boundary conditions, in the case of free-fermion vertex weights. We describe how the recently developed `Tangent method' can be used to determine the form of the arctic curve. The obtained result is in agreement with numerics.
