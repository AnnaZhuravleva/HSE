We consider models with nearest-neighbor interactions and with the set $[0,1]$ of spin values, on a Cayley tree of order $k\geq 1$.   It is known that the "splitting Gibbs measures" of the model can be described by solutions of a nonlinear integral equation. Recently, solving this integral equation some periodic (in particular translation-invariant) splitting Gibbs measures were found. In this paper we give three constructions of new sets of non-translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures. Our constructions are based on known solutions of the integral equation.
