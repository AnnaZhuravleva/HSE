Maps on a parameter space for expressing distribution functions are exactly derived from the Perron-Frobenius equations for a generalized Boole transform family. Here the generalized Boole transform family is a one-parameter family of maps where it is defined on a subset of the real line and its probability distribution function is the Cauchy distribution with some parameters. With this reduction, some relations between the statistical picture and the orbital one are shown. From the viewpoint of information geometry, the parameter space can be identified with a statistical manifold, and then it is shown that the derived maps can be characterized. Also, with an induced symplectic structure from a statistical structure, symplectic and information geometric aspects of the derived maps are discussed.
