Our assumption that spacetime is a continuum leads to many challenges in mathematical physics. Singularities, divergent integrals and the like threaten many of our favorite theories, from Newtonian gravity to classical electrodynamics, quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model. In general relativity, singularities are intimately connected to some of the theory's most dramatic successful predictions. We survey these problems and the large amount of work that has gone into dealing with them.
