This work deals with extremal properties of spectral measures corresponding to selfadjoint extensions of a regular symmetric operator with deficiency indices (1,1). We propose a generalization of the moment problem which in particular allows us to study point mass perturbations of extremal spectral measures. The results permit to obtain characterizations of spectral measures of differential operators similar to what is done for solutions of the classical moment problem.
