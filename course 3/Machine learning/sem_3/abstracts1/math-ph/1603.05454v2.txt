The quantum problem of an electron moving in a plane under the field created by two Coulombian centers admits simple analytical solutions for some particular inter-center distances. These elementary eigenfunctions, akin to those found by Demkov for the analogous three dimensional problem, are calculated using the framework of quasi-exact solvability of a pair of entangled ODE's descendants from the Heun equation. A different but interesting situation arises when the two centers have the same strength. In this case completely elementary solutions do not exist.
