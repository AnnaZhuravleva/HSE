In our preceding paper \cite{watanabe6}, we showed that if the solution to the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation for superconductivity belongs to a certain set, then the transition from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition in the BCS-Bogoliubov model. Here we have no magnetic fields. In this paper, we show that the solution to the BCS-Bogoliubov gap equation indeed belongs to the set above. On the basis of these results, we then give an operator-theoretical proof of the statement that the transition from a normal conducting state to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition.
