The Duflo map is a valuable tool for operator ordering in contexts in which Kirillov-Kostant brackets and their quantizations play a role. A priori, the Duflo map is only defined on the subspace of the symmetric algebra over a Lie algebra consisting of elements invariant under the adjoint action. Here we discuss extensions to the whole symmetric algebra, as well as their application to the calculation of Chern-Simons theory expectation values.
