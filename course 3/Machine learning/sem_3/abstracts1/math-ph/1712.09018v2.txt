We study quantum antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models on a hypercubic lattice. We prove the following three theorems without any assumption: (i) The spontaneous magnetization which is obtained by applying the infinitesimally weak symmetry breaking field is equal to the maximum spontaneous magnetization at zero or finite low temperatures. (ii) When the spontaneous magnetization is non-vanishing at zero temperature, there appears a gapless excitation, Nambu-Goldstone mode, above an infinite-volume pure ground state. (iii) When the spontaneous magnetization is non-vanishing at zero or finite low temperatures, the transverse correlation in the infinite-volume limit exhibits a Nambu-Goldstone-type slow decay.
