We continue the analysis of the set of locally normal KMS states w.r.t. the translation group for a local conformal net A of von Neumann algebras on the real line. In the first part we have proved the uniqueness of KMS state on every completely rational net. In this second part, we exhibit several (non-rational) conformal nets which admit continuously many primary KMS states. We give a complete classification of the KMS states on the U(1)-current net and on the Virasoro net Vir_1 with the central charge c=1, whilst for the Virasoro net Vir_c with c>1 we exhibit a (possibly incomplete) list of continuously many primary KMS states. To this end, we provide a variation of the Araki-Haag-Kastler-Takesaki theorem within the locally normal system framework: if there is an inclusion of split nets A in B and A is the fixed point of B w.r.t. a compact gauge group, then any locally normal, primary KMS state on A extends to a locally normal, primary state on B, KMS w.r.t. a perturbed translation. Concerning the non-local case, we show that the free Fermi model admits a unique KMS state.
