We propose a generalization of Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) that has internal degrees of freedom described by an affine Lie superalgebra. We give a general formulation of SLE corresponding to representation theory of an affine Lie superalgebra whose underlying finite dimensional Lie superalgebra is basic classical type, and write down stochastic differential equations on internal degrees of freedom in case that the corresponding affine Lie superalgebra is $\widehat{\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)}$. We also demonstrate computation of local martingales associated with the solution from a representation of $\widehat{\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)}$.
