Completely positive maps are useful in modeling the discrete evolution of quantum systems. Spectral properties of operators associated with such maps are relevant for determining the asymptotic dynamics of quantum systems subjected to multiple interactions described by the same quantum channel. We discuss a connection between the properties of the peripheral spectrum of completely positive and trace preserving map and the algebra generated by its Kraus operators $\mathcal{A}(A_1,\ldots A_K)$. By applying the Shemesh and Amitsur - Levitzki theorems to analyse the structure of the algebra $\mathcal{A}(A_1,\ldots A_K)$ one can predict the asymptotic dynamics for a class of operations.
