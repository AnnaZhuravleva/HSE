We show that if the non Gaussian part of the cumulants of a random matrix model obey some scaling bounds in the size of the matrix, then Wigner's semicircle law holds. This result is derived using the replica technique and an analogue of the renormalisation group equation for the replica effective action. This is a transcript of a talk given at "5th Winter Workshop on Non-Perturbative Quantum Field Theory" Sophia-Antipolis, March 2017 and is based on former work in collaboration with A. Tanasa and D.L. Vu, see arXiv:1609.01873 .
