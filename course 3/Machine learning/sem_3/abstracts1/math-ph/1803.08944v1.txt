In a recent paper, Engle, Hanusch and Thiemann showed that there is a unique state on the reduced holonomy-flux $\ast$-algebra of homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology, that is invariant under residual diffeomorphims. This result has been claimed to be true both for the Ashtekar-Bojowald-Lewandowski framework and for that introduced by the present author. Unfortunately, the uniqueness proof relies on an incorrect argument which spoils the second case. In our short note, we are going to patch this issue, this way keeping the nice uniqueness result in both cases. Moreover, we will even extend the underlying operator algebraic statements as this might help later for studying higher-dimensional models.
