Metriplectic systems are state space formulations that have become well-known under the acronym GENERIC. In this work we present a GENERIC based state space formulation in an operator setting that encodes the weak-formulation of the field equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous mixture of compressible viscous and heat-conducting Newtonian fluids consisting of reactive constituents. We discuss the mathematical model of the fluid mixture formulated in the framework of continuum thermodynamics. The fluid mixture is considered an open thermodynamic system that moves free of external body forces. As closure relations we use the linear constitutive equations of the phenomenological theory known as Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (TIP). The phenomenological coefficients of these linear constitutive equations satisfy the Onsager-Casimir reciprocity relations. We present the state space representation of the fluid mixture, formulated in the extended GENERIC framework for open systems, specified by a symmetric, mixture related dissipation bracket and a mixture related Poisson-bracket for which we prove the Jacobi-identity
