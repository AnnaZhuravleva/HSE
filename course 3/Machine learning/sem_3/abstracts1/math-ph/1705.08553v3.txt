We prove Lieb-Robinson bounds for a general class of lattice fermion systems. By making use of a suitable conditional expectation onto subalgebras of the CAR algebra, we can apply the Lieb-Robinson bounds much in the same way as for quantum spin systems. We preview how to obtain the spectral flow automorphisms and to prove stability of the spectral gap for frustration-free gapped systems satisfying a Local Topological Quantum Order condition.
