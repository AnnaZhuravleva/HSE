In this paper we recover the non-perturbative partition function of 2D Yang-Mills theory from the perturbative path integral. To achieve this goal, we study the perturbative path integral quantization for 2D Yang-Mills theory on surfaces with boundaries and corners in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism (or, more precisely, in its adaptation to the setting with boundaries, compatible with gluing and cutting - the BV-BFV formalism). We prove that cutting a surface (e.g. a closed one) into simple enough pieces - building blocks - and choosing a convenient gauge-fixing on the pieces, assembling back the partition function on the surface one recovers the known non-perturbative answers for 2D Yang-Mills theory.
