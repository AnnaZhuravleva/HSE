Tartaglia and Pearce have argued that the nonunitary $n\times n$ fused Forrester-Baxter $\mbox{RSOS}(m,m')$ models are described, in the continuum scaling limit, by the minimal models ${\cal M}(M,M',n)$ constructed as the higher-level conformal cosets $(A^{(1)}_1)_k\otimes (A^{(1)}_1)_n/(A^{(1)}_1)_{k+n}$ at integer fusion level $n\ge 1$ and fractional level $k=nM/(M'\!-\!M)-2$ with $(M,M')=\big(nm-(n\!-\!1)m',m'\big)$. These results rely on Yang-Baxter integrability and are valid in Regime III for models determined by the crossing parameter $\lambda=(m'\!-\!m)\pi/m'$ in the interval $0<\lambda<\pi/n$. Here we consider the $2\times 2$ $\mbox{RSOS}(m,m')$ models in the interval $\tfrac{\pi}{2}<\lambda<\pi$ and investigate the associated one-dimensional sums. In this interval, we verify that the one-dimensional sums produce new finitized Virasoro characters $ch_{r,s}^{(N)}(q)$ of the minimal models ${\cal M}(m,m',1)$ with $m'>2m$. We further conjecture finitized bosonic forms and check that these agree with the ground state one-dimensional sums out to system sizes $N=12$. The $2\times 2$ $\mbox{RSOS}(m,m')$ models thus realize new Yang-Baxter integrable models in the universality classes of the minimal models ${\cal M}(m,m',1)$. For the series ${\cal M}(m,2m+1,1)$ with $m\ge 2$, the spin-1 one-dimensional sums were previously analysed by Jacob and Mathieu without the underlying Yang-Baxter structure. Finitized Kac characters $\chi_{r,s}^{m,m';(N)}(q)$ for the logarithmic minimal models ${\cal LM}(p,p',1)$ are also obtained for $p'\ge 2p$ by taking the logarithmic limit $m,m'\to\infty$ with $m'/m\to p'/p+$.
