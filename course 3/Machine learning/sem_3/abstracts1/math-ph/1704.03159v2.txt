We prove a pair of transformation formulas for multivariate elliptic hypergeometric sum/integrals associated to the $A_n$ and $BC_n$ root systems, generalising the formulas previously obtained by Rains. The sum/integrals are expressed in terms of the lens elliptic gamma function, a generalisation of the elliptic gamma function that depends on an additional integer variable, as well as a complex variable and two elliptic nomes. As an application of our results, we prove an equality between $S^1\times S^3/\mathbb{Z}_r$ supersymmetric indices, for a pair of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories related by Seiberg duality, with gauge groups $SU(n+1)$ and $Sp(2n)$. This provides one of the most elaborate checks of the Seiberg duality known to date. As another application of the $A_n$ integral, we prove a star-star relation for a two-dimensional integrable lattice model of statistical mechanics, previously given by the second author.
