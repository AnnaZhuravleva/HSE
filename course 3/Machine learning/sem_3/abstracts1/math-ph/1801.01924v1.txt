This work deals with decay bounds for Green matrices and generalized eigenvectors of block Jacobi matrices when the real part of the spectral parameter lies in an infinite gap of the operator's essential spectrum. We consider the cases of commutative and noncommutative matrix entries separately. An example of a block Jacobi operator with noncommutative entries and nonnegative essential spectrum is given to illustrate the results.
