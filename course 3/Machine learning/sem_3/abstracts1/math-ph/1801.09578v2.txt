We make use of matrix representations of completely positive maps in order to study open quantum dynamics on graphs, with emphasis on quantum walks and the associated trajectories obtained via a monitoring of the position. We discuss the discrete and continuous time setting and consider the statistics of particles located on a vertex with some internal degree of freedom. Other classes of semigroup generators, such as graph-induced generators are also considered. In the case of primitive quantum channels we present expressions of the mean hitting time for a particle to reach a vertex in terms of a quantum version of the fundamental matrix, thus extending recent results in the setting of open quantum random walks. An open quantum version of Kac's Lemma for the expected return time is discussed. By considering appropriate block matrix expressions we are able to make computations in terms of matrix-valued transition rates, in analogy with the notion of rates from classical continuous-time Markov chains. Also inspired by the classical case a recurrence criterion for the continuous time open walk setting is presented.
