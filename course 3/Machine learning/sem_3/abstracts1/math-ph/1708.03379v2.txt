We consider a two dimensional quantum Hamiltonian separable in Cartesian coordinates and allowing a fifth-order integral of motion. We impose the superintegrablity condition and find all doubly exotic superintegrable potentials (i.e potentials V (x, y) = V_1(x)+V_2(y) where neither V_1(x) nor V_2(y) satisfy a linear ODE) allowing the existence of such an integral. All of these potentials are found to have the Painlev\'e property. Most of them are expressed in terms of known Painlev\'e transcendents or elliptic functions but some may represent new higher order Painlev\'e transcendents.
