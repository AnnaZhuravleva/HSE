We give a detailed study of the symplectic geometry of a family of integrable systems obtained by coupling two angular momenta in a non trivial way. These systems depend on a parameter t $\in$ [0, 1] and exhibit different behaviors according to its value. For a certain range of values, the system is semitoric, and we compute some of its symplectic invariants. Even though these invariants have been known for almost a decade, this is to our knowledge the first example of their computation in the case of a non-toric semitoric system on a compact manifold (the only invariant of toric systems is the image of the momentum map). In the second part of the paper we quantize this system, compute its joint spectrum, and describe how to use this joint spectrum to recover information about the symplectic invariants.
