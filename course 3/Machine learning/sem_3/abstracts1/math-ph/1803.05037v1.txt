The generic null geodesic of the Schwarzschild--Kruskal--Szekeres geometry has a natural complexification, an elliptic curve with a cusp at the singularity. To realize that complexification as a Riemann surface without a cusp, and also to ensure conservation of energy at the singularity, requires a branched cover of the space-time over the singularity, with the geodesic being doubled as well to obtain a genus two hyperelliptic curve with an extra involution. Furthermore, the resulting space-time obtained from this branch cover has a Hamiltonian that is null geodesically complete. The full complex null geodesic can be realized in a natural complexification of the Kruskal--Szekeres metric.
