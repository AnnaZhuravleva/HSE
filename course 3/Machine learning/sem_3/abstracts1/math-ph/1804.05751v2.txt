Superintegrable Hamiltonian systems in a two-dimensional Euclidean space are considered. We present all real standard potentials that allow separation of variables in polar coordinates and admit an independent fourth-order integral of motion. The general form of the potentials satisfies a linear ODE. In the classical case, the standard potentials coincide with the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) or Post-Winternitz (PW) models. In the quantum case new superintegrable systems are obtained, in addition to the TTW and PW ones. Their classical limit is free motion.
