Motivated by a recent application of quantum graphs to model the anomalous Hall effect we discuss quantum graphs the vertices of which exhibit a preferred orientation. We describe an example of such a vertex coupling and analyze the corresponding band spectra of lattices with square and hexagonal elementary cells showing that they depend heavily on the network topology, in particular, on the degrees of the vertices involved.
