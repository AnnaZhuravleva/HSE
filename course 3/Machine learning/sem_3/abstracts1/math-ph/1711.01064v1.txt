We extend the recently developed Izergin-Korepin analysis on the wavefunctions of the $U_q(sl_2)$ six-vertex model to the reflecting boundary conditions. Based on the Izergin-Korepin analysis, we determine the exact forms of the symmetric functions which represent the wavefunctions and its dual. As an application, we derive algebraic identities for the symmetric functions by combining the results with the determinant formula of the domain wall boundary partition function of the six-vertex model with reflecting end.
