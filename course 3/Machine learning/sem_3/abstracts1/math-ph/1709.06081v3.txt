Using an algebraic method for solving the wave equation in quantum mechanics, we encountered a new class of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. It consists of a four-parameter polynomial with continuous spectrum on the whole real line and two of its discrete versions; one with a finite spectrum and another with countably infinite spectrum. A second class of these new orthogonal polynomials appeared recently while solving a Heun-type equation. Up to now, these polynomials are defined by their three-term recursion relations and initial values. However, their other properties like the weight functions, generating functions, orthogonality, Rodrigues-type formulas, etc. are yet to be derived analytically. Due to the prime significance of these polynomials in physics, we call upon experts in the field of orthogonal polynomials to study them, derive their properties and write them in closed form (e.g., in terms of hypergeometric functions).
