We study 6j-symbols, or Racah coefficients for tensor products of infinite-dimensional unitary principal series representations of the group SL(2,C). These symbols were constructed earlier by Ismagilov and we rederive his result (up to some slight difference associated with equivalent representations) using the Feynman diagrams technique. The resulting 6j-symbols are expressed either as a triple integral over complex plane with a symmetric kernel or as an infinite bilateral sum of integrals of the Mellin-Barnes type.
