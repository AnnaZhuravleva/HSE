We construct an additional independent integral of motion for a class of three dimensional minimally superintegrable systems with constant magnetic field. This class was introduced in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50 (2017) 245202 and it is known to possess periodic closed orbits. In the present paper we demonstrate that it is maximally superintegrable. Depending on the values of the parameters of the system, the newly found integral can be of arbitrarily high polynomial order in momenta.
