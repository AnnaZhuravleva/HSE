Pinors and spinors are defined as sections of the subbundles whose fibers are the representation spaces of the Clifford algebra of the forms equipped with the Graf product. In this context, pinors and spinors are here considered and the geometric generalized Fierz identities provide the necessary framework to derive and construct new spinor classes on the space of smooth sections of the exterior bundle, endowed with the Graf product, for prominent specific signatures.
