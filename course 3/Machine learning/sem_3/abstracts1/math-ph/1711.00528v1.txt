We review the work of Tosio Kato on the mathematics of non--relativistic quantum mechanics and some of the research that was motivated by this. Topics include analytic and asymptotic eigenvalue perturbation theory, Temple--Kato inequality, self--adjointness results, quadratic forms including monotone convergence theorems, absence of embedded eigenvalues, trace class scattering, Kato smoothness, the quantum adiabatic theorem and Kato's ultimate Trotter Product Formula.
