Tsallis entropy is a useful one-parameter generalization of the standard von Neumann entropy in information theory. We study the variance of Tsallis entropy of bipartite quantum systems in a random pure state. The main result is an exact variance formula of Tsallis entropy that involves finite sums of some terminating hypergeometric functions. In the special cases of quadratic entropy and small subsystem dimensions, the main result is further simplified to explicit variance expressions. As a byproduct, we find an independent proof of the recently proved variance formula of von Neumann entropy based on the derived moment relation to the Tsallis entropy.
