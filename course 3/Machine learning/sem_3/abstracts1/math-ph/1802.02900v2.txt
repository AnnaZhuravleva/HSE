The primary purpose of this note is to prove two recent conjectures concerning the $n$ body matrix that arises in recent papers of Escobar--Ruiz, Miller, and Turbiner on the classical and quantum $n$ body problem in $d$-dimensional space. First, whenever the masses are in a nonsingular configuration, meaning that they do not lie on an affine subspace of dimension $\leq n-2$, the $n$ body matrix is positive definite, and hence defines a Riemannian metric on the space coordinatized by their interpoint distances. Second, its determinant can be factored into the product of the order $n$ Cayley--Menger determinant and a mass-dependent factor that is also of one sign on all nonsingular mass configurations. The factorization of the $n$ body determinant is shown to be a special case of an intriguing general result proving the factorization of determinants of a certain form.
