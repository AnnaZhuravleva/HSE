We propose a geometric setting of the axiomatic mathematical formalism of quantum theory. Guided by the idea that understanding the mathematical structures of these axioms is of similar importance as was historically the process of understanding the axioms of geometry, we complete the spaces of observables and of states in a similar way as in classical geometry linear or affine spaces are completed by projective spaces. In this sense, our theory can be considered as a "completion of usual linear quantum theory" , such that the usual theory appears as the special case where a reference frame is fixed once and for all. In the present first part, this general setting is explained. Dynamics (time evolution) will be discussed in subsequent work.
