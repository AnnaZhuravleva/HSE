We study rigorously a lattice gas version of the Sherrington-Kirckpatrick spin glass model. In discrete optimization literature this problem is known as Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) and it belongs to the class NP-hard. We prove that the fluctuations of the ground state energy tend to vanish in the thermodynamic limit, and we give a lower bound of such ground state energy. Then we present an heuristic algorithm, based on a probabilistic cellular automaton, which seems to be able to find configurations with energy very close to the minimum, even for quite large instances.
