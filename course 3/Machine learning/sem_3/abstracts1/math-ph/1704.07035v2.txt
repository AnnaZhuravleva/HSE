We investigate the elliptic integrable model introduced by Deguchi and Martin, which is an elliptic extension of the Perk-Schultz model. We introduce and study a class of partition functions of the elliptic model by using the Izergin-Korepin analysis. We show that the partition functions are expressed as a product of elliptic factors and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. This result resembles the recent works by number theorists in which the correspondence between the partition functions of trigonometric models and the product of the deformed Vandermonde determinant and Schur functions were established.
