The Boltzmann-Enskog equation for a hard sphere gas is known to have so called microscopic solutions, i.e., solutions of the form of time-evolving empirical measures of a finite number of hard spheres. However, the precise mathematical meaning of these solutions should be discussed, since the formal substitution of empirical measures into the equation is not well-defined. Here we give a rigorous mathematical meaning to the microscopic solutions to the Boltzmann-Enskog equation by means of a suitable series representation.
