We use the tangent method to investigate the arctic curve in a model of non-intersecting lattice paths with arbitrary fixed starting points aligned along some boundary and whose distribution is characterized by some arbitrary piecewise differentiable function. We find that the arctic curve has a simple explicit parametric representation depending of this function, providing us with a simple transform that maps the arbitrary boundary condition to the arctic curve location. We discuss generic starting point distributions as well as particular freezing ones which create additional frozen domains adjacent to the boundary, hence new portions for the arctic curve. A number of examples are presented, corresponding to both generic and freezing distributions.
