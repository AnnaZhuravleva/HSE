Gaussian pentachoron weights can be used for constructing algebraic realizations of four-dimensional Pachner moves. Here, we consider a natural `gauge equivalence' for such weights with one and two bosonic - i.e., commuting - variables on 3-faces. For the one-boson case, all generic weights turn out to be gauge equivalent. For the two-boson case, and generic weights, their gauge equivalence classes are parameterized by multiplicative 2-cocycles. Moreover, a generic two-boson weight can be reduced by a gauge transformation to a delta-function form.
