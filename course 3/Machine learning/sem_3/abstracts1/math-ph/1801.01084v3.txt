We show that the planar orthogonal polynomials with $l$ logarithmic singularities in the potential are the multiple orthogonal polynomials (Hermite-Pad\'e polynomials) of Type II with $l$ measures. We also find the ratio between the determinant of the moment matrix corresponding to the multiple orthogonal polynomials and the determinant of the moment matrix from the original planar measure.
