A system composed of an ideal gas of N fermions interacting with an impurity particle in two space dimensions is considered. The interaction between impurity and fermions is given in terms of two-body point interactions whose strength is determined by the two-body binding energy, which is a free parameter of the model. If the mass of the impurity is 1.225 times larger than the mass of a fermion, it is shown that the energy is bounded below uniformly in the number N of fermions. This result improves previous, N-dependent lower bounds and it complements a recent, similar bound for the Fermi polaron in three space dimensions.
