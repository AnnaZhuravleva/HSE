The regularized trace of the heat kernel of a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with a singular two-particle contact interaction is considered. We derive a complete small-time asymptotic expansion in (fractional) powers of the time, $t$. Most importantly, we do not invoke standard parametrix constructions for the heat kernel. Instead, we first derive the large-energy expansion of the regularized trace of the resolvent for the considered operator. Then, we exploit that the resolvent may be obtained by a Laplace transformation of the heat semi-group, and an application of a suitable inverse Watson lemma eventually delivers the small-$t$ asymptotic expansion of the heat-kernel trace.
