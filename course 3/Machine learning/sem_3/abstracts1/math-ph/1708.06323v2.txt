For any quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, there exists the universal R-matrix, which satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. It is known that the adjoint action of the universal R-matrix on the elements of the tensor square of the algebra constitutes a quantum Yang-Baxter map, which satisfies the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. The map has a zero curvature representation among L-operators defined as images of the universal R-matrix. We find that the zero curvature representation can be solved by the Gauss decomposition of a product of L-operators. Thereby obtained a quasi-determinant expression of the quantum Yang-Baxter map associated with the quantum algebra $U_{q}(gl(n))$. Moreover, the map is identified with products of quasi-Pl\"{u}cker coordinates over a matrix composed of the L-operators. We also consider the quasi-classical limit, where the underlying quantum algebra reduces to a Poisson algebra. The quasi-determinant expression of the quantum Yang-Baxter map reduces to ratios of determinants, which give a new expression of a classical Yang-Baxter map.
