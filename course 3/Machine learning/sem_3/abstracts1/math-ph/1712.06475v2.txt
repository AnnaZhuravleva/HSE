We revisit the construction of the eigenvectors of the single and double-row transfer matrices associated with the Zamolodchikov-Fateev model, within the algebraic Bethe ansatz method. The left and right eigenvectors are constructed using two different methods: the fusion technique and Tarasov's construction. A simple explicit relation between the eigenvectors from the two Bethe ans\"atze is obtained. As a consequence, we obtain the Slavnov formula for the scalar product between on-shell and off-shell Tarasov-Bethe vectors.
