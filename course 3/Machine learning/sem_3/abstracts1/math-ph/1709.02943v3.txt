In this paper we construct separable strongly continuous representations of the quantum holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra. Since the quantum holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra encodes the canonical commutation relations of a gauge theory these representations provide a kinematical framework of a quantum gauge theory. Furthermore, we device a method of constructing physically interesting operators such as the Yang-Mills Hamilton operator. This in turn establishes the existence of a general framework of non-perturbative quantum gauge theory on a curved background and in particular of a quantum Yang-Mills theory. This construction works in any dimension.
