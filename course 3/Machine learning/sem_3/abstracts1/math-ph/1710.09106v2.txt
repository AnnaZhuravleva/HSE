We present a multi-spin solution to the Yang-Baxter equation. The solution corresponds to the integrable lattice spin model of statistical mechanics with positive Boltzmann weights and parameterized in terms of the basic hypergeometric functions. We obtain this solution from a non-trivial basic hypergeometric sum-integral identity which originates from the equality of supersymmetric indices for certain three-dimensional N=2 Seiberg dual theories.
