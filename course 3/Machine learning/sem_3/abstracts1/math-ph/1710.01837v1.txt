We introduce, and investigate the properties of, the family of quantum Br\`{e}gman distances, based on embeddings into suitable vector spaces (with the reflexive noncommutative Orlicz spaces over semi-finite W*-algebras and noncommutative Lp spaces over any W*-algebras providing two important examples). This allows us to define geometric categories for nonlinear quantum inference theory, with morphisms given by constrained minimisations of quantum Br\`{e}gman distances.
