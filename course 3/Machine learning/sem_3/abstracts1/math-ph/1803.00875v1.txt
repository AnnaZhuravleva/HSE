We study the dynamics of the solution of a non-linear quantum master equation describing a simple laser under the mean field approximation. The quantum system is formed by a single mode optical cavity and a set of two level atoms that are coupled to two reservoirs. First, we establish the existence of a unique regular stationary state for the non-linear evolution equation under consideration. Second, we examine the free interaction solutions, i.e., the solutions to the non-linear quantum master equation that coincide with unitary evolutions generated by the Hamiltonian resulting from neglecting the interactions between the laser mode, atoms and the bath. We obtain that a family of non-constant free interaction solutions is born at the regular stationary state as a relevant parameter, which is denoted by $C_\mathfrak{b} $, passes through the critical value $1$. These free interaction solutions yield the periodic solutions of the Maxwell Bloch equations modeling our physical system in the framework of the semiclassical laser theory. Third, in case $ C_\mathfrak{b} < 1$ we deduce that the system converges exponentially fast to the equilibrium, and so the regular stationary state is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium solution. Thus, the quantum system has a Hopf bifurcation at $C_\mathfrak{b} =1 $.
