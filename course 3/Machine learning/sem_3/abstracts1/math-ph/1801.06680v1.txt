The relationship between classical and quantum three one-mode systems interacting in a non-linear way is described. We investigate the integrability of these systems by using the reduction procedure. The reduced coherent states for the quantum system are constructed. We find the explicit formulas for the reproducing measure for these states. Examples of some applications of the obtained results in non-linear quantum optics are presented.
