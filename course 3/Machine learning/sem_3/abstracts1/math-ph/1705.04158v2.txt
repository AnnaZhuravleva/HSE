Non-commutative analysis tools have successfully been applied to the integer quantum Hall effect, in particular for a proof of the stability of the Hall conductance in an Anderson localization regime and of the bulk-boundary correspondence. In this work, these techniques are implemented to study two-dimensional dirty superconductors described by Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians. After a thorough presentation of the basic framework and the topological invariants, Kubo formulas for the thermal, thermoelectric and spin Hall conductance are analyzed together with the corresponding edge currents.
