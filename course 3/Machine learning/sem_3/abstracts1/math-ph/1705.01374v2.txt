We define mixed states associated with submanifolds with probability densities in quantizable closed K{\"a}hler manifolds. Then, we address the problem of comparing two such states via their fidelity. Firstly, we estimate the sub-fidelity and super-fidelity of two such states, giving lower and upper bounds for their fidelity, when the underlying submanifolds are two Lagrangian submanifolds intersecting transversally at a finite number of points, in the semiclassical limit. Secondly, we investigate a family of examples on the sphere, for which we manage to obtain a better upper bound for the fidelity. We conclude by stating a conjecture regarding the fidelity in the general case.
