Quantum information geometry studies families of quantum states by means of differential geometry. A new approach is followed with the intention to facilitate the introduction of a more general theory in subsequent work. To this purpose, the emphasis is shifted from a manifold of strictly positive density matrices to a manifold of faithful quantum states on the C*-algebra of bounded linear operators. In addition, ideas from the parameter-free approach to information geometry are adopted. The underlying Hilbert space is assumed to be finite-dimensional. In this way technicalities are avoided so that strong results are obtained, which one can hope to prove later on in a more general context. Two different atlases are introduced, one in which it is straightforward to show that the quantum states form a Banach manifold, the other which is compatible with the inner product of Bogoliubov and which yields affine coordinates for the exponential connection.
