In this paper we investigate two topics related to the celebrated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff Theorem: a non-convergence and a prolongation result. Given a Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with identity $I$, and given $X,Y\in \mathcal{A}$, we study the relationship of three different issues: the convergence of the BCH series $\sum_n Z_n(X,Y)$, the existence of a logarithm of $e^Xe^Y$, and the convergence of the Mercator-type series $\sum_n \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n}(e^Xe^Y-I)^n$. We fix some general results, and by suitable counterexamples, we show that various pathologies can occur. This problem is also related to some recent results, of interest in physics, on closed formulas for the BCH series: while the sum of the BCH series presents several non-convergence issues, these closed formulas can provide a prolongation for the BCH series when it is not convergent. This leads us to the second topic of the paper: we study a prolongation problem for the BCH local-group operation generated by a family of smooth vector fields, showing that simple prolongation arguments for ODEs intervene to face this problem in a simple way.
