We show, that the non-abelian quantum statistics can be studied using certain topological invariants, which are the homology groups of configuration spaces. In particular, we formulate a general framework for describing quantum statistics of particles constrained to move in a topological space $X$. The framework involves the study of flat complex vector bundles over the configuration space of $X$, which can be achieved by determining its homology groups. We apply this methodology for configuration spaces of graphs. As a conclusion, we provide families of graphs, which are good candidates for simplified models in the further study of quantum statistical phenomena and obtain a number of new results concerning topology of graph configuration spaces.
