We consider matrix functions with certain invariance under inversion in the unit circle. If such a function satisfies a positivity assumption on the unit circle, then only zero partial indices appear in its Riemann-Hilbert (Wiener-Hopf) factorization. It implies the unique solvability of a certain class of Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problems. It includes the ones associated with the inverse scattering transform of the focusing/defocusing integrable discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.
