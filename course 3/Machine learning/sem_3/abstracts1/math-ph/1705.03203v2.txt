We discuss the average-field approximation for a trapped gas of non-interacting anyons in the quasi-bosonic regime. In the homogeneous case, i.e., for a confinement to a bounded region, we prove that the energy in the regime of large statistics parameter, i.e., for "less-bosonic" anyons, is independent of boundary conditions and of the shape of the domain. When a non-trivial trapping potential is present, we derive a local density approximation in terms of a Thomas-Fermi-like model.
