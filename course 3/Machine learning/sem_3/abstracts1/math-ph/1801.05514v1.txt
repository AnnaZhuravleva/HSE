We deduce from a determinant identity on quantum transfer matrices of generalized quantum integrable spin chain model their generating functions. We construct the isomorphism of Clifford algebra modules of sequences of transfer matrices and the boson space of symmetric functions. As an application, tau-functions of transfer matrices immediately arise from classical tau-functions of symmetric functions.
