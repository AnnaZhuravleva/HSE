In this paper we will realize the polynomial Heisenberg algebras through the harmonic oscillator. We are going to construct then the Barut-Girardello coherent states, which coincide with the so-called multiphoton coherent states, and we will analyze the corresponding Heisenberg uncertainty relation and Wigner distribution function for some particular cases. We will show that these states are intrinsically quantum and cyclic, with a period being a fraction of the oscillator period. The associated geometric phases will be as well evaluated.
