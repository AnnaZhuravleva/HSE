Study of the classical motion of two identical particles on a plane subject to non-Coulomb potentials in a constant magnetic field presented in polar coordinates. With the rigorous analysis of the potentials and the constants of motion, we are able to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of bounded and periodic orbits. We also show and analyze numerical solutions of Newton equations of motion.
