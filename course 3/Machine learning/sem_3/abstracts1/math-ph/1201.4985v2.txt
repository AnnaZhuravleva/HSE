Generalized Pauli's theorem, proved by D. S. Shirokov for two sets of anticommuting elements of a real or complexified Clifford algebra of dimension $2^n$, is extended to the case, when both sets of elements depend smoothly on points of Euclidian space of dimension $r$. We prove that in the case of even $n$ there exists a smooth function such that two sets of Clifford algebra elements are connected by a similarity transformation. All cases of connection between two sets are considered in the case of odd $n$. Using the equation for the spin connection of general form, it is shown that the problem of the local Pauli's theorem is equivalent to the problem of existence of a solution of some special system of partial differential equations. The special cases $n=2$, $r\geq 1$ and $n\geq 2$, $r=1$ with more simpler solution of the problem are considered in detail.
