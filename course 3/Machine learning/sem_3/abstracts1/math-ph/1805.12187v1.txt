We show that the rigorous nonperturbative field strength (or wave-function) renormalization $Z$, contrary to general belief, is not necessarily equal to zero in case the two-point function of an interacting quantum field theory is, as expected, more singular at the light-cone (with proper definitions) than the corresponding free field two-point function. However, if (massless) photons or composite (unstable) particles are present, the condition $Z=0$ should hold true due to arguments seldom presented in the literature. In fact, we argue (within a natural framework for gauge theories) that the condition $Z=0$ is a universal feature of realistic models of elementary particle physics, which include massless or unstable particles.
