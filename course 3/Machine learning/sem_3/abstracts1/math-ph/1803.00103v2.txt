This short note summarizes the works done in collaboration between S. Belliard (CEA, Saclay), L. Frappat (LAPTh, Annecy), S. Pakuliak (JINR, Dubna), E. Ragoucy (LAPTh, Annecy), N. Slavnov (Steklov Math. Inst., Moscow) and more recently A. Hutsalyuk (Wuppertal / Moscow) and A. Liashyk (Kiev / Moscow).   It presents the construction of Bethe vectors, their scalar products and the form factors of local operator for integrable models based on the (super)algebras $gl_n$, $gl_{m|p}$ or their quantum deformations.   It corresponds to two talks given by E.R. and N.S. at \textsl{Correlation functions of quantum integrable systems and beyond}, in honor of Jean-Michel Maillet for his 60's (ENS Lyon, October 2017).
