I will sketchily illustrate how the theory of symmetry helps in determining solutions of (deterministic) differential equations, both ODEs and PDEs, staying within the classical theory. I will then present a quick discussion of some more and less recent attempts to extend this theory to the study of stochastic differential equations, and briefly mention some perspective in this direction.
