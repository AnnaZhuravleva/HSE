Before we proposed an algebraic technics for the Hamiltonian approach to the evolution systems of partial differential equations, including systems with constraints. Here we further develop this approach and present the defining system of equations (suitable for the computer calculations), characterizing the Hamiltonian operators of the given form. We illustrate our technics by a simple example.
