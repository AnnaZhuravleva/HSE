The problem of the Rivlin cube is to determine the stability of all homogeneous equilibria of an isotropic incompressible hyperelastic body under equitriaxial dead loads. Here, we consider the stochastic version of this problem where the elastic parameters are random variables following standard probability laws. Uncertainties in these parameters may arise, for example, from inherent data variation between different batches of homogeneous samples, or from different experimental tests. As for the purely elastic problem, we consider the following questions: what are the likely equilibria and how does their stability depend on the material constitutive law? In addition, for the stochastic model, the problem is to derive the probability distribution of deformations, given the variability of the parameters.
