We study the multi-dimensional operator $(H_x u)_n=\sum_{|m-n|=1}u_{m}+f(T^n(x))u_n$, where $T$ is the shift of the torus $\T^d$. When $d=2$, we show the spectrum of $H_x$ is almost surely purely continuous for a.e. $\alpha$ and generic continuous potentials. When $d\geq 3$, the same result holds for frequencies under an explicit arithmetic criterion. We also show that general multi-dimensional operators with measurable potentials do not have eigenvalue for generic $\alpha$.
