In this paper we are interested in understanding the impact of surface defects on a condensate of electron pairs in a quantum wire. Based on previous results we establish a simple mathematical model in order to account for such surface effects. For a system of non-interacting pairs, we will prove the destruction of the condensate in the bulk. Finally, taking repulsive interactions between the pairs into account, we will show that the condensate is recovered for pair densities larger than a critical one given the number of the surface defects is not too large.
