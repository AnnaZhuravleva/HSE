We study the unitary representations of the non-compact real forms of the complex Lie superalgebra sl(n|m). Among them, only the real form su(p,q|m) (p+q=n) admits nontrivial unitary representations, and all such representations are of the highest-weight type (or the lowest-weight type). We extend the standard oscillator construction of the unitary representations of non-compact Lie superalgebras over standard Fock spaces to generalised Fock spaces which allows us to define the action of oscillator determinants raised to non-integer powers. We prove that the proposed construction yields all the unitary representations including those with continuous labels. The unitary representations can be diagrammatically represented by non-compact Young diagrams. We apply our general results to the physically important case of four-dimensional conformal superalgebra su(2,2|4) and show how it yields readily its unitary representations including those corresponding to supermultiplets of conformal fields with continuous (anomalous) scaling dimensions.
