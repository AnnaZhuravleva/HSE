Regular perturbative Lagrangians that admit approximate Noether symmetries and approximate conservation laws are studied. Specifically, we investigate the connection between approximate Noether symmetries and collineations of the underlying manifold. In particular we determine the generic Noether symmetry conditions for the approximate point symmetries and we find that for a class of perturbed Lagrangians, Noether symmetries are related to the elements of the Homothetic algebra of the metric which is defined by the unperturbed Lagrangian. Moreover, we discuss how exact symmetries become approximate symmetries. Finally, some applications are presented.
