A configuration space version of BPHZ renormalization is proved in the realm of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. All arguments are formulated entirely in configuration space so that the range of application is extended to analytic spacetimes. Further the relation to the momentum space method is established. In the course of that, it is necessary to study the limit of constant coupling.
