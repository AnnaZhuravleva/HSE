We provide the general solution of problems concerning AC star circuits by turning them into geometric problems. We show that one problem is strongly related to the Fermat-point of a triangle. We present a solution that is well adapted to the practical application the problem is based on. Furthermore, we solve a generalization of the geometric situation and discuss the relation to non-symmetric, unbalanced AC star circuits.
