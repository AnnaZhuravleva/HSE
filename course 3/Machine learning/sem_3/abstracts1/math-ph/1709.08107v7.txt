The structure of the gauge invariant (particle number preserving) C*-algebra generated by the resolvents of a non-relativistic Bose field is analyzed. It is shown to form a dense subalgebra of the bounded inverse limit of a system of approximately finite dimensional C*-algebras. Based on this observation, it is proven that the closure of the gauge invariant algebra is stable under the dynamics induced by Hamiltonians involving pair potentials. These facts allow to proceed to a description of interacting Bosons in terms of C*-dynamical systems. It is outlined how the present approach leads to simplifications in the construction of infinite bosonic states and sheds new light on topics in many body theory.
