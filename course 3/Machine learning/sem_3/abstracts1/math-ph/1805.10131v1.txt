In this note first we study the Weyl operators and Weyl S-spectrum of a bounded right quaternionic linear operator, in the setting of the so-called S-spectrum, in a right quaternionic Hilbert space. In particular, we give a characterization for the S-spectrum in terms of the Weyl operators. In the same space we also study the Browder operators and introduce the Browder S-spectrum.
