The notion of fractional monodromy was introduced by Nekhoroshev, Sadovski\'{i} and Zhilinski\'{i} as a generalization of standard (`integer') monodromy in the sense of Duistermaat from torus bundles to singular torus fibrations. In the present paper we prove a general result that allows to compute fractional monodromy in various integrable Hamiltonian systems. In particular, we show that the non-triviality of fractional monodromy in 2 degrees of freedom systems with a Hamiltonian circle action is related only to the fixed points of the circle action. Our approach is based on the study of a specific notion of parallel transport along Seifert manifolds.
