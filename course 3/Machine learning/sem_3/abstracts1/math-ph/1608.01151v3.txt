We present the derivation of the Yang-Mills gauge theory based on the covariant Hamiltonian representation of Noether's theorem. As the starting point, we re-formulate our previous presentation of the canonical Hamiltonian derivation of Noether's theorem. The formalism is then applied to derive the Yang-Mills gauge theory. The Noether currents of U(1) and SU(N) gauge theories are derived from the respective infinitesimal generating functions of the pertinent symmetry transformations which maintain the form of the Hamiltonian.
