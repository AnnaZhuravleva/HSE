We study the Cauchy problem for two types of Schr\"{o}dinger equations. Firstly, an equation on the real line with Hamiltonian being a differential operator of arbitrary high order (example for order two is the Sturm-Liouville operator) is considered. Secondly, we consider an equation in multidimensional real space with Hamiltonian consisting of the Laplace operator and a multipliplication by a potential operator; the potential is allowed to be unbounded, e.g. an arbitrary continuous non-negative function may serve as the potential. Coefficients of the Hamiltonians are time-independent variable functions. For both cases we provide explicit formulas that express the solution (provided by the resolving semigroup) in terms of initial condition and coefficients of the equations studied. Formulas obtained are based on translation operators and thus may be interpreted as quasi-Feynman formulas with generalized functions in the integration kernel. The technique used lies in the field of functional analysis and strongly continuous semigroup theory: Chernoff's theorem, Chernoff functions, and special constructions described in the paper. For the Schr\"odinger equation, both Feynman and quasi-Feynman formulas provide approximations to Feynman path integrals, which makes such formulas an attractive mathematical tool for quantum physics, as the case of quantum anharmonic oscillator is covered by the technique presented. The paper includes an extensive introduction and is written to be accessible to a wide range of readers.
