We consider Schramm-Loewner evolutions with internal degrees of freedom that are associated with representations of affine Lie algebras, following the group theoretical formulation of SLE. We observe that SLEs considered by Bettelheim et al. [PRL 95, 251601 (2005)] and Alekseev et al. [Lett. Math. Phys. 97, 243-261 (2011)] in correlation function formulation are reconstrunced. We also explicitly write down stochastic differential equations on internal degrees of freedom for Heisenberg algebras and the affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$. Our formulation enables to write down several local martingales associated with the solution of SLE from computation on a representation of an affine Lie algebra. Indeed, we write down local martingales associated with solution of SLE for Heisenberg algebras and the affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$. We also find affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$ symmetry of a space of SLE local martingales for the affine $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$.
