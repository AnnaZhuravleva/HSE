Grand canonical equilibrium states of a continuum system of interacting particles are studied. The particles are placed in the space $\mathbb{R}^d$ divided into congruent cubic cells. For a region $V\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ consisting of $N\in \mathbb{N}$ cells, every two particles contained in $V$ attract each other with intensity $J_1/N$. The particles contained in the same cell are subject to binary repulsion with intensity $J_2>J_1$. For fixed values of the temperature, the interaction intensities and the chemical potential, the thermodynamic phase is defined as a probability measure on the space of occupation numbers of cells, determined by a condition typical to Curie-Weiss theories. There is proved that the half-plane $J_1\times$\textit{ chemical potential} contains phase coexistence points at which two thermodynamic phases of the system exist. An equation of state for this system is obtained. Some illustrating numerical results are also presented.
