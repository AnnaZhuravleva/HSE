We give a brief overview on the relation between Connes spectral distance in noncommutative geometry and the Wasserstein distance of order 1 in optimal transport. We first recall how these two distances coincide on the space of probability measures on a Riemannian manifold. Then we work out a simple example on a discrete space, showing that the spectral distance between arbitrary states does not coincide with the Wasserstein distance with cost the spectral distance between pure states.
