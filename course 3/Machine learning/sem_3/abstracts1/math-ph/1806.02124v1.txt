States of a generic quantum field theory on a curved spacetime are considered, which satisfy the KMS condition with respect to an evolution associated with a complete (Killing) vector field. It is shown that at any point where the vector field is spacelike, such states cannot satisfy a certain microlocal regularity condition, which is weaker than the microlocal spectrum condition in the case of asymptotically free fields.
