We show that evolutionary Hirota type Euler-Lagrange equations in (2+1) dimensions have a symplectic Monge-Amp\`ere form. We consider integrable equations of this type in the sense that they admit infinitely many hydrodynamic reductions and determine Lax pairs for them. For two seven-parameter families of integrable equations converted to two-component form we have constructed Lagrangians, recursion operators and bi-Hamiltonian representations. We have also presented a six-parameter family of tri-Hamiltonian systems.
