We prove a conditional theorem on the positivity of the Lyapunov exponent for a Schr\"odinger cocycle over a skew shift base with a cosine potential and the golden ratio as frequency. For coupling below 1, which is the threshold for Herman's subharmonicity trick, we formulate three conditions on the Lyapunov exponent in a finite but large volume and on the associated large deviation estimates at that scale. Our main results demonstrate that these finite-size conditions imply the positivity of the infinite volume Lyapunov exponent. This paper shows that it is possible to make the techniques developed for the study of Schr\"odinger operators with deterministic potentials, based on large deviation estimates and the avalanche principle, effective.
