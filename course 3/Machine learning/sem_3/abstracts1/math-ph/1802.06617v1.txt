The raising operator relating adjacent bound states for the general, non-symmetric Rosen-Morse potential is constructed explicitly. It is demonstrated that, in constrast to the symmetric (modified P\"oschl-Teller) potential, the operator is non-local and must be expressed applying techniques from fractional calculus. A recurrence relation between adjacent states is derived applying the Weyl fractional integral, which, in contrast to standard recurrence relations, allows the efficient numerical computation of the coefficients of all Jacobi polynomials necessary for the evaluation of the bound state wave functions, providing an application of fractional calculus to exactly solvable quantum systems.
