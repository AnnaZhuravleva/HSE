This paper mathematically studies membranes and filaments adhering to periodic patterned substrates in a one-dimensional model. The problem is formulated by the minimizing problem of an elastic energy with a contact potential on graph substrates. Global minimizers (ground states) are mainly considered in view of their graph representations. Our main results exhibit sufficient conditions for the graph representation and examples of situations where any global minimizer must overhang.
