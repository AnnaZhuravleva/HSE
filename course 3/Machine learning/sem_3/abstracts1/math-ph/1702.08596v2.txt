We provide a generalization of the notion of Dirac system by using Morse families to intrinsically embrace the dynamics associated with different physical systems such as constrained variational calculus, optimal control, Lagrangian mechanics, etc., from both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian viewpoint. Besides, we introduce a geometric construction of Port-Dirac systems and use it to describe the interconnection of Dirac systems. Special emphasis on theoretical and applied examples is given throughout the paper to show the applicability of the proposed framework.
