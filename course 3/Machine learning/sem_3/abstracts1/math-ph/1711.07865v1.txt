We explore various combinatorial problems mostly borrowed from physics, that share the property of being continuously or discretely integrable, a feature that guarantees the existence of conservation laws that often make the problems exactly solvable. We illustrate this with: random surfaces, lattice models, and structure constants in representation theory.
