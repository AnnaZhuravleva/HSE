A finite dimensional operator which commutes with some symmetry group, admits quotient operators. Such a quotient operator is determined by the group action and by picking a certain representation of this group. Similar quotient operators were first introduced in [3, 21] for the purpose of an isospectral construction of metric graphs and manifolds. The quotients introduced here allow us to generalize previous isospectral constructions of discrete graphs, as well as to provide tools for spectral analysis of finite dimensional operators.
