The autonomous Duffing oscillator, and its van der Pol modification, are known to admit time-dependent first integrals for some specific values of parameters. This corresponds to the existence of appropriate Darboux polynomials, and in fact more can be shown: that there exist Liouvillian first integrals which do not depend on time. They can be expressed in terms of the Gauss hypergoemetric function, and are neither analytic, algebraic nor meromorphic. A criterion for this to happen in a general dynamical system is also given.
