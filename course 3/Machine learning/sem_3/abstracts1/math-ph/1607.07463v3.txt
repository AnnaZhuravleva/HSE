We analyze quantum Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^2$ using a novel discretization method based on an algebraic analogue of stochastic calculus. Such an analogue involves working with "Gaussian" free fields whose covariance matrix is indefinite rather than positive definite. Specifically, we work with Lie-algebra valued fields on a lattice and exploit an approximate gauge-invariance that is restored when taking the continuum limit. This analysis is applied to show the equivalence between Wilson loop expectations computed using partial axial-gauge, complete axial-gauge, and the Migdal-Witten lattice formulation. As a consequence, we obtain intriguing Lie-theoretic identities involving heat kernels and iterated integrals.
