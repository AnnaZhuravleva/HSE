In this paper, a supersymmetric extension of the minimal surface equation is formulated. Based on this formulation, a Lie superalgebra of infinitesimal symmetries of this equation is determined. A classification of the one-dimensional subalgebras is performed, which results in a list of 143 conjugacy classes with respect to action by the supergroup generated by the Lie superalgebra. The symmetry reduction method is used to obtain invariant solutions of the supersymmetric minimal surface equation. The classical minimal surface equation is also examined and its group-theoretical properties are compared with those of the supersymmetric version.
