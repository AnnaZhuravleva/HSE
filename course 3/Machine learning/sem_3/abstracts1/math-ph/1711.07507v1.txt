We investigate, in the Luttinger model with fixed box potential, the time evolution of an inhomogeneous state prepared as a localized fermion added to the noninteracting ground state. We proved that, if the state is evolved with the interacting Hamiltonian, the averaged density has two peaks moving in opposite directions, with a constant but renormalized velocity. We also proved that a dynamical `Landau quasi-particle weight' appears in the oscillating part of the averaged density, asymptotically vanishing with large time. The results are proved with the Mattis-Lieb diagonalization method. A simpler proof with the exact Bosonization formulas is also provided.
