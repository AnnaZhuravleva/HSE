A central issue of the science of complex systems is the quantitative characterization of complexity. In the present work we address this issue by resorting to information geometry. Actually we propose a constructive way to associate to a - in principle any - network a differentiable object (a Riemannian manifold) whose volume is used to define an entropy. The effectiveness of the latter to measure networks complexity is successfully proved through its capability of detecting a classical phase transition occurring in both random graphs and scale--free networks, as well as of characterizing small Exponential random graphs, Configuration Models and real networks.
