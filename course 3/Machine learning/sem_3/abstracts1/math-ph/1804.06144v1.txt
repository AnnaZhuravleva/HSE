We investigate the thermodynamic limit of the inhomogeneous T-Q relation of the antiferromagnetic XXZ spin chain with antiperiodic boundary condition. It is shown that the contribution of the inhomogeneous term at the ground state can be neglected when the system-size N tends to infinity, which enables us to reduce the inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations (BAEs) to the homogeneous ones. Then the quantum numbers at the ground states are obtained, by which the system with arbitrary size can be studied. We also calculate the twisted boundary energy of the system.
