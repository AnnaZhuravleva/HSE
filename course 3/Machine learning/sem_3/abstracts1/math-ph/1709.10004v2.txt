We construct L$_{\infty}$ algebras for general `initial data' given by a vector space equipped with an antisymmetric bracket not necessarily satisfying the Jacobi identity. We prove that any such bracket can be extended to a 2-term L$_{\infty}$ algebra on a graded vector space of twice the dimension, with the 3-bracket being related to the Jacobiator. We then prove the significantly more general theorem that if the Jacobiator takes values in the image of any linear map that defines an ideal there is a 3-term L$_{\infty}$ algebra with a generally non-trivial 4-bracket. We discuss special cases such as the commutator algebra of octonions, its contraction to the `R-flux algebra', and the Courant algebroid.
