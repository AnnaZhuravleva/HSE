We construct certain Fr\'echet principal $K$-bundles over affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces by means of the natural projection $G\stackrel{}{\rightarrow}G/K$ where $G$ is a (possibly twisted) geometric affine Kac-Moody group with a ``compact'' form $K$. Then we present two methods by means of which one can find certain spin structures on affine Kac-Moody symmetric spaces of compact type. We also briefly sketch defining a Dirac-like operator on these spaces.
