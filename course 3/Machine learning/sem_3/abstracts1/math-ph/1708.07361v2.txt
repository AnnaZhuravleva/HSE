We present analytical implementation of conformal field theory on a compact Riemann surface. We consider statistical fields constructed from background charge modifications of the Gaussian free field and derive Ward identities which represent the Lie derivative operators in terms of the Virasoro fields and the puncture operators associated with the background charges. As applications, we derive Eguchi-Ooguri's version of Ward's equations and certain types of BPZ equations on a torus.
