A new approach to the construction of formal deformations of associative algebras is proposed. It exploits the machinery of injective resolutions of an associative algebra $A$ in the category of $A$-bimodules. Specifically, we show that certain first-order deformations of $A$ extend to all orders and we derive explicit recurrent formulas determining this extension. In physical terms, this may be regarded as the deformation quantization of noncommutative Poisson structures on $A$.
