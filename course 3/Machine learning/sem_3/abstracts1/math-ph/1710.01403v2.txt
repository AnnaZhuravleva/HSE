The unique-continuation property from sets of positive measure is here proven for the time-independent $N$-electron magnetic Schr\"odinger equation. The unique-continuation property from sets of positive measure guarantees that if a solution of the Schr\"odinger equation vanishes on a set of positive measure, then it vanishes identically almost everywhere. We explicitly consider potentials of the form $V=\sum_j v(x_j)$ and $U=\sum_{j\neq l} u(x_j,x_l)$.
