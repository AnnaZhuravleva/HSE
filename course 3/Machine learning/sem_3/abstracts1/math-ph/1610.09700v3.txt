In the context of the massless Nelson model, we prove that two non-relativistic nucleons interacting with a massless meson field do not bind when a sufficiently strong Coulomb repulsion between the nucleons is added to the Hamiltonian. The result holds for both the renormalized and unrenormalized theories, and can also be applied to the so-called piezoelectric polaron model, which describes an electron interacting with the acoustical vibrational modes of a crystal through the piezoelectric interaction. The result can then be interpreted as well as a no-binding statement about piezoelectric bipolarons. The methods used allow also for a significant reduction of about 30% over previously known no-binding conditions for the optical bipolaron model of H. Fr\"ohlich.
