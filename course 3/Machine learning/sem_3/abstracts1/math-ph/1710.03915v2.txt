This paper is concerned with the Schr\"odinger operators $\Delta_{f_0}$ and $\Delta_f$ attached to a pair $(\mathbb{C}^n, f_0)$ and its deformation $(\mathbb{C}^n, f)$, where $f_0$ is a non-degenerate and quasi-homogeneous polynomial on $\mathbb{C}^n$ and $f$ is its relevant or marginal deformation. We give the $tt^*$ geometry structure on the Hodge bundle associated to $\Delta_f$, which describes the genus 0 anomaly. Next we study the corresponding singularity torsion type invariants and give the anomaly formulas for the 2nd torsion type invariant.
