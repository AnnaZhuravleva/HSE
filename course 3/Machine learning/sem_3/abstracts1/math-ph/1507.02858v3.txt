We investigate the time evolution of Hagedorn wavepackets by non-Hermitian quadratic Hamiltonians. We state a direct connection between coherent states and Lagrangian frames. For the time evolution a multivariate polynomial recursion is derived that describes the activation of lower lying excited states, a phenomenon unprecedented for Hermitian propagation. Finally we apply the propagation of excited states to the Davies--Swanson oscillator.
