The three-body general problem is formulated as a problem of geodesic trajectories flows on the Riemannian manifold. It is proved that a curved space with local coordinate system allows to detect new hidden symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system and reduce the three-body problem to the system of 6\emph{th} order. It is shown that the equivalence of the initial Newtonian three-body problem and the developed representation provides coordinate transformations in combination with the underdetermined system of algebraic equations. The latter makes a system of geodesic equations relative to the evolution parameter, i.e., to the arc length of the geodesic curve, irreversible. Equations of deviation of geodesic trajectories characterizing the behavior of the dynamical system as a function of the initial parameters of the problem are obtained. To describe the motion of a dynamical system influenced by the external regular and stochastic forces, a system of stochastic equations (SDE) is obtained. Using the system of SDE, a partial differential equation of the second order for the joint probability distribution of the momentum and coordinate of dynamical system in the phase space is obtained. A criterion for estimating the degree of deviation of probabilistic current tubes of geodesic trajectories in the phase and configuration spaces is formulated. The mathematical expectation of the transition probability between two asymptotic subspaces is determined taking into account the multichannel character of the scattering.
