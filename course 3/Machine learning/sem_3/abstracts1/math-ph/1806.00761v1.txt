A new family of solvable potentials related to the Schroedinger-Riccati equation has been investigated. This one-dimensional potential family depends on parameters and is restricted to the real interval. It is shown that this potential class, which is a rather general class of solvable potentials related to the hypergeometric functions, can be generalized to even wider classes of solvable potentials. As a consequence the nonlinear Schroedinger-type equation has been obtained.
