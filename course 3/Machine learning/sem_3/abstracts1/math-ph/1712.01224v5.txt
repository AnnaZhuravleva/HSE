We observe that an instantaneous collision process of hard spheres cannot be a deterministic time-reversible dynamical system. We then propose a suitable time-irreversible random dynamical system for hard spheres, with their collisions driven by a Poisson counting process. We find the exact statistical steady state of the system, and determine the form of its marginal distributions for a large number of spheres. We also find that the Kullback-Leibler entropy between a general statistical ensemble and the steady state is a nonincreasing function of time, although the conventional Boltzmann entropy can both increase or decrease in time. We compute the forward equation for the single-sphere marginal distribution, whose collision term is exact if the marginal is that of the steady state, and the number of spheres is large. For the impenetrable spheres (those which collide with probability one upon contact), we arrive at the Enskog equation. We also examine the hydrodynamic limit of the resulting Enskog equation for constant-density spheres, and find that the corresponding Enskog-Euler and Enskog-Navier-Stokes equations contain additional nonvanishing terms.
