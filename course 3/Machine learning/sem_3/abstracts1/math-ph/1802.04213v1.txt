A new integral representation is obtained for the star product corresponding to the $s$-ordering of the creation and annihilation operators. This parametric ordering convention introduced by Cahill and Glauber enables one to vary the type of ordering in a continuous way from normal order to antinormal order. Our derivation of the corresponding integral representation is based on using reproducing formulas for analytic and antianalytic functions. We also discuss a different representation whose kernel is a generalized function and compare the properties of this kernel with those of the kernels of another family of star products which are intermediate between the $qp-$ and $pq$-quantization.
