We study 2d vortex sheets with unbounded support. First we show a version of the Biot- Savart law related to such objects. Next, we give a formula associating the kinetic energy of such a flow with certain moments of its vorticity. It allows us to identify a class of vortex sheets of unbounded support being only sigma-finite measures, but with locally finite kinetic energy. One of such examples are celebrated Kaden spirals. We study them in details. In particular our estimates allow us to show that the kinetic energy of Kaden spirals in the neighbourhood of an origin is dissipated. The latter result has an interesting physical interpretation.
