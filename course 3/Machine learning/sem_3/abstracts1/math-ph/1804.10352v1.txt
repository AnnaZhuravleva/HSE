In previous papers, we discussed the recurrence relations of the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of the Laguerre, Jacobi, Wilson and Askey-Wilson types. In this paper we explore those of the Racah and $q$-Racah types. For the $M$-indexed ($q$-)Racah polynomials, we derive $3+2M$ term recurrence relations with variable dependent coefficients and $1+2L$ term ($L\geq M+1$) recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Based on the latter, the generalized closure relations and the creation and annihilation operators of the quantum mechanical systems described by the multi-indexed ($q$-)Racah polynomials are obtained. In appendix we present a proof and some data of the recurrence relations with constant coefficients for the multi-indexed Wilson and Askey-Wilson polynomials.
