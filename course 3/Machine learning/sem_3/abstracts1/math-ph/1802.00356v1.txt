In this paper we prove superintegrability of Hamiltonian systems generated by functions on $K\backslash G/K$, restriced to a symplectic leaf of the Poisson variety $G/K$, where $G$ is a simple Lie group with the standard Poisson Lie structure, $K$ is the subgroup of fixed points with respect to the Cartan involution.
