We consider expansions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of models of quantum field theory. For a class of models known as generalized spin boson model we prove the existence of asymptotic expansions of the ground state and the ground state energy to arbitrary order. We need a mild but very natural infrared assumption, which is weaker than the assumption usually needed for other methods such as operator theoretic renormalization to be applicable. The result complements previously shown analyticity properties.
