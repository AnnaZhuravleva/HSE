The exact probability distributions of the amplitudes of eigenfunctions, $\Psi(x, y)$, of several integrable planar billiards are analytically calculated and shown to possess singularities at $\Psi = 0$; the nature of this singularity is shape-dependent. In particular, we prove that the distribution function for a rectangular quantum billiard is proportional to the complete elliptic integral, ${\bf K}(1 - \Psi ^2)$, and demonstrate its universality, modulo a weak dependence on quantum numbers. On the other hand, we study the low-lying states of nonseparable, integrable triangular billiards and find the distributions thereof to be described by the Meijer G-function or certain hypergeometric functions. Our analysis captures a marked departure from the Gaussian distributions for chaotic billiards in its survey of the fluctuations of the eigenfunctions about $\Psi = 0$.
