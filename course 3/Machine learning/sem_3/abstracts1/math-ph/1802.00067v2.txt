We study entanglement-related properties of random quantum states which are unitarily invariant, in the sense that their distribution is left unchanged by conjugation with arbitrary unitary operators. In the large matrix size limit, the distribution of these random quantum states is characterized by their limiting spectrum, a compactly supported probability distribution. We prove several results characterizing entanglement and the PPT property of random bipartite unitarily invariant quantum states in terms of the limiting spectral distribution, in the unbalanced asymptotical regime where one of the two subsystems is fixed, while the other one grows in size.
