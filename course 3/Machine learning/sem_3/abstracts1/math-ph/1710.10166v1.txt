We study the gluing theory of Riemann surfaces using formal algebraic geometry, and give computable relations between the associated parameters for different gluing processes. As its application to the Liouville conformal field theory, we construct the sheaf of tempered conformal blocks on the moduli space of pointed Riemann surfaces which satisfies the factorization property and has a natural action of the Teichm\"{u}ller groupoid.
