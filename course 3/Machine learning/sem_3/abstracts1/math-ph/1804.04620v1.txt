In this paper, we present all constant solutions of Yang-Mills equations with arbitrary non-Abelian current in the case of the Lie group ${\rm SU}(2)$ in Euclidian space ${\mathbb R}^n$ of arbitrary dimension $n$. Namely, we obtain all solutions of specific system of $3n$ cubic equations with $3n$ unknowns and $3n$ parameters. We use the methods of singular value decomposition and two-sheeted covering of orthogonal group by spin group to do this.
