Coloring the faces of 2-dimensional square lattice with $k$ distinct colors such that no two adjacent faces have the same color is considered by establishing connection between the $k$ coloring problem and a generalized vertex model. Associating the colors with $k$ distinct species of particles with infinite repulsive force between nearest neighbors of the same type and zero chemical potential $\mu$ associated with each species, the number of ways $[W(k)]^N$ for large $N$ is related to the entropy of the {\it{hard square lattice gas}} at close packing of the lattice, where $N$ is the number of lattice sites. We discuss the evaluation of $W(k)$ using transfer matrix method with non-periodic boundary conditions imposed on at least one dimension and show the characteristic Toeplitz block structure of the transfer matrix. Using this result, we present some analytical calculations for non-periodic models that remain finite in one dimension. The case $k=3$ is found to approach the exact result obtained by Lieb for the residual entropy of ice with periodic boundary conditions. Finally, we show, by explicit calculation of the contribution of subgraphs and the series expansion of $W(k)$, that the Pauling type estimate(which is based on mean field approximation) dominates at large values of $k$. We thus also provide an alternative series expansion for the chromatic polynomial of a regular square graph (previous ones present in the literature are due to Birkhoff and others).
