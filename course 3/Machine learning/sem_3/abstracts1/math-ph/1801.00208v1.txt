We associate real and regular algebraic-geometric data to the class of multi-line soliton solutions of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KP) equation whose asymptotic behavior in space-time has been recently classified using the combinatorial structure of the totally non--negative part of real Grassmannians $Gr^{TNN} (k,n)$. In our construction we directly relate real and regular KP divisors on reducible $M$--curves to the classification of networks parametrizing a given positroid cell in $Gr^{TNN} (k,n)$.
