Integrable deformations of the hyperbolic and trigonometric ${\mathrm{BC}}_n$ Sutherland models were recently derived via Hamiltonian reduction of certain free systems on the Heisenberg doubles of ${\mathrm{SU}}(n,n)$ and ${\mathrm{SU}}(2n)$, respectively. As a step towards constructing action-angle variables for these models, we here apply the same reduction to a different free system on the double of ${\mathrm{SU}}(2n)$ and thereby obtain a novel integrable many-body model of Ruijsenaars--Schneider--van Diejen type that is in action-angle duality with the respective deformed Sutherland model.
