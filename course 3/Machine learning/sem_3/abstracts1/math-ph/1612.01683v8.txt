Enss (1983) proved a propagation estimate for the usual free Schroedinger operator that turned out later to be very useful for inverse scattering in the work of Enss--Weder (1995). Since then, this method has been called the Enss--Weder time-dependent method. We study the same type of propagation estimate for the fractional powers of the negative Laplacian and, as with the Enss--Weder method, we apply our estimate to inverse scattering. We find that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines the short-range interactions.
