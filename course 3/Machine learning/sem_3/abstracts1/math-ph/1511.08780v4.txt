The classical $\overline \partial$-method has been generalized recently [lnv], [lnv2] to be used in the presence of exceptional points. We apply this generalization to solve Dirac inverse scattering problem with weak assumptions on smoothness of potentials. As a consequence, this provides an effective method of reconstruction of complex-valued one time differentiable conductivities in the inverse impedance tomography problem.
