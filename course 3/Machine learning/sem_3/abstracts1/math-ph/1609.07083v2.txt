In this work, we adapt Sinkhorn-Knopp theorem for rectangular positive maps $(T:M_k\rightarrow M_m)$. We extend their concepts of support and total support to these maps. We show that a positive map $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map if and only if $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a positive map with total support.   Moreover, if $k$ and $m$ are coprime then $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map if and only if $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ has support.   This result provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the filter normal form, which is commonly used in Quantum Information Theory in order to simplify the task of detecting entanglement. Let $A=\sum_{i=1}^nA_i\otimes B_i\in M_k\otimes M_m$ be a state and $G_A: M_k\rightarrow M_m$ be the positive map $G_A(X)=\sum_{i=1}^nB_itr(A_iX)$. We show that $A$ can be put in the filter normal form if and only if $G_A: M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a positive map with total support. We prove that any state $A\in M_k\otimes M_m\simeq M_{km}$ such that $\dim(\ker(A))<k-1$, if $k=m$, and $\dim(\ker(A))<\min\{k,m\}$, if $k\neq m$, can be put in the filter normal form.   Recently, a connection between the capacity of a rectangular positive map $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ and the capacity of a certain square positive map $\widetilde{T}:M_{mk}\rightarrow M_{mk}$ was noticed. Here, we obtain a deeper connection between these maps. As a corollary of our main results, we prove that $T:M_k\rightarrow M_m$ is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map if and only if $\widetilde{T}:M_{mk}\rightarrow M_{mk}$ is equivalent to a doubly stochastic map.
