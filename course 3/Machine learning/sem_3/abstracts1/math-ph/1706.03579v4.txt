We obtain asymptotics of large Hankel determinants whose weight depends on a one-cut regular potential and any number of Fisher-Hartwig singularities. This generalises two results: 1) a result of Berestycki, Webb and Wong [5] for root-type singularities, and 2) a result of Its and Krasovsky [37] for a Gaussian weight with a single jump-type singularity. We show that when we apply a piecewise constant thinning on the eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix drawn from a one-cut regular ensemble, the gap probability in the thinned spectrum, as well as correlations of the characteristic polynomial of the associated conditional point process, can be expressed in terms of these determinants.
