In these four lectures, aiming at senior undergraduate and junior graduate Physics and Mathematics students, basic elements of the theory of elliptic functions are presented. Simple applications in classical mechanics are discussed, including a point particle in a cubic, sinusoidal or hyperbolic potential, as well as simple applications in quantum mechanics, namely the n=1 Lame potential. These lectures were given at the School of Applied Mathematics and Physical Sciences of the National Technical University of Athens in May 2017.
