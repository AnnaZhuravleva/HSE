On the affine space containing the space $\mathcal{S}$ of quantum states of finite-dimensional systems there are contravariant tensor fields by means of which it is possible to define Hamiltonian and gradient vector fields encoding relevant geometrical properties of $\mathcal{S}$. Guided by Dirac's analogy principle, we will use them as inspiration to define contravariant tensor fields, Hamiltonian and gradient vector fields on the affine space containing the space of fair probability distributions on a finite sample space and analyse their geometrical properties.   Most of our considerations will be dealt with for the simple example of a three-level system.
