Automorphisms of the infinite dimensional Onsager algebra are introduced. Certain quotients of the Onsager algebra are formulated using a polynomial in these automorphisms. In the simplest case, the quotient coincides with the classical analog of the Askey-Wilson algebra. In the general case, generalizations of the classical Askey-Wilson algebra are obtained. The corresponding class of solutions of the non-standard classical Yang-Baxter algebra are constructed, from which a generating function of elements in the commutative subalgebra is derived. We provide also another presentation of the Onsager algebra and of the classical Askey-Wilson algebras.
