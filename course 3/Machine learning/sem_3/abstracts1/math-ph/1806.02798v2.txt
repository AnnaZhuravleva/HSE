The Box-Ball System (BBS) is a cellular automaton introduced by Takahashi and Satsuma (TS) as a discrete counterpart of the KdV equation. Both systems exhibit solitons, solitary waves that conserve shape and speed even after collision with other solitons. The BBS has configuration space {0,1}^Z representing boxes which may contain one ball or be empty. A carrier visits successively boxes from left to right, picking balls from occupied boxes and deposing one ball, if carried, at each visited empty box. Conservation of solitons suggests that this dynamics has many spatially-ergodic invariant measures besides the i.i.d. distribution. Building on the TS identification of solitons, we provide a soliton decomposition of the ball configurations and show that the dynamics reduces to a hierarchical translation of the components, finally obtaining an explicit recipe to construct a rich family of invariant measures. We also consider the asymptotic speed of solitons of each size.
