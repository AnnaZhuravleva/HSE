Coprimeness property was introduced to study the singularity structure of discrete dynamical systems. In this paper we shall extend the coprimeness property and the Laurent property to further investigate discrete equations with complicated pattern of singularities. As examples we study extensions to the Somos-$4$ recurrence and the two-dimensional discrete Toda equation. By considering their non-autonomous polynomial forms, we prove that their tau function analogues possess the extended Laurent property with respect to their initial variables and some extra factors related to the non-autonomous terms. Using this Laurent property, we prove that these equations satisfy the extended coprimeness property. This coprimeness property reflects the singularities that trivially arise from the equations.
