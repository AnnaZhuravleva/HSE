We review a new theory of orthogonal separation of variables on pseudo-Riemannian spaces of constant zero curvature via concircular tensors and warped products. We then apply this theory to three-dimensional Minkowski space, obtaining an invariant classification of the forty-five orthogonal separable webs modulo the action of the isometry group. The eighty-eight inequivalent coordinate charts adapted to the webs are also determined and listed. We find a number of separable webs which do not appear in previous works in the literature. Further, the method used seems to more efficient and concise than those employed in earlier works.
