We consider hydrodynamic scaling limits for a class of reversible interacting particle systems, which includes the symmetric simple exclusion process and certain zero-range processes. We study a (non-quadratic) microscopic action functional for these systems. We analyse the behaviour of this functional in the hydrodynamic limit and we establish conditions under which it converges to the (quadratic) action functional of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory. We discuss the implications of these results for rigorous analysis of hydrodynamic limits.
