The Brezin-Gross-Witten model is one of the basic examples in the class of non-eigenvalue unitary matrix models. In the Kontsevich phase, it is a tau-function for the KdV hierarchy. In this paper we present an explicit formula that connects the Kontsevich-Witten and Brezin-Gross-Witten tau-functions using the $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}$ operators, which preserves the KdV integrability. The differential operators used in the formula are simply the Virasoro and Heisenberg operators. While the geometric interpretation of the Brezin-Gross-Witten model remains unknown, the formula provides a possible way to identify this model with enumerative geometry invariants.
