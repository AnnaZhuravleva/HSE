We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on analytic spacetimes with an analytic Cauchy surface. In this setting, we prove the existence of pure analytic Hadamard states. The proof is based on considering an elliptic operator obtained by Wick rotating the Klein-Gordon operator in a neighborhood of a Cauchy hypersurface. The Cauchy data of Hadamard two-point functions are constructed as Calder\'{o}n projectors (suitably generalized if the hypersurface is non-compact) for the elliptic operator.
