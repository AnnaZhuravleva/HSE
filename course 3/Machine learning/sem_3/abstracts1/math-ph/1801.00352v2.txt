After exhaustive inspection of bosonic coherent states appearing in physical literature two of us, Horzela and Szafraniec, came in 2012 to the reasonably general definition which relies exclusively on reproducing kernels. The basic feature of coherent states, which is the resolution of the identity, is preserved though it now achieves advantageous form of the Segal-Bargmann transform.   It turns out that the aforesaid definition is not only extremely economical but also puts under a common umbrella typical coherent states as well as those which are squeezed and entangled. We examine the case here on the groundwork of holomorphic Hermite polynomials in one and two variables. An interesting side of this story is how some limit procedure allows disentangling.
