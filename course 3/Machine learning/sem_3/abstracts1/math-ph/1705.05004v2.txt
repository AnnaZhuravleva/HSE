We study the dynamics of an inertial particle coupled to forcing, dissipation, and noise in the small mass limit. We derive an expression for the limiting (homogenized) joint distribution of the position and (scaled) velocity degrees of freedom. In particular, weak convergence of the joint distributions is established, along with a bound on the convergence rate for a wide class of expected values.
