We study the fully nonlinear dynamical Cosserat micropolar elasticity problem in space with three dimensionals with various energy functionals dependent on the microrotation $\overline{R}$ and the deformation gradient tensor $F$ . We derive a set of coupled nonlinear equations of motion from first principles by varying the complete energy functional. We obtain a double sine-Gordon equation and construct soliton solutions. We show how the solutions can determine the overall deformational behaviour and discuss the relations between wave numbers and wave velocities thereby identifying parameter values where the waves cannot propagate.
