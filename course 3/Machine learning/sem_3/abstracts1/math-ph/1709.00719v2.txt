We have studied free higher spin gauge fields through an investigation of their Hamiltonian dynamics. Over a flat space-time, their Hamiltonian constraints were identified and solved through the introduction of prepotentials, enjoying both linearized generalized diffeomorphism and linearized generalized Weyl rescaling gauge invariance, motivating our study of conformal invariants for higher spins. We built these with the Cotton tensor, whose properties (tracelessness, symmetry, divergencelessness; completeness, invariance) we established. With these geometric tools, a first order action was written down in terms of the prepotentials. It is manifestly invariant under electric-magnetic duality which, with the gauge freedom of the prepotentials, completely fixes the action. This action is associated to twisted self-duality conditions.   With an interest in supersymmetric extensions, we began to extend this study to fermions, similarly analyzing the spin $5/2$ massless free field, whose prepotential also enjoys conformal gauge invariance. The spin $2$-spin $5/2$ supermultiplet was considered, and a rigid symmetry of its action (a chirality-duality rotation) was built to commute with supersymmetry. We also investigated the properties of a mixed symmetry field on a flat six-dimensional space-time, the so-called chiral $(2,2)$-form: Hamiltonian analysis, prepotentials, and a first order action associated to self-duality conditions.   Finally, we studied both fermionic and bosonic higher spin surface charges over a constantly curved background space-time. The Hamitonian constraints are the generators of gauge transformations. Plugging into them appropriate values of the gauge parameters (imposing a physical variation of the fields), their finite and non-vanishing on-shell values were computed and recognized as conserved charges of the theory. Their algebra was checked to be abelian.
