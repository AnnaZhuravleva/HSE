In this work we give positive solution to the adiabatic limit problem in causal perturbative QED, as well as give a contribution to the solution of the convergence problem for the perturbative series in QED. The method is general enough to be applicable to more general causal perturbative QFT, such as Standard Model with the Higgs field. As a by-product we provide the spatial-infinity asymtotics of the interacting fields in QED, and realize the proof of charge univerality outlined by Staruszkiewicz. As another byproduct we give a completely knew perspective on the relation between the metric structure of space-time (understood as a spectrum of a certain commutative algebra of operators, with the metric structure determined likewise by operators in the way practiced in spectral formulation of geometry due to Connes) and the energy-momentum tensor undersood as an operator valued distribution. We show that there is a deep bi-unique interrelation between space-time geometry and free quantum fields which persists when passing to interacting fields. We show in particular that passing from free to interacting fields will necessary disturb space-time geometry. Under assumption (which we make precise in this work) that Einstein equations stay valid for coherent states (say in a quasi-classical limit), the gravitational constant can be computed from the relation joining space-time geometry with interacting fields.
