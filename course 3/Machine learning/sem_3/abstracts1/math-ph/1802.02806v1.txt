Equivariant twisted K theory classes on compact Lie groups $G$ can be realized as families of Fredholm operators acting in a tensor product of a fermionic Fock space and a representation space of a central extension of the loop algebra $LG$ using a supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The aim of the present article is to extend the construction to higher loop algebras using an abelian extension of a $3D$ current algebra. We have only partial success: Instead of true Fredholm operators we have formal algebraic expressions in terms of the generators of the current algebra and an infinite dimensional Clifford algebra. These give rise to sesquilinear forms in a Hilbert bundle which transform in the expected way with respect to $3D$ gauge transformations but do not define true Hilbert space operators.
