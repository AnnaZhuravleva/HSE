We compare two classes of functions arising from genus-one superstring amplitudes: modular and holomorphic graph functions. We focus on their analytic properties, we recall the known asymptotic behaviour of modular graph functions and we refine the formula for the asymptotic behaviour of holomorphic graph functions. Moreover, we give new evidence of a conjecture which relates these two asymptotic expansions.
