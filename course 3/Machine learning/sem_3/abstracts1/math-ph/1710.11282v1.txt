We derive the leading asymptotic approximation, for low angle {\theta}, of the Wigner rotation matrix elements $d^j_{m_1m_2}(\theta)$, uniform in $j,m_1$ and $m_2$. The result is in terms of a Bessel function of integer order. We numerically investigate the error for a variety of cases and find that the approximation can be useful over a significant range of angles. This approximation has application in the partial wave analysis of wavepacket scattering.
