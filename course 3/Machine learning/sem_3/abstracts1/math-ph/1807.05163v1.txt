We construct a rational extension of the truncated Calogero-Sutherland model by Pittman et al. The exact solution of this rationally extended model is obtained analytically and it is shown that while the energy eigenvalues remain unchanged, however the eigenfunctions are completely different and written in terms of exceptional X1 Laguerre orthogonal polynomials. The rational model is further extended to a more general, the Xm case by introducing m dependent interaction term. As expected, in the special case of m = 0, the extended model reduces to the conventional model of Pittman et al. In the two appropriate limits, we thereby obtain rational extensions of the celebrated Calogero-Sutherland as well as Jain-Khare models.
