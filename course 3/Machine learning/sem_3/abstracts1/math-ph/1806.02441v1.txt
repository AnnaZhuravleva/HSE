In 2008, Lehner, Wettig, Guhr and Wei conjectured a power series identity and showed that it implied a determinantal formula for a Bessel-type integral over the unitary supergroup. The integral is the supersymmetric extension of Bessel-type integrals over the unitary group appearing as partition functions in quantum chromodynamics. The identity is proved by interpreting both sides as the same unitary integral, which can be computed using the Cartan decomposition. An equivalent identity of Schur functions is also given and interpreted probabilistically.
