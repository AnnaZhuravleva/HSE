Motivated by the recent contribution \cite{BB17} we study the scaling limit behavior of a class of one-dimensional stochastic differential equations which has a unique attracting point subject to a small additional repulsive perturbation. Problems of this type appear in the analysis of continuously monitored quantum systems. We extend the results of \cite{BB17} and prove a general result concerning the convergence to a homogeneous Poisson process using only classical probabilistic tools.
