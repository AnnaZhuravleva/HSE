The notion of normal products, a generalization of Wick products, is derived with respect to BPHZ renormalization formulated entirely in configuration space. If inserted into time-ordered products, they admit the limit of coinciding field operators, which constitute the normal product. The derivation requires the introduction of Zimmermann identities, which relate field monomials or renormalization parts with differing subtraction degree. Furthermore, we calculate the action of wave operators on elementary fields inserted into time-ordered products using the properties of normal products.
