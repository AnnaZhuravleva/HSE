Starting from the wave equation for a medium with material properties that vary periodically, we study a system of recurrence relations that describe propagation of wave packets that oscillate on the microscale (i.e. on lengths of the order of the period of the medium) and vary slowly on the macroscale (i.e. on lengths that contain a large number of periods). The resulting equations contain a version of the geometric optics and the overall energy transport description for periodic media.
