We consider quantum systems described by the fractional powers of the negative Laplacian and the interaction potentials. When a slowly decaying potential function is given, we prove the nonexistence of the wave operators, under the assumption that the Dollard-type modified wave operators exist and that they are asymptotically complete. This nonexistence indicates the borderline between short-range and long-range behavior.
