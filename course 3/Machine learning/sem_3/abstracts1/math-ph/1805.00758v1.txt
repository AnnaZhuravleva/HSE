This article is concerned with compositions in the context of three standard quantizations in the Fock space framework, namely, anti-Wick, Wick and Weyl quantizations. The first one is a composition of states and is closely related to the standard scattering identification operator encountered in Quantum Electrodynamics for time dynamics issues. Anti-Wick quantization and Segal Bargmann transforms are implied there for that purpose. The other compositions are for observables (operators in some specific classes) for the Wick and Weyl symbols. For the Wick symbol of the composition of two operators, we obtain an absolutely converging series, and for the Weyl symbol, the remainder term of the asymptotic expansion is absolutely converging, still in the Fock spaces framework.
