The theory of quasifree quantum stochastic calculus for infinite-dimensional noise is developed within the framework of Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic calculus. The question of uniqueness for the covariance amplitude with respect to which a given unitary quantum stochastic cocycle is quasifree is addressed, and related to the minimality of the corresponding stochastic dilation. The theory is applied to the identification of a wide class of quantum random walks whose limit processes are driven by quasifree noises.
