In this paper we extend the analysis of magnetic monopoles in quantum mechanics in three dimensional rotationally invariant noncommutative space $\textbf{R}^3_\lambda$. We construct the model step-by-step and observe that physical objects known from previous studies appear in a very natural way. Nonassociativity became a topic of great interest lately, often in a connection with magnetic monopoles. We show that this model does not possess this property.
