This paper addresses an R(p,q)-deformed conformal Virasoro algebra with an arbitrary conformal dimension Delta. Wellknown deformations constructed in the literature are deduced as particular cases. Then, the special case of the conformal dimension Delta=1 is elucidated for its interesting properties. The R(p,q)-KdV equation, associated with the deformed Virasoro algebra, is also derived and discussed. Finally, the (p,q)-deformed energy-momentum tensor, consistent with the central extension term, is computed and analyzed.
