We discuss the application of recent results on generalized solutions to the Cauchy problem for hyperbolic systems to Dirac equations with external fields. In further analysis we focus on the question of existence of associated distributional limits and derive their explicit form in case of free Dirac fields with regularizations of initial values corresponding to point-like probability densities.
