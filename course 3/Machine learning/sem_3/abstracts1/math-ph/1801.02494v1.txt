This paper studies the quantum Boltzmann Nordheim equation from a Boltzmann equation for Haldane statistics. Strong solutions are obtained for the Cauchy problem with initial data in L1 and uniformly bounded on a one (resp. two or three)-dimensional torus for three-dimensional velocities and pseudo-Maxwellian (resp. very soft) forces. The main results are existence, uniqueness and stability of solutions conserving mass, momentum, and energy, with the uniform bound exploding if the solutions are only local in time.
