We prove the modified algebraic Bethe Ansatz characterization of the spectral problem for the closed XXX Heisenberg spin chain with an arbitrary twist and arbitrary positive (half)-integer spin at each site of the chain. We provide two basis to characterize the spectral problem and two families of inhomogeneous Baxter T-Q equations. The two families satisfy an inhomogeneous quantum Wronskian equation.
