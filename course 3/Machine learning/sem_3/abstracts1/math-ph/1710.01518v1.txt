We study generalised quantum waveguides in the presence of moderate and strong external magnetic fields. Applying recent results on the adiabatic limit of the connection Laplacian we show how to construct and compute effective Hamiltonians that allow, in particular, for a detailed spectral analysis of magnetic waveguide Hamiltonians. Using our general construction, we discuss a number of explicit examples and thereby recover known results as special cases.
