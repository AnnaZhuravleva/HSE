In this paper we consider pairs of interacting electrons moving in a simple quantum wire, namely the half-line. In particular, we extend the results obtained in [arXiv:1708.03753] by allowing for contact interactions of the Lieb-Liniger type between the two electrons constituting the pair. We construct the associated Hamiltonian rigorously and study its spectral properties. We then investigate Bose-Einstein condensation of pairs and prove, as a main result, the existence of condensation whenever the Hamiltonian has a non-trivial discrete spectrum. Most importantly, condensation is proved for very weak and very strong contact interactions.
