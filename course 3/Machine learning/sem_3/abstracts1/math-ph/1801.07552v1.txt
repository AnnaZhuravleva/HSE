We extend our approach of asymptotic parametrix construction for Hamiltonian operators from conical to edge-type singularities which is applicable to coalescence points of two particles of the helium atom and related two electron systems including the hydrogen molecule. Up to second order we have calculated the symbols of an asymptotic parametrix of the nonrelativisic Hamiltonian of the helium atom within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and provide explicit formulas for the corresponding Green operators which encode the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunctons near an edge.
