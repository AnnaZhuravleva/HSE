Elastic (stretching) flows of null curves are studied in three-dimensional Minkowski space. As a main tool, a natural type of moving frame for null curves is introduced, without use of the pseudo-arclength. This new frame is related to a Frenet null frame by a gauge transformation that belongs to the little group contained in the Lorentz group $SO(2,1)$ and provides an analog of the Hasimoto transformation (relating a parallel frame to a Frenet frame for curves in Euclidean space). The Cartan structure equations of the transformed frame are shown to encode a hereditary recursion operator giving a two-component generalization of the recursion operator of Burgers equation, as well as a generalization of the Cole-Hopf transformation. Three different hierarchies of integrable systems are obtained from the various symmetries of this recursion operator. The first hierarchy contains two-component Burgers-type and nonlinear Airy-type systems; the second hierarchy contains novel quasilinear Schr\"odinger-type (NLS) systems; and the third hierarchy contains semilinear wave equations (in two-component system form). Each of these integrable systems is shown to correspond to a geometrical flow of a family of elastic null curves in three-dimensional Minkowski space.
