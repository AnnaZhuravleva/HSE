In this paper we study a two-dimensional [2D] rotationally symmetric harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frictional force. At the classical level, we solve the equations of motion for a particular case of the time-dependent coefficient of friction. At the quantum level, we use the Lewis-Riesenfeld procedure of invariants to construct exact solutions for the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. The eigenfunctions obtained are in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials. By mean of the solutions we verify a generalization version of the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation and derive the generators of the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We construct the coherent states $\grave{\textrm{a}}$ la Barut-Girardello and $\grave{\textrm{a}}$ la Perelomov and respectively study their properties.
