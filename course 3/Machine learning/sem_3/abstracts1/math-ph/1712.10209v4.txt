We qualify the main features of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of point interaction for a three-dimensional quantum system consisting of three point-like particles, two identical fermions, plus a third particle of different species, with two-body interaction of zero range. For arbitrary magnitude of the interaction, and arbitrary value of the mass parameter (the ratio between the mass of the third particle and that of each fermion) above the stability threshold, we identify the essential spectrum, localise the discrete spectrum and prove its finiteness, qualify the angular symmetry of the eigenfunctions, and prove the increasing monotonicity of the eigenvalues with respect to the mass parameter. We also demonstrate the existence or absence of bound states in the physically relevant regimes of masses.
