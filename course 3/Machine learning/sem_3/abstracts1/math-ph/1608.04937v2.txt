Collective dynamics can be observed among many animal species, and have given rise in the last decades to an active and interdisciplinary field of study. Such behaviors are often modeled by active matter, in which each individual is self-driven and tends to update its velocity depending on the one of its neighbors.   In a classical model introduced by Vicsek and al., as well as in numerous related active matter models, a phase transition between chaotic behavior at high temperature and global order at low temperature can be observed. Even though ample evidence of these phase transitions has been obtained for collective dynamics, from a mathematical standpoint, such active systems are not fully understood yet. Significant progress has been achieved in the recent years under an assumption of mean-field interactions, however to this day, few rigorous results have been obtained for models involving purely local interactions.   In this paper, as a first step towards the mathematical understanding of active microscopic dynamics, we describe a lattice active particle system, in which particles interact locally to align their velocities. We obtain rigorously, using the formalism developed for hydrodynamic limits of lattice gases, the scaling limit of this out-of-equilibrium system.   This article builds on the multi-type exclusion model introduced by Quastel by detailing his proof and incorporating several generalizations, adding significant technical and phenomenological difficulties.
