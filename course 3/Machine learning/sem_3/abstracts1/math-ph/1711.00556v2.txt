We consider Hilbert's problem of the axioms of Physics at a qualitative or conceptual level. This issue is more pressing than ever as we seek to understand how both General Relativity and quantum theory could emerge from some deeper theory of quantum gravity, and in this regard I have previously proposed a `principle of self-duality' or `quantum Born reciprocity' as a key structure. Here I outline some of my recent work around the idea of quantum spacetime as motivated by this non-standard philosophy, including a new toy model of gravity on a spacetime consisting of four points forming a square.
