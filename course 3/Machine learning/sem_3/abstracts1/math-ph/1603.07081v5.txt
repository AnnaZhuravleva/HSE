In recent years a remarkable progress was made in the construction of spatial cloaks using the methods of transformation optics and metamaterials.   The temporal cloaking, i.e. the cloaking of an event in spacetime, was also widely studied by using transformations on spacetime domains.   We propose a simple and general method for the construction of temporal cloaking using the change of time variables only.
