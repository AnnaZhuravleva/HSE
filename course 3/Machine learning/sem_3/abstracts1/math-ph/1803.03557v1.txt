In the article [B.J.West, Exact solution to fractional logistic equation, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 429 (2015) 103-108], the author has obtained a function as the solution to fractional logistic equation (FLE). As demonstrated later in [I. Area, J. Losada, J. J. Nieto, A note on the fractional logistic equation, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 444 (2016) 182-187], this function (West function) is not the solution to FLE, but nevertheless as shown by West, it is in good agreement with the numerical solution to FLE. The West function indicates a compelling feature, in which the exponentials are substituted by Mittag-Leffler functions. In this paper, a modified fractional logistic equation (MFLE) is introduced, to which the West function is a solution. The proposed fractional integro-differential equation possesses a nonlinear additive term related to the solution of the logistic equation (LE). The method utilized in this article, may be applied to the analysis of solutions to nonlinear fractional differential equations of mathematical physics.
