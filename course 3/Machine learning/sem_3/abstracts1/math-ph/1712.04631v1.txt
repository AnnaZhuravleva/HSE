We show how the one-mode pseudo-bosonic ladder operators provide concrete examples of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension five. It is the first time that an algebraic-geometric structure of this kind is observed in the context of pseudo-bosonic operators. Indeed we don't find the well known Heisenberg algebras, which are involved in several quantum dynamical systems, but different Lie algebras which may be decomposed in the sum of two abelian Lie algebras in a prescribed way. We introduce the notion of semidirect sum (of Lie algebras) for this scope and find that it describes very well the behaviour of pseudo-bosonic operators in many quantum models.
