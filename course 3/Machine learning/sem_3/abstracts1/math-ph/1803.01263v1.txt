In this paper, we discuss several concepts of the modern theory of discrete integrable systems, including:   - Time discretization based on the notion of B\"acklund transformation;   - Symplectic realizations of multi-Hamiltonian structures;   - Interrelations between discrete 1D systems and lattice 2D systems;   - Multi-dimensional consistency as integrability of discrete systems;   - Interrelations between integrable systems of quad-equations and integrable systems of Laplace type;   - Pluri-Lagrangian structure as integrability of discrete variational systems.   All these concepts are illustrated by the discrete time Toda lattices and their relativistic analogs.
