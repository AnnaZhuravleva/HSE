We present a general infinite volume limit construction of probability measures obeying the Glimm-Jaffe axioms of Euclidean quantum field theory in arbitrary space-time dimension. In particular, we obtain measures that may be interpreted as corresponding to scalar quantum fields with arbitrary bounded continuous self-interaction. It remains however an open problem whether this general construction contains non-Gaussian measures.
