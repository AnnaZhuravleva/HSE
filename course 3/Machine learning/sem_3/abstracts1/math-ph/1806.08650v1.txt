We derive Fredholm determinant and series representation of the tau function of the Fuji-Suzuki-Tsuda system and its multivariate extension, thereby generalizing to higher rank the results obtained for Painlev\'e VI and the Garnier system. A special case of our construction gives a higher rank analog of the continuous hypergeometric kernel of Borodin and Olshanski. We also initiate the study of algebraic braid group dynamics of semi-degenerate monodromy, and obtain as a byproduct a direct isomonodromic proof of the AGT-W relation for $c=N-1$.
