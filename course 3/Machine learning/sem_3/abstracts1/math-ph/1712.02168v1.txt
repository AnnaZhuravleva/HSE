In this note we present explicit and elementary formulas for the correspondence between the group of special Lorentz transformation $SO^+(3,1)$, on the one hand, and its spin group $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$, on the other hand. Although we will not mention Clifford algebra terminology explicitly, it is hidden in our calculations by using complex $2\times2$-matrices. Nevertheless, our calculations are strongly motivated by the Clifford algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(4,\mathbb{C})$ of four-dimensional space-time.
