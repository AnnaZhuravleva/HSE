We propose variants of Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) that are related to superconformal algebras following the group theoretical formulation of SLE, in which the relevant stochastic differential equation is derived from a random process on an infinite dimensional Lie group. In this paper, we consider random processes on certain kind of groups of superconformal transformations generated by exponentiated elements of the Grassmann envelop of superconformal algebras. We also provide a prescription of obtaining local martingales from a representation of the superconformal algebra after integration by Grassmann variables.
