We consider a string in a space of canonical variables which are Weyl spinors with components in an infnite-dimensional split Clifford algebra. The Lorentz algebra for the quantum string is obtained from Poisson brackets in Clifford space and used to derive commutation relations for the Fourier modes of the open string. The Clifford algebra is augmented with the octonions through an R-algebra tensor product which generates a ten- dimensional Minkowski space. We apply the results of Manogue, Schray and Dray on octonionic Lorentz transformations to obtain a Lorentz in- variant string action.
