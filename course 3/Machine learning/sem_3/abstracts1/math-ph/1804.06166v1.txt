We consider a product of $2 \times 2$ random matrices which appears in the physics literature in the analysis of some 1D disordered models. These matrices depend on a parameter $\epsilon >0$ and on a positive random variable $Z$. Derrida and Hilhorst (J Phys A 16:2641, 1983, \S 3) predict that the corresponding characteristic exponent has a regular expansion with respect to $\epsilon$ up to --- and not further --- an order determined by the distribution of $Z$. We give a rigorous proof of that statement. We also study the singular term which breaks that expansion.
