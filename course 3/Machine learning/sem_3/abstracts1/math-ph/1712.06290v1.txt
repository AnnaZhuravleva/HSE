Weakly interacting quantum fluids allow for a natural kinetic theory description which takes into account the fermionic or bosonic nature of the interacting particles. In the simplest cases, one arrives at the Boltzmann-Nordheim equations for the reduced density matrix of the fluid. We discuss here two related topics: the kinetic theory of the fermionic Hubbard model, in which conservation of total spin results in an additional Vlasov type term in the Boltzmann equation, and the relation between kinetic theory and thermalization.
