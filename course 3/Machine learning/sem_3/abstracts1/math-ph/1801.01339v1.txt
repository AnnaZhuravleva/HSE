We apply the Lindstedt-Poincar\'{e} method to the Lotka-Volterra model and discuss alternative implementations of the approach. By means of an efficient systematic algorithm we obtain an unprecedented number of perturbation corrections for the two dynamical variables and the frequency. They enable us to estimate the radius of convergence of the perturbation series for the frequency as a function of the only model parameter. The method is suitable for the treatment of systems with any number of dynamical variables.
