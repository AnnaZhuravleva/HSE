The Dunkl operators associated to a necessarily finite Coxeter group acting on a Euclidean space are generalized to any finite group using the techniques of non-commutative geometry, as introduced by the authors to view the usual Dunkl operators as covariant derivatives in a quantum principal bundle with a quantum connection. The definitions of Dunkl operators and their corresponding Dunkl connections are generalized to quantum principal bundles over quantum spaces which possess a classical finite structure group. We introduce cyclic Dunkl connections and their cyclic Dunkl operators. Then we establish a number of interesting properties of these structures, including the characteristic zero curvature property. Particular attention is given to the example of complex reflection groups, and their naturally generalized siblings called groups of Coxeter type.
