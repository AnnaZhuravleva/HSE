In this paper, we consider an Ising model with three competing interactions on a triangular chandelier-lattice (TCL). We describe the existence, uniqueness, and non-uniqueness of translation-invariant Gibbs measures associated with the Ising model. We obtain an explicit formula for Gibbs measures with a memory of length 2 satisfying consistency conditions. It is proved rigorously that the model exhibits phase transitions only for given values of the coupling constants. As a consequence of our approach, the dichotomy between alternative solutions of Hamiltonian models on TCLs is solved. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results.
