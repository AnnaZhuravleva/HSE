We introduced few years ago a new notion of causality for noncommutative spacetimes directly related to the Dirac operator and the concept of Lorentzian spectral triple. In this paper, we review in a non-technical way the noncommutative causal structure of many toy models as almost commutative spacetimes and the Moyal-Weyl spacetime. We show that those models present some unexpected physical interpretations as a geometrical explanation of the Zitterbewegung trembling motion of a fermion as well as some geometrical constraints on translations and energy jumps of wave packets on the Moyal spacetime.
