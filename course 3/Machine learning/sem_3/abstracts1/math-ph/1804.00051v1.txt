We introduce Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states for non-unitary representations of non-compact groups, and discuss the main similarities and differences with respect to ordinary unitary Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states. The example of coherent states for the non-unitary finite dimensional representations of $SU(1,1)$ is considered and they are used to describe the propagation of light in coupled PT-symmetric optical devices.
