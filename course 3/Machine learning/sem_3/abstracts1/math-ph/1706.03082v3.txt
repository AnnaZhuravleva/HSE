The derivation of effective evolution equations is central to the study of non-stationary quantum many-body sytems, and widely used in contexts such as superconductivity, nuclear physics, Bose-Einstein condensation and quantum chemistry. We reformulate the Dirac-Frenkel approximation principle in terms of reduced density matrices, and apply it to fermionic and bosonic many-body systems. We obtain the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations, respectively. While we do not prove quantitative error estimates, our formulation does show that the approximation is optimal within the class of quasifree states. Furthermore, we prove well-posedness of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations in energy space and discuss conserved quantities.
