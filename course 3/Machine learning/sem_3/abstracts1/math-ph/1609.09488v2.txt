We propose and study a new approach to the topologization of spaces of (possibly not all) future-directed causal curves in a stably causal spacetime. It relies on parametrizing the curves "in accordance" with a chosen time function. Thus obtained topological spaces of causal curves are separable and completely metrizable, i.e. Polish. The latter property renders them particularly useful in the optimal transport theory. To illustrate this fact, we explore the notion of a causal time-evolution of measures in globally hyperbolic spacetimes and discuss its physical interpretation.
