We discuss gravitational lensing by elliptical galaxies with some particular mass distributions. Using simple techniques from the theory of quadrature domains and the Schwarz function (cf. \cite{Sh}) we show that when the mass density is constant on confocal ellipses, the total number of lensed images of a point source cannot exceed 5 (4 bright images and 1 dim image). Also, using the Dive--Nikliborc converse of the celebrated Newton's theorem concerning the potentials of ellipsoids, we show that ``Einstein rings'' must always be either circles (in the absence of a tidal shear), or ellipses.
