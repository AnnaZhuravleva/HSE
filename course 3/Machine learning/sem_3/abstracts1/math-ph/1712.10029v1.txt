We continue the study the ultraviolet problem for QED in d=3 using Balaban's formulation of the renormalization group. The model is defined on a fine toroidal lattice and we seek control as the lattice spacing goes to zero. In an earlier paper the renormalization group flow was controlled with a bounded field approximation. In this paper we lay the groundwork for controlling the large field corrections. The main result in part II is an ultraviolet stability bound in a fixed finite volume.
