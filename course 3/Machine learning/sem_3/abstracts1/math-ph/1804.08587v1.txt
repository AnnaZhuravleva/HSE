In this article, we study microscopic properties of a two-dimensional eigenvalue ensemble near a conical singularity arising from insertion of a point charge in the bulk of the support of eigenvalues. In particular, we characterize all rotationally symmetric scaling limits ('Mittag-Leffler fields') and obtain universality of them when the underlying potential is algebraic. Applications include a result on the asymptotic distribution of $\log|p_n(\zeta)|$ where $p_n$ is the characteristic polynomial of an $n$:th order random normal matrix.
