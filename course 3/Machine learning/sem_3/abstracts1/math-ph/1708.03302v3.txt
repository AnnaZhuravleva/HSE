Nonlinear PDE's having {\bf given} conditional symmetries are constructed. They are obtained starting from the invariants of the "conditional symmetry" generator and imposing the extra condition given by the characteristic of the symmetry. Several of examples starting from the Boussinesq and including non-autonomous Korteweg-De Vries like equations are given to showcase the methodology introduced.
