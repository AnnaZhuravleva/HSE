The matrix Schr\"odinger equation is considered on the half line with the general selfadjoint boundary condition at the origin described by two boundary matrices satisfying certain appropriate conditions. It is assumed that the matrix potential is integrable, is selfadjoint, and has a finite first moment. The corresponding scattering data set is constructed, and such scattering data sets are characterized by providing a set of necessary and sufficient conditions assuring the existence and uniqueness of the one-to-one correspondence between the scattering data set and the input data set containing the potential and boundary matrices. The work presented here provides a generalization of the classic result by Agranovich and Marchenko from the Dirichlet boundary condition to the general selfadjoint boundary condition.
