The more important difference between Riemann and pseudo Riemann manifolds is the metric signature and its theoretical consequences. The scientific literature in Riemann manifolds is sound and extensive. However, the practical application for Physics Theories becomes often impossible due to the signature consequences. Eg., some of the rich results in Riemann Geometry and Topology becomes invalid for Physics if they are based on the concept of positive semi definite norm. To avoid this problem, the proof machinery must avoid such assumption and must be based in other tools. This paper is a contribution to provide methodologies for Hodge decomposition and \poincare duality based on the concept of linear independence instead of positive norm.   As result, the Hodge decomposition and also the norm decomposition are expressed based on continuous and discrete terms. When this results are applied to Classical Electromagnetic Theory, in pseudo Riemann manifolds with minkowskian metric, magnitudes as the field norm and action have one discrete stepwise term. This result of quantization of the norm is a property of the Topology, in special of the Cohomology classes.
