The dominant method for defining multivariate operator means is to express them as fix-points under a contraction with respect to the Thompson metric. Although this method is powerful, it crucially depends on monotonicity. We are developing a technique to prove the existence of multivariate operator means that are not necessarily monotone. This gives rise to an entire new class of convex non-monotonic multivariate operator means.
