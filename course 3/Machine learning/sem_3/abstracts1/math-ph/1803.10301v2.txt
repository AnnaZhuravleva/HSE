We discuss connection between the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain in the limiting case of zero anisotropy and some aspects of enumerative combinatorics. The representation of the Bethe wave functions via the Schur functions allows to apply the theory of symmetric functions to calculation of the correlation functions. We provide a combinatorial derivation of the dynamical correlation functions of the projection operator in terms of nests of self-avoiding lattice paths.
