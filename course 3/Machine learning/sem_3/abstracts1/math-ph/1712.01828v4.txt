Making use of its smooth structure only, out of a connected oriented smooth 4-manifold a von Neumann algebra is constructed. As a special four dimensional phenomenon this von Neumann algebra is approximated by algebraic (i.e., formal) curvature tensors of the underlying 4-manifold and the von Neumann algebra itself is a hyperfinite factor of ${\rm II}_1$ type hence is unique up to abstract isomorphisms of von Neumann algebras. Nevertheless over a fixed 4-manifold this von Neumann algebra admits a representation on a Hilbert space such that its unitary equivalence class is preserved by orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms. Consequently the Murray--von Neumann coupling constant of this representation is well-defined and gives rise to a new and computable real-valued smooth 4-manifold invariant.   Some consequences of this construction for quantum gravity are also discussed. Namely reversing the construction by starting not with a particular smooth 4-manifold but with the unique hyperfinite ${\rm II}_1$ factor, a conceptually simple but manifestly four dimensional, covariant, non-perturbative and genuinely quantum theory is introduced whose classical limit is general relativity in an appropriate sense. Therefore it is reasonable to consider it as a sort of quantum theory of gravity. In this model, among other interesting things, the observed positive but small value of the cosmological constant acquires a natural explanation.
