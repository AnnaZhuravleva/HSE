We introduce a class of linear maps irreducibly covariant with respect to the finite group generated by the Weyl operators. This group provides a direct generalization of the quaternion group. In particular, we analyze the irreducibly covariant quantum channels; that is, the completely positive and trace-preserving linear maps. Interestingly, imposing additional symmetries leads to the so-called generalized Pauli channels, which were recently considered in the context of the non-Markovian quantum evolution. Finally, we provide examples of irreducibly covariant positive but not necessarily completely positive maps.
