Based on operators borrowed from scattering theory, several concrete realizations of index theorems are proposed. The corresponding operators belong to some C*-algebras of pseudo-differential operators with coefficients which either have limits at plus and minus infinity, or which are periodic or asymptotically periodic, or which are uniformly almost periodic. These various situations can be deduced from a single partial isometry which depends on several parameters. All computations are explicitly performed.
