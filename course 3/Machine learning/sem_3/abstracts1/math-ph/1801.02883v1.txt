We consider a system of N fermions in the mean-field regime interacting though an inverse power law potential $V(x)=1/|x|^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha\in(0,1]$. We prove the convergence of a solution of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation to a solution of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equation in the sense of reduced density matrices. We stress the dependence on the singularity of the potential in the regularity of the initial data. The proof is an adaptation of [22], where the case $\alpha=1$ is treated.
