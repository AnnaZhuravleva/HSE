We provide a direct combinatorial formula for the interacting star product in perturbative Algebraic Quantum Field Theory (pAQFT). Our expression is non-perturbative in the coupling constant and is well defined on regular observables if the interaction is also regular. Under the same assumptions, we also show that the quantum M{\o}ller operator exists non-perturbatively (in the coupling constant) provided that the classical M{\o}ller operator can be constructed exactly. This provides a first step towards understanding how pAQFT can be formulated such that the only formal parameter is $\hbar$, while the coupling constant can be treated as a number.   In the introductory part of the paper, apart from reviewing the framework, we make precise several statements present in the pAQFT literature and recast these in the language of (formal) deformation quantization. Finally, we use our formalism to streamline the proof of perturbative agreement provided by Drago, Hack, and Pinamonti and to generalize some of the results obtained in that work to the case of a non-linear interaction.
