We study two different types of gluing for graphs: interface (obtained by choosing a common subgraph as the gluing component) and bridge gluing (obtained by adding a set of edges to the given subgraphs). We introduce formulae for computing even and odd Laplacians of graphs obtained by gluing, as well as their spectra. We subsequently discuss applications to quantum mechanics and bounds for the Fiedler value of the gluing of graphs.
