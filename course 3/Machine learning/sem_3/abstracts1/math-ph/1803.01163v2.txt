In this paper, we study the truncated two-particle correlation function in particle systems with long range interactions. For Coulombian and soft potentials, we define and give well-posedness results for the equilibrium correlations. In the Coulombian case, we prove the onset of the Debye screening length in the equilibrium correlations, for suitable velocity distributions. Additionally, we give precise estimates on the effective range of interaction between particles. In the case of soft potential interaction the equilibrium correlations and their fluxes in the space of velocities are shown to be linearly stable.
