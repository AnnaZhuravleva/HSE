We show that the asymptotic formula for $\pi$, the Wallis formula, that was related with quantum mechanics and the hydrogen atom in \cite{HF}, can also be related to the harmonic oscillator using a quantum duality between these two systems. As a corollary we show that this very interesting asymptotic formula is not related with the hydrogen atom or quantum mechanics itself but with a clever choice of a trial function and a potential in the Schroedinger equation when we use the variational approach to calculate the ground state energy associated with the given potential function.
