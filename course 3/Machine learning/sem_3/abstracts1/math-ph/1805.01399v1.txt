The paper presents a new method of geometric solution of a Schrodinger equation by a construction of an equivalent first-order partial differential equation with a bigger number of variables. The equivalent equation shall be restricted to a specific subspace with auxiliary conditions which are obtained from a coherent state transform. The method is applied to the fundamental case of the harmonic oscillator and coherent state transform generated by the minimal nilpotent step three Lie group---the shear group (also known as quartic group in literature). We obtain a geometric solution for an arbitrary minimal uncertainty state used as a fiducial vector. In contrast, it is shown that the well-known Fock--Segal--Bargmann transform and the Heisenberg group require the specific fiducial vector to produce a geometric solution. A technical aspect considered in this paper is that the representation of the shear group is not square-integrable and a respective modification of a coherent state transform is required.
