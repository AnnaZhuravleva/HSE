Scattering of a wave of frequency $\omega$ by a complex structure coupled to the external through $N$ channels, such as the electronic wave in a chaotic quantum dot, can be encoded in the on-shell scattering $N\times N$ matrix $\mathcal{S}(\omega)$. Temporal aspects of the scattering process can be analysed through the concept of time delays. Within a random matrix approach, we study the statistical properties of the symmetrised Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix $\mathcal{Q}_s(\omega)=-\mathrm{i}\mathcal{S}^{-1/2}\big(\partial_\omega\mathcal{S}\big)\,\mathcal{S}^{-1/2}$. We obtain the joint distribution for $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}_s$, for quantum dots with non-ideal contacts, characterised by a finite transmission probability (per channel) $0<T\leq1$. We derive two representations of the distribution of $\mathcal{Q}_s$ in terms of matrix integrals (the general case of unequally coupled channels is also discussed). We consider the Wigner time delay $\tau_\mathrm{W}=(1/N)\mathrm{tr}\big\{\mathcal{Q}_s\big\}$, which is an important quantity serving as a measure of the density of states of the open system. Using the distribution of the symmetrised Wigner-Smith matrix $\mathcal{Q}_s$, we determine the distribution $\mathscr{P}_{N,\beta}(\tau)$ of the Wigner time delay for uniform couplings in the weak coupling limit $NT\ll1$ ($\beta$ is the Dyson index).
