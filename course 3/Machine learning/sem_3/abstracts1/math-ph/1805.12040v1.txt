It is known that any Poisson manifold can be embedded into a bigger space which admites a description in terms of the canonical Poisson structure, i.e., Darboux coordinates. Such a procedure is known as a symplectic realization and has a number of important applications like quantization of the original Poisson manifold. In the present paper we extend the above idea to the case of quasi-Poisson structures which should not necessarily satisfy the Jacobi identity. For any given quasi-Poisson structure $\Theta$ we provide a recursive procedure of the construction of a symplectic manifold, as well as the corresponding expression in the Darboux coordinates, which we look in form of the generalized Bopp shift. Our construction is illustrated on the exemples of the constant $R$-flux algebra, quasi-Poisson structure isomorphic to the commutator algebra of imaginary octonions and the non-geometric M-theory $R$-flux backgrounds. In all cases we derive explicit formulae for the symplectic realization and the generalized Bopp shift. We also discuss possible applications of the obtained mathematical structures.
