We present an axiomatic modification of quaternionic quantum mechanics with a possible-worlds semantics capable of predicting essential "nonquantum" features of an observable universe model - the dimensionality and topology of spacetime, the existence, the signature and a specific form of a metric on it, and certain naturally distinguished directions (vistas) in spacetime unrelated to its metric properties.
