We establish existence of order-disorder phase transitions for a class of "non-sliding" hard-core lattice particle systems on a lattice in two or more dimensions. All particles have the same shape and can be made to cover the lattice perfectly in a finite number of ways. We also show that the pressure and correlation functions have a convergent expansion in powers of the inverse of the fugacity. This implies that the Lee-Yang zeros lie in an annulus with finite positive radii.
