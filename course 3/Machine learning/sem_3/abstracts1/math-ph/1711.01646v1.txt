In [1,2] we have developed a method (we call it the S-function method) that is successful in treating certain classes of rational second order ordinary differential equations (rational 2ODEs) that are particularly `resistant' to canonical Lie methods and to Darbouxian approaches. In this present paper, we generalize the S-function method making it capable of dealing with a class of elementary 2ODEs presenting elementary functions. Then, we apply this method to a Duffing-Van der Pol forced oscillator, obtaining an entire class of first integrals.
