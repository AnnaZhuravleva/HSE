We show that representations of the loop braid group arise from Aharonov-Bohm type effects in finite 2-group (3+1)-dimensional topological higher gauge theory. For this we introduce a minimal categorification of biracks, which we call bikoids. Our main example of bikoids arises from finite 2-groups, realised as crossed modules of groups. Given a bikoid, and hence a groupoid of symmetries, we construct a family of unitary representations of the loop braid group derived from representations of the groupoid algebra. We thus give a candidate for higher Bais' flux metamorphosis, and hence also a version of a `higher quantum group'.
