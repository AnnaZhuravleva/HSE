Recently, there has been observed an interesting correspondence between supersymmetric quiver gauge theories with four supercharges and integrable lattice models of statistical mechanics such that the two-dimensional spin lattice is the quiver diagram, the partition function of the lattice model is the partition function of the gauge theory and the Yang-Baxter equation expresses the identity of partition functions for dual pairs. This correspondence is a powerful tool which enables us to generate new integrable models. The aim of the present paper is to give a short account on a progress in integrable lattice models which has been made due to the relationship with supersymmetric gauge theories.
