An interesting attempt for solving infrared divergence problems via the theory of generalized wave operators was made by P. Kulish and L. Faddeev. Our method of using the ideas from the theory of generalized wave operators is essentially different. We assume that the unperturbed operator $A_0$ is known and that the scattering operator $S$ and the unperturbed operator $A_0$ are permutable. (In the Kulish-Faddeev theory this basic property is not fulfilled.) The permutability of $S$ and $A_0$ gives us an important information about the structure of the scattering operator. We show that the divergences appeared because the deviations of the initial and final waves from the free waves were not taken into account. The approach is demonstrated on important examples.
