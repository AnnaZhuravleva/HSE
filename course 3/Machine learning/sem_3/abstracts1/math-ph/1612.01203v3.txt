In the setting of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes, we consider Klein-Gordon fields subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, with mass satisfying the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We introduce a condition on the b-wave front set of two-point functions of quantum fields, which locally in the bulk amounts to the usual Hadamard condition, and which moreover allows to estimate wave front sets for the holographically induced theory on the boundary. We prove the existence of two-point functions satisfying this condition, and show their uniqueness modulo terms that have smooth Schwartz kernel in the bulk and have smooth restriction to the boundary. Finally, using Vasy's propagation of singularities theorem, we prove an analogue of Duistermaat and H\"ormander's theorem on distinguished parametrices.
