The mapping of time-evolving random matrices to their characteristic polynomials is considered as generating vortical complex wave functions. The vortex cores, associated with complex eigenvalues of the matrix that serve as screw-type branch points for the associated wave-function phase, exhibit rich dynamics upon temporal evolution. These topological dynamics are extended to include anti-vortices and non-vortical topological defects: phase maxima, phase minima and phase saddles. The commutative group structure for complexes of such defects generates a hierarchy of aggregates, which undergo topologically-allowed reactions. The equations of motion for the polynomial wave function, and for its associated phase defects, may be inferred from the evolution equation for the random matrices. Several special cases, including defect-line bubbles and knots, are discussed from both an analytical and computational perspective.
