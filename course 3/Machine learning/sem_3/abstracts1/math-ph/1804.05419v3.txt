Why is the manifold topology in a spacetime taken for granted? Why do we prefer to use Riemann open balls as basic-open sets, while there also exists a Lorentz metric? Which topology is a best candidate for a spacetime; a topology sufficient for the description of spacetime singularities or a topology which incorporates the causal structure? Or both? Is it more preferable to have a topology with as many physical properties as possible, whose description might be complicated and counterintuitive, or a topology which can be described via a countable basis but misses some important information? These are just a few from the questions that we ask in this Chapter, which serves as a critical review of the terrain and contains a survey with remarks, corrections and open questions.
