We associate real and regular algebraic-geometric data to each multi-line soliton solution of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KP) equation. These solutions are known to be parametrized by points of the totally non-negative part of real Grassmannians $Gr^{TNN} (k,n)$. In Ref. 3 we were able to construct real algebraic-geometric data for soliton data in the main cell $Gr^{TP} (k,n)$ only. Here we do not just extend that construction to all points in $Gr^{TNN} (k,n)$, but we also considerably simplify it, since both the reducible rational M-curve $\Gamma$ and the real regular KP divisor on $\Gamma$ are directly related to the parametrization of positroid cells in $Gr^{TNN} (k,n)$ via the Le-networks introduced in Ref. 61. Finally, we apply our construction to soliton data in $Gr^{TP}(2,4)$ and we compare it with that in Ref. 3.
