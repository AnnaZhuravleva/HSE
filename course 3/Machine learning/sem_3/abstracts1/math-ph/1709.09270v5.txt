We present a new method to compute R\'enyi entropies in one-dimensional critical systems. The null-vector conditions on the twist fields in the cyclic orbifold allow us to derive a differential equation for their correlation functions. The latter are then determined by standard bootstrap techniques. We apply this method to the calculation of various R\'enyi entropies in the non-unitary Yang-Lee model.
