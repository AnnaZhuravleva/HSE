The factorisation method commonly used in linear supersymmetric quantum mechanics is extended, such that it can be applied to nonlinear quantum mechanical systems. The new method is distinguishable from the linear formalism, as the superpotential is forced to become eigenfunction-dependent. An example solution is given for the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and its supersymmetric partner equation. This method allows new nonlinear evolution equations to be constructed from the solutions of known nonlinear equations, and has the potential to be a useful tool for mathematicians and physicists working in the field of nonlinear systems, allowing the discovery of previously unknown `dualities' amongst soliton solutions and their respective equations.
