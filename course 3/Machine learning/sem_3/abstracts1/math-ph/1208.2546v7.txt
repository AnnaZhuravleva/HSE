In this paper the inverse problem of the correspondence between the solutions of the Dirac equation and the electromagnetic 4-potentials, is fully solved. The Dirac solutions are classified into two classes. The first one consists of degenerate Dirac solutions corresponding to an infinite number of 4-potentials while the second one consists of non-degenerate Dirac solutions corresponding to one and only one electromagnetic 4-potential. Explicit expressions for the electromagnetic 4-potentials are provided in both cases. Further, in the case of the degenerate Dirac solutions, it is proven that at least two 4-potentials are gauge inequivalent, and consequently correspond to different electromagnetic fields. An example is provided to illustrate this case.
