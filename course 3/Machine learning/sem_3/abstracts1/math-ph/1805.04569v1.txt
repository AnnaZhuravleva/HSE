We analyze a phase-field approximation of a sharp-interface model for two- phase materials proposed by M. Silhavy [32, 33]. The distinguishing trait of the model resides in the fact that the interfacial term is Eulerian in nature, for it is defined on the deformed configuration. We discuss a functional frame allowing for existence of phase- field minimizers and {\Gamma}-convergence to the sharp-interface limit. As a by-product, we provide additional detail on the admissible sharp-interface configurations with respect to the analysis in [32, 33].
