We explicitly compute limit shapes for several grand canonical Gibbs ensembles of partitions of integers. These ensembles appear in models of aggregation and are also related to invariant measures of zero range and coagulation-fragmentation processes. We show, that all possible limit shapes for these ensembles fall into several distinct classes determined by the asymptotics of the internal energies of aggregates.
