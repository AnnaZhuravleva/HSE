The paper deals with a problem of asymptotic soliton like solutions to the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equaion with a small parameter at the highest derivative and variable coefficients depending on the variables $x$, $t$ as well as a small parameter. There is proposed an algorithm of constructing the solutions and there are proved theorems on accuracy with which the solutions satisfy the BBM equation.
