We consider two examples of dynamical semigroups obtained by singular perturbations of a standard generator which are special case of unbounded completely positive perturbations studied in detail in [10]. In the section 2 we propose a generalization of an example from [1] aimed to give a positive answer to a conjecture of Arveson. In the section 3 we consider in greater detail an improved and simplified construction of a nonstandard dynamical semigroup outlined in our short communication [13].
