In the two papers of this series, we initiate the development of a new approach to implementing the concept of symmetry in classical field theory, based on replacing Lie groups/algebras by Lie groupoids/algebroids, which are the appropriate mathematical tools to describe local symmetries when gauge transformations are combined with space-time transformations. In this second part, we shall adapt the formalism developed in the first paper to the context of gauge theories and deal with minimal coupling and Utiyama's theorem.
