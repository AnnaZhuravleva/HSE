Single-valuedness of the eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians is proposed as a natural quantisation condition. Separation of Variables can be used to relate the classification of eigenstates to the classification of projective structures with Fuchsian holonomy. Using complex Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates one may reformulate the quantisation conditions in terms of the generating function for the variety of opers. These results are interpreted as a variant of the geometric Langlands correspondence.
