In this note we give a concise review of the present state-of-art for the problem of self-adjoint realisations for the Dirac operator with a Coulomb-like singular scalar potential $V(\vec x)=\phi(\vec x) I_4$. We try to follow the historical and conceptual path that leads to the present understanding of the problem and to highlight the techniques employed and the main ideas. In the final part we outline a few major open questions that concern the topical problem of the multiplicity of self-adjoint realisations of the model, and which are worth addressing in the future.
