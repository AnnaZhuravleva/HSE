Solid-state single-photon emitters are key components for integrated quantum photonic devices. However, they can suffer from poor extraction efficiencies, caused by the large refractive index contrast between the bulk material they are embedded in and air: this results in a small fraction (that can be as low as <1%) of the emitted photons reaching free-space collection optics. To overcome this issue, we present a device that combines a metallic nano-ring, positioned on the sample surface and centered around the emitter, and an epoxy-based super-solid immersion lens, deterministically deposited above the ring devices. We show that the combined broadband lensing effect of the nano-ring and of the super-solid immersion lens significantly increases the extraction of light emitted by single InAs/GaAs quantum dots into free space: we observe enhancements in the emitted intensity by the nano-ring of up to a factor 20 and by the super-solid immersion lens of up to a factor 10. Such cumulative enhancements allow us to measure photon fluxes approaching 1 million counts per second, from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot in bulk. The combined broad-band enhancement in the extraction of light can be implemented with any kind of classical and quantum solid-state emitter and opens the path to the realisation of scalable bright devices. The same approach can also be implemented to improve the absorption of light, for instance for small-area broadband photo-detectors.
