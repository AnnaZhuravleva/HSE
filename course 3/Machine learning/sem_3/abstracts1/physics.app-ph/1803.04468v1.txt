We report a compact, scalable, quantum photonic integrated circuit realised by combining multiple, independent InGaAs/GaAs quantum-light-emitting-diodes (QLEDs) with a silicon oxynitride waveguide circuit. Each waveguide joining the circuit can then be excited by a separate, independently electrically contacted QLED. We show that the emission from neighbouring QLEDs can be independently tuned to degeneracy using the Stark Effect and that the resulting photon streams are indistinguishable. This enables on-chip Hong-Ou-Mandel-type interference, as required for many photonic quantum information processing schemes.
