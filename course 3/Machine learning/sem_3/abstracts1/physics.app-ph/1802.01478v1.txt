The aim of this paper is to implement a modified Perturb and Observe algorithm (P\&O), in order to solve the oscillations problem of photovoltaic (PV) power output generated by the conventional P\&O algorithm. A comparison between the novel and the basic P\&O algorithms is made. The first is implemented using embedded C language; the second is implemented using analog blocks. Next, the simulation study is made to present the response of the modified method to rapid temperature, solar irradiance and load change.
