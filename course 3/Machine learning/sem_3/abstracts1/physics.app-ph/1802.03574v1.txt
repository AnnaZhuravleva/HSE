Monte Carlo simulations show similarity on radial distributions of power and isotopic concentration at any effective depletion time among five kinds of fuel-cladding combinations with the same cycle length, including the normal UO2-zircaloy combination, the candidate Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) UO2/U3Si2-FeCrAl combination, and three kinds of candidate ATF U3Si2-FeCrAl combinations. An analytical formula f(x,s) including the depletion time (s) and the relative radial (x) is proposed to describe the radial properties for all five kinds of fuel-cladding combinations. f(x,s) has the form of the second order polynomial term of s with the exponential type of coefficients depending on x. It is shown that the suggested function f(x,s) gives a nice description on the simulation data with rather small deviations and can immediately provide radial distribution of power, burnup, and isotopic concentration of 235,238U and 239,241Pu at any effective depletion time and relative radius. It is useful to discuss the fuel temperature through the present analytical formula. The present work provides an analytical formula to describe the radial properties of the ATF which is expected to be helpful for further neutronic and multi-physics coupling study.
