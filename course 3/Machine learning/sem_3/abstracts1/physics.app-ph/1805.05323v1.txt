Reconfigurability of integrated photonic chips plays a key role in current experiments in the area of linear-optical quantum computing. We demonstrate a reconfigurable multiport interferometer implemented as a femtosecond laser-written integrated photonic device. The device includes a femtosecond laser-written $4\times 4$ multiport interferometer equipped with 12 thermooptical phase shifters, making it a universal programmable linear-optical circuit. We achieve a record fast switching time for a single nested Mach-Zender interferometer of $\sim10$ ms and quantitatively analyse the reconfigurability of the optical circuit. We believe, that our results will improve the current state of quantum optical experiments utilizing femtosecond laser-written photonic circuits.
