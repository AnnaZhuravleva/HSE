Microring resonators are critical photonic components used in filtering, sensing and nonlinear applications. To date, the development of high performance microring resonators in LNOI has been limited by the sidewall angle, roughness and etch depth of fabricated rib waveguides. We present large free spectral range microring resonators based on our low-loss, high-index contrast waveguides in $Z$-cut LNOI. Our microring resonators achieve an FSR greater than 5 nm and a large 3 dB resonance bandwidth. This work will enable efficient on-chip filtering in LNOI and precede future, more complex, microring resonator networks and nonlinear field enhancement applications.
