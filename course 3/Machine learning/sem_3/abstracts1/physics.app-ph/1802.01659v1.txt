In order to transmute long-lived MAs and flatten power distribution in a PWR MOX fuel assembly, the authors have proposed to replace some high power fuel rods by MAs loaded fuel rods. The present work proves the high efficiency of long-lived MAs transmutation in a PWR MOX assembly with 92 fuel rods with 3% MAs loaded. The power and the burnup distribution have been flatted by using the MAs loading method proposed by authors. The 237Np loading method is expected for the transmutation by comparing with natural decay time to achieve the same reduction. The mixed MAs loading has better behaviors on power flattening and negative contribution of reactivity. In addition, the mixed MAs loading can largely reduce the quantity of 241Am, while the addition of other MAs has no influence on the transmutation efficiency of 237Np.
