Precisely evaluating the systematic error induced by the quadratic Zeeman effect is important for developing atom interferometer gravimeters aiming at an accuracy in the regime ( ). This paper reports on the experimental investigation of Raman spectroscopy-based magnetic field measurements and the evaluation of the systematic error in the Gravimetric Atom Interferometer (GAIN) due to quadratic Zeeman effect. We discuss Raman duration and frequency step size dependent magnetic field measurement uncertainty, present vector light shift (VLS) and tensor light shift (TLS) induced magnetic field measurement offset, and map the absolute magnetic field inside the interferometer chamber of GAIN with an uncertainty of 0.72 nT and a spatial resolution of 12.8 mm. We evaluate the quadratic Zeeman effect induced gravity measurement error in GAIN as . The methods shown in this paper are important for precisely mapping the absolute magnetic field in vacuum and reducing the quadratic Zeeman effect induced systematic error in Raman transition-based precision measurements, such as atomic interferometer gravimeters.
