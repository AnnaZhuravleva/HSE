Quantum photonics plays a crucial role in the development of novel communication and sensing technologies. Color centers hosted in silicon carbide and diamond offer single photon emission and long coherence spins that can be scalably implemented in quantum networks. We develop systems that integrate these color centers with photonic devices that modify their emission properties through electromagnetically tailored light and matter interaction.
