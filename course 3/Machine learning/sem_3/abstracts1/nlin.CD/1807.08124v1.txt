Recently, there has been provided two chaotic models based on the twist-deformation of classical Henon-Heiles system. First of them has been constructed on the well-known, canonical space-time noncommutativity, while the second one on the Lie-algebraically type of quantum space, with two spatial directions commuting to classical time. In this article, we find the direct link between mentioned above systems, by synchronization both of them in the framework of active control method. Particularly, we derive at the canonical phase-space level the corresponding active controllers as well as we perform (as an example) the numerical synchronization of analyzed models.
