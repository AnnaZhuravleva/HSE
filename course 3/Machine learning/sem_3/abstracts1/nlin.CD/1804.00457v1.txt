We present effects of an external driving on the tunneling dynamics of interacting bosons confined in a double well potential. At large values of a periodic driving potential, the dynamics become chaotic, with a distinct difference between tuning of the amplitude or the phase of the driving term with regard to the route leading to chaos. For example, we find that a controlled increase in the amplitude of the driving term with a fixed phase leads to quasiperiodic route to chaos. While tuning of the frequency with a fixed (large) amplitude leads to a crisis induced intermittency route to a chaotic dynamics, where the system intermittently visits different attractors in the phase space. Surprisingly, a chirp frequency superposed on a harmonic signal suppresses the chaotic motion, thereby yielding an orderly dynamics, pretty similar to a (damped) Rabi oscillation.
