Starting from a semiclassical approach recently developed for spectral correlation functions of quantum systems whose classical dynamics is chaotic, we focus on the case of broken time-reversal symmetry, the so-called unitary class. We obtain to all orders in perturbation theory the non-oscillatory parts of all correlation functions, showing that the off-diagonal contributions to these correlation functions cancel. The innovation that allows this calculation to be performed is the introduction of an auxiliary matrix model which is governed by the same diagrammatic rules as the semiclassical approach and which can be exactly solved.
