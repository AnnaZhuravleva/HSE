We study an autoresonant asymptotic behaviour for nonlinear oscillators under slowly changing frequency and amplitude of external driver. As a result we obtain formulas for threshold values of amplitude and frequency of the driver when autoresonant behaviour for the nonlinear oscillator is observed. Also we study a capture into resonance and emission out of the resonance for trajectories of the oscillator. A measure of autoresonant asymptotic behaviours for nonlinear oscillator is obtained.
