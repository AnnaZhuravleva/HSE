The most general and versatile defining feature of quantum chaotic systems is that they possess an energy spectrum universally described by random matrix theory (RMT). This feature can be exhibited by systems with a well defined classical limit as well as by systems with no classical correspondence, such as locally interacting spins or fermions. Despite great phenomenological success, a general mechanism explaining the emergence of RMT without reference to semiclassical concepts is still missing. Here we provide exact analytical results for the energy spectrum of the Floquet propagator of the kicked Ising spin-1/2 chain with longitudinal and transverse fields. Specifically, we write the Fourier transform of spectral density's two-point function, the spectral form factor, in terms of a partition function of a two-dimensional classical Ising model featuring a space-time duality. We show that the self-dual cases provide a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos, where the spectral form factor is demonstrated to match RMT for all values of the integer time variable $t$ in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we rigorously prove RMT form factor for odd $t$, while we formulate a precise conjecture for even $t$. Our results imply ergodicity for any finite amount of disorder in the longitudinal field, rigorously excluding the possibility of many-body localization.
