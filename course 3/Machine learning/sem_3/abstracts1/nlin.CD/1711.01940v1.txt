The field of quantum chaos originated in the study of spectral statistics for interacting many-body systems, but this heritage was almost forgotten when single-particle systems moved into the focus. In recent years new interest emerged in many-body aspects of quantum chaos. We study a chain of interacting, kicked spins and carry out a semiclassical analysis that is capable of identifying all kinds of genuin many-body periodic orbits. We show that the collective many-body periodic orbits can fully dominate the spectra in certain cases.
