Recently, the development of quantum chips has made great progress-- the number of qubits is increasing and the fidelity is getting higher. However, qubits of these chips are not always fully connected, which sets additional barriers for implementing quantum algorithms and programming quantum programs. In this paper, we introduce a general circuit optimizing scheme, which can efficiently adjust and optimize quantum circuits according to arbitrary given qubits' layout by adding additional quantum gates, exchanging qubits and merging single-qubit gates. Compared with the optimizing algorithm of IBM's QISKit, the quantum gates consumed by our scheme is 74.7%, and the execution time is only 12.9% on average.
