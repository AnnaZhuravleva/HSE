With the nonuniform media taken into account, the nonisospectral and variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation, which describes various physical situations such as fluid dynamics and plasma, is under investigation in this paper. With appropriate selection of wave functions, the Darboux transformation is constructed, by which the multi-soliton solutions are derived and graphs are presented. The spectral parameters, coefficients and initial phase are discussed analytically and numerically to demonstrate their respective effect on the soliton dynamics, which plays a role in achieving the feasible soliton management with explicit conditions taken into account.
