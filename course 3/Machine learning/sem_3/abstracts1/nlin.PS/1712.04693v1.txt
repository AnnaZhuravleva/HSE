We study the dynamics and interaction of coaxial vortex rings in the FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable medium. We find that threading vortex rings with a vortex string results in significant qualitative differences in their evolution and interaction. In particular, threading prevents the annihilation of rings in a head-on collision, allows generic ring overtaking, and can even reverse the direction of motion of a ring. We identify that an important mechanism for producing this new behaviour is that threaded vortex rings interact indirectly via induced twisting of the threading vortex string.
