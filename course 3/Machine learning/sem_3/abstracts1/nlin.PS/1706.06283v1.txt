The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation provides a simple mathematical model of cardiac tissue as an excitable medium hosting spiral wave vortices. Here we present extensive numerical simulations studying long-term dynamics of knotted vortex string solutions for all torus knots up to crossing number 11. We demonstrate that FitzHugh-Nagumo evolution preserves the knot topology for all the examples presented, thereby providing a novel field theory approach to the study of knots. Furthermore, the evolution yields a well-defined minimal length for each knot that is comparable to the ropelength of ideal knots. We highlight the role of the medium boundary in stabilizing the length of the knot and discuss the implications beyond torus knots. By applying Moffatt's test we are able to show that there is not a unique attractor within a given knot topology.
