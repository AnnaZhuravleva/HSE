A model of nonlinear elastic medium with internal structure is considered. The medium is assumed to contain cavities, microcracks or inclusions consisting of substances that differ sharply in physical properties from the base material. To describe the wave processes in such a medium, the averaged values of physical fields are used. This leads to nonlinear evolutionary PDEs, differing from the classical balance equations. Using some transformations, these equations can be presented in the Hamiltonian form. It is shown that the system under investigation has a family of invariant soliton-like solutions. The present work is devoted to study of the spectral stability of the solitary wave solutions.
