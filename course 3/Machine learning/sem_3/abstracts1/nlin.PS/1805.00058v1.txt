We address the construction of analytically integrable complex-valued potentials by linear superpositions of fundamental bright and dark optical solitons that solve cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equations. The real part of the potentials coincides with the bright soliton intensity. The imaginary part results from the convolution of the bright soliton with its concomitant, a localized dark excitation that arises from repulsive nonlinearities in the media. In general, the method leads to the Gross-Pitaevskii nonlinear differential equation, so the above results correspond to the absence of external interactions. The potentials presented here may find applications in the study of self-focussing signals that propagate in nonlinear media with balanced gain and loss since they are parity-time symmetrical.
