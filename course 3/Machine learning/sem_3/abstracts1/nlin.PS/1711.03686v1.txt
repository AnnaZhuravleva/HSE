Whitham modulation theory for certain two-dimensional evolution equations of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) type is presented. Three specific examples are considered in detail: the KP equation, the two-dimensional Benjamin-Ono (2DBO) equation and a modified KP (m2KP) equation. A unified derivation is also provided. In the case of the m2KP equation, the corresponding Whitham modulation system exhibits features different from the other two. The approach presented here does not require integrability of the original evolution equation. Indeed, while the KP equation is known to be a completely integrable equation, the 2DBO equation and the m2KP equation are not known to be integrable. In each of the cases considered, the Whitham modulation system obtained consists of five first-order quasilinear partial differential equations. The Riemann problem (i.e. the analogue of the Gurevich-Pitaevskii problem) for the one-dimensional reduction of the m2KP equation is studied. For the m2KP equation, the system of modulation equations is used to analyze the linear stability of traveling wave solutions.
