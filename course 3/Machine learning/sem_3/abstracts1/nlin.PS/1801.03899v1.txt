Since its discovery in 2002, the chimera state has frequently been described as a counter-intuitive, puzzling phenomenon. The Kuramoto model, in contrast, has become a celebrated paradigm useful for understanding a range of phenomena related to phase transitions, synchronization and network effects. Here we show that the chimera state can be understood as emerging naturally through a symmetry breaking bifurcation from the Kuramoto model's partially synchronized state. Our analysis sheds light on recent observations of chimera states in laser arrays, chemical oscillators, and mechanical pendula.
