We provide a unified description of efficiency correction and error estimation for moments of conserved quantifies in heavy-ion collisions. Moments and cumulants are expressed in terms of the factorial moments, which can be easily corrected for the efficiency effect. By deriving the covariance between factorial moments, one can obtain the general error formula for the efficiency corrected moments based on the error propagation derived from the Delta theorem. The skellam distribution based Monto Carlo simulation is used to test the Delta theorem and Bootstrap error estimation methods. The statistical errors calculated from the two methods can well reflect the statistical fluctuations of the efficiency corrected moments.
