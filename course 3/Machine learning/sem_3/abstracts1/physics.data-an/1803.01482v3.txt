In the search for neutrinoless double-beta decay, the high-pressure gaseous Time Projection Chamber has a distinct advantage, because the ionization charge tracks produced by particle interactions are extended and the detector captures the full three-dimensional charge distribution with appropriate charge readout systems. Such information of tracks provides a crucial extra-handle for discriminating signal events against backgrounds. In this paper, we constructed a toy model to demonstrate where the discrimination power comes from and how much of it the neural network models have already harnessed. Then we adapted 3-dimensional convolutional and residual neural networks on the simulated double-beta and background charge tracks and tested their capabilities in classifying these two types of events. We show that both the 3D structure and the overall depth of the neural networks significantly improve the accuracy of the classifier and lead to results better than previous works. We also studied their performance under various spatial granularities as well as different diffusion and noise conditions. The results indicate that the methods are stable and generalize well despite varying experimental conditions.
