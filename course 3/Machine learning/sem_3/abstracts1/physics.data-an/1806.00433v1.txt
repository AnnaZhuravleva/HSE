Correcting measured detector-level distributions to particle-level is essential to make data usable outside the experimental collaborations. The term unfolding is used to describe this procedure. A new method of unfolding the data using a modified Generative Adversarial Network (MSGAN) is presented here. Applied to various distributions, it is demonstrated to perform at par with, or better than, currently used methods.
