This paper presents an architecture for the analysis management in high energy physics experiments. Some new concepts on data analysis are introduced. A protocol for organizing and operating an analysis is raised. A toolkit following this architecture is developed, which provides a solution of analysis management with both flexibility and reproducibility. A foreseen development of this toolkit is discussed.
