Maximum likelihood method is widely used for parameter estimation in high energy physics. To consider various systematic uncertainties, tens of or even hundreds of nuisance parameters (NP) are introduced in a likelihood fit. The constraint of a nuisance parameter and its impact on the parameter of interest (POI) will be the main concerns for a precise measurement. A fit involving many parameters is usually slow and it is even more time-consuming to investigate why a parameter is over-constrained or has a large impact. In this paper, we are trying to understand the reasons behind and provide simple formulae to estimate the constraint and impact directly.
