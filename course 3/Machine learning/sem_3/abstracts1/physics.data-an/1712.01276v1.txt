This proceeding covers tools and technologies at our disposal for scientific data preservation and shows that this extends the scientific reach of our experiments. It is cost-efficient to warehouse data from completed experiments on the tape archives of our national and international laboratories. These subject-specific data stores also offer the technologies to capture and archive knowledge about experiments in the form of technical notes, electronic logs, websites, etc. Furthermore, it is possible to archive our source code and computing environments. The paper illustrates these challenges with experience from preserving the LEP data for the long term.
