We propose a general procedure for the detector-response correction (including efficiency correction) of higher order cumulants observed by the event-by-event analysis in heavy-ion collisions. This method makes use of the moments of the response matrix characterizing the property of a detector, and is applicable to a wide variety of response matrices such as those having non-binomial responses and including the effects of ghost tracks. A procedure to carry out the detector-response correction of realistic detectors is discussed. In test analyses, we show that this method can successfully re- construct the cumulants of true distribution for various response matrices including the one having multiplicity-dependent efficiency.
