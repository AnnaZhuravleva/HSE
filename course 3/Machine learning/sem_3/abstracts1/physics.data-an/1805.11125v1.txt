A spectral fitter based on the graphics processor unit (GPU) has been developed for Borexino solar neutrino analysis. It is able to shorten the fitting time to a superior level compared to the CPU fitting procedure. In Borexino solar neutrino spectral analysis, fitting usually requires around one hour to converge since it includes time-consuming convolutions in order to account for the detector response and pile-up effects. Moreover, the convergence time increases to more than two days when including extra computations for the discrimination of $^{11}$C and external $\gamma$s. In sharp contrast, with the GPU-based fitter it takes less than 10 seconds and less than four minutes, respectively. This fitter is developed utilizing the GooFit project with customized likelihoods, pdfs and infrastructures supporting certain analysis methods. In this proceeding the design of the package, developed features and the comparison with the original CPU fitter are presented.
