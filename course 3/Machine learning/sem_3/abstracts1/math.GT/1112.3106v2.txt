We advocate the use of cluster algebras and their y-variables in the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. We study hyperbolic structures on the mapping tori of pseudo-Anosov mapping classes of punctured surfaces, and show that cluster y-variables naturally give the solutions of the edge-gluing conditions of ideal tetrahedra. We also comment on the completeness of hyperbolic structures.
