The G-degree of colored graphs is a key concept in the approach to Quantum Gravity via tensor models. The present paper studies the properties of the G-degree for the large class of graphs representing singular manifolds (including closed PL manifolds). In particular, the complete topological classification up to G-degree 6 is obtained in dimension 3, where all 4-colored graphs represent singular manifolds.
