We obtain a formula for the Turaev-Viro invariants of a link complement in terms of values of the colored Jones polynomial of the link. As an application we give the first examples for which the volume conjecture of Chen and the third named author\,\cite{Chen-Yang} is verified. Namely, we show that the asymptotics of the Turaev-Viro invariants of the Figure-eight knot and the Borromean rings complement determine the corresponding hyperbolic volumes. Our calculations also exhibit new phenomena of asymptotic behavior of values of the colored Jones polynomials that seem not to be predicted by neither the Kashaev-Murakami-Murakami volume conjecture and various of its generalizations nor by Zagier's quantum modularity conjecture. We conjecture that the asymptotics of the Turaev-Viro invariants of any link complement determine the simplicial volume of the link, and verify it for all knots with zero simplicial volume. Finally we observe that our simplicial volume conjecture is stable under connect sum and split unions of links.
