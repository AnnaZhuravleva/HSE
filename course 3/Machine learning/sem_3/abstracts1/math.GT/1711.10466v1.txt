Sphere eversions have been described so far by either pictures with minimal topological complexity, numerical evolution or complex equations. We write down relatively simple explicit formulas for the whole eversion, both analytic and topologically simpler, including also Boy surface (real projective plane). We show their usefulness in visualizing the process using commonly available modeling software.
