We study classical query algorithms with post-selection, and find that they are closely connected to rational functions with nonnegative coefficients. We show that the post-selected classical query complexity of a Boolean function is equal to the minimal degree of a rational function with nonnegative coefficients that approximates it (up to a factor of two). For post-selected quantum query algorithms, a similar relationship was shown by Mahadev and de Wolf, where the rational approximations are allowed to have negative coefficients. Using our characterisation, we find an exponentially large separation between post-selected classical query complexity and post-selected quantum query complexity, by proving a lower bound on the degree of rational approximations (with nonnegative coefficients) to the Majority function. This lower bound can be generalised to arbitrary symmetric functions, and allows us to find an unbounded separation between non-deterministic quantum and post-selected classical query complexity. All lower bounds carry over into the communication complexity setting.   We show that the zero-error variants of post-selected query algorithms are equivalent to non-deterministic classical query algorithms, which in turn are characterised by nonnegative polynomials, and for some problems require exponentially more queries to the input than their bounded-error counterparts. Finally, we describe a post-selected query algorithm for approximating the Majority function, and an efficient query algorithm for approximate counting.
