The analysis of long term seismological data collected underground in the M\'atra Mountains, Hungary, using the facilities of the M\'atra Gravitational and Geophysical Laboratory (MGGL) is reported. The laboratory is situated inside the Gy\"ongy\"osoroszi mine, Hungary, 88m below the surface. This study focuses on the requirements of the Einstein Telescope (ET), one of the planned third generation gravitational wave observatories, which is designed for underground operation. After a short introduction of the geophysical environment the evaluation of the collected long term data follows including the comparison of a two-week measurement campaign deeper in the mine. Based on our analysis and considering the specialities of long term data collection, refinements of the performance and evaluation criteria are suggested as well as performance estimation of a possible M\'atra site.
