The search for continuous gravitational waves demands computationally efficient algorithms that can handle highly non-linear parameter spaces. Loosely coherent algorithms establish upper limits and detect signals by analyzing families of templates as a single unit. We describe a new computationally efficient loosely coherent search intended for spotlight and all-sky searches over medium scale coherence lengths (20000-1000000 sec).
