In the last decades a vaste amount of evidence for the existence of dark matter has been accumulated. At the same time, many efforts have been undertaken to try to identify what dark matter is. Indirect searches look at places in the Universe where dark matter is believed to be abundant and seek for possible annihilation or decay signatures. The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) represents the next generation of imaging Cherenkov telescopes and, with one site in the Southern hemisphere and one in the Northern hemisphere, will be able to observe all the sky with unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution above a few tens of GeV. The CTA Consortium will undertake an ambitious program of indirect dark matter searches for which we report here the brightest prospects.
