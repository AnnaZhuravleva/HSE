The computation of microlensing light curves represents a bottleneck for the modeling of planetary events, making broad searches in the vast parameter space of microlensing extremely time-consuming. The release of the first version of VBBinaryLensing (based on the advanced contour integration method presented in Bozza(2010)) has represented a considerable advance in the field, with the birth of several analysis platforms running on this code. Here we present the version 2.0 of VBBinaryLensing, which contains several upgrades with respect to the first version, including new decision trees that introduce important optimizations in the calculations.
