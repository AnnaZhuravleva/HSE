In 2015/16, the photomultiplier cameras of the H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescopes CT1-4 have undergone a major upgrade. The entire electronics has been replaced, using NECTAr chips for the front-end readout. A new ventilation system has been installed and several auxiliary components have been replaced. Besides this, the internal control and readout software was rewritten from scratch in a modern and modular way. Ethernet technology was used wherever possible to ensure both flexibility, stability and high bandwidth. An overview of the installed components will be given.
