I present the first public release (v3.4) of the USINE code for cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy (https://lpsc.in2p3.fr/usine). It contains several semi-analytical propagation models previously used in the literature (leaky-box model, 2-zone 1D and 2D diffusion models) for the calculation of nuclei ($Z=1-30$), anti-protons, and anti-deuterons. With a single ASCII initialisation file to configure runs, its many displays, and the speed associated to semi-analytical approaches, USINE should be a useful tool for beginners, but also for experts to perform statistical analyses of high-precision cosmic-ray data. Any geometry, transport, and source parameters can be enabled as free parameters, whereas nuisance parameters are enabled on solar modulation levels, cross sections (inelastic and production), and systematics of the CR data. The next release, in preparation, will include leptons, dark matter contributions in 2D model, interface with MCMC engine, etc.
