I explore the possibility of resurrecting an old, non-Bayesian computational approach for inferring the source direction of a gravitational wave from the output of a two-detector network. The method gives the beam pattern response functions and time delay, and performs well even in the presence of noise and unexpected signal forms. I further suggest an improvement to this method in the form of a weighting algorithm that usefully improves its accuracy beyond what can be achieved with simple best-fit methods, validating the new procedure with several small-scale simulations. The approach is identified as complimentary to -- rather than in competition with -- the now-standard Bayesian approach typically used by the LIGO network in parameter determination. Finally, I briefly discuss the possible applications of this method in the world of three-or-more detector networks and some directions for future work.
