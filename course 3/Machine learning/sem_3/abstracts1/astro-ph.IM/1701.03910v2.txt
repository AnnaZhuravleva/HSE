Determination of mass composition of high energy cosmic rays is one of the greatest challenge in modern astrophysics. All of previous methods for finding the mass composition of primary cosmic rays in a surface array at least require two independent measurements (e.g. muon and electron components) of extensive air showers (EAS). Here a new statistical parameter is introduced which can be used to determine the mass composition of vertical downward cosmic rays in a simple surface array. The most interesting thing about the new parameter is that it does not need two independent measurements and can be used in a simple surface array which does not have muon detectors.
