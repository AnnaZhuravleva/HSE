Schumann resonance transients which propagate around the globe can potentially generate a correlated background in widely separated gravitational wave detectors. We show that due to the distribution of lightning hotspots around the globe these transients have characteristic time lags, and this feature can be useful to further suppress such a background, especially in searches of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. A brief review of the corresponding literature on Schumann resonances and lightnings is also given.
