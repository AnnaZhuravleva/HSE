The Advanced LIGO detectors have recently completed their second observation run successfully. The run lasted for approximately 10 months and lead to multiple new discoveries. The sensitivity to gravitational waves was partially limited by correlated noise. Here, we utilize auxiliary sensors that witness these correlated noise sources, and use them for noise subtraction in the time domain data. This noise and line removal is particularly significant for the LIGO Hanford Observatory, where the improvement in sensitivity is greater than 20%. Consequently, we were also able to improve the astrophysical estimation for the location, masses, spins and orbital parameters of the gravitational wave progenitors.
