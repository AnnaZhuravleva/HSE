As an essential part of China’s Gravitational Waves Program, the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) is a ground-based experiment aiming at the Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) by measuring B-mode polarization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). First proposed in 2014 and currently in fast construction phase, AliCPT is China’s first CMB project that plans for commissioning in 2019. Led by the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the project is a worldwide collaboration of more than fifteen universities and research institutes. Ali CMB Project is briefly introduced.
