Here we develop a general statistical procedure for the analysis of finite two-dimensional (2D) patterns inspired by the analysis of heavy-ion data. The method is used in the study of publicly available data obtained by the Gaia-ESA mission. We prove that the procedure can be sensitive to the limits of accuracy of measurement, and can also clearly identify the real physical effects on the large background of random distributions. As an example, the method confirms the presence of binary and ternary star systems in the studied data. At the same time, the possibility of the statistical detection of the gravitational microlensing effect is discussed.
