In cavity-based axion dark matter search experiments exploring high mass regions, multiple-cavity design is considered to increase the detection volume within a given magnet bore. We introduce a new idea, referred to as multiple-cell cavity, which provides various benefits including a larger detection volume, simpler experimental setup, and easier phase-matching mechanism. We present the characteristics of this concept and demonstrate the experimental feasibility with an example of a double-cell cavity.
