Accurate determination of gravitational wave source parameters relies on transforming between the source and detector frames. All-sky searches for continuous wave sources are computationally expensive, in part, because of barycentering transformation of time delays to a solar system frame. This expense is exacerbated by the complicated modulation induced in signal templates. We investigate approximations for determining time delays of signals received by a gravitational wave detector with respect to the solar system barycenter. A highly non-linear conventional computation is transformed into one that has a pure linear sum in its innermost loop. We discuss application of these results to determination of the maximal useful coherence length of continuous wave searches.
