We study the geometry underlying the Wilson loop diagram approach to calculating scattering amplitudes in the gauge theory of Supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) $N=4$. By applying the tools developed to study total positivity in the real Grassmannian, we are able to systematically compute with all Wilson loop diagrams of a given size and find unexpected patterns and relationships between them. We focus on the smallest nontrivial multi-propagator case, consisting of 2 propagators on 6 vertices, and compute the positroid cells associated to each diagram and the homology of the subcomplex they generate in $\mathbb{G}_{\mathbb{R}, \geq 0}$. We also verify in this case the conjecture that the spurious singularities of the volume functional {\em do} all cancel on the codimension 1 boundaries of these cells.
