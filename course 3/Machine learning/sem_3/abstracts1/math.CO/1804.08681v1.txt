We show that there is the same number of (n,l)-alternating sign trapezoids as there is of column strict shifted plane partitions of class l-1 with at most n parts in the top row, thereby proving a result that was conjectured independently by Behrend and Aigner. The first objects generalize alternating sign triangles, which have recently been introduced by Ayyer, Behrend and the author who showed that they are counted by the same formula as alternating sign matrices. Column strict shifted plane partitions of a fixed class were introduced in a slightly different form by Andrews, and they essentially generalize descending plane partitions. They also correspond to cyclically symmetric lozenge tilings of a hexagon with a triangular hole in the center. In addition, we also provide three statistics on each class of objects and show that their joint distribution is the same. We prove our result by employing a constant term approach that is based on the author's operator formula for monotone triangles. This paper complements a forthcoming paper of Behrend and the author, where the six-vertex model approach is used to show equinumeracy as well as generalizations involving statistics that are different from those considered in the present paper.
