We perform Godsil-McKay switching on the hypercube to create graphs that maintain many of the same properties of the hypercube. In particular, these switched and partially switched perturbations of the $n$-cube exhibit perfect state transfer (PST, a desirable property in quantum information theory) between certain pairs of vertices. We also consider convex combinations of graphs with PST, as well as switched systems of the aforementioned graphs. We analyse which pairs of vertices retain PST after the perturbations, and show that the sensitivity with respect to readout time errors remains unaffected for some pairs of vertices.
