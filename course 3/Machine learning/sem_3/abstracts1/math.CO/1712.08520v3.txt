We study three finite-dimensional quotient vector spaces constructed from the linear span of the set of characteristic functions of permutohedral cones by imposing two kinds of constraints: (1) neglect characteristic functions of higher codimension permutohedral cones, and (2) neglect characteristic functions of non-pointed permutohedral cones. We construct an ordered basis which is canonical, in the sense that it has subsets which map onto ordered bases for the quotients. We present straightening relations to the canonical basis, and using Laplace transforms we obtain functional representations for each quotient space.
