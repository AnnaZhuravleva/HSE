In this note, we study the permutohedral geometry of the poles of a certain differential form introduced in recent work of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, He and Yan. There it was observed that the poles of the form determine a family of polyhedra which have the same face lattice as that of the permutohedron. We prove that the set of such polyhedra in fact fills out the configuration space of a particularly well-behaved family of generalized permutohedra, the zonotopal generalized permutohedra, that are obtained as the Minkowski sums of line segments parallel to the root directions $e_i-e_j$.
