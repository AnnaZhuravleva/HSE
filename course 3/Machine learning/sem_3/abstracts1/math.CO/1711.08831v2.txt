We construct a new type of quantum walk from orientable embeddings. Two infinite families of quantum walks built from self-dual embeddings exhibit interesting phenomena. First, their Hamiltonians are Hermitian adjacency matrices of sparse digraphs. Second, all these walks satisfy the stay-at-home property---the probability that the walk stays at the initial state tends to $1$ as the size of graph goes to infinity.
