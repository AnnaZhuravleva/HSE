The orthogonal rank of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the smallest dimension $\xi$ such that there exist non-zero column vectors $x_v\in\mathbb{C}^\xi$ for $v\in V$ satisfying the orthogonality condition $x_v^* x_w=0$ for all $vw\in E$. We show that \[ 1 + \max\left(\frac{n^+}{n^-}, \frac{n^-}{n^+} \right) \le \xi, \] where $n^+$ and $n^-$ denote the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$ of $G$, respectively. This result complements a previous result by the authors, in which they showed that the quantum chromatic number $\chi_q$ is bounded from below by the above expression. It is known that the quantum chromatic number $\chi_q$ and the orthogonal rank $\xi$ are incomparable.   We then prove this expression is a lower bound for the projective rank $\xi_f$ of all non-singular graphs, and conclude with some examples of using this inertial bound.
