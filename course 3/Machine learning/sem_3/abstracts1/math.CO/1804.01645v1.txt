We construct infinite families of graphs in which pretty good state transfer can be induced by adding a potential to the nodes of the graph (i.e. adding a number to a diagonal entry of the adjacency matrix). Indeed, we show that given any graph with a pair of cospectral nodes, a simple modification of the graph, along with a suitable potential, yields pretty good state transfer (i.e. asymptotically perfect state transfer) between the nodes. This generalizes previous work, concerning graphs with an involution, to asymmetric graphs.
