This is the second companion paper of arXiv:1601.03586. We consider the morphism from the variety of triples introduced in arXiv:1601.03586 to the affine Grassmannian. The direct image of the dualizing complex is a ring object in the equivariant derived category on the affine Grassmannian (equivariant derived Satake category). We show that various constructions in arXiv:1601.03586 work for an arbitrary commutative ring object.   The second purpose of this paper is to study Coulomb branches associated with star shaped quivers, which are expected to be conjectural Higgs branches of $3d$ Sicilian theories in type $A$ by arXiv:1007.0992.
