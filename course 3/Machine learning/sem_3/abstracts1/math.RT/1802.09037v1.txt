Refection Positivity is a central theme at the crossroads of Lie group representations, euclidean and abstract harmonic analysis, constructive quantum field theory, and stochastic processes. This book provides the first presentation of the representation theoretic aspects of Refection Positivity and discusses its connections to those different fields on a level suitable for doctoral students and researchers in related fields.
