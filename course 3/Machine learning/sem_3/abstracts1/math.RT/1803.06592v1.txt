Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebra. A layer sum is introduced as the sum of formal exponentials of the distinct weights appearing in an irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-module. It is argued that the character of every finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-module admits a decomposition in terms of layer sums, with only non-negative integer coefficients. Ensuing results include a new approach to the computation of Weyl characters and weight multiplicities, and a closed-form expression for the number of distinct weights in a finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathfrak{g}$-module. The latter is given by a polynomial in the Dynkin labels, of degree equal to the rank of $\mathfrak{g}$.
