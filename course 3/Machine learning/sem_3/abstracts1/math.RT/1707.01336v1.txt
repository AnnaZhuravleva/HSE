In this work we consider an association of meromorphic Jacobi forms of half-integral index to the pure D-type cases of umbral moonshine, and solve the module problem for four of these cases by constructing vertex operator superalgebras that realise the corresponding meromorphic Jacobi forms as graded traces. We also present a general discussion of meromorphic Jacobi forms with half-integral index and their relationship to mock modular forms.
