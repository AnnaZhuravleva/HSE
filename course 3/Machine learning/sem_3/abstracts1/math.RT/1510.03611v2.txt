Consider a restriction of an irreducible finite dimensional holomorphic representation of $\GL(n+1,C)$ to the subgroup $GL(n,C)$ (it is determined by the Gelfand-Tsetlin branching rule). We write explicitly formulas for generators of the Lie algebra $gl(n+1)$ in the direct sum of representations of $\GL(n,C)$. Nontrivial generators act as differential-difference operators, the differential part has order $(n-1)$, the difference part acts on the space of parameters (highest weights) of representations. We also formulate a conjecture about unitary principal series of $GL(n,C)$
