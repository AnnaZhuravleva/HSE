This is the third companion paper of arXiv:1601.03586. When a gauge theory has a flavor symmetry group, we construct a partial resolution of the Coulomb branch as a variant of the definition. We identify the partial resolution with a partial resolution of a generalized slice in the affine Grassmannian, Hilbert scheme of points, and resolved Cherkis bow variety for a quiver gauge theory of type ADE or affine type A.
