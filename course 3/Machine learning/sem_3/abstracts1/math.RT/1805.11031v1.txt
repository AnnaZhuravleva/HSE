We construct the unique two-parameter vertex algebra which is freely generated of type $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and generated by the weights $2$ and $4$ fields. Subject to some mild constraints, all vertex algebras of type $\mathcal{W}(2,4,\dots, 2N)$ for some $N$, can be obtained as quotients of this universal algebra. This includes the principal $\mathcal{W}$-algebra $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{p}_{2n}, f_{\text{prin}})$, as well as the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}_{2n}, f_{\text{prin}})^{\mathbb{Z}_2}$, and many others which arise as cosets of affine vertex algebras inside larger affine vertex algebras or $\mathcal{W}$-algebras.
