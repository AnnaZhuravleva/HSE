We introduce the shifted quantum affine algebras. They map homomorphically into the quantized $K$-theoretic Coulomb branches of $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ SUSY quiver gauge theories. In type $A$, they are endowed with a coproduct, and they act on the equivariant $K$-theory of parabolic Laumon spaces. In type $A_1$, they are closely related to the open relativistic quantum Toda lattice of type $A$.
