We discover a large class of simple affine vertex algebras $V_{k} (\mathfrak g)$, associated to basic Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak g$ at non-admissible collapsing levels $k$, having exactly one irreducible $\mathfrak g$-locally finite module in the category ${\mathcal O}$. In the case when $\mathfrak g$ is a Lie algebra, we prove a complete reducibility result for $V_k(\mathfrak g)$-modules at an arbitrary collapsing level. We also determine the generators of the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra $V^k (\mathfrak g)$ at certain negative integer levels. Considering some conformal embeddings in the simple affine vertex algebras $V_{-1/2} (C_n)$ and $V_{-4}(E_7)$, we surprisingly obtain the realization of non-simple affine vertex algebras of types $B$ and $D$ having exactly one non-trivial ideal.
