In the Coxeter group W(R) generated by the root system R, let T(R) be the number of conjugacy classes having no eigenvalue 1 and let S(R) be the number of conjugacy classes having no eigenvalue -1. The algebra H{R) of observables of the rational Calogero model based on the root system R possesses T(R) independent traces, the same algebra considered as an associative superalgebra with respect to a certain natural parity possesses S(R) even independent supertraces and no odd trace or supertrace. The numbers T(R) and S(R) are determined for all irreducible root systems (hence for all root systems). It is shown that T(R) =< S(R), and T(R) = S(R) if and only if superalgebra H(R) contains a Klein operator (or, equivalently, W(R) containes -1).
