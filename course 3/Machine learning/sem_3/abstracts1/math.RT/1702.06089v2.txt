We complete the classification of conformal embeddings of a maximally reductive subalgebra $\mathfrak k$ into a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ at non-integrable non-critical levels $k$ by dealing with the case when $\mathfrak k$ has rank less than that of $\mathfrak g$. We describe some remarkable instances of decomposition of the vertex algebra $V_{k}(\mathfrak g)$ as a module for the vertex subalgebra generated by $\mathfrak k$. We discuss decompositions of conformal embeddings and constructions of new affine Howe dual pairs at negative levels. In particular, we study an example of conformal embeddings $A_1 \times A_1 \hookrightarrow C_3$ at level $k=-1/2$, and obtain explicit branching rules by applying certain $q$-series identity. In the analysis of conformal embedding $A_1 \times D_4 \hookrightarrow C_8$ at level $k=-1/2$ we detect subsingular vectors which do not appear in the branching rules of the classical Howe dual pairs.
