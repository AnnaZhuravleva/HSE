In this note we describe a general elementary procedure to attach a fusion ring to any Kac-Moody algebra of affine type. In the case of untwisted affine algebras, they are usual fusion rings in the literature. In the case of twisted affine algebras, they are exactly the twisted fusion rings defined by the author in [Ho2] via tracing out diagram automorphisms on conformal blocks for appropriate simply-laced Lie algebras. We also relate the fusion ring to the modular S-matrix for any Kac-Moody algebra of affine type.
