We present a new idea of testing the validity of the Friedman-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric, through the multiple measurements of galactic-scale strong gravitational lensing systems with type Ia supernovae in the role of sources. Each individual lensing system will provide a model-independent measurement of the spatial curvature parameter referring only to geometrical optics independently of the matter content of the universe. This will create a valuable opportunity to test the FLRW metric directly. Our results show that the LSST would produce robust constraints on the spacial curvature comparable to Planck 2014 results, with 650 strongly lensed SNe Ia observed in the future.
