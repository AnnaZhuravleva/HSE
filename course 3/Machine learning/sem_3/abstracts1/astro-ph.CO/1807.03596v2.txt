Based on the dynamics of single scalar field slow-roll inflation and the theory of reheating, we investigate the generalized natural inflationary (GNI) model. Concretely, by means of the observation data of scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we firstly give constraints on the model parameters $m$ and the e-folding number $N_{*}$ corresponding to the different values of decay constant $f$. When taking $m=1$, the model can reduce to the so-called natural inflationary (NI) model, and the allowable ranges of values of $N_{*}$ and $f$ can be obtained. By contrast, we find that $m<1$ is well supported for a broad range of values of $f$. Next, for the general reheating phase characterized by the reheating e-folding number $N_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and the effective average equation of state $w_{re}$, the physical conditions of $N_{re}\geq0$ and $10^{2}$ GeV$\leq T_{re}\leq10^{16}$ GeV can give more stringent constraints on the related parameters. The results show that the effect of $f$ on the reheating phase is relatively weaker, in other words, these parameters are insensitive to the value of $f$, and the different values of $w_{re}$ can lead to the significant changes to the parameters within the range of $-1\leq w_{re}\leq1$. Finally, we also discuss a two-phase reheating scenario consisting of the oscillation phase and the thermalization phase, and calculate the minimum coupling constant $g$ in order to achieve the simplest two-phase reheating.
