Inflation may provide a suitable collider to probe physics at very high energies. In this paper we investigate the impact on the CMB bispectrum of higher spin fields which are long-lived on super-Hubble scales, e.g. partially massless higher spin fields. We show that distinctive statistical anisotropic signals on the CMB three-point correlator are induced and we investigate their detectability.
