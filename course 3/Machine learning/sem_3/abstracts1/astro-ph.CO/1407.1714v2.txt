We argue that an anisotropic dipolar imaginary primordial power spectrum is possible within the framework of noncommutative space-times. We show that such a spectrum provides a good description of the observed dipole modulation in CMBR data. We extract the corresponding power spectrum from data. The dipole modulation is related to the observed hemispherical anisotropy in CMBR data, which might represent the first signature of quantum gravity.
