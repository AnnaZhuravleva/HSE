The effect of massive neutrinos on the growth of cold dark matter perturbations acts as a scale-dependent Newton's constant and leads to scale-dependent growth factors just as we often find in models of gravity beyond General Relativity. We show how to compute growth factors for $\Lambda$CDM and general modified gravity cosmologies combined with massive neutrinos in Lagrangian perturbation theory for use in COLA and extensions thereof. We implement this together with the grid-based massive neutrino method of Brandbyge and Hannestad in $\texttt{MG-PICOLA}$ and compare COLA simulations to full $\it N$-body simulations of $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity with massive neutrinos. Our implementation is computationally cheap if the underlying cosmology already has scale-dependent growth factors and it is shown to be able to produce results that match $\it N$-body to percent level accuracy for both the total and CDM matter power-spectra up to $k\lesssim 1 h/$Mpc.
