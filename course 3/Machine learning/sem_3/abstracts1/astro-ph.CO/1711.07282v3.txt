We explore the cosmological implications of the interactions among the dark particles in the dark $SU(2)_R$ model. It turns out that the relevant interaction is between dark energy and dark matter, through a decay process. With respect to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, it changes only the background equations. We note that the observational aspects of the model are dominated by degeneracies between the parameters that describe the process. Thus, only the usual $\Lambda$CDM parameters, such as the Hubble expansion rate and the dark energy density parameter (interpreted as the combination of the densities of the dark energy doublet) could be constrained by observations at this moment.
