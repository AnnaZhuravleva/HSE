In the era of precision cosmology, we investigate an novel method to probe the Dark Universe. By studying the fractality of the universe, we estimate a characteristic scale of homogeneity. Using a fisher analysis, we investigate the potential impact of this scale to the cosmological information we can gain from the Euclid satellite, and therefore understand the nature of Dark Energy and Dark matter of our universe.
