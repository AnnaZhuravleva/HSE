Cosmology in the near future promises a measurement of the sum of neutrino masses, a fundamental Standard Model parameter, as well as substantially-improved constraints on the dark energy. We use the shape of the BOSS redshift-space galaxy power spectrum, in combination with CMB and supernova data, to constrain the neutrino masses and the dark energy. Essential to this calculation are several recent advances in non-linear cosmological perturbation theory, including FFT methods, redshift space distortions, and scale-dependent growth. Our 95% confidence upper bound of 200 meV on the sum of masses degrades substantially to 770 meV when the dark energy equation of state and its first derivative are also allowed to vary, representing a significant challenge to current constraints. We also study the impact of additional galaxy bias parameters, finding that a velocity bias or a more complicated scale-dependent density bias shift the preferred neutrino mass values 20%-30% lower while minimally impacting the other cosmological parameters.
