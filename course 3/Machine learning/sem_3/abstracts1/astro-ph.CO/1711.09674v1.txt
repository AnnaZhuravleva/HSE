The recent Planck data on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background marginally support deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model at several multipoles. With a view towards current and forthcoming observational surveys, we trace these features to other observables like the scalar bispectrum and the tensor power spectrum. A possible detection of such bumps in these channels would increase their statistical significance shedding light on the ultra violet mechanisms responsible for their appearance in the data.
