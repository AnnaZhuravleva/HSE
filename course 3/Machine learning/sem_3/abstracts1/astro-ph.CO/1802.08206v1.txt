We explore the possible spectrum of binary mergers of sub-solar mass black holes formed out of dark matter particles interacting via a dark electromagnetism. We estimate the properties of these dark black holes by assuming that their formation process is parallel to Population-III star formation; except that dark molecular cooling can yield smaller opacity limit. We estimate the binary coalescence rates for the Advanced LIGO and Einstein telescope, and find that scenarios compatible with all current constraints could produce dark black holes at rates high enough for detection by Advanced LIGO.
