Neutrinos are key astronomical messengers, because they are undeflected by magnetic field and unattenuated by electromagnetic interaction. After the first detection of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the TeV-PeV region by Neutrino Telescopes we are entering a new epoch where neutrino astronomy becomes possible. In this paper I briefly review the main issues concerning cosmological neutrinos and their experimental observation.
