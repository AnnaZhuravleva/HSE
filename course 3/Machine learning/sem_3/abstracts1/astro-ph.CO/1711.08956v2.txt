We revise primordial black hole (PBH) formation in the axion-like curvaton model and investigate whether PBHs formed in this model can be the origin of the gravtitational wave (GW) signals detected by the Advanced LIGO. In this model, small-scale curvature perturbations with large amplitude are generated, which is essential for PBH formation. On the other hand, large curvature perturbations also become a source of primordial GWs by their second-order effects. Severe constraints are imposed on such GWs by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. We also check the consistency of the model with these constraints. In this analysis, it is important to take into account the effect of non-Gaussianity, which is generated easily in the curvaton model. We see that, if there are non-Gaussianities, the fixed amount of PBHs can be produced with a smaller amplitude of the primordial power spectrum.
