The recent observations of the gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo collaboration infer the increasing possibility of the primordial black holes (PBHs). Recently it was pointed out that sufficient PBHs are produced by the Affleck-Dine mechanism where inhomogeneous baryogenesis takes place due to change of the Hubble induced mass during and after inflation and forms high baryon bubbles (HBBs). The produced HBBs have large density contrasts through the QCD phase transition or stable Q-ball formation, which leads to formation of the LIGO PBHs. Furthermore, in this model stringent constraints from CMB $\mu$-distortion and pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments are completely absent. In this paper, we study the model in full details based on gravity and gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios and show that the model can explain the current GWs events evading observational constraints.
