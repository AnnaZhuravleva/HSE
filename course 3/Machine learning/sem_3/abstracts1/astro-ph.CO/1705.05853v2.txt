In recent years, realistic hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies like the Milky Way have become available, enabling a reliable estimate of the dark matter density and velocity distribution in the Solar neighborhood. We review here the status of hydrodynamical simulations and their implications for the interpretation of direct dark matter searches. We focus in particular on: the criteria to identify Milky Way-like galaxies; the impact of baryonic physics on the dark matter velocity distribution; the possible presence of substructures like clumps, streams, or dark disks; and on the implications for the direct detection of dark matter with standard and non-standard interactions.
