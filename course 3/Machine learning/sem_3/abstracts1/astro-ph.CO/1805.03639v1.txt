We report on a novel phenomenon of the resonance effect of primordial density perturbations arisen from a sound speed parameter with an oscillatory behavior, which can generically lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the early Universe. For a general inflaton field, it can seed primordial density fluctuations and their propagation is governed by a parameter of sound speed square. Once if this parameter achieves an oscillatory feature for a while during inflation, a significant non-perturbative resonance effect on the inflaton field fluctuations takes place around a critical length scale, which results in significant peaks in the primordial power spectrum. By virtue of this robust mechanism, primordial black holes with specific mass function can be produced with a sufficient abundance for dark matter in sizable parameter ranges.
