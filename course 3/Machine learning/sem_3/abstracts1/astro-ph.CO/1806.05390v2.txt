We investigate the sensitivity of reheating history on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). Contrary to the monochromatic case of mass fraction of PBH, reheating era with different e-folding and equation-of-state can have a substantial impact on the abundance of PBH with an extended mass fraction. We demonstrate explicitly this reheating sensitivity in an illustrative model of single field inflation with a quasi-inflection point, and find that both the peak position and amplitude of the extended mass fraction as well as the abundance of PBH in DM can vary by many orders of magnitude, which adds another layer of uncertainty on the PBH scenarios as dark matter.
