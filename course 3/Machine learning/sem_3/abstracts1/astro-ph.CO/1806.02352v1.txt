We advocate the idea that the Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are powered by the magnetic reconnection in magnetars, triggered by Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) dark matter. The effect, in all respects, is similar to the idea proposed by Zhitnitsky (2017) for the origin of solar nanoflares. The "only" distinction is that all physical parameters are drastically (many orders of magnitude) different between these two systems: the Sun and the magnetar. The magnetic reconnection in both cases is triggered and ignited by the shock wave which develops when the nuggets' Mach number $M \gg 1$. These shock waves generate very strong and very short impulses expressed in terms of pressure $\Delta p/p\sim M^2$ and temperature $\Delta T/T\sim M^2$ in the vicinity of (would be) magnetic reconnection area. We find that the proposed mechanism produces coherent emission which is consistent with the FRB energy requirements, with the observed energy distribution $dN\sim E^{-1.6}dE$ and with the observed duration of FRBs measred in ms. We also estimate the events rate of $\sim 10^3$ FRBs per day for current detection limits which is also consistent with observations.
