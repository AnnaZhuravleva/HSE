We show that the number of primordial black holes (PBHs) which is originated from primordial density perturbations with moderately-tilted power spectrum fluctuates following the log-normal distribution, while it follows the Poisson distribution if the spectrum is steeply blue. The log-normal, as well as the Poisson, PBH number fluctuation behaves as an isocurvature mode and affects the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function in a different way from those for the Poisson case. The future 21cm observation can put a stronger constraint on the PBH fraction than the current one in a wide mass range, $10^{-6}M_\odot$--$100M_\odot$.
