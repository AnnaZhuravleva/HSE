The previously introduced class of two-parametric phenomenological inflationary models in General Relativity in which the slow-roll assumption is replaced by the more general, constant-roll condition is generalized to the case of $f(R)$ gravity. A simple constant-roll condition is defined in the original Jordan frame, and exact expressions for a scalaron potential in the Einstein frame, for a function $f(R)$ (in the parametric form) and for inflationary dynamics are obtained. The region of the model parameters permitted by the latest observational constraints on the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial metric perturbations generated during inflation is determined.
