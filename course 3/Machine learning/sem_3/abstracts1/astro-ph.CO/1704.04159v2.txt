We find that a fuzzy dark matter background and the mG scale magnetic field in the galactic center can give rise to a radiation with a very large energy release. The frequency of the radiation field is the same as the frequency of the oscillating axion-like background field. We show that there is an energy transfer between the fuzzy dark matter sector and the electromagnetic sector because of the presence of the generated radiation field and the galactic magnetic field. The energy release rate of radiation is found to be very slow in comparison with the energy of fuzzy dark matter but could be significant comparing with the energy of galactic magnetic field in the source region. Using this example, we show that the fuzzy dark matter together with a large scale magnetic field is possible to give rise to fruitful physics.
