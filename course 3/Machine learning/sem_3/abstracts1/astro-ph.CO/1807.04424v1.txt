We study the effects of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the energy spectrum of inflationary gravitational waves. The models of inflation are classified into two types based on their predictions for the tensor power spectrum; red-tilted ($n_T<0$) and blue-tilted spectra ($n_T>0$), respectively, and then the energy spectra of the gravitational waves {\color{black} are calculated} for each type of model. We find that the gravitational wave spectra are enhanced depending on the model parameter if the predicted inflationary tensor spectra have a blue-tilt whereas they are suppressed for the spectra that have a red-tilt. Moreover, we perform the analyses on the reheating parameters involving the temperature, equation-of-state parameter and the number of $e$-folds using the gravitational wave spectrum. Our results imply that the Gauss-Bonnet term plays an important role not only during inflation but also during reheating whether the process is instantaneous or {\color{black} lasted} for a certain number of $e$-folds until it thermalizes and eventually completes.
