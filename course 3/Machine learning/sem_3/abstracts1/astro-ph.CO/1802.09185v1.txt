We consider two non-canonical scalar fields (tachyon and DBI) with E-model type of the potential. We study cosmological inflation in these models to find possible $\alpha$-attractors. We show that similar to the canonical scalar field case, in both tachyon and DBI models there is a value of the scalar spectral index in small $\alpha$ limit which is just a function of the e-folds number. However, the value of $n_{s}$ in DBI model is somewhat different from the other ones. We also compare the results with Planck2015 TT, TE, EE+lowP data. The reheating phase after inflation is studied in these models which gives some more constraints on the model's parameters.
