We show that fragmentation of the inflaton into long-lived spatially localized oscillon configurations can lead to copious production of black holes. In a single-field inflation model primordial black holes of sublunar mass can form, and they can account for all of the dark matter. We also explore the possibility that solar-mass primordial black holes, particularly relevant for gravitational wave astronomy, are produced from the same mechanism.
