In a model of the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework of generalized Proca theories, there exists a de Sitter attractor preceded by the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}=-1-s$, where $s$ is a positive constant. We run the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo code to confront the model with the observational data of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae type Ia, and local measurements of the Hubble expansion rate for the background cosmological solutions and obtain the bound $s=0.254^{{}+ 0.118}_{{}-0.097}$ at 95% confidence level (CL). Existence of the additional parameter $s$ to those in the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model allows to reduce tensions of the Hubble constant $H_0$ between the CMB and the low-redshift measurements. Including the cosmic growth data of redshift-space distortions in the galaxy power spectrum and taking into account no-ghost and stability conditions of cosmological perturbations, we find that the bound on $s$ is shifted to $s=0.16^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ (95 % CL) and hence the model with $s>0$ is still favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model. Apart from the quantities $s, H_0$ and the today's matter density parameter $\Omega_{m0}$, the constraints on other model parameters associated with perturbations are less stringent, reflecting the fact that there are different sets of parameters that give rise to a similar cosmic expansion and growth history.
