A comparison of various measurements of linear matter density perturbation amplitude is made, which are obtained from the observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, galaxy cluster mass function, weak gravitation lensing, matter power spectrum and redshift space distortions. It is shown that Planck CMB temperature anisotropy data at high multipoles, $\ell>1000$ (where the effect of gravitational lensing is most significant), produce the measurement of matter density perturbations amplitude that contradict to all other constraints obtained both from remaining Planck CMB anisotropy data and from other cosmological data, at about $3.7\sigma$ significance level. Therefore, the combination of these data should not be used currently to constrain cosmological parameters.   With the exception of Planck CMB temperature anisotropy data at high multipoles, all other measurements of density perturbation amplitude are in good agreement between each other and give the following measurements of linear density perturbation amplitude: $\sigma_8=0.792\pm0.006$, mean density of the Universe: $\Omega_m=0.287\pm0.007$, and Hubble constant: $H_0 = 69.4\pm 0.6$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$. Taking in account the data on baryon acoustic oscillations and (or) direct Hubble constant measurements, one can obtain different constraints on sum of neutrino mass and number of relativistic species.
