We study the generalized $\alpha$ attractor model in the context of the late time cosmic acceleration. The model interpolates between the scaling freezing and thawing dark energy models. In the slow roll region, the original potential is modified whereas the modification ceases in the asymptotic region and the effective potential behaves as the quadratic one. In our setting, the field rolls slowly around the present epoch and mimics the scaling behavior in the future. We obtain observational constraints on the model parameters by using an integrated data base (SN+Hubble+BAO+CMB).
