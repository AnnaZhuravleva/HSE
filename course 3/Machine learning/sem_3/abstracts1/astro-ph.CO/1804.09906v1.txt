The cosmic distance duality (CDD) relation (also known as the Etherington relation) plays a crucial role in a wide assortment of cosmological measurements. Attempts at confirming it observationally have met with mixed results, though the general consensus appears to be that the data do support its existence in nature. A common weakness with past approaches has been their reliance on a specific cosmological model, or on measurements of the luminosity distance to Type Ia SNe, which introduces a model dependence in spite of beliefs to the contrary. Confirming that the CDD is actually realized in the cosmos is crucial because its violation would require exotic new physics. In this paper, we present a true model-independent study of the CDD based on the observed angular size of compact quasar cores and a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the HII galaxy Hubble diagram---without the assumption of any background cosmology. In so doing, we confirm at a very high level of confidence that the angular-diameter and luminosity distances do indeed satisfy the CDD. We demonstrate the potential power of this result by utilizing it in a comparative test of two competing cosmological models---the R_h=ct universe and LCDM---and show that R_h=ct is favoured by the CDD data with a likelihood ~82.3% compared with ~17.7% for the standard model.
