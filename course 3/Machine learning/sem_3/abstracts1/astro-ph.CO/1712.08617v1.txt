We perform Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses to put constraints on the non-flat $\phi$CDM inflation model using Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements. The $\phi$CDM model is a consistent dynamical dark energy model in which the currently accelerating cosmological expansion is powered by a scalar field $\phi$ slowly rolling down an inverse power-law potential energy density. We also use a physically consistent power spectrum for energy density inhomogeneities in this non-flat model. We find that, like the closed-$\Lambda$CDM and closed-XCDM models, the closed-$\phi$CDM model provides a better fit to the lower multipole region of the CMB temperature anisotropy data compared to that provided by the tilted flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. Also, like the other closed models, this model reduces the tension between the Planck and the weak lensing $\sigma_8$ constraints. However, the higher multipole region of the CMB temperature anisotropy data are better fit by the tilted flat-$\Lambda$ model than by the closed models.
