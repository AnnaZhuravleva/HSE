A large experimental program is underway to extend the sensitivity of direct detection experiments, searching for interaction of Dark Matter with nuclei, down to the {\it neutrino floor}. However, such experiments are becoming increasingly difficult and costly due to the large target masses and exquisite background rejection needed for the necessary improvements in sensitivity. We investigate an alternative approach to the detection of Dark Matter--nucleon interactions: Searching for the persistent traces left by Dark Matter scattering in ancient minerals obtained from much deeper than current underground laboratories. For such a search, it is crucial to understand the details of the nuclear recoils induced by Dark Matter, in particular, the range of the recoiling nuclei in the material. We estimate the sensitivity of paleo-detectors, which extends down to the neutrino floor for a wide range of Dark Matter masses. With readily available $\mathcal{O}(500)\,$Myr old minerals, paleo-detectors can probe spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections 2--3 orders of magnitude lower than current direct detection limits for most of the WIMP mass range.
