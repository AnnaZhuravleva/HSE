These lecture notes are based on the hand-written notes which I prepared for the cosmology course taught to graduate students of PPGFis and PPGCosmo at the Federal University of Esp\'irito Santo (UFES), starting from 2014. This course covers topics ranging from the evidence of the expanding universe to Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies. They can be found also on my personal webpage http://ofp.cosmo-ufes.org/ and shall be published by Springer in 2018.
