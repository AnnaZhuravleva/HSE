The existence of the cosmic neutrino background is a fascinating prediction of the hot big bang model. These neutrinos were a dominant component of the energy density in the early universe and, therefore, played an important role in the evolution of cosmological perturbations. In particular, fluctuations in the neutrino density produced a distinct shift in the temporal phase of sound waves in the primordial plasma, which has recently been detected in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this paper, we report on the first measurement of this neutrino-induced phase shift in the spectrum of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) of the BOSS DR12 data. Constraining the acoustic scale using Planck data, and marginalizing over the effects of neutrinos in the CMB, we find evidence for a non-zero phase shift at greater than 95% confidence. We also demonstrate the robustness of this result in simulations and forecasts. Besides being a new measurement of the cosmic neutrino background, our work is the first application of the BAO signal to early universe physics and a non-trivial confirmation of the standard cosmological history.
