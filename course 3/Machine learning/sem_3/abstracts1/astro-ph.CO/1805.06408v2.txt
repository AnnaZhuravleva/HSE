We use all available baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Hubble parameter data to constrain the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, dynamical dark energy, and spatial curvature in simple cosmological models. We find that the consensus spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model provides a reasonable fit to the data, but depending on the Hubble constant prior and cosmological model, it can be a little more than 1$\sigma$ away from the best-fit model, which can favor mild dark energy dynamics or non-flat spatial hypersurfaces.
