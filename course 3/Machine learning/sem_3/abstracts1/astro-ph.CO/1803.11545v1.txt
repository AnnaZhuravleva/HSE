Precision cosmology enables to test fundamental physics, including neutrino properties, with unprecedented accuracy. In this work, I review the basics of neutrino cosmology. I briefly describe how neutrinos affect cosmological observables, such as anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and fluctuations in the matter field. I show current constraints and projected sensitivities on the sum of the neutrino masses $\Sigma m_\nu$ and on the number of relativistic species $N_\mathrm{eff}$ from a selection of cosmological data. I finally comment about the implications of those bounds for neutrino physics.
