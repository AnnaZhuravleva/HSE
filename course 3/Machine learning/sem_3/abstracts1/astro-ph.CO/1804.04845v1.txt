With the recent progresses on the Type II supernovae, we attempt to investigate whether there does exist new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm, i.e., the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ plus cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM). Constraining four alternative cosmological models with currently available Type II supernovae data calibrated by the standard color method, at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, we find that: (i) a spatially flat universe is supported for the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM model; (ii) the constrained equation of state of dark energy $\omega$ is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM hypothesis for the $\omega$CDM model where $\omega$ is a free parameter; (iii) for the decaying vacuum model, there is no evidence of interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the dark sector of the universe; (iv) there is also no hint of dynamical dark energy for the dark energy density-parametrization scenario. It is very obvious that a larger Type II supernovae sample is required, if we expect to draw definitive conclusions about the formation and evolution of the universe.
