Up to now several gravitational-wave events from the coalescences of black hole binaries have been reported by LIGO/VIRGO, and imply that black holes should have an extended mass function. We work out the merger rate distribution of primordial-black-hole binaries with a general mass function by taking into account the torques by all primordial black holes and linear density perturbations. In the future, many more coalescences of black hole binaries are expected to be detected, and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional merger rate distributions will be crucial for reconstructing the mass function of primordial black holes.
