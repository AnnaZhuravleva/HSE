The nonlinear interaction between one graviton and two scalars is enhanced in specific inflationary models, potentially leading to distinguishable signatures in the bispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. We develop the tools to examine such bispectrum signatures, and show a first application using WMAP temperature data. We consider several $\ell$-ranges, estimating the $g_{tss}$ amplitude parameter, by means of the so-called separable modal methodology. We do not find any evidence of a tensor-scalar-scalar signal at any scale. Our tightest bound on the size of the tensor-scalar-scalar correlator is derived from our measurement including all the multipoles in the range $ 2 \leq \ell \leq 500$ and it reads $g_{tss} = -48 \pm 28$ ($68\%$CL). This is the first direct observational constraint on the primordial tensor-scalar-scalar correlation, and it will be cross-checked and improved by applying the same pipeline to high-resolution temperature and polarization data from $Planck$ and forthcoming CMB experiments.
