We consider a scenario in which the inflaton $\phi$ is a pseudoscalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity through a term of the form ${\cal X} R \phi^2$. The pseudoscalar is also coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field (or an ensemble of ${\cal N}$ gauge fields) through an axial coupling of the form $\phi F \tilde{F}$. After Ref.~\cite{Anber:2009ua}, it is well known that this axial coupling leads to a production of gauge particles which acts as a friction term in the dynamics of the inflaton, producing a slow-roll regime even in presence of a steep potential. A remarkable result in this scenario, is that the spectrum of the chiral gravitational waves sourced by the scalar-gauge field interplay can be enhanced due to the non-minimal coupling with gravity, leading to measurable signatures, while maintaining agreement with current observational constraints on $n_s$ and $r$. The inclusion of non-minimal coupling could be helpful to alleviate tensions with non-Gaussianity bounds in models including axial couplings.
