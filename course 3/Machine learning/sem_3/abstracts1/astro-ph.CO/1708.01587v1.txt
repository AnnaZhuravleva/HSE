We study the imprints of a massive spin-2 field on inflationary observables, and in particular on the breaking of consistency relations. In this setup, the minimal inflationary field content interacts with the massive spin-2 field through dRGT interactions, thus guaranteeing the absence of Boulware-Deser ghostly degrees of freedom. The unitarity requirement on spinning particles, known as Higuchi bound, plays a crucial role for the size of the observable signal.
