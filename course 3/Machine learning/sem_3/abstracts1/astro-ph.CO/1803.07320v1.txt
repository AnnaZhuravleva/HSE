The recent local measurement of Hubble constant leads to a more than $3\sigma$ tension with Planck + LCDM (Riess et al, 2018). In this article we study the $H_0$ tension in non-flat QCDM cosmology, where Q stands for a minimally coupled and slowly rolling quintessence field $\phi$ with a smooth potential $V(\phi)$. By generalizing the QCDM parametrization in Huang et al, 2011 to non-flat universe and using the latest cosmological data, we find that the $H_0$ tension remains at $3.2\sigma$ level for this class of model.
