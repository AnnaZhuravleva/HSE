In this letter, we report precise and robust observational constraints on dark matter-dark energy scattering cross section, using the latest data from cosmic microwave background (CMB) Planck temperature and polarization, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements and weak gravitational lensing data from Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). The scattering scenario consists of a pure momentum exchange between the dark components, and we find $\sigma_d < 10^{-29} \, {\rm cm^2}$ at 95\% CL from the joint analysis (CMB + BAO + CFHTLenS), for typical dark matter particle mass of the order 1-10 ${\rm GeV}/c^2$. We notice that the scattering among the dark components may influence the growth of large scale structure in the Universe, leaving the background cosmology unaltered.
