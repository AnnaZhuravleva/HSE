The inherently unstable nature of domain walls makes their detection in laboratory experiments extremely challenging. We propose a method to stabilise domain walls in a particular modified gravity model inside a cavity. We suggest two ways in which the walls could be detected once stabilized: studying the trajectories of Ultra Cold Neutrons (UCN's) either via the deflection angle of a neutron beam induced by the attraction towards the wall or through the time difference of these particles passing through the wall. We give realistic estimates for these effects and expect that they should be detectable experimentally.
