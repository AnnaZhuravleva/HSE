We present the convolutional neural network used in reference [11] to detect cosmic strings in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy maps. By training our neural network on numerically generated CMB temperature maps with and without cosmic strings the network can produce prediction maps that locate the position of the cosmic strings and provide a probabilistic estimate of the value of the string tension $G\mu$. The network as applied to noiseless simulations of CMB maps with arcminute resolution was able to locate strings and accurately determine the value of the string tension for sky maps having strings with string tension as low as $G\mu=5\times10^{-9}$.
