We investigate rotationally supported dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies as new targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches with gamma-ray telescopes. Differently from pressure-supported objects, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies provides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution. We then are able to calculate the astrophysical factors (or J-factors) of a sample of 36 dIrr galaxies. The range of the calculated values extends from $\sim10^{14}$ to $\sim \text{few}\hspace{0.1cm}\times$ $10^{17}\,\text{GeV}^2\text{cm}^{-5}$ and it turns out to be comparable with the J-factors of the well-known dwarf spheroidal galaxies, that is in the range from $\sim10^{12}$ to $\sim10^{20}\,\text{GeV}^2\text{cm}^{-5}$ including the uncertainties. However, the star-forming region in dIrrs constitutes an extra background, that is instead negligible in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Therefore, we study the possibility of masking the unresolved star-forming regions of these galaxies with the intention of searching for the secondary gamma rays produced by DM annihilation events in their extended halos. We also individuate two galaxies IC10 and Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) as the best candidates for indirect DM searches in our galaxy sample. Finally, we get the prospective constraints on the DM annihilation cross-section by means of the current and next-generation gamma-ray telescopes.
