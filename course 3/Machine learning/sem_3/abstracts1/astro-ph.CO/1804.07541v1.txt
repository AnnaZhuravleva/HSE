The decay of massive particles during inflation generates characteristic signals in the squeezed limit of the primordial bispectrum. These signals are in particular distinctive in the regime of the quasi-single field inflation, where particles are oscillating with masses comparable to the Hubble scale. We apply the investigation to a class of scalar particles that experience a so-called waterfall phase transition in the isocurvature direction driven by the symmetry-breaking mechanism based on the hybrid inflation scenario. With a time-varying mass, a novel shape of oscillatory bispectrum is presented as the signature of a waterfall phase transition during inflation.
