We study multi-field inflation in random potentials generated via a non-equilibrium random matrix theory process. We make a novel modification of the process to include correlations between the elements of the Hessian and the height of the potential, similar to a Random Gaussian Field (RGF). We present the results of over 50,000 inflationary simulations involving 5-100 fields. For the first time, we present results of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ fields using the full `transport method', without slow-roll approximation. We conclude that Planck compatibility is a common prediction of such models, however significant isocurvature power at the end of inflation is possible.
