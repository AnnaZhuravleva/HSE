We report on a search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) using 278.8 days of data collected with the XENON1T experiment at LNGS. XENON1T utilizes a liquid xenon time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of $(1.30 \pm 0.01)$ t, resulting in a 1.0 t$\times$yr exposure. The energy region of interest, [1.4, 10.6] $\mathrm{keV_{ee}}$ ([4.9, 40.9] $\mathrm{keV_{nr}}$), exhibits an ultra-low electron recoil background rate of $(82\substack{+5 \\ -3}\textrm{ (sys)}\pm3\textrm{ (stat)})$ events/$(\mathrm{t}\times\mathrm{yr}\times\mathrm{keV_{ee}})$. No significant excess over background is found and a profile likelihood analysis parameterized in spatial and energy dimensions excludes new parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent elastic scatter cross-section for WIMP masses above 6 GeV/c${}^2$, with a minimum of $4.1\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ at 30 GeV/c${}^2$ and 90% confidence level.
