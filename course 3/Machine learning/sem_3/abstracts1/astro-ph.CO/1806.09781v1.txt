The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) provides a direct way to measure the luminosity distance, which enables us to probe cosmology. In this paper, we continue to expand the application of GW standard sirens in cosmology, and propose that the spatial curvature can be estimated in a model-independent way by comparing the distances from future GW sources and current cosmic chronometric observations. We expect an electromagnetic counterpart of the GW event to give the source redshift, and simulate hundreds of GW data from the coalescence of double neutron stars and black hole--neutron star binaries using the Einstein Telescope as reference. Our simulations show that, from 100 simulated GW events and observations of cosmic chronometers, the error of the curvature parameter $\Omega_{K}$ is expected to be constrained at the level of $\sim0.125$. If 1000 GW events are observed, the uncertainty of $\Omega_{K}$ would be further reduced to $\sim0.04$. Compared to some actual model-independent curvature tests involving the distances from other cosmic probes, this method with GW data achieves constraints with much higher precision.
