We study anisotropic inflationary solutions in massive Gauge-flation. We work with the theory in both the Stueckelberg and dynamical symmetry-breaking limits and demonstrate that extended periods of accelerated anisotropic expansion are possible. In the case of dynamical symmetry breaking, we show that spacetime can transition from isotropic quasi-de Sitter space to an accelerating Bianchi spacetime due to a rolling Higgs field - the spacetime can develop hair. Similarly, symmetry restoring transitions are possible from accelerating Bianchi spacetime to quasi-de Sitter space - the spacetime can lose its hair. These transitions can be arranged to occur quickly, within an $e$-folding or so, or over tens of $e$-folds.
