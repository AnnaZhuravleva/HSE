Internal galaxy and cluster dynamics employ Newton's gravity, which neglects the field self-interaction effects of General Relativity. This may be why dark matter seems needed to understand these dynamics. While the Universe evolution is treated with General Relativity, the approximations of isotropy and homogeneity effectively suppress field self-interaction effects and this may introduce the need for dark energy to describe the Universe's evolution. Calculations have shown that an increased binding due to self-interaction can indeed account for galaxy and cluster dynamics without dark matter. This increased binding implies an effective weakening of gravity outside the bound system. In this article, such suppression is estimated and its consequence for the Universe's evolution is discussed. Observations are reproduced without need for dark energy.
