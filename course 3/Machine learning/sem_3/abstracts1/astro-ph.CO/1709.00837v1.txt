The gravitational waves from compact binary systems are viewed as a standard siren to probe the evolution of the universe. This paper summarizes the potential and ability to use the gravitational waves to constrain the cosmological parameters and the dark sector interaction in the Gaussian process methodology. After briefly introducing the method to reconstruct the dark sector interaction by the Gaussian process, the concept of standard sirens and the analysis of reconstructing the dark sector interaction with LISA are outlined. Furthermore, we estimate the constraint ability of the gravitational waves on cosmological parameters with ET. The numerical methods we use are Gaussian process and the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo. Finally, we also forecast the improvements of the abilities to constrain the cosmological parameters with ET and LISA combined with the \it Planck.
