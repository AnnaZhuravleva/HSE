We study the post-inflationary dynamics of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs field in the presence of a non-minimal coupling $\xi|\Phi|^2R$ to gravity, both with and without the electroweak gauge fields coupled to the Higgs. We assume a minimal scenario in which inflation and reheating are caused by chaotic inflaton with quadratic potential, and no additional new physics is relevant below the Planck scale. By using classical real-time lattice simulations with a renormalisation group improved effective Higgs potential, and by demanding the stability of the Higgs vacuum after inflation, we obtain upper bounds for $\xi$, taking into account the experimental uncertainty of the top-Yukawa coupling. We compare the bounds in the absence and presence of the electroweak gauge bosons, and conclude that the addition of gauge interactions does have a rather minimal impact. In the unstable cases, we parametrize the time when such instability develops. For a top quark mass $m_t \approx173.3 {\rm GeV}$, the Higgs vacuum instability is triggered for $\xi \gtrsim 4 -5$, although a slightly lower mass $m_t \approx 172.1 {\rm GeV}$ pushes up this limit to $\xi \gtrsim 11 - 12$. This, together with the estimation $\xi \gtrsim 0.06$ for stability during inflation, provides tight constraints to the Higgs-curvature coupling within the SM.
