We study the nonlinear effects of the clustering and smooth quintessence. We present numerical and also approximate semi-analytical expressions of nonlinear power spectrum both for clustering and smooth dark energy models beyond the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) scale. This approximation is motivated by the extension of the resummation method of Anselmi $\&$ Pietroni (2012) for the dark energy models with evolving equation of state. The results of this scheme allow us for the prediction of the nonlinear power spectrum in the mildly nonlinear regime up to few percentage accuracies compared to the other available tools to compute the nonlinear power spectrum for the evolving dark energy models.
