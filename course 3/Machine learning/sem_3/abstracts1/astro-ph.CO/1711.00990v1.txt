In this letter, we propose a novel scenario which simultaneously explains $\mathcal{O}(10)M_\odot$ primordial black holes (PBHs) and dark matter in the minimally supersymmetric standard model. Gravitational waves (GWs) events detected by LIGO-Virgo collaboration suggest an existence of black holes as heavy as $\sim 30M_\odot$. In our scenario, as seeds of the PBHs, we make use of the baryon number perturbations which are induced by the special type of Affleck-Dine mechanism. Furthermore, the scenario does not suffer from the stringent constraints from CMB $\mu$-distortion due to the Silk damping and pulsar timing. We find the scenario can explain not only the current GWs events consistently, but also dark matter abundance by the non-topological solitons formed after Affleck-Dine mechanism, called Q-balls.
