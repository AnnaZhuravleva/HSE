We develop a fully self-consistent N-body simulation pipeline and apply this pipeline to refine general phenomenological interacting dark energy models. Comparing our simulation results with the SDSS galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements, we obtain up to $820\%$ improvement of the constraint on the interaction strength compared with the previous linear examination. This improvement attributes to the correct treatment of the non-linear structure formation at low redshifts, where weak lensing measurements are sensitive.
