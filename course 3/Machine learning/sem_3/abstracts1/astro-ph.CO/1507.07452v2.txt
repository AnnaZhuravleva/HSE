We exploit a new numerical technique for evaluating the tree order contributions to the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra for scalar potential models of inflation. Among other things we use the formalism to develop a good analytic approximation which goes beyond generalized slow roll expansions in that (1) it is not contaminated by the physically irrelevant phase, (2) its 0th order term is exact for constant first slow roll parameter, and (3) the correction is multiplicative rather than additive. These features allow our formalism to capture at first order, effects which are higher order in other expansions. Although this accuracy is not necessary to compare current data with any specific model, our method has a number of applications owing to the simpler representation it provides for the connection between the power spectra and the expansion history of a general model.
