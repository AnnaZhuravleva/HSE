We present the first predictions for the angular power spectrum of the astrophysical gravitational wave background constituted of the radiation emitted by all resolved and unresolved astrophysical sources. Its shape and amplitude depend on both the astrophysical properties on galactic scales and on cosmological properties. We show that the angular power spectrum behaves as $C_{\ell}\propto 1/{\ell}$ on large scales and that relative fluctuations of the signal are of order 30% at 100 Hz. We also present the correlations of the astrophysical gravitational wave background with weak-lensing and galaxy distribution. These numerical results pave the way to the study of a new observable at the crossroad between general relativity, astrophysics and cosmology.
