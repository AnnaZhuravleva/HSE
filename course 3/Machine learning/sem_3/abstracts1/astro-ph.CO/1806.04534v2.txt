In this work we effectively calculated the two-dimensional Minkowski functionals for cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps generated by single field models of inflation with a standard kinetic term. We started with calculation of the bispectrum of initial perturbations and then calculated the two-dimensional configuration space cubic moments for temperature fluctuations. These cubic moments give rise to first order non-Gaussian correction terms to the Minkowski functionals. Thus, we developed a robust mechanism to predict the amount of non-Gaussianity generated by inflation in the CMB temperature maps using Minkowski functionals.
