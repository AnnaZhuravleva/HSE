We briefly discuss the intriguing case of a phenomenological non-gravitational coupling in the dark sector, where the interaction is parameterized as an energy transfer either from dark matter to dark energy or the opposite. We show that a non-zero coupling with an energy flow from the latter to the former leads to a full reconciliation of the tension between high- and low-redshift observations present in the standard cosmological model.
