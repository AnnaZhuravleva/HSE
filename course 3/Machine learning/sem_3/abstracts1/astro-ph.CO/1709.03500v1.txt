Primordial black hole (PBH), which can be naturally produced in the early universe, remains a promising dark matter candidate . It can merge with a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of a galaxy and generate gravitational wave (GW) signals in the favored frequency region of LISA-like experiments. In this work, we initiate the study on the event rate calculation for such extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI). Including the sensitivities of various proposed GW detectors, we find that such experiments offer a novel and outstanding tool to test the scenario where PBH constitutes (fraction of) dark matter. The PBH energy density fraction of DM ($f_\text{PBH}$) could potentially be explored as small as $10^{-3} \sim 10^{-4}$. Further, LISA has the capability to search for PBH mass upto $10^{-2} \sim 10^{-1} M_\odot$. Other proposed GW experiments can probe lower PBH mass regime.
