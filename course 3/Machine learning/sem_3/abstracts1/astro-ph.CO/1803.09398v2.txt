The recently announced results on 21-cm absorption spectrum by EDGES can place very interesting constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross sections and corresponding channels. We properly take into account all the annihilation from the radiation epoch to the 21-cm observation redshifts in the Boltzmann code for the cosmic microwave background. Our results show that one can use the 21-cm absorption profile to constrain the dark matter interactions for the first time. For DM annihilation into the $e^+e^-$ channel, the EDGES results give the most stringent upper limit on the annihilation cross section at the lower dark matter mass region comparing with other existing limits.
