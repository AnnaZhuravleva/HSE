We explore the possibility that Fast Radio Bursts are due to the annihilation of cusps on cosmic string loops. We compute the energy released in the annihilation events in the radio region, the expected event rate, and the time scale of the bursts. We find that the energy and event rates are sufficiently high and the time scale is sufficiently small to explain the current data. We predict how the event rate will change as the resolution of telescopes improves. Since the burst rate depends on the string tension, future data will allow the determination of the tension.
