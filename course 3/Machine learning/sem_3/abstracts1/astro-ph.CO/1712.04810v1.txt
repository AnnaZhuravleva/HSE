We present a general approach for modelling the small-scale suppression in the linear matter power spectrum induced by the presence of non-cold dark matter. We show that the new parametrisation accurately describes a large variety of non-thermal scenarios, removing the need to individually test each of them. We discuss the first astrophysical constraints on its free parameters and we outline the next steps for pursuing a full statistical data analysis.
