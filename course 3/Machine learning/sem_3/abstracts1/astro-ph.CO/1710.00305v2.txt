We initiate a study on various cosmological imprints of string axions whose scalar potentials have plateau regions. In such cases, we show that a delayed onset of oscillation generically leads to a parametric resonance instability. In particular, for ultralight axions, the parametric resonance can enhance the power spectrum slightly below the Jeans scale, alleviating the tension with the Lyman $\alpha$ forest observations. We also argue that a long-lasting resonance can lead to an emission of gravitational waves at the frequency bands which are detectable by gravitational wave interferometers and pulsar timing arrays.
