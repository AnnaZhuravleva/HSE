Compact dark masses of $\simeq 2000M_\odot$ have been derived at the centers of well studied globular clusters orbiting our galaxy, representing $\simeq 0.1\%$ of the mass of these compact stellar systems. While it is tempting to conclude these dark masses are long sought examples of "intermediate mass" black holes (IMBH), no confirming radio/X-ray emission is detected and extended sizes of $\simeq 0.09 ~\rm{pcs}$ are permitted by the observations that are much larger than the Schwartzchild radius ($\simeq 3 \times 10^{-4}~\rm{pcs}$). Here we offer a standing wave explanation for the observed properties of these dark objects, as a soliton composed of light bosons, $m = \left( 3.2 \pm 0.62 \right)\times 10^{-18} eV$, that should develop in the deep gravitational potentials of globular clusters orbiting within the dark halo of our galaxy, from the presence of only a small fraction, $\simeq 10^{-2}$, of the dark matter in this form. This would add to the dominant Universal dark matter that is increasingly interpreted as a lighter boson of $10^{-22}eV$, implied by the large dark cores of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Identification of two such light bosonic mass scales of $10^{-18}eV$ and $10^{-22}eV$, favors a generic string theory prediction as dimensional compactification generates a wide, discrete mass spectrum of axionic scalar fields. Observations with improved resolution can test this important theory for the dark matter by resolving our predicted soliton scale, below $\simeq 0.1~\rm{pc}$.
