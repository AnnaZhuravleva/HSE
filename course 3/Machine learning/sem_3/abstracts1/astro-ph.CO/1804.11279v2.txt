Heavy scalar fields can undergo an instability during inflation as a result of their kinetic couplings with the inflaton. This is known as the geometrical destabilization of inflation, as it relies on the effect of the negative curvature of the field-space manifold overcoming the stabilizing force of the potential. This instability can drive the system away from its original path in field space into a new inflationary attractor, a scenario that we dub sidetracked inflation. We study this second phase and its observable consequences in several classes of two-field models. We show that cosmological fluctuations exhibit varied behaviours depending on the potential and the field space geometry, and that they can be captured by single-field effective theories with either a modified dispersion relation, a reduced speed of sound, or an imaginary one --- the latter case describing a transient tachyonic growth of the fluctuations. We also numerically calculate the bispectrum with the transport approach, finding large non-Gaussianities of equilateral and orthogonal shapes. In the hyperbolic geometry the potentials of our models present a pole at the boundary of the Poincar\'e disk and we discuss their relationships with $\alpha$-attractors.
