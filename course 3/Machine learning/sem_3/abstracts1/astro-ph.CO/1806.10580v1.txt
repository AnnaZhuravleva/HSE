A recently proposed Asymptotically Safe cosmology provides an elegant mechanism towards understanding the nature of dark energy and its associated cosmic coincidence problem. The underlying idea is that the accelerated expansion of the universe can occur due to infrared quantum gravity modifications at intermediate astrophysical scales (galaxies or galaxy clusters) which produce local anti-gravity sources. In this cosmological model no extra unproven energy scales or fine-tuning are used. In this study the Asymptotically Safe model is confronted with the most recent observational data from low-redshift probes, namely measurements of the Hubble parameter, standard candles (Pantheon SnIa, Quasi-stellar objects) and high redshift probes (CMB shift parameters). Performing an overall likelihood analysis we constrain the free parameters of the model and we test its performance against the concordance model (flat $\Lambda$CDM) utilizing the AIC statistical test. We find that the Asymptotically Safe model is statistically equivalent with that of $\Lambda$CDM, hence it can be seen as a viable and very efficient cosmological alternative.
