The formalism of dark energy based on modeling speed of sound as a function of equation of state parameter is elaborated. A specific model which allows detailed study of cosmological constant boundary crossing is introduced and analytical solutions for the model dynamics are obtained. It is shown how in specific parameter regimes dark energy can be a transient phenomenon. It is further demonstrated how the model reproduces specific features of recent fits of dark energy $w(z)$ to observational data.
