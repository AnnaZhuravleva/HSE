The use of Eulerian 'standard perturbation theory' to describe mass assembly in the early universe has traditionally been limited to modes with k $\lesssim$ 0.1 h/Mpc at z = 0. At larger k the SPT power spectrum deviates from measurements made using N-body simulations. Recently, there has been progress in extending the reach of perturbation theory to larger k using ideas borrowed from effective field theory. We revisit the computation of the redshift-space matter power spectrum within this framework, including for the first time the full one-loop time dependence. We use a resummation scheme proposed by Vlah et al. to account for damping of baryonic acoustic oscillations due to large-scale random motions and show that this has a significant effect on the multipole power spectra. We renormalize by comparison to a suite of custom N-body simulations matching the MultiDark MDR1 cosmology. At z = 0 and for scales k $\lesssim$ 0.4 h/Mpc we find that the EFT furnishes a description of the real-space power spectrum up to $\sim$2%, for the $\ell$ = 0 mode up to $\sim$5%, and for the $\ell$ = 2, 4 modes up to $\sim$25%. We argue that, in the MDR1 cosmology, positivity of the $\ell$ = 0 mode gives a firm upper limit of k $\approx$ 0.75 h/Mpc for the validity of the one-loop EFT prediction in redshift space using only the lowest-order counterterm. We show that replacing the one-loop growth factors by their Einstein-de Sitter counterparts is a good approximation for the $\ell$ = 0 mode, but can induce deviations as large as 2% for the $\ell$ = 2, 4 modes. An accompanying software bundle, distributed under open source licenses, includes Mathematica notebooks describing the calculation, together with parallel pipelines capable of computing both the necessary one-loop SPT integrals and the effective field theory counterterms.
