We evaluate the dimensionless non-Gaussianity parameter $h_{_{\rm NL}}$, that characterizes the amplitude of the tensor bispectrum, numerically for a class of two field inflationary models such as double inflation, hybrid inflation and aligned natural inflation. We compare the numerical results with the slow roll results which can be obtained analytically. In the context of double inflation, we also investigate the effects on $h_{_{\rm NL}}$ due to curved trajectories in the field space. We explicitly examine the validity of the consistency relation governing the tensor bispectrum in the squeezed limit. Lastly, we discuss the contribution to $h_{_{\rm NL}}$ due to the epoch of preheating in two field models.
