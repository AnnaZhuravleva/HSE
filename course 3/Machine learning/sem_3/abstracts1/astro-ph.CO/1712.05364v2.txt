Simple models of single-field inflation in the very early universe can generate the observed amplitude and scale dependence of the primordial density perturbation, but models with multiple fields can provide an equally good fit to current data. We show how future observations will be able to distinguish between currently favoured models. If a curvaton field generates the primordial perturbations after inflation, we show how the total duration of inflation can be measured.
