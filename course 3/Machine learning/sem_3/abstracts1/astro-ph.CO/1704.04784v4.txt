We revisit the constraints on inflation models by using the current cosmological observations involving the latest local measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_{0} = 73.00\pm 1.75$ km s $^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$). We constrain the primordial power spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations with the observational data including the Planck 2015 CMB full data, the BICEP2 and Keck Array CMB B-mode data, the BAO data, and the direct measurement of $H_0$. In order to relieve the tension between the local determination of the Hubble constant and the other astrophysical observations, we consider the additional parameter $N_{\rm eff}$ in the cosmological model. We find that, for the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$N_{\rm eff}$ model, the scale invariance is only excluded at the 3.3$\sigma$ level, and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}>0$ is favored at the 1.6$\sigma$ level. Comparing the obtained 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ contours of $(n_s,r)$ with the theoretical predictions of selected inflation models, we find that both the convex and concave potentials are favored at 2$\sigma$ level, the natural inflation model is excluded at more than 2$\sigma$ level, the Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation model is only favored at around 2$\sigma$ level, and the spontaneously broken SUSY inflation model is now the most favored model.
