Indirect detection of dark matter is a major avenue for discovery. However, baryonic backgrounds are diverse enough to mimic many possible signatures of dark matter. In this work, we study the newly proposed technique of dark matter velocity spectroscopy\,\cite{speckhard2016}. The non-rotating dark matter halo and the Solar motion produce a distinct longitudinal dependence of the signal which is opposite in direction to that produced by baryons. Using collisionless dark matter only simulations of Milky Way like halos, we show that this new signature is robust and holds great promise. We develop mock observations by high energy resolution X-ray spectrometer on a sounding rocket, the Micro-X experiment, to our test case, the 3.5 keV line. We show that by using six different pointings, Micro-X can exclude a constant line energy over various longitudes at $\geq$ 3$\sigma$. The halo triaxiality is an important effect and it will typically reduce the significance of this signal. We emphasize that this new {\it smoking gun in motion} signature of dark matter is general, and is applicable to any dark matter candidate which produces a sharp photon feature in annihilation or decay.
