We show that breaking of the conformal invariance of electromagnetic Lagrangian which is required for inflationary magnetogenesis arises naturally in the Poincare Gauge Theory. We find that in the minimal version of this model the generated magnetic field is too small to explain the observations. We propose some generalizations of the minimal model which may lead to sufficiently large magnetic fields.
