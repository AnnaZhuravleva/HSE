We study Bose condensation and formation of Bose stars in the virialized dark matter halos/miniclusters by universal gravitational interactions. We prove that this phenomenon does occur and it is described by kinetic equation. We give expression for the condensation time. Our results suggest that Bose stars may form in the mainstream dark matter models such as invisible QCD axions and Fuzzy Dark Matter.
