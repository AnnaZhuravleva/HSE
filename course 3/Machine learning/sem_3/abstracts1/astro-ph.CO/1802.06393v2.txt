Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced by the perturbations that exit the horizon during inflationary phase. While inflation models predict the power spectrum of the perturbations in Fourier space, the PBH abundance depends on the probability distribution function (PDF) of density perturbations in real space. In order to estimate the PBH abundance in a given inflation model, we must relate the power spectrum in Fourier space to the PDF in real space by coarse-graining the perturbations with a window function. However, there are uncertainties on what window function should be used, which could change the relation between the PBH abundance and the power spectrum. This is particularly important in considering PBHs with mass $30 M_\odot$ that account for the LIGO events because the required power spectrum is severely constrained by the observations. In this paper, we investigate how large influence the uncertainties on the choice of a window function have over the power spectrum required for LIGO PBHs. As a result, it is found that the uncertainties significantly affect the prediction for the stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) induced by the second order effect of the perturbations. In particular, the pulsar timing array constraints on the produced GWs could disappear for the real-space top-hat window function.
