In this paper, we explore a detectable imprint of massive fields with integer spins $s \geq 2$, which may be predicted from string theory. It was shown that such a massive non-zero spin field can generate the squeezed primordial bispectrum which depends on the angle between the two wavenumbers. We show that considering the contribution from the massive spin-2 field, the angular dependent primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) yields a strong scale dependence in the bias parameter for the galaxy alignment, which becomes prominent at small scales. As another example of an angular dependent PNG, we also consider the primordial bispectrum where the angular dependence was introduced by a vector field, while breaking the global rotational symmetry. As a consequence, we find that the B-mode cosmic shear and non-diagonal components do not vanish. These aspects provide qualitative differences from the PNG sourced by massive non-zero spin fields.
