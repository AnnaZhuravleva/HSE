The cubic Galileon model containing the lowest non-trivial order action of the full Galileon action can produce the stable late-time cosmic acceleration. This model can have a significant role in the growth of structures. The signatures of the cubic Galileon model in the structure formation can be probed by the weak lensing statistics. Weak lensing convergence statistics is one of the strongest probes to the structure formation and hence it can probe the dark energy or modified theories of gravity models. In this work, we investigate the detectability of the cubic Galileon model from the $ \Lambda $CDM model or from the canonical quintessence model through the convergence power spectrum and bi-spectrum.
