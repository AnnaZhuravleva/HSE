Measurements of $\sigma_8$ from large scale structure observations show a discordance with the extrapolated $\sigma_8$ from Planck CMB parameters using $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Similar discordance is found in the value of $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$. In this paper, we show that the presence of viscosity in cold dark matter, shear or bulk or combination of both, can remove the above mentioned conflicts simultaneously. This indicates that the data from Planck CMB observation and different LSS observations prefer small but non-zero amount of viscosity in cold dark matter fluid.
