We estimate the lensing convergence power spectrum from supernovae magnification data using real space correlation function technique. For our analysis we have utilized 296 supernovae from 5-year Supernovae Legacy Survey in the weak lensing limit. The data we used consists of measurements from four different patches, each of them covers almost 1 square degree of the sky, merged together. We demonstrate that it is quite possible to have a good estimate of the convergence power spectrum from this data. Our primary intention is to extract meaningful informations from SNLS weak lensing data and to demonstrate how the power spectrum for convergence can be reconstructed therefrom, without going into the nitty-gritty of errors, although we have done some error analysis in the process.
