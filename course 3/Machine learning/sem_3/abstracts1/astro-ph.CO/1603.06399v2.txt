We propose a test of single-scalar inflation based on using the well-measured scalar power spectrum to reconstruct the tensor power spectrum, up to a single integration constant. Our test is a sort of integrated version of the single-scalar consistency relation. This sort of test can be used effectively, even when the tensor power spectrum is measured too poorly to resolve the tensor spectral index. We give an example using simulated data based on a hypothetical detection with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 0.01$. Our test can also be employed for correlating scalar and tensor features in the far future when the data is good.
