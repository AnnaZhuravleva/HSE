Extensions of the standard models of particle physics and cosmology often lead to long-range fifth forces whose strength and range depend on gravitational environment. Fifth forces on astrophysical scales are best studied in the cosmic web where perturbation theory breaks down. We present constraints on a symmetron- or chameleon-screened fifth force with Yukawa coupling and megaparsec range -- as well as an unscreened fifth force with differential coupling to galactic mass components -- by searching for the displacement it predicts between galaxies' stellar and gas mass centroids. Taking data from the \textit{Alfalfa} HI survey, identifying galaxies' gravitational environments with the maps of~\citet{Desmond:2017ctk} and forward-modelling with a Bayesian likelihood framework, we set upper bounds on the strength of the fifth force relative to Newtonian gravity, $\Delta G/G$, from $\sim \text{few} \: \times 10^{-4}$ ($1\sigma$) for range $\lambda_C = 50$ Mpc to $\sim 0.1$ for $\lambda_C = 500$ kpc. In $f(R)$ gravity this requires $f_{R0} \lesssim \text{few} \: \times \: 10^{-8}$. The analogous bounds without screening are $\sim \text{few} \: \times 10^{-4}$ and $\text{few} \times 10^{-3}$. These are the tightest and among the only fifth-force constraints on galaxy scales. We show how our results may be strengthened with future survey data and identify the key features of an observational programme for furthering fifth-force tests beyond the Solar System.
