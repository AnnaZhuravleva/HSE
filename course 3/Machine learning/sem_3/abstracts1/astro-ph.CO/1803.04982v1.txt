Ideas borrowed from renormalization group are applied to warm inflation to characterize the inflationary epoch in terms of flows away from the de Sitter regime. In this framework different models of inflation fall into universality classes. Furthermore, for warm inflation this approach also helps to characterise when inflation can smoothly end into the radiation dominated regime. Warm inflation has a second functional dependence compared to cold inflation due to dissipation, yet despite this feature, it is shown that the universality classes defined for cold inflation can be consistently extended to warm inflation.
