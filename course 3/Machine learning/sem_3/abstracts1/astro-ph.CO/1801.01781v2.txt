We introduce new CosmoEJS modules to improve the investigation of the consequences of constraints on the parameter values of cosmological models. We use CosmoMC to fit dark energy models and modified gravity models to recent data from the cosmic microwave background measurements of the Planck satellite, baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae type Ia, Hubble Parameter H(z) measurements, and redshift space distortions. While the results are in agreement with previous constraints for these models, here, we add an investigation into the statistical fits with CosmoEJS, an interactive Java package of simulations that allow the user to explore the ramifications of choosing various values for the cosmological parameters of a particular model. We visually and numerically inspect the plots of the simulated theoretical values for comparisons to the observational values, calculate derived cosmological values, and finally plot the expansion history of cosmological models. These new simulations now include modified gravity cosmological models as well as observations of the growth of structures of galaxies for a more accurate description of the universe's dynamics. The latest version of CosmoEJS is available from http://www.compadre.org/osp/items/detail.cfm?ID=12406.
