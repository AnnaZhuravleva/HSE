We revisit the cosmological and astrophysical constraints on the fraction of the dark matter in primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass function. We consider a variety of mass functions, all of which are described by three parameters: a characteristic mass and width and a dark matter fraction. Various observations then impose constraints on the dark matter fraction as a function of the first two parameters. We show how these constraints relate to those for a monochromatic mass function, demonstrating that they usually become more stringent in the extended case than the monochromatic one. Considering only the well-established bounds, and neglecting the ones that depend on additional astrophysical assumptions, we find that there are three mass windows, around $5\times 10^{-16}M_\odot,$ $2\times 10^{-14}M_\odot$ and $25-100M_\odot$, where PBHs can constitute all dark matter. However, if one includes all the bounds, PBHs can only constitute of order $10\%$ of the dark matter.
