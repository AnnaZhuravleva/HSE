Observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and the Planck mission suggest a hemispherical power amplitude asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background with a correlation length on the order of the size of the observable universe. We find that this anomaly can be naturally explained by a cosmic string of axion-like particle (ALP) field formed near the region of our universe. The cosmic string created a field variation around it, which then turned into particle density fluctuations after inflation. The ALPs consequently decayed into radiations before the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) era and resulted the observed power asymmetry. We find in this scenario that the hemispherical power amplitude asymmetry is strongly scale dependent: $A(k)\propto {\rm exp}(-kl)/k$. Interestingly, the constraints based on purely cosmological considerations give rise to a symmetry-breaking scale on the order of $10^{16}$GeV, which coincides with the grand unified theory scale. In addition, as the ALPs decayed into radiations before the BBN era, which requires a relatively heavy mass or strong self coupling, and considering that the potential breaks the shift symmetry softly in order to protect the system from radiative corrections, the ALP potential is "monodromy" in nature.
