We study the stability of cosmic string wakes against the disruption by the dominant Gaussian fluctuations which are present in cosmological models. We find that for a string tension given by $G \mu = 10^{-7}$ wakes remain locally stable until a redshift of $z = 6$, and for a value of $G \mu = 10^{-14}$ they are stable beyond a redshift of $z = 20$. We study a global stability criterion which shows that wakes created by strings at times after $t_{eq}$ are identifiable up to the present time, independent of the value of $G \mu$. Taking into account our criteria it is possible to develop strategies to search for the distinctive position space signals in cosmological maps which are induced by wakes.
