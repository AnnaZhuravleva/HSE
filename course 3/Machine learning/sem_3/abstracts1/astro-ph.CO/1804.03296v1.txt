In this work we use the latest observations on BAO, SNIa and $H(z)$ to constrain three models showing an explicit interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We find that using all three observational probes together, two of the interaction models show positive evidence at more than 2 $ \sigma $. Although significant, further study is needed to establish this statement firmly.
