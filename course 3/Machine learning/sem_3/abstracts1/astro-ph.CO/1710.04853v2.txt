It has been previously shown that the linear inflation appears naturally as a solution of Coleman-Weinberg inflation, provided that the inflaton has a non-minimal coupling to gravity and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. We revisit the previous study by improving the discussion of reheating and by comparing the results of the metric and the Palatini formulations of non-minimal gravity. We find that both formulations predict linear inflation but a different number of $e$-folds. If the non-minimal coupling is larger than one, future experimental sensitivity can discriminate between the two realizations.
