We investigate compact halos of sterile-neutrino dark matter and examine observable signatures with respect to neutrino and photon emission. Primarily, we consider two cases: primordial black-hole halos and ultra-compact mini-halos. In both cases, we find that there exists a broad range of possible parameter choices such that detection in the near future with X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes might be well possible. In fact, for energies above $10\,{\rm TeV}$, the neutrino telescope IceCube would be a splendid detection machine for such macroscopic dark-matter candidates.
