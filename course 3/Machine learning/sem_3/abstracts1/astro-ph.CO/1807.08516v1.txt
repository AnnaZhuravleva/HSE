Hidden photons and axion-like particles are candidates for cold dark matter if they were produced non-thermally in the early universe. We conducted a search for both of these bosons using 800 live-days of data from the XMASS detector with 327 kg of liquid xenon in the fiducial volume. No significant signal was observed, and thus we set constraints on the $\alpha' / \alpha$ parameter related to kinetic mixing of hidden photons and the coupling constant $g_{Ae}$ of axion-like particles in the mass range from 40 to 120 keV/$c^2$, resulting in $\alpha' / \alpha < 6 \times 10^{-26}$ and $g_{Ae} < 4 \times 10^{-13}$. These limits are the most stringent derived from both direct and indirect searches to date.
