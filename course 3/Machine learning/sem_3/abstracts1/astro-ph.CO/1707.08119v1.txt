We use the simulated gravitational-wave data to explore the evolution of the universe in light of current observations of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Taking advantage of state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to constrain the basic cosmological parameters, the Hubble constant, present matter density parameter and equation of state of dark energy, we find that LIGO needs about, at least 5-year data accumulation, namely about 1000 events, to achieve the accuracy comparable to the Planck result. We also find that, from a new information channel, the constrained value of the Hubble constant from 1000 simulated events is more consistent with the direct local observation by Riess et al. than the indirect global measurement by the Planck Collaboration at the $2\sigma$ confidence level. The combination of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals is very prospective to reveal the underlying physics of the universe.
