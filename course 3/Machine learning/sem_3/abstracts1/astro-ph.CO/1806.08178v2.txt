We explore possible non-Gaussian features of primordial gravitational waves by constructing model-independent templates for nonlinearity parameters of tensor bispectrum. Our analysis is based on Effective Field Theory of inflation that relies on no particular model as such and thus the results are quite generic. The analysis further reveals that chances of detecting squeezed limit tensor bispectrum are fairly higher than equilateral limit. We also discuss prospects of detectability in upcoming CMB missions.
