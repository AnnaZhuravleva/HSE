It is well-known that the first-order phase transition (PT) will yield a stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) background with a logo-like spectrum. However, we show that when such a PT happened during the primordial inflation, the GWs spectrum brought by the PT will be reddened, which thus records the unique voiceprint of inflation. We assess the abilities of the GW detectors to detect the corresponding signal.
