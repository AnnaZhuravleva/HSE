We compute in detail how deviations from Einstein gravity at the inflation energy scale could appear as non-Gaussian features in the sky. To illustrate this we use multi-field $\alpha-$attractor models in the framework of supergravity to realise inflation. We find no obvious obstacle for having choices of model's parameters that generate non-Gaussian features of the equilateral and local type at the $\cal O$(1) level in the $f_{\rm NL}$ non-Gaussianity parameter, thus being potentially detectable in future cosmological surveys. This non-Gaussianity has its origin in either the non-canonical kinetic term, the interactions of the fields in the potential or the $\alpha-$parameter, or a combination of these three. This opens up the exciting possibility of constraining the law of gravity at energy scales close to the Planck one.
