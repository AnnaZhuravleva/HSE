Accelerated expansion of the universe is well established through various cosmological observations including Type Ia supernovae redshift. In Newtonian cosmology and in Friedmann models based on Einstein's theory of gravitation this necessities an expansion energy approximately 3 times the total matter-energy density in the universe. We show here that this expansion energy can be accounted for by including magnetic energy density of the intergalactic field of order of {\mu}G, compatible with observations. The observed expansion rate, and the accelerated expansion of the universe at the Mpc scale is thus derived based on the spacetime vorticity generated cosmic magnetic fields.
