We present a Fisher matrix forecast for the sensitivity on the mass of a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) particle from current (DES-like) and future (LSST-like) photometric galaxy surveys using the galaxy angular power spectrum. We model the nonlinear clustering using a a modified Halo Model proposed to account for WDM effects. We estimate that from this observable alone a lower bound of $m_{\text{wdm}}>647\,$eV ($m_{\text{wdm}}>126\,$eV) for the LSST (DES) case could be obtained.
