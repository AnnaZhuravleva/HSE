Once quantum corrections are taken into account, the strong coupling limit of the $\xi$-attractor models (in metric gravity) might depart from the usual Starobinsky solution and move into linear inflation. Furthermore, it is well known that the metric and Palatini formulations of gravity lead to different inflationary predictions in presence of non-minimally couplings between gravity and the inflaton. In this letter we show that for a certain class of non-minimally coupled models, loop corrections will lead to a linear inflation attractor regardless of the adopted gravity formulation.
