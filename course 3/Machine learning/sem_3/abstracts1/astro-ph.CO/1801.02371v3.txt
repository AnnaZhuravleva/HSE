To explore whether there is new physics going beyond the standard cosmological model or not, we constrain seven cosmological models by combining the latest and largest Pantheon Type Ia supernovae sample with the data combination of baryonic acoustic oscillations, cosmic microwave background radiation, Planck lensing and cosmic chronometers. We find that a spatially flat universe is preferred in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, that the constrained equation of state of dark energy is very consistent with the cosmological constant hypothesis, that there is no evidence of dynamical dark energy, that there is no hint of interaction between dark matter and dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and that there does not exist the sterile neutrinos in the neutrino sector of the universe. We also give the 95$\%$ limit of the total mass of three active neutrinos $\Sigma m_\nu<0.178$ eV. It is clear that there is no any departure from the standard cosmological model based on current observational datasets.
