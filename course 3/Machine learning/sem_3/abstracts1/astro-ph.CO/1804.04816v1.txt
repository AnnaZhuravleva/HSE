The EDGES Collaboration has recently announced the detection of the 21-cm spectrum with an absorption profile centred at $78$ megahertz, of which the depth is deeper than that expected by the standard cosmological paradigm. To enrich the heating process of baryons due to scattering with dark matter during dark ages, we in this Letter explore the possibility of extra heat transfer between dark sector compositions and their observational signatures on the 21-cm cosmological spectrum. By parameterizing interaction models of the dark Universe, we find that the observational constraint on the parameter space of dark matter can be slightly relaxed but the discrepancy with the commonly predicted parameter space of weakly interacting massive particles remains. Our analyses also reveal that the interaction between dark compositions may leave observational signatures on the 21-cm spectrum during dark ages and thus would become detectable in the forthcoming 21-cm cosmology.
