Stability properties of gravitationally bound condensates composed of ultralight axionic Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) are studied. Collisions among themselves or with other astrophysical bodies could make condensates structurally unstable, making them prone to collapse and decay, and we estimate the relevant timescales using the time-dependent variational method. We conclude that instability of these condensates, stimulated by galaxy collisions or interactions with black holes, can occur. The subsequent decay takes place over an extended period, lasting as long as many thousands of years. We also discuss the possible relevance of FDM condensates to understanding the composition of Ultracompact Dwarf (UCD) Galaxies. Future observation of extremely massive black holes in the central regions of UCDs can constrain this interpretation.
