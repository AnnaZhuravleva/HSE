In this letter, combining peak theory and the numerical analysis of gravitational collapse in the radiation dominated era, we show that the abundance of primordial blacks holes, generated by an enhancement in the inflationary power spectrum, is extremely dependent upon the shape of the peak. Given the amplitude of the power spectrum we show that the density of primordial black holes generated from a narrow peak, is exponentially smaller compared to the case of a broad peak. Specifically, for a top-hat profile of the power spectrum in Fourier space, we find that in order to consider primordial black holes as the whole of dark matter, one needs the amplitude of the power spectrum to be an order of magnitude smaller than what has been used so far. In the case of a narrow peak, one would instead need a much larger amplitude, which in many cases invalidates the perturbative analysis of cosmological perturbations. Finally, we show that, although the critical collapse gives a broad mass spectrum, the density of primordial black holes is essentially peaked at a single mass value.
