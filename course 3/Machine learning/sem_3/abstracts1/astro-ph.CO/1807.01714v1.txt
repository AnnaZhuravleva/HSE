In a fully inhomogeneous, anisotropic cosmological simulation with numerical relativity, we find a local measurement of the Hubble parameter can be 1.2\% larger than a global measurement, considering scales comparable to Type 1a supernova surveys. We find inhomogeneities cannot fully resolve the tension between the \citet{riess2018b} and \citet{planck2016params} measurements, however in extreme cases the tension can be reduced to $2.3\sigma$.
