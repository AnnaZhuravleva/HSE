We examine the oscillon formation in a recently proposed inflation model of the pure natural inflation, where the inflaton is an axion that couples to a strongly-coupled pure Yang-Mills theory. The plateau of the inflaton potential, which is favored by recent observations, drives the fragmentation of the inflaton and can produce spatially localized oscillons. We find that the oscillons are formed for F<~ O(0.1) M_{Pl}, with F the effective decay constant of the model. We also comment on observations implications of the oscillons.
