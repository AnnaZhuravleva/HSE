The EDGES experiment has recently measured an anomalous global 21-cm spectrum due to hydrogen absorptions at redshifts of about $z\sim 17$. Model independently, the unusually low temperature of baryons probed by this observable sets strong constraints on any physical process that transfers energy into the baryonic environment at such redshifts. Here we make use of the 21-cm spectrum to derive bounds on the energy injection due to a possible population of ${\cal O}(1-100) M_\odot$ primordial black holes, which induce a wide spectrum of radiation during the accretion of the surrounding gas. After calculating the total radiative intensity of a primordial black hole population, we estimate the amount of heat and ionisations produced in the baryonic gas and compute the resulting thermal history of the Universe with a modified version of RECFAST code. Finally, by imposing that the temperature of the gas at $z\sim 17$ does not exceed the indications of EDGES, we constrain the possible abundance of primordial black holes. Depending on uncertainties related to the accretion model, we find that ${\cal O}(10) M_\odot$ primordial black holes can only contribute to a fraction $f_{\rm PBH}<(1-10^{-3})$ of the total dark matter abundance.
