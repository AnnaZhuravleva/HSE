We perform large-scale cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations directly via numerical relativity. Starting with initial conditions sampled from the cosmic microwave background, we track the emergence of a cosmic web without the need for a background cosmology. We measure the backreaction of large-scale structure on the evolution of averaged quantities in a matter-dominated universe. We find negligible global backreaction in our simulations, with cosmological parameters $\Omega_m = 1.005$, $\Omega_R = -1.2\times 10^{-8}$, and $\Omega_Q + \Omega_L = -2.9\times 10^{-9}$. Sampling smaller scales, above the homogeneity scale of the Universe ($100-180\,h^{-1}$Mpc), we find $2-3\%$ variations in mean spatial curvature and backreaction.
