We perform a detailed confrontation of various oscillating dark-energy parame-trizations with the latest sets of observational data. In particular, we use data from Joint Light Curve analysis (JLA) sample from Supernoave Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) distance measurements, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, redshift space distortion, weak gravitational lensing, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers, and the local Hubble constant value, and we impose constraints on four oscillating models. We find that all models are bent towards the phantom region, nevertheless in the three of them the quintessential regime is also allowed within 1$\sigma$ confidence-level. Furthermore, the deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are small, however for two of the models they could be visible at large scales, through the impact on the temperature anisotropy of the CMB spectra and on the matter power spectra.
