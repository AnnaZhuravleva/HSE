We propose a Cosmological Model Independent Time Delay (CMITD) method where the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) variable $K(z)$ is constructed by observational data instead of cosmological model. The simulated time delay data show the CMITD method could present the validity of LIV test. And, the errors in the propagating process is critical for the existence and magnitude of LIV.
