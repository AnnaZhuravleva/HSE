The growth of a massive black hole will steepen the cold dark matter density at the center of a galaxy into a dense spike, enhancing the prospects for indirect detection. We study the impact of black hole spin on the density profile using the exact Kerr geometry of the black whole in a fully relativistic adiabatic growth framework. We find that, despite the transfer of angular momentum from the hole to the halo, rotation increases significantly the dark matter density close to the black hole. The gravitational effects are still dominated by the black hole within its influence radius, but the larger dark matter annihilation fluxes might be relevant for indirect detection estimates.
