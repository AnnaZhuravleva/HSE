Intensity mapping enables us to test cosmology and fundamental physics during the Epoch of Reionisation, with power spectra of line fluctuations probing a large range of scales and redshifts. Cosmological volumes of 21cm line fluctuations in general modified gravity scenarios are presented, where additional parameters are the initial condition parameter $\alpha$ of matter perturbations and the scale-dependent modified gravity parameter $Y$ that measures deviations from General Relativity in the Poisson equation. For upcoming surveys like the SKA we forecast, using the power spectra derived from our simulations, the ability of intensity mapping to constrain modifications of gravity during reionisation, as well as investigate correlations with astrophysical parameters.
