We investigate for an Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework that can consistently explain inflation to Large Scale Structures (LSS). With the development of the construction algorithm of EFT, we arrive at a properly truncated action for the entire scenario. Using this, we compute the two-point correlation function for quantum fluctuations from Goldstone modes and related inflationary observables in terms of coefficients of relevant EFT operators, which we constrain using Planck 2015 data. We then carry forward this primordial power spectrum with the same set of EFT parameters to explain the linear and non-linear regimes of LSS by loop-calculations of the matter overdensity two-point function. For comparative analysis, we make use of two widely accepted transfer functions, namely, BBKS and Eisenstein-Hu, thereby making the analysis robust. We finally corroborate our results with LSS data from SDSS-DR7 and WiggleZ. The analysis thus results in a consistent, model-independent EFT framework for inflation to structures.
