We revisit a model-independent estimator for cosmic acceleration based on type Ia supernovae distance measurements. This approach does not rely on any specific theory for gravity, energy content or parameterization for the scale factor or deceleration parameter and is based on falsifying the {\it null hypothesis} that the Universe never expanded in an accelerated way. By generating mock catalogues of known cosmologies we test the robustness of this estimator establishing its limits of applicability. We detail the pros and cons of such approach. For example, we find that there are specific counterexamples in which the estimator wrongly provides evidence against acceleration in accelerating cosmologies. The dependence of the estimator on the $H_0$ value is also discussed. Finally, we update the evidence for acceleration using the recent UNION2.1 and JLA samples. Contrary to recent claims, available data strongly favors an accelerated expansion of the Universe in complete agreement with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model.
