With recent Lyman-alpha forest data from BOSS and XQ-100, some studies suggested that the lower mass limit on the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) particles is lifted up to $10^{-21}$ eV. However, such a limit was obtained by $\Lambda$CDM simulations with the FDM initial condition and the quantum pressure (QP) was not taken into account which could have generated non-trivial effects in large scales structures. We investigate the QP effects in cosmological simulations systematically, and find that QP leads to further suppression of the matter power spectrum at small scales. Furthermore, we estimate the flux power spectrum of Lyman-alpha forest, and compare it with data from BOSS and XQ-100 to set the lower bound on the FDM particle mass to $10^{-23}$ eV. We carefully estimate the uncertainty in the calculation of one-dimensional flux power spectrum due to the temperature of the hydrogen gas, and conclude that unless the effect of QP and the uncertainties of the temperature of the hydrogen gas are properly taken into account, one cannot exclude the FDM of mass larger than $10^{-22}$ eV at statistically significant levels.
