The Horndeski scalar-tensor theory and its recent extensions allow nonlinear derivative interactions of the scalar degree of freedom. We study the matter bispectrum of large scale structure as a probe of these modified gravity theories, focusing in particular on the effect of the terms that newly appear in the so-called "beyond Horndeski" theories. We derive the second-order solution for the matter density perturbations and find that the interactions beyond Horndeski lead to a new time-dependent coefficient in the second-order kernel which differs in general from the standard value of general relativity and the Horndeski theory. This can deform the matter bispectrum at the folded triangle configurations ($k_1+k_2=k_3$), while it is never possible within the Horndeski theory.
