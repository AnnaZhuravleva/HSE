In the paper is considered the use of a , $^{65}$Zn source in the BEST-2 gallium experiment to constrain the regions of the allowed oscillation parameters. The required activity of the $^{65}$Zn source for the BEST-2 experiment, its size, effect on the results of oscillatory measurements, as well as the possibility of production such a source are calculated. Schemes of measurements execution are considered.
