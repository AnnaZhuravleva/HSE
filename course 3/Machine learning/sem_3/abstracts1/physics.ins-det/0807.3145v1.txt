A special type of Hamamatsu MPPC, with a sensitive area of 1.3x1.3mm^2 containing 667 pixels with 50x50um^2 each, has been developed for the near neutrino detector in the T2K long baseline neutrino experiment. About 60 000 MPPCs will be used in total to read out the plastic scintillator detectors with wavelength shifting fibers. We report on the basic performance of MPPCs produced for T2K.
