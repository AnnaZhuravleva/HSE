We present design and simulation of a Josephson parametric amplifier with bandwidth exceeding 1.6 GHz, and with high saturation power approaching -90 dBm at a gain of 22.8 dB. An improvement by a factor of roughly 50 in bandwidth over the state of the art is achieved by using well-established impedance matching techniques. An improvement by a factor of roughly 100 in saturation power over the state of the art is achieved by implementing the Josephson nonlinear element as an array of rf-SQUIDs with a total of 40 junctions. WRSpice simulations of the circuit are in excellent agreement with the calculated gain and saturation characteristics.
