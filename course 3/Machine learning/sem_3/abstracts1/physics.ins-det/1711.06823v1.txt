The Belle-II VerteX Detector (VXD) is a 6 layers silicon tracker device that will cope with an unprecedented luminosity of 8 x 10^35 cm-2 s-1 achievable by the new SuperKEKB e+e- collider, now under commissioning at the KEK laboratory (Tsukuba, Japan). A radiation monitoring and beam abort system has been developed based on single-crystal s-CVD diamond sensors. The sensors will be placed in 20 key positions in the vicinity of the interaction region. The severe space limitations require a remote readout of the sensors. In this contribution we present the system design, along with the sensor characterisation procedure. We present also the preliminary results with the prototype system during the first SuperKEKB commissioning phase in February-June 2016.
