We present measurements of drift velocities and mobilities of some innovative negative ion gas mixtures at nearly atmospheric pressure based on SF$_{6}$ as electronegative capture agent and of pure SF$_{6}$ at various pressures, performed with the NITEC detector. NITEC is a Time Projection Chamber with 5 cm drift distance readout by a GEMPix, a triple thin GEMs coupled to a Quad-Timepix chip, directly sensitive to the deposited charge on each of the 55 $\times$ 55 $\mu$m$^2$ pixel. Our results contribute to expanding the knowledge on the innovative use of SF$_{6}$ as negative ion gas and extend to triple thin GEMs the possibility of negative ion operation for the first time. Above all, our findings show the feasibility of negative ion operation with He:CF$_4$:SF$_{6}$ at 610 Torr, opening extremely interesting possibility for next generation directional Dark Matter detectors at 1 bar.
