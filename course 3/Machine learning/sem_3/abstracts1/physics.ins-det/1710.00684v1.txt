This documents describes the technical design and the expected performance of the Barrel DIRC detector for the PANDA experiment. The Barrel DIRC will provide hadronic charged particle identification in the polar angle range of $22^\circ$ to $140^\circ$ for particle momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 3.5 GeV/c.   The design is based on the successful BaBar DIRC with several key improvements. The performance and system cost were optimized in detailed detector simulations and validated with full system prototypes using particle beams at GSI and CERN. The final design meets or exceeds the PID goal of clean $\pi/K$ separation with at least 3 standard deviations over the entire phase space of charged kaons in the Barrel DIRC.
