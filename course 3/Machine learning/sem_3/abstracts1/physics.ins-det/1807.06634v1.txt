Liquid scintillators doped with metals are needed for a variety of measurements in nuclear and particle physics. Nanoparticles provide a mechanism to dope the scintillator and their unique optical properties could be used to enhance detection capabilities. We present here the first study of lead-based perovskite nanoparticles for this application. Perovskites are an attractive choice due to the versatility of their crystal structure and their ease of synthesis.
