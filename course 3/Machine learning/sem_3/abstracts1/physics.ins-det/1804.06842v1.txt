The JENSA gas-jet target enables the direct measurement of previously inaccessible reactions with radioactive beams provided by the rare isotope re-accelerator ReA3 at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The gas jet will be the main target for the Separator for Capture Reactions SECAR at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams on the campus of Michigan State University. In this work, we describe the advantages of a gas-jet target, briefly review similar approaches, detail the current recirculating gas system, and report recent measurements of helium jet thicknesses of up to about $10^{19}$ atoms/cm$^2$.
