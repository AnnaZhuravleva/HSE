We propose an evolution of the Mu2e experiment, called Mu2e-II, that would leverage advances in detector technology and utilize the increased proton intensity provided by the Fermilab PIP-II upgrade to improve the sensitivity for neutrinoless muon-to-electron conversion by one order of magnitude beyond the Mu2e experiment, providing the deepest probe of charged lepton flavor violation in the foreseeable future. Mu2e-II will use as much of the Mu2e infrastructure as possible, providing, where required, improvements to the Mu2e apparatus to accommodate the increased beam intensity and cope with the accompanying increase in backgrounds.
