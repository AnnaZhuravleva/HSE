Progress in nuclear physics is driven by the experimental observation that requires state of the art detectors to measure various kinematic properties, such as energy, momentum, position etc. of the particles produced in a nuclear reaction. Advances in detector technology has enabled nuclear physicists to measure these quantities with better precision, and the reduced cost of the detection system has helped to have larger detection systems (array of detectors) to measure the rare processes with greater sensitivity. Several detection systems have been designed, developed and built in India over last few decades and are being used by the physicists. In this article, I will focus on such developments of detection systems at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), Kolkata.
