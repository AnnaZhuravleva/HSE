Resonant feedback circuits are proposed as an alternative to normal modes of conducting wall cavities or lumped circuits in searches for hidden sector particles. The proposed method offers several potential advantages over the most sensitive axion searches to date, that employ cavity resonators, including coverage of a wider range of axion masses, the ability to probe many axion masses simultaneously, and the elimination of experimentally troublesome mechanical tuning rod mechanisms. After an outline of the proposed method, we present a noise budget for a straw-man experiment configuration. We show that the proposed experiment has the potential to probe the axion mass range 2-40 micro-eV with 38 days of integration time. Other existing and proposed resonant searches for hidden sector particles may also benefit from this approach to detection.
