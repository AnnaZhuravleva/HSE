SABRE is a direct detection experiment aiming to measure the annual modulation of the dark matter interaction rate with \naitl crystals. A modulation compatible with the standard hypothesis in which our Galaxy is embedded in a dark matter halo has been measured by the DAMA experiment in the same target material. Experiments based on other direct detection techniques, with different target materials, seem to exclude the interpretation of such modulation in the simplest scenario of WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering. The SABRE experiment aims to carry out an independent search for a dark matter signal with NaI(Tl) crystals, with sufficient sensitivity to confirm or refute the DAMA claim. The SABRE concept and goal is to obtain an ultra-low background rate of the order of 0.1 cpd/keV$_{ee}$/kg in the energy region of interest. This challenging goal is achievable by developing high-purity crystals and operating them inside a liquid scintillator veto for active background rejection. In addition, twin detectors will be located in the northern and southern hemispheres to help identify any possible contribution to the modulation from seasonal or site-related effects. The SABRE project includes an initial PoP phase at LNGS (Italy), to assess the radio-purity of the crystals as well as the efficiency of the liquid scintillator veto. This paper describes the general concept of SABRE and the expected sensitivity to WIMP annual modulation. Assuming an exposure of 50 kg and 3 years, SABRE will be able to confirm (reject) the presence of a signal's modulation with the amplitude reported by DAMA at 5.5$\sigma$ (6.2$\sigma$) at 90% C.L, regardless of any model assumptions. In addition, we present the sensitivity curve to WIMP-nucleus scattering, under the same exposure conditions, and we show that SABRE is sensitive to cross sections as small as $2\cdot10^{-42}$ cm$^{2}$ for a WIMP mass of 40-50 GeV.
