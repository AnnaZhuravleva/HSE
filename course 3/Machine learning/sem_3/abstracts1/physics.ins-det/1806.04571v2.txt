The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a dual-site experiment for long baseline neutrino oscillation studies, and for neutrino astrophysics and nucleon decay searches. The far detector is a 40-kton underground liquid argon time-projection-chamber (LAr TPC), in which the photon detector system adds precise timing capabilities. The ProtoDUNE dual phase detector will consist of a 6x6x6 m^3 LAr TPC to be operated at the CERN Neutrino Platform and the photon detection system will be formed by 8-inch cryogenic photomultipliers from Hamamatsu. The validation measurements of the PMT model (R5912-20Mod) and the base design at cryogenic temperatures are described. Also, the characterisation results of the 40 photomultipliers to be used in ProtoDUNE dual phase are presented.
