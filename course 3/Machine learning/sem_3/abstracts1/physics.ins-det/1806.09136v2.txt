In 2017, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN has obtained an astonishing result providing proton-proton collisions with an integrated luminosity of 50.25 fb-1. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), a general-purpose detector operating at the LHC, has been able to record 45.39 fb-1. ECAL (Electromagnetic Calorimeter), has shown a good performance with a very stable DAQ (Data Acquisition) system even during higher LHC luminosity peaks. This has been partly because of the electronics auto-recovery system that has been developed to identify errors like SEU (Single Event Upset) and to resolve them. A new monitoring system has been developed called ecalView which is used for monitoring the errors from different electronics of the ECAL and to keep a log of these errors in a database for future reference.
