One of the potential problems of a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD)-based Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the Ion back Flow (IBF): ions generated through the avalanche amplification process flow back to the drift volume of the TPC and disarrange an electric field inside it. Consequently non-negligible degradation of azimuthal spatial resolution is caused due to this IBF. Meanwhile, it is necessary to collect primary ionized electrons to maintain intrinsic performance of the MPGDs. The MPGD based TPC is currently planned to be used as a central tracking detector of the International Large Detector (ILD), which is one of the detector concepts for the future International Linear Collider (ILC) project, and which requires fine azimuthal spatial resolution of less than 100 ${\rm \mu m}$ over the drift length of the TPC to attain high momentum resolution. Because of a unique beam structure of the ILC, the IBF is a critical issue for the realization of the ILD-TPC. Not only to suppress the ion back-flow to the drift volume, but also to allow the primary electrons pass through, a large aperture GEM-like gating device has been developed. Several bench tests for confirming the performance of the gating device have been conducted, besides that, beam test with the full detector module equipped with the gating device was carried out to verify the resolution that the full module can provide. As a result, it turned out that the developed gating device fulfills requirements for maintaining the performance of the MPGD based TPC, and it has sufficient performance for the central tracker of the ILD at the ILC.
