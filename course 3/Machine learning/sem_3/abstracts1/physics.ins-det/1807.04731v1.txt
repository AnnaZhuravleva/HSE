We introduce a novel approach to investigate CP violation in the neutrino sector, based on the simultaneous detection of $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ stemming from the oscillation of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ produced in the decay at rest of $\pi$s and $\mu$s at a beam dump. This approach relies on a novel liquid scintillator detector technology expected to yield unprecedented identification of $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ charged-current interactions, which we investigate by means of Montecarlo simulations. Here we report preliminary results concerning both the detection technique and its physics reach.
