In nuclear, particle and astroparticle physics experiments, calorimeters are used to measure the properties of particles with kinetic energies that range from a fraction of 1 eV to 10^20 eV or more. These properties are not necessarily limited to the energy carried by these particles, but may concern the entire four-vector, including the particle mass and type. In many modern experiments, large calorimeter systems play a central role, and this is expected to be no different for experiments that are currently being planned/designed for future accelerators. In this paper, the state of the art as well as new developments in calorimetry are reviewed. The latter are of course inspired by the perceived demands of future experiments, and/or the increasing demands of the current generation of experiments, as these are confronted with, for example, increased luminosity. These demands depend on the particles to be detected by the calorimeter. In electromagnetic calorimeters, radiation hardness of the detector components is a major concern. The generally poor performance of the current generation of hadron calorimeters is considered inadequate for future experiments, and a lot of the R&D in the past decade has focused on improving this performance. The root causes of the problems are investigated and different methods that have been exploited to remedy this situation are evaluated. The use of calorimetric methods to detect energy deposits at the Joule level in astrophysics experiments and at the (sub-)eV level in experiments searching for dark matter is briefly described in separate sections.
