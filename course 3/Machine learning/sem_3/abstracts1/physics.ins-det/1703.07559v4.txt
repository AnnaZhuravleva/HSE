Horizon-T, a modern Extensive Air Showers (EAS) detector system, is constructed at Tien Shan high-altitude Science Station of Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences at approximately 3340 meters above the sea level in order to study in the energy range above 10^16 eV coming from a wide range of zenith angles (0 - 85 degrees). The detector includes eight charged particle detection points and a Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation detector. Each charged particle detector response is calibrated using single MIP (minimally ionizing particle) signal. The details of this calibration are provided in this article. This note is valid for data before March 2017 and will not be updated following any detector calibration and configuration changes as a large upgrade has been implemented.
