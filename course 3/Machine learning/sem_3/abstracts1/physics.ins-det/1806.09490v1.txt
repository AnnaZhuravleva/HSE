The time-of-flight (TOF) system in the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is composed of super modules based on multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPC) for high-denseness, high-resolution time measurement. In order to evaluate the quality of detectors during the mass production, a distributed data readout system is developed to meet with the high data rate of 6.4Gbps, and a related data acquisition (DAQ) software is implemented under Linux operating system to test and verify the feasibility of the distributed data readout method. In this paper, the DAQ software is focused on data collection, event building, status monitoring and system controlling. Laboratory tests confirmed the function of the DAQ software and show that the overall data transfer rate of a single data transmission path can reach up to about 550Mbps which already meet the demand.
