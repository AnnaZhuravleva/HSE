In March of 2018, after the completion of the Physics Run 2, an upgrade has been installed at an innovative detector system Horizon-T, with the upgraded version now called Horizon-10T. It was constructed to study Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the energy range above 10^16 eV coming from a wide range of zenith angles (0 - 85 degrees). The system is located at Tien Shan high-altitude Science Station of Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences at approximately 3340 meters above the sea level. After this upgrade, the detector consists of ten charged particle detection points separated by the distance up to 1.3 kilometer as well as optical detector to view the Vavilov-Cherenkov light from the EAS. Each detector connects to the Data Acquisition system via cables. The calibration of the time delay for each cable including newly installed ones and the signal attenuation is provided in this article as well as the description of the newly installed detection points and their MIP response values.
