The LHCb detector will be upgraded during the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) of the LHC in order to cope with higher instantaneous luminosities and to read out the data at 40 MHz using a trigger-less readout system. The current LHCb main tracking system will be replaced by a single homogeneous detector based on scintillating fibres. This contribution gives an overview of the scintillating fibre tracker concept and presents the experience from the series production complemented by most recent test-beam and laboratory results.
