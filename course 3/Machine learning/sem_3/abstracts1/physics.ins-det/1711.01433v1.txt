We report on the characterization of two inverted coaxial Ge detectors in the context of being employed in future $^{76}$Ge neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. It is an advantage that such detectors can be produced with bigger Ge mass as compared to the planar Broad Energy Ge detectors (BEGe) that are currently used in the GERDA $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiment. This will result in lower background for the search of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay due to a reduction of cables, electronics and holders. The measured resolution near the $^{76}$Ge Q-value at 2039 keV is 2.5 keV and their pulse-shape characteristics are similar to BEGe-detectors. It is concluded that this type of Ge-detector is suitable for usage in $^{76}$Ge $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments.
