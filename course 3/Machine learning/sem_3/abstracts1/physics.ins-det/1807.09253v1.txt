The cloud and bubble chambers have been used historically for particle detection, capitalizing on supersaturation and superheating respectively. Here we present the snowball chamber, which utilizes supercooled liquid. In our prototype, an incoming particle triggers crystallization of purified water. We demonstrate water is supercooled for a significantly shorter time with respect to control data in the presence of AmBe and $^{252}$Cf neutron sources. A greater number of multiple nucleation sites are observed as well in neutron calibration data, as in a PICO-style bubble chamber. Similarly, gamma calibration data indicate a high degree of insensitivity to electron recoils inducing the phase transition, making this detector potentially ideal for dark matter searches seeking nuclear recoil alone, while muon veto coincidence with crystallization indicates that at least the hadronic component of cosmic-ray showers triggers nucleation. We explore the possibility of using this new technology for WIMP and low-mass dark matter searches, and conclude with a discussion of the interdisciplinary implications of radiation-induced freezing of water for chemistry, biology, and atmospheric sciences.
