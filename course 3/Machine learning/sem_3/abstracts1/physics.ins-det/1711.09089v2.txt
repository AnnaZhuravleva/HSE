The Spin Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment (SANE) performed inclusive, double-polarized electron scattering measurements of the proton at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab. A novel detector array observed scattered electrons of four-momentum transfer $2.5 < Q^2< 6.5$ GeV$^2$ and Bjorken scaling $0.3<x<0.8$ from initial beam energies of 4.7 and 5.9 GeV. Employing a polarized proton target whose magnetic field direction could be rotated with respect to the incident electron beam, both parallel and near perpendicular spin asymmetries were measured, allowing model-independent access to transverse polarization observables $A_1$, $A_2$, $g_1$, $g_2$ and moment $d_2$ of the proton. This document summarizes the operation and performance of the polarized target, polarized electron beam, and novel detector systems used during the course of the experiment, and describes analysis techniques utilized to access the physics observables of interest.
