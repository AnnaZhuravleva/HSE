The tagging system of the KEDR detector is a symmetrical focusing magnetic spectrometer for electrons and positrons scattered at small angles; it is embedded into the lattice of the VEPP-4M collider and intended for two-photon processes study. It measures scattered electron energy with resolution $\Delta E/E_0=0.03\%...0.6\%$ ($E_0$ is the beam energy). For precise energy scale calibration two methods are used: tagging of bremsstrahlung electron/positron by the photon energy measured by BGO calorimeter, and direct calibration using Compton backscattering spectrum edge. This report covers design and current status of the calibration system.
