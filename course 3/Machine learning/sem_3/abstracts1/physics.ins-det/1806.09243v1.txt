The purpose of Equatorial Port Plug 12 (EPP#12) for International thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) is to provide a common platform and interface, support or constrainer for five diagnostic plant systems and one glow discharging cleaning system (GDC). As EPP#12 integrator, a team from Institute of plasma physics Chinese of Sciences (CASIPP) performs the design work. The Instrument and Control(I&C) is an important part of system design. The main I&C functions will be implemented include temperature measurements of the port structures, electrical heater with temperature control during baking of windows and providing spare input measurement channel. The integrator should provide the embedded temperature sensors, associated cabling, electrical connectors and electrical feedthrough. Most electrical components will be deployed in port plug structure which is a harsh environment for electrical components. In this paper, we present the survey and research of electrical components for ITER EPP#12. And the design and implement of a test environment for electrical components which is based-on ITER CODAC is also described.
