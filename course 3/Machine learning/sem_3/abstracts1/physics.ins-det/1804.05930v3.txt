The M\"ossbauer technique is proposed as an alternative experimental procedure to be used in the detection of Coherent Elastic $\nu$-Nucleus Scattering (CENNS). The $Z_{0}$-boson exchange is considered as a perturbation on the nuclear mean-field potential with a change in the valence neutron quantum states in the $^{57}Fe$ nucleus of the M\"ossbauer detector sample. This nuclei is a typical isotope used in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Perturbed level of the valence neutron accommodates the transferred energy, modifying the location of the isometric peak of the M\"ossbauer electromagnetic resonance. We calculate the isometric shift correction due CENNS and show that this quantity is able to be detected with enough precision. Therefore, the difference between the M\"ossbauer isometric shift in the presence of a reactor-neutrino beam and without the neutrinos flux is pointed out as a figure of merit to manifest CENNS. In this work, we show that the CENNS correction of the Isomeric Shift is of $\approx 10^{-7}$eV, which is greater than the $10^{-10}$eV resolution of the technique.
