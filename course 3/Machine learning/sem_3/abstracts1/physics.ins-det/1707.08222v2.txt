The R&D mission of the Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) is described in detail. ANNIE is: (1) an important measurement of neutrino-nucleus interactions focusing specifically on neutron production, and (2) an R&D effort focused on using new photodetector technology and chemical additives to make advanced water-base neutrino detectors. The ANNIE experiment consists of a small Water Cherenkov detector, instrumented with both conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) deployed on the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) at Fermilab. The experiment is designed to proceed in two stages: a partially-instrumented test-beam run using only PMTs (Phase I) for the purpose of measuring critical neutron backgrounds to the experiment; and a physics run with a fully-instrumented detector (Phase II). This paper gives preliminary results of the first phase and described the detector design upgrades necessary for the next phase.
