The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) , composed of two small satellites, is a new mission to monitor the Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) coincident with gravitational wave events with a FOV of 100% all-sky. GECAM detects and localizes 6 keV-5 MeV GRBs via 25 compact and novel Gamma-Ray Detectors (GRDs). Each GRD module is comprised of a LaBr3:Ce scintillator, SiPM array and preamplifier. A large dynamic range is achieved by the high gain and low gain channels of the preamplifier. This article discusses the performance of a GRD prototype which includes a set of radioactive sources in the range of 5.9-1332.5 keV. The energy resolution and energy to ADC channel conversion of the GRD module are also discussed. The typical energy resolution is 5.3% at 662 keV (FWHM) which meets the relevant requirements (< 8% at 662 keV). The energy calibration capability is evaluated by the measured intrinsic activity of LaBr3:Ce and Geant4 simulation results. The test results demonstrate the feasibility of the GECAM GRD design.
