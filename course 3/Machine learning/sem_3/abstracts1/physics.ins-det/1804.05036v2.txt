This article documents the characteristics of the high voltage (HV) system of the hadronic calorimeter TileCal of the ATLAS experiment. Such a system is suitable to supply reliable power distribution into particles physics detectors using a large number of PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMTs). Measurements performed during the 2015 and 2016 data taking periods of the ATLAS detector show that its performance, in terms of stability and noise, fits the specifications. In particular, almost all the PMTs show a voltage instability smaller than 0.5 V corresponding to a gain stability better than 0.5%. A small amount of channels was found not working correctly. To diagnose the origin of such defects, the results of the HV measurements were compared to those obtained using a Laser system. The analysis shows that less than 0.2% of the about 10 thousand HV channels were malfunctioning.
