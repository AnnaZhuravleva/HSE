The radioactive noble gas $^{222}$Rn, which can be dissolved in water, is an important background source for JUNO. In this paper, based on the water system of JUNO prototype, two kinds of high sensitivity radon detectors have been proposed and developed. The sensitivity of Si-PIN Rn detector, which uses a Si-PIN photodiode to detect the $\alpha$ from $^{214}$Po decay, is $\sim$9.0~mBq/m$^3$. The sensitivity of LS Rn detector, which uses liquid scintillator to detect the coincident signals of $\beta$ from $^{214}$Bi decay and $\alpha$ from $^{214}$Po decay, is $\sim$64.0~mBq/m$^3$. Both of the two kinds of Rn detector have the potential to be developed as an online Rn concentration monitoring equipment for JUNO veto detector.
