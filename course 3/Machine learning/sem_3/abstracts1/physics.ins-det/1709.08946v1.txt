The recently approved India-based Neutrino Observatory will use the world's largest magnet to study atmospheric muon neutrinos. The 50 kiloton Iron Calorimeter consists of iron alternating with single-gap resistive plate chambers. A uniform magnetic field of $\sim$1.5 T is produced in the iron using toroidal-shaped copper coils. Muon neutrinos interact with the iron target to produce charged muons, which are detected by the resistive plate chambers, and tracked using orthogonal pick up strips. Timing information for each layer is used to discriminate between upward and downward traveling muons. The design of the readout electronics for the detector depends critically on an accurate model of the charge induced by the muons, and the dependence on bias voltages. In this paper, we present timing and charge response measurements using prototype detectors under different operating conditions. We also report the effect of varying gas mixture, particularly $SF_6$, on the timing response.
