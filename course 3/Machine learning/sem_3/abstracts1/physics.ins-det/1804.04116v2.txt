High pressure gas time projection chambers (HPGTPCs) are made with a variety of materials, many of which have not been well characterized in high pressure noble gas environments. As HPGTPCs are scaled up in size toward ton-scale detectors, assemblies become larger and more complex, creating a need for detailed understanding of how structural supports and high voltage insulators behave. This includes the identification of materials with predictable mechanical properties and without surface charge accumulation that may lead to field deformation or sparking. This paper explores the mechanical and electrical effects of high pressure gas environments on insulating polymers PTFE, HDPE, PEEK, POM and UHMW in Argon and Xenon, including studying absorption, swelling and high voltage insulation strength.
