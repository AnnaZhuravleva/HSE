Since the first version of the Mu2e TDR released at the beginning of 2015, the Mu2e Calorimeter system has undergone a long list of changes to arrive to its final design. These changes were primarily caused by two reasons: (i) the technology choice between the TDR proposed solution of BaF2 crystals readout with solar blind Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs) and the backup option of CsI crystals readout with Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) has been completed and (ii) the channels numbering, the mechanical system and the readout electronics were substantially modified while proceeding with engineering towards the final project. This document updates the description of the calorimeter system adding the most recent engineering drawings and tecnical progresses.
