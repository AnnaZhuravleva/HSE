The HeRSCheL detector consists of a set of scintillating counters, designed to increase the coverage of the LHCb experiment in the high-rapidity regions on either side of the main spectrometer. The new detector improves the capabilities of LHCb for studies of diffractive interactions, most notably Central Exclusive Production. In this paper the construction, installation, commissioning, and performance of HeRSCheL are presented.
