The LHCb Experiment is preparing a detector upgrade fully exploit the flavour physics potential of the LHC. The whole detector will be read out at the full collision rate and the online event selection will be performed by a software trigger. This will increase the event yields by a facto 10 for muonic and a factor 20 for hadronic final states. Research towards the upgrade has started with the target to install the detector in 2018.
