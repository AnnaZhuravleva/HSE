The new hemispherical photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with 9 inch diameter from Hainan Zhanchuang Photonics Technology Co.,Ltd (HZC) have been studied. Narrow transit time spread (FWHM=2.35 ns) accompanied by small nonlinearity (750 photoelectrons at 5%) and high gain (1E7 ) with good single photoelectron (PE) resolution have been observed. 11 PMTs of this type are deployed and studied in the prototype detector for JUNO at IHEP, China.
