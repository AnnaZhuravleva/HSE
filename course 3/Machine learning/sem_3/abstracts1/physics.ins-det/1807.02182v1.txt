The VIP2 experiment tests the Pauli Exclusion Principle with high sensitivity, by searching for Pauli-forbidden atomic transitions from the 2p to the 1s shell in copper at about 8keV. The transition energy of Pauli-forbidden K X-rays is shifted by about 300 eV with respect to the normal allowed K line. This energy difference can be resolved using Silicon Drift Detectors. The data for this experiment is taken in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS), which provides shielding from cosmic radiation. An overview of the detection system of the VIP2 experiment will be given. This includes the Silicon Drift Detectors used as X-ray detectors which provide an energy resolution of around 150 eV at 6 keV and timing information for active shielding. Furthermore, the low maintenance requirement makes them excellent X-ray detectors for the use in an underground laboratory. The VIP2 setup will be discussed which consists of a high current target system and a passive as well as an active shielding system using plastic scintillators read out by Silicon Photomultipliers.
