A new management system for the SND detector experiments (at VEPP-2000 collider in Novosibirsk) is developed. We describe here the interaction between a user and the SND databases. These databases contain experiment configuration, conditions and metadata. The new system is designed in client-server architecture. It has several logical layers corresponding to the users roles. A new template engine is created. A web application is implemented using Node.js framework. At the time the application provides: showing and editing configuration; showing experiment metadata and experiment conditions data index; showing SND log (prototype).
