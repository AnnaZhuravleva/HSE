We describe a work of a multi-cathode counter of the developed design in a single electron counting mode with a cathode made of aluminum alloy. The results of the calibration of the counter are presented. The coefficient of gas amplification was found from the calibration spectra. The electric fields and operation of this detector in two configurations are described and the original idea to find the effect from electrons emitted from the surface of a cathode by difference of the rates measured in two volume configurations is expounded. Furthermore, the advantage of using a multi-cathode counter for measurement of the intensity of single electron emission from a metal is explained.
