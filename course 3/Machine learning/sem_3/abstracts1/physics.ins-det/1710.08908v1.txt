The PandaX-III (Particle And Astrophysical Xenon Experiment III) experiment will search for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (NLDBD) of 136Xe at the China Jin-Ping underground Laboratory II (CJPL-II). In the first phase of the experiment, a high pressure gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC) will contain 200 kg, 90% 136Xe enriched gas operated at 10 bar. Microbulk Micromegas, a fine pitch micro-pattern gas detector, will be used for charge readout and enable us to reconstruct tracks of NLDBD events with good energy and spatial resolution. With simulation, we demonstrate excellent background suppression capability with tracking information. In this proceeding, we will give an overview of recent progress of PandaX-III, including data taking of a 20 kg scale prototype TPC.
