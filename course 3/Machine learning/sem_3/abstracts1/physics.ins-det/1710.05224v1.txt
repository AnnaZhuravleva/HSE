The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is an extended astroparticle observatory with the goal of studying Gamma Ray Bursts (among other extreme universe phenomena), space weather and atmospheric radiation at ground level. It consists of a network of several Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCD) located at different sites and different latitudes along the American Continent (from Mexico up to the Antarctic region). Another interest of LAGO is to encourage and support the development of experimental basic research in Latin America, mainly with low cost equipment. In the case of Chiapas, Mexico, the experimental astroparticle physics activity was limited, up to now, to data analysis from other detectors located far away from the region. Thanks to the collaboration within LAGO, the deployment of one WCD is ongoing at the Universidad Aut\'onoma de Chiapas (UNACH). This will allow, for the first time in the region, to train students and researchers in the deployment processes. Till now the setup of the signal-processing electronics has been performed and the characterization of the photomultiplier tube is currently being done. The main, short-term goal is to install one WCD on top of the Tacan\'a volcano in Chiapas in a short term. The status of the work is presented.
