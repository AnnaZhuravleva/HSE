The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), a 20ktons multi-purpose underground liquid scintillator detector, was proposed with the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy as a primary physics goal. Due to low background requirement of the experiment, a multi-veto system ,which consists of a water Cherenkov detector and a top tracker detector, is required. In order to keep the water quality good and remove the radon in the water, a ultra-pure water system, a radon removal system and radon concentration measurement system have been designed. In this paper, the radon removal equipments and its radon removal limit will be presented.
