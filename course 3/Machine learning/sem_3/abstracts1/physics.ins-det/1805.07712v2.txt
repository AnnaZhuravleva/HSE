A muon beam monitor is an indispensable component for accelerator-based long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments to monitor and control the neutrino beam. Though Si photodiodes and ionization chambers have been successfully used as muon monitors at the T2K experiment, more radiation tolerant sensors are desired for the future operation. Electron-multiplier tubes (EMTs) are one candidate. Secondary electrons produced by the passage of muons at dynodes are multiplied in the tube and produce signal. Two prototype detectors were installed at the T2K muon monitor location, and several EMT properties were studied based on data with the T2K muon beam. The signal size is as expected based on calculation. The EMTs show sufficiently fast time response for bunch-by-bunch beam monitoring. The spill-by-spill intensity resolution is 0.4% and better than the required value (1%). Signal linearity within $\pm$1% is achieved up to 500 kW with +250 kA horn operation. A gradual signal decrease is observed during the initial exposure due to stabilization of dynode materials before the response becomes stable within $\pm$1%. This work demonstrates that EMTs may be useful for future muon monitoring.
