The inorganic crystals have been widely used for dark matter direct searching for many decades. However, limited by the crystal growth technique, a lot of small crystals have to be used together for large target mass, which results in a degradation of light collection efficiency. An experiment was built up to study the degradation, and the method of soaking crystals into mineral oil to improve the efficiency as well as reduce the interface effect were proposed and validated. Good data and MC agreements were achieved in the experiment.
