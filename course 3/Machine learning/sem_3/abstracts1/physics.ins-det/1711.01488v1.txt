COSINE-100, a direct detection WIMP dark matter search, is using 106 kg of NaI(Tl) crystals to definitively test the DAMA collaboration's claim of WIMP discovery. In the context of most standard models of WIMP dark matter, the DAMA result is in conflict with other direct detection experiments. To resolve this tension, COSINE-100 seeks to independently test the DAMA observation using a detector of the same target material as DAMA, thus definitively confirming or refuting their claim of WIMP discovery. Here, we present the current status and projected sensitivity of COSINE-100, along with the projected sensitivity of COSINE-200, a possible next phase of the experiment.
