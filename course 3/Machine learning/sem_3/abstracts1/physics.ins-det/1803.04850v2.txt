High-performance event reconstruction is critical for current and future massive liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) to realize their full scientific potential. LArTPCs with readout using wire planes provide a limited number of 2D projections. In general, without a pixel-type readout it is challenging to achieve unambiguous 3D event reconstruction. As a remedy, we present a novel 3D imaging method, Wire-Cell, which incorporates the charge and sparsity information in addition to the time and geometry through simple and robust mathematics. The resulting 3D image of ionization density provides an excellent starting point for further reconstruction and enables the true power of 3D tracking calorimetry in LArTPCs.
