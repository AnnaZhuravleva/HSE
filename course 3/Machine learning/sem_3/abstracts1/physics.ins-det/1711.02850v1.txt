The spin program at NICA using SPD and MPD requires high intensity polarized proton beam with high value of the beam polarization. First results on the measurements of the proton beam polarization performed at internal target at Nuclotron are reported. The polarization of the proton beam provided by new source of polarized ions has been measured at 500 MeV using quasielastic proton-proton scattering and DSS setup at internal target. The obtained value of the vertical polarization of ~35 % is consistent with the calculations taking into account the current magnetic optics of the Nuclotron injection line.
