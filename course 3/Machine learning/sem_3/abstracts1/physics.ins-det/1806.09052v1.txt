A completely New Small Wheel (NSW) will be constructed for ATLAS Phase-1 upgrade. Small-Strip Thin-Gap-Chamber (sTGC) will devote to the trigger function of NSW. A full-size sTGC quadruplet consists of 4 layers, and will need 4 pad Front-End-Boards and 4 strip Front-End-Boards for sTGC signals readout. The 8 boards should be readout simultaneously at a time. This paper presents the study of multi-layer sTGC test system, a FEB Driver Card (FEBDC) is designed for pFEB and sFEB boards handling. The design and test of FEBDC are described in details.
