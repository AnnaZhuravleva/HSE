In next ten years, the Large Hadron Collider will be upgraded to the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), resulting in ten time more integrated luminosity. To withstand the much harsher radiation and occupancy conditions of the HL-LHC, the inner tracker of the ATLAS detector must be redesigned and rebuilt completely. The design of the ATLAS Upgrade inner tracker (ITk) has already been defined. It consists of several layers of silicon particle detectors. The innermost layers will be composed of silicon pixel sensors, and the outer layers will consist of silicon microstrip sensors. This paper will focus on the latest research and development activities performed by ITk strips community with respect to the assembly and test of the strip modules and the stave and petal structures.
