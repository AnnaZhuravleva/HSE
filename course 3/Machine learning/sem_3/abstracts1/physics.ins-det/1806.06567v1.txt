Radon background is one of the most critical influences on the ultra-low background and rare-event physical experiments in underground laboratories. To conduct a comprehensive investigation of the radon concentrations in China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL), long-term cumulative measurements were carried out using time-integrated passive radon dosimeters containing CR-39 solid-state nuclear track detectors at four sites of CJPL-I. The measurements lasted from May 30,2015 to March 16,2016, a total of 290 days, and the total effective measurement time is 6,953 hours. In the main experiment hall equipped with the ventilation system, the average annual radon concentrations were (55+/-7) Bq m^-3, (58+/-10) Bq^m-3and (53+/-9) Bq m^-3 in three locations respectively. In the storage tunnel without any radon reduction facility, the average annual radon concentrations increased to (345+/-15) Bq m^-3, reflecting the original average annual radon concentration levels in the underground laboratory. Compared with the measured results in the period from 2010 to 2011, the average radon concentration in the main experimental hall was reduced from (86+/-25) Bq m^-3 to (58+/-10) Bq m^-3 due to the well-running ventilation system. Compared with other international underground laboratories, radon concentrations in CJPL-I were at an intermediate level and can meet the demand for low background and rare-event physical experiments.
