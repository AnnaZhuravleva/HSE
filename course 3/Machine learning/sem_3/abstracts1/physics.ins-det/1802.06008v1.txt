The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is a concept for a future linear collider that would provide e$^+$e$^-$ collisions at up to 3 TeV. The physics aims require a detector system with excellent jet energy and track momentum resolution, highly efficient flavour tagging and lepton identification capabilities, full geometrical coverage extending to low polar angles, and timing information of the order of nanoseconds to reject beam-induced background. To deal with these requirements, an extensive R&D programme is in place to overcome current technological limits. The CLIC detector concept includes a low-mass all-silicon vertex and tracking detector system and fine-grained calorimeters designed for particle flow analysis techniques, surrounded by a 4 T solenoid magnet. An overview of the requirements and design optimisations for the CLIC detector concept is presented.
