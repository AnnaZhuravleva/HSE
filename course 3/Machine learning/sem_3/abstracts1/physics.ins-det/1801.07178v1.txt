The concept of a hybrid readout of a time projection chamber is presented. It combines a GEM-based amplification and a pad-based anode plane with a pixel chip as readout electronics. This way, a high granularity enabling to identify electron clusters from the primary ionisation is achieved as well as flexibility and large anode coverage. The benefits of this high granularity, in particular for dE/dx measurements, are outlined and results of a simulation-based performance study are given. The structure of the first prototype board is discussed, including adaptions based on a very preliminary first measurement for a second production towards a proof-of-principle.
