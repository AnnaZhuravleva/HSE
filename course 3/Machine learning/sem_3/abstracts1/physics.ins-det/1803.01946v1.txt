SIMNRA is widely adopted by the scientific community of ion beam analysis for interpretation of nuclear scattering analysis. Taking advantage of its recognized reliability and quality of the simulations, we developed a computer program that use parallel sessions of SIMNRA to perform self-consistent analysis for energy spectra of a given sample obtained using different techniques or experimental setups. In this paper, we present a result using MultiSIMNRA on self-consistent analysis for a multielemental thin film produced by magnetron sputtering. The results demonstrate the potentialities of the self-consistent analysis and its feasibility when using MultiSIMNRA.
