Neutrino Activation Analysis rather than Neutron Activation Analysis? Yes, after the first observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). Pulsed muon neutrinos are produced by the decay-at-rest of charged pions ($\pi$DAR) resulting from the impact of high-energy protons on a target. We investigate the possibility of measuring CEvNS with $\pi$DAR beamlines and determine the corresponding requirements for the neutrino detectors. Form factors from nuclear physics cannot be avoided in CEvNS and vary among different isotopes. In principle, we can use this channel to conduct a Neutrino Activation Analysis (NiAA) and improve our understanding of nuclear structure in the low-energy range. With ton-scale liquid noble gas detectors, we will not only achieve percent level precision in the measurement of neutron radii but also clarify the contributions of higher-order moments to neutron form factors.
