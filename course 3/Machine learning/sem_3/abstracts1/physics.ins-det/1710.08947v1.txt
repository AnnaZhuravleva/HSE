After a highly successful first data taking period at the LHC, the LHCb experiment developed a new trigger strategy with a real-time reconstruction, alignment and calibration for Run II. This strategy relies on offline-like track reconstruction in the high level trigger, making a separate offline event reconstruction unnecessary. To enable such reconstruction, and additionally keeping up with a higher event rate due to the accelerator upgrade, the time used by the track reconstruction had to be decreased. Timing improvements have in parts been achieved by utilizing parallel computing techniques that will be described in this document by considering two example applications. Despite decreasing computing time, the reconstruction quality in terms of reconstruction efficiency and fake rate could be improved at several places. Two applications of fast machine learning techniques are highlighted, refining track candidate selection at the early stages of the reconstruction.
