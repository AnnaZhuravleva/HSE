The T2K neutrino oscillation experiment established the $\nu_\mu \rightarrow \nu_e$ appearance with only $10\%$ of the original beam request of $7.8\times10^{21}$ $30$ GeV protons on target (POT). In view of the J-PARC program of upgrades of the beam intensity, the T2K-II proposal for $20\times10^{21}$ POT aimed at establishing CP violation at $3\sigma$ level for a significant fraction of the possible $\delta_{CP}$ values. The Hyper-K proposal consists of a further increase by a factor $10$ of the far detector mass. Facing the potential increase of statistics by two orders of magnitude, it is of great importance to undertake a vigorous program of near detector upgrade, with the aim of reducing the overall statistical and systematic uncertainties at the appropriate level of better than $4\%$. The design and performance of the proposed upgraded near-detector will be reported in these proceedings.
