In this work, the simulation of optical photons is carried out in an antineutrino detector module consisting of a plastic scintillator connected to light guides and photomultipliers on both ends, which is considered to be used for remote reactor monitoring in the field of nuclear safety. Using Monte Carlo (MC) based GEANT4 simulation, numerous parameters influencing the light collection and thereby the energy resolution of the antineutrino detector module are studied: e.g., degrees of scintillator surface roughness, reflector type, and its ap- plying method onto scintillator and light guide surface, the reflectivity of the reflector, light guide geometries and diameter of the photocathode. The impact of each parameter is inves- tigated by looking at the detected spectrum, i.e. the number photoelectrons per depositing energy. In addition, the average light collection efficiency of the detector module and its spatial variation are calculated for each simulation setup. According to the simulation re- sults, it is found that photocathode size, light guide shape, reflectivity of reflecting material and wrapping method show a significant impact on the light collection efficiency while scin- tillator surface polishing level and the choose of reflector type show relatively less impact. This study demonstrates that these parameters are very important in the design of plastic scintillator included antineutrino detectors to improve the energy resolution efficiency.
