We introduce a new concomitant referencing mode for operating a multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrograph (MRTOF-MS), wherein the reference and analyte ions are interleaved on a cycle by cycle bases. Using this mode, we demonstrate an improved technique for performing wide bandwidth mass measurements via MRTOF-MS. This new technique offers a simplified analysis and high-accuracy.
