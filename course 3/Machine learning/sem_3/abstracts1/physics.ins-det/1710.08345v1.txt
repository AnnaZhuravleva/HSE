Hyper-Kamiokande is a proposed next-generation general purpose neutrino detection experiment. It comprises an underground water Cherenkov detector that will be more than 8 times as large as the highly successful Super-Kamiokande and use significantly improved photodetectors with the same 40 % photocoverage. The resulting sensitivity improvements will particularly benefit astroparticle physics at low energies. This contribution to the EPS-HEP 2017 proceedings gives an overview over Hyper-Kamiokande and presents its projected physics reach in the areas of supernova neutrinos, solar neutrinos and indirect dark matter searches, based on the current design report. It also discusses additional sensitivity improvements if the second detector is built in Korea in a location with a higher overburden.
