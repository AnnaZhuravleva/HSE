The Belle II experiment has been preparing for its first e+ e- collisions, scheduled in April 2018. With a target luminosity 40 times greater than the Belle experiment, the goal of Belle II is to open the door to a panorama of measurements in heavy flavour physics and much more. The initial beams and the commissioning of the SuperKEKB collider took place earlier in 2016. After completing most of the detector assembly and performing test runs with cosmic rays, the experiment is ready for initial collisions. Soon after in early 2019, data collection with the full Belle II detector will commence and the largest B-factory data sample will be collected.
