Given their small mobility coefficient in liquid argon with respect to the electrons, the ions spend a considerably longer time in the active volume. We studied the effects of the positive ion current in a liquid argon time projection chamber, in the context of massive argon experiments for neutrino physics. The constant recombination between free ions and electrons produces a quenching of the charge signal and a constant emission of photons, uncorrelated in time and space to the physical interactions. The predictions evidence some potential concerns for multi-ton argon detectors, particularly when operated on surface
