Bolometers are low temperature particle detectors with high energy resolution and detection efficiency. Some types of bolometric detectors are also able to perform an efficient particle identification. A wide variety of radiopure dielectric and diamagnetic materials makes the bolometric technique favorable for applications in astroparticle physics. In particular, thanks to their superior performance, bolometers play an important role in the world-wide efforts on searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Such experiments strongly require an extremely low level of the backgrounds that can easily mimic the process searched for. Here we overview recent progress in the development of low background techniques for bolometric double-beta decay searches.
