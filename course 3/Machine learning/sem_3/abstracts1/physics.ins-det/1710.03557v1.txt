To cope with the harsh environment foreseen at the high luminosity conditions of HL- LHC, the ATLAS pixel detector has to be upgraded to be fully efficient with a good granularity, a maximized geometrical acceptance and an high read out rate. LPNHE, FBK and INFN are involved in the development of thin and edgeless planar pixel sensors in which the insensitive area at the border of the sensor is minimized thanks to the active edge technology. In this paper we report on two productions, a first one consisting of 200 {\mu}m thick n-on-p sensors with active edge, a second one composed of 100 and 130 {\mu}m thick n-on-p sensors. Those sensors have been tested on beam, both at CERN-SPS and at DESY and their performance before and after irradiation will be presented.
