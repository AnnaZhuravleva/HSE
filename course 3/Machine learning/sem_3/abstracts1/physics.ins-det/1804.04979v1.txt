The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) provides a rich science program with a focus on neutrino oscillations and other beyond the standard model physics. The high-intensity, wide-band neutrino beam will be produced at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) and will be directed to the 40~kt liquid argon far detector at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, 1300~km from FNAL. The primary goals of the experiment are to determine the ordering of neutrino masses and to measure the CP violating phase, $\delta_{\textrm{CP}}$. The underground location of the large DUNE far detector and its excellent energy and spatial resolution will allow also for non-accelerator physics programs predicted by grand unified theories, such as nucleon decay or $n$---$\bar{n}$ oscillations. Moreover, DUNE will be sensitive to the electron neutrino flux from a core-collapse supernova, providing valuable information on the phenomenon's underlying mechanisms. This ambitious project requires extensive prototyping and a testing program to guarantee that all parts of the technology are fully understood and well tested. Two such prototypes, in both single phase (ProtoDUNE-SP) and dual phase (ProtoDUNE-DP) technologies, are under construction and will be operated at the CERN Neutrino Platform (NP) starting in 2018.
