In particle physics experiments, the quality of calorimetric particle detection is typically considerably worse for hadrons than for electromagnetic showers. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of this problem and evaluate two different methods that have been exploited to remedy this situation: compensation and dual readout. It turns out that the latter approach is more promising, as evidenced by experimental results.
