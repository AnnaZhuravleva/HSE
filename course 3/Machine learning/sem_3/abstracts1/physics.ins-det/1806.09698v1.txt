The JUNO observatory is a medium baseline experiment in construction in China. A large liquid scintillator volume detects the antineutrinos issued from nuclear reactors. The liquid scintillator detector is instrumented with 17000 large photomultiplier tubes. Two veto systems are added to reduce the backgrounds. The front-end electronics system performs analog signal processing (the underwater electronics) and after about 100 m cables, the back-end electronics system, outside water, consists of the DAQ and the trigger. One of the main challenges of the whole electronics system is the fast data link (250 Mb/s) combined with the power delivery over 100 m Ethernet cables. Three different options are considered to connect the front-end and the back-end systems, depending on the DAQ data volume and the way to deliver the power to the underwater system. In order to test the three options in an efficient and fast way, a common baseboard with interfaces to different mezzanine boards is designed.
