Basic R & D have been carried out with one small straw tube detector prototype with premixed gas of Ar+CO2 in 70:30 and 90:10 ratio. The gain and the energy resolution are measured with Fe55 X-ray source. Effect of temperature and pressure on these parameters are measured. The variation of gain and energy resolution with rate per unit length are also measured. The details of the test set-up, the method of measurement and the test results are presented in this paper.
