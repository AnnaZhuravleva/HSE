The Silicon Detector (SiD) is one of the detector concepts for the International Linear Collider (ILC), which is proposed to be built in Japan. Since the decision to reduce the center-of-mass energy for the first stage of the ILC to 250 GeV, numerous efforts are ongoing to evaluate the possible physics program and the change in the detector background. It was found that changing the beam parameters would increase the luminosity and therefore further strengthen the physics outcome. On the downside, the new beam parameters lead to an increase in the detector background arising from beam-beam interactions. The simulation study, which is the topic of this note, focuses on the impact the increased background levels have on the SiD vertex detector performance. The results suggest that the vertex detector occupancies can be accommodated in the design of the SiD detector without any loss in performance.
