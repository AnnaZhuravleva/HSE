A two-phase argon detector is generally suitable for the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter owing to its high rejection power against electron recoil background events. However, ionization/scintillation ratio (S2/S1) has not been effectively used for argon in current experiments because its basic properties and discrimination power are not well known, as compared with xenon. The scope of this study is the evaluation of S2/S1 properties with a two-phase detector at drift-fields from 0.2 kV/cm to 3.0 kV/cm. Finally, the discrimination power between electron recoils and nuclear recoils based on S2/S1 is discussed.
