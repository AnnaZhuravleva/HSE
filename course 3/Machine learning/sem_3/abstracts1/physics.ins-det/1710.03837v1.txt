The ANAIS experiment aims at the confirmation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). Several 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) modules produced by Alpha Spectra Inc. have been operated there during the last years in various set-ups; an outstanding light collection at the level of 15 photoelectrons per keV, which allows triggering at 1 keV of visible energy, has been measured for all of them and a complete characterization of their background has been achieved. In the first months of 2017, the full ANAIS-112 set-up consisting of nine Alpha Spectra detectors with a total mass of 112.5 kg was commissioned at LSC and the first dark matter run started in August, 2017. Here, the latest results on the detectors performance and measured background from the commissioning run will be presented and the sensitivity prospects of the ANAIS-112 experiment will be discussed.
