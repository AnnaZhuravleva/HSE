Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the simulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light. Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs' timing information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated trajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position at the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the vertical by about 3 degrees.
