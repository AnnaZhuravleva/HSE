The current event display system in the offline software of Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory Experiment(JUNO) is based on the ROOT EVE package. We use Unity, a renowned game engine, to improve its performance and make it available on different platforms. Compared to ROOT, Unity provides a more vivid demonstration for high energy physics experiments and can be ported to different platforms easily. We build a tool for event display in JUNO with Unity. It provides us an intuitive way to observe the detector model, the particle trajectories and the hit distributions.
