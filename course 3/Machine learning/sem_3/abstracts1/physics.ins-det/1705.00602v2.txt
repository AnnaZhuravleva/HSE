The VSiPMT (Vacuum Silicon PhotoMultiplier Tube) is an original design for an innovative light detector we proposed with the aim to create new scientific instrumentation for industrial applications and physics research. The idea behind this device is to replace the classical dynode chain of a photomultiplier tube with a silicon photomultiplier, the latter acting as an electron detector and amplifier. The VSiPMT offers very attractive features and unprecedented performance, definitely superior to every other photodetector with comparable sensitive surface, such as: negligible power cosumption, excellent photon counting, easy low-voltage-based stabilization and very good time performance. After the feasibility test of the idea, Hamamatsu Photonics realized for our research group two VSiPMT industrial prototypes, that have been fully characterized. The results of the full characterization of the 1-inch industrial prototype are presented in this work.
