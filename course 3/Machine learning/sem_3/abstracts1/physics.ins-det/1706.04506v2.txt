To ensure compliance with the experimental requirement for ultra-low background, in this study the radioactivity of stainless steels manufactured by smelting is thoroughly investigated. Raw materials, stage samples, and commercial samples are investigated by glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) and/or with high-purity germanium detectors (HPGe) at both the ground level and/or the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. Custom-made stainless steel samples are found to have radioactivity levels comparable to those in other low-background experiments. The comprehensive results regarding the radioactivity level in materials to be used in the proposed Jinping Neutrino Experiment are reported.
