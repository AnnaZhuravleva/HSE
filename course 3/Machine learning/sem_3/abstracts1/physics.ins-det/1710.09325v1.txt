This document describes requirements for the caverns to house the cyclotron, beam transport line, and target systems; issues associated with transport and assembly of components on the site; electrical power, cooling and ventilation; as well as issues associated with radiation protection of the environment and staff of KamLAND who will be interfacing with IsoDAR during its operational phases. Specifics of IsoDAR operations at the KamLAND site are not addressed.   Recent developments in planning for deployment of IsoDAR include the identification of a potential new site for the experiment, where the target can be placed directly on the equatorial plane of the KamLAND detector, and also, an upgrade of the detector resolution to 3\%/$\sqrt{E(MeV)}$. The option of the new site might allow, depending on the results of shielding and background evaluations in KamLAND, for an increase in event rate by about a factor of 1.6 owing to increased solid angle for the detector, improving the physics reach for a same period of the experiment. Alternatively, it raises the option of reducing technical risk and cost by reducing beam intensity to maintain the originally planned event rates. This new siting option is described, and aspects the physics reach of the sterile neutrino search are updated to reflect this second option, as well as the higher resolution of the experiment. A full update of the physics capability given the new site and resolution is beyond the scope of this CDR and will be published later.
