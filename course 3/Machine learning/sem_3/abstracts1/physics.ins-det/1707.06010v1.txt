We propose a search of galactic axions with mass about 0.2 microeV using a large volume resonant cavity, about 50 m^3, cooled down to 4 K and immersed in a moderate axial magnetic field of about 0.6 T generated inside the superconducting magnet of the KLOE experiment located at the National Laboratory of Frascati of INFN. This experiment, called KLASH (KLoe magnet for Axion SearcH) in the following, has a potential sensitivity on the axion-to-photon coupling, g_agg, of about 6x10^-17 GeV-1, reaching the region predicted by KSVZ and DFSZ models of QCD axions.
