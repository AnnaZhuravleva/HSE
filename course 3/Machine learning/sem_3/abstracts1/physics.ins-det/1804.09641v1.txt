We apply deep neural networks (DNN) to data from the EXO-200 experiment. In the studied cases, the DNN is able to reconstruct the relevant parameters - total energy and position - directly from raw digitized waveforms, with minimal exceptions. The accuracy of reconstruction, as evaluated on calibration data, either reaches or exceeds what was achieved by the conventional approaches developed by EXO-200 over the course of the experiment. An accurate Monte Carlo simulation is usually a prerequisite for a successful reconstruction with DNNs. We describe how in an experiment such as EXO-200 certain reconstruction and analysis tasks could be successfully performed by training the network on waveforms from experimental data, either reducing or eliminating the reliance on the Monte Carlo.
