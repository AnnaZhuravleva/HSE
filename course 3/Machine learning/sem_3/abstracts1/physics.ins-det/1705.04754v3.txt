In halo dark matter axion search experiments, cylindrical microwave cavities are typically employed to detect signals from the axion-photon conversion. To enhance the conversion power and reduce the noise level, cavities are placed in strong solenoid magnetic fields at sufficiently low temperatures. Exploring high mass regions in cavity-based axion search experiments requires high frequency microwave cavities and thus understanding cavity properties at high frequencies in extreme conditions is deemed necessary. We present a study of the magnetoresistance of copper using a cavity with a resonant frequency of 12.9 GHz at the liquid helium temperature in magnetic fields up to 15 T utilizing a second generation high temperature superconducting magnet. The observations are interpreted to be consistent with the anomalous skin effect and size effect. This is the first measurement of magnetoresistance at a high frequency (> 10 GHz) in high magnetic fields (> 10 T).
