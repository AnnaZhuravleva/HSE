The Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB accelerator has a level 1 trigger implemented in field-programmable gate arrays. Due to the high luminosity of the beam, a trigger that effectively rejects beam induced background is required. A three dimensional tracking algorithm for the level 1 trigger that uses the Belle II central drift chamber detector response is being developed to reduce the recorded beam background while having a high efficiency for physics of interest. In this paper, we describe the three dimensional track trigger that finds and fits track parameters which we developed.
