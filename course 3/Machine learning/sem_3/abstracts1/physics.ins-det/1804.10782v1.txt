The imaging Time-Of-Propagation (iTOP) detector is a Cherenkov particle identification detector constructed from quartz bars for the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider. The purpose of the detector is to identify, with high precision, charged hadrons produced in electron-positron collisions. Belle II particle identification requires detector timing resolution below 50 picoseconds. A novel front-end electronic system was designed, built, and integrated to acquire data from the 8192 channels of the microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes in the iTOP detector. Sampling of the analog signals is done by switched-capacitor array application-specific integration circuits. The processes of triggering, digitization of windows of interest, readout, and data transfer to the Belle II data acquisition system are managed by Xilinx Zynq-7000 programmable system on a chip devices.
