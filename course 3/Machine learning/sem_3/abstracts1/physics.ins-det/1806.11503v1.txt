The Muon Upgrade Phase II of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) aims to guarantee the optimal conditions of the present system and extend the $\eta$ coverage to ensure a reliable system for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) period. The Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) system will upgrade the off-detector electronics (called link system) of the chambers currently installed chambers and place improved RPCs (iRPCs) to cover the high pseudo$-$rapidity region, a challenging region for muon reconstruction in terms of background and momentum resolution. In order to find the best option for the iRPCs, different granularity, and timing configurations were explored by using Monte$-$Carlo simulations, a R\&D program for new detectors was performed and real size prototypes have been tested in the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++) at CERN. The results indicated that the technology suitable for the high background conditions is based on High Pressure Laminate (HPL) double-gap RPC, while electronics based on 350 nm SiGe ASICs technology is the baseline candidate for the Front End Board (FEB). The RPC Upgrade Phase II program will be finished with the installation of the chambers during the Yearly Technical Stops starting at the end of 2021 and 2022, followed by the replacement of the link system during the Long Shutdown 3 (LS3) starting at the end of 2023.
