The Superconducting Quantum Computing (SQC) is one of the most promising quantum computing techniques. The SQC requires precise control and acquisition to operate the superconducting qubits. The ultra-precision DC source is used to provide a DC bias for the qubit to work at its operation point. With the development of the multi-qubit processor, to use the commercial precise DC source device is impossible for its large volume occupation. We present our ultra-precision DC source which is designed for SQC experiments in this paper. The DC source contains 12 channels in 1U 19~inch crate. The performances of our DC source strongly beat the commercial devices. The output rang is -7~V to +7~V with 20~mA maximum output current. The Vpp of the output noise is 3~uV, and the standard deviation is 0.497~uV. The temperature coefficient is less than 1~ppm/$^{\circ}$C in 14~V range. The primary results show that the total drift of the output within 48h at an A/C room temperature environment is 40~uV which equal to 2.9~ppm/48h. We are still trying to optimize the channel density and long-term drift / stability.
