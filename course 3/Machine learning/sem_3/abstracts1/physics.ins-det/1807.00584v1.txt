The SABRE (Sodium Iodide with Active Background REjection) experiment will search for an annually modulating signal from dark matter using an array of ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detectors surrounded by an active scintillator veto to further reduce the background. The first phase of the experiment is the SABRE Proof of Principle (PoP), a single 5 kg crystal detector operated in a liquid scintillator filled vessel at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). The SABRE-PoP installation is underway with the goal of running in 2018 and performing the first in situ measurement of the crystal background, testing the veto efficiency, and validating the SABRE concept. The second phase of SABRE will be twin arrays of NaI(Tl) detectors operating at LNGS and at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL) in Australia. By locating detectors in both hemispheres, SABRE will minimize seasonal systematic effects. This paper presents the status report of the SABRE activities as well as the results from the most recent Monte Carlo simulation and the expected sensitivity.
