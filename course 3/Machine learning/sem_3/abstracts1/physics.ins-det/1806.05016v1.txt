The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors has been utilized for various applications due to their excellent spatial resolution, high rate capabilities and flexibility in design. The GEM detectors stand as a promising device to be used in nuclear and particle physics experiments. Many future experiments and upgrades are looking forward to use this technology leading to high demand of GEM foils. Until now, CERN is the only reliable manufacturer and distributor of GEM foils, but with technology transfer, few other industries across the globe have started manufacturing these foils employing the same photo-lithographic technique. The Micropack Pvt. Ltd. is one such industry in India which produced first few $10~cm ~\times~ 10~cm$ GEM foils, which were then distributed to few collaborating partners for testing reliability and performance of foils before they can be accepted by the scientific community. Characterization of three such foils have already been performed by studying their optical and electrical properties. Using these foils a triple GEM detector has been built and various performance characteristics have been measured. In this paper, we specifically report measurements on gain, resolution and response uniformity, by utilizing local quality control set-ups existing at University of Delhi.
