China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) will start commissioning in early 2018. The neutron spectra from the tungsten target bombarding by 1.6 GeV proton beam are very wide, namely white neutron spectra. Two white neutron beams schemed by CSNS are simulated by FLUKA. And the beam spectrum and intensity comparisons with other neutron sources in service are made. The fidelity of neutron spectra of these two white-neutron beam lines for chip irradiation experiments are estimated. The CSNS atmospheric-like neutron beams will be the first white neutron beam lines in China and the most intensive ones in a few years suitable to carry out the accelerated test experiments of neutron single event effect in the world.
