In the past 20 years, dual-readout calorimetry has emerged as a technique for measuring the properties of high-energy hadrons and hadron jets that offers considerable advantages compared with the instruments that are currently used for this purpose in experiments at the high-energy frontier. In this paper, we review the status of this experimental technique and the challenges faced for its further development.
