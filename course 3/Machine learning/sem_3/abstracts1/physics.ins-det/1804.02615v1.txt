We demonstrate technological improvements in phonon sector tests of Lorentz Invariance that implement quartz Bulk Acoustic Wave oscillators. In this experiment, room temperature oscillators with state-of-the-art phase noise are continuously compared on a platform that rotates at a rate of order a cycle per second. The discussion is focused on improvements in noise measurement techniques, data acquisition and data processing. Preliminary results of the second generation of such tests are given, and indicate that SME coefficients in the matter sector can be measured at a precision of order $10^{-16}$ GeV after taking a years worth of data. This is equivalent to an improvement of two orders of magnitude over the prior acoustic phonon sector experiment.
