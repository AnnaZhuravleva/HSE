The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims to make a model-independent determination of the effective electron antineutrino mass with a sensitivity of 0.2 eV/c$^{2}$. It investigates the kinematics of $\beta$-particles from tritium $\beta$-decay close to the endpoint of the energy spectrum. Because the KATRIN main spectrometer (MS) is located above ground, muon-induced backgrounds are of particular concern. Correlation measurements with the MS and a scintillator-based muon detector system showed that about $12\%$ of secondary electrons produced at the inner surface of the MS are induced by cosmic-ray muons, with approximately one secondary electron produced for every five muon crossings. Coincidence measurements with the same setup were able to probe the secondary-electron energy spectrum. However, the magnetic and electrostatic shielding of the MS is able to efficiently suppress these electrons, and we find that muons are responsible for less than $17\%$ ($90\%$ confidence level) of the overall MS background.
