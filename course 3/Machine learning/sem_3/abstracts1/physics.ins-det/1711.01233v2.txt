This work presents a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor (DMAPS) prototype manufactured in the LFoundry 150 nm CMOS process. The described device, named LF-Monopix, was designed as a proof of concept of a fully monolithic sensor capable of operating in the environment of outer layers of the ATLAS Inner Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Implementing such a device in the detector module will result in a lower production cost and lower material budget compared to the presently used hybrid designs. In this paper the chip architecture will be described followed by the simulation and measurement results.
