A focal plane detector for the Enge Split-pole Spectrograph at Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory has been designed. The detector package consists of two position sensitive gas avalanche counters, a gas proportionality energy loss section, and a residual energy scintillator. This setup allows both particle identification and focal plane reconstruction. In this paper we will detail the construction of each section along with their accompanying electronics and data acquisition. Effects of energy loss throughout the detector, ray tracing procedures, and resolution as a function of fill pressure and bias voltage are also investigated. A measurement of the $^{27}\!$Al$(d,p)$ reaction is used to demonstrate detector performance and to illustrate a Bayesian method of energy calibration.
