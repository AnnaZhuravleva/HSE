The identification, or "tagging", of the $^{136}$Ba daughter atom that results from double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe provides a promising technique for the elimination of backgrounds in a future upgrade of the nEXO neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. The tagging scheme being developed in this work utilizes a cryogenic probe to trap the barium atom in solid xenon and extract it from the time projection chamber filled with liquid xenon. The barium atom is then tagged via fluorescence imaging in the solid xenon matrix. Individual barium atoms in a particular matrix site have been imaged and counted with high definition by scanning a focused laser across the solid xenon matrix deposited on a sapphire window. This is the first time single atoms have been imaged in solid noble element and represents significant progress towards a practical barium tagging technique for nEXO.
