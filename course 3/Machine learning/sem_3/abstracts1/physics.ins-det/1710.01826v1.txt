Project 8 is a tritium endpoint neutrino mass experiment utilizing a phased program to achieve sensitivity to the range of neutrino masses allowed by the inverted mass hierarchy. The Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES) technique is employed to measure the differential energy spectrum of decay electrons with high precision. We present an overview of the Project 8 experimental program, from first demonstration of the CRES technique to ultimate sensitivity with an atomic tritium source. We highlight recent advances in preparation for the first measurement of the continuous tritium spectrum with CRES.
