The proposed magnetised Iron CALorimeter detector (ICAL) to be built in the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) laboratory aims to detect atmospheric muon neutrinos. In order to achieve improved physics results, the constituent components of the detector must be fully understood by proper characterisation and optimisation of various parameters. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) are the active detector elements in the ICAL detector and can be made of glass or bakelite. The number of RPCs required for this detector are very large so a detailed study is necessary to establish the characterisation and optimisation of these RPCs. These detectors once installed will be taking data for 15-20 years. In this paper, we report the selection criteria of the glass electrodes procured from Indian manufacturers. Based on the factors that deteriorate the quality of glass the choice of electrode is made. The glass characterisation studies include UV-VIS transmission for optical properties, SEM, AFM for surface properties, WD-XRF, PIXE for determining the composition of glass samples and electrical properties. Based on these techniques a procedure is adopted to arrive at the best glass sample. We have done a second order check on the quality of the fabricated glass RPCs. In this regard, the efficiency and cross-talk of RPCs were measured. Results from Asahi and Saint Gobain glass RPCs came out to be the best.
