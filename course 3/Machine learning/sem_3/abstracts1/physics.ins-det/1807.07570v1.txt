Gamma-gamma angular correlation measurements are a powerful tool for identifying the angular momentum (spin) of excited nuclear states involved in a $\gamma$-ray cascade, and for measuring the multipole orders and mixing ratios of transitions. Though the physical angular correlations are fully calculable from first principles, experimental effects can make the extraction of coefficients and thus conclusions about spins and mixing ratios difficult. In this article we present data analysis techniques developed for the clover detectors of the GRIFFIN spectrometer at TRIUMF-ISAC combined with GEANT4 simulations in order to extract accurate experimental results.
