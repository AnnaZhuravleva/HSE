The architecture of the novel MPGD-based photon detectors of COMPASS RICH-1 consists in a large-size hybrid MPGD multilayer layout combining two layers of Thick-GEMs and a bulk resistive MICROMEGAS. Concerning biasing voltage, the Thick-GEMs are segmented in order to reduce the energy released in case of occasional discharges, while the MICROMEGAS anode is segmented in pads individually biased at positive voltage, while the micromesh is grounded. In total, there are ten different electrode types and more than 20000 electrodes supplied by more than 100 HV channels. Commercial power supply units are used. The original elements of the power supply system are the architecture of the voltage distribution net, the compensation, by voltage adjustment, of the effects of pressure and temperature variation affecting the detector gain and a sophisticated control software, which allows to protect the detectors against errors by the operator, to monitor and log voltages and current at 1 Hz rate and to automatically react to detector misbehaviors. The HV system and its performance are described in detail as well as the electrical stability of the detector during the operation at COMPASS.
