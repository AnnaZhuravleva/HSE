The dependence of the quantum efficiency on the angle and polarization of the incident photon needs to be formulated for a precise description of the response of photomultiplier tubes. A simplified one step model of photoelectron emission was derived from Spicer's three step model, and it enabled the formulation of the dependence of the quantum efficiency in the visible range for thin multi-alkali (NaKSbCs) photocathodes. The expression of the quantum efficiency was proved by a measurement of the photocurrent for linearly polarized light at various incident angles. Meanwhile the measurement revealed the complex refractive indices and thicknesses both of the stratified photocathode and antireflection coating. It is indicated that the angular dependence of the quantum efficiency is dictated by the optical properties of the photocathode, which are discussed in detail on the basis of the obtained parameters.
