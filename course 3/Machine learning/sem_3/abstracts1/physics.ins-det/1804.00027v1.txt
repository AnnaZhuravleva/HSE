Reactor neutrinos play a substantial role in the study of the fundamental properties of neutrinos. With current and upcoming precision experiments, it is essential more than ever to understand the reactor neutrino flux and spectrum. However, two discrepancies between prediction and measurement are observed. On the one hand, there is a $\sim6\%$ total measured flux deficit, known as the reactor antineutrino anomaly, consistently seen by several experiments at short baselines. On the other hand, there is an observed excess over prediction for $\bar\nu_e$ energies between 5-7 MeV. We discuss current status of the experimental measurements and provide an outlook.
