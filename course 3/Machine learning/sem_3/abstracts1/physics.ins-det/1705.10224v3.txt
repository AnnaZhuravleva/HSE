We present a report of the MEG II experiment, the upgrade of MEG, whose goal is to search for the forbidden decay \megc\ with increased precision. After having briefly reviewed the motivation for such a search and the current limit due to MEG, we present the conceptual design of the detector detailing for each subdetector the motivations and the extent of the upgrade and the expected resolution improvements. Novel subdetectors and calibration hardware are introduced. We conclude with the expected sensitivity of the MEGII experiment.
