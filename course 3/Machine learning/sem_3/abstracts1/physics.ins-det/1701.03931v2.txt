AXEL is a high pressure xenon gas TPC detector being developed for neutrinoless double-beta decay search. We use the proportional scintillation mode with a new electroluminescence light detection system to achieve high energy resolution in a large detector. The detector also has tracking capabilities, which enable significant background rejection. To demonstrate our detection technique, we constructed a 10L prototype detector filled with up to 10bar xenon gas. The FWHM energy resolution obtained by the prototype detector is 4.0 $\pm$ 0.30 $\%$ at 122 keV, which corresponds to 0.9 ~ 2.0 % when extrapolated to the Q value of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe.
