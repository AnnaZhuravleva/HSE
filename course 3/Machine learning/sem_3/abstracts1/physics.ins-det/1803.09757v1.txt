Ambient neutron is one of the most serious backgrounds for underground experiments searching for rare events. Ambient neutron flux in an underground laboratory of Kamioka Observatory was measured using a $\mathrm{^3He}$ proportional counter with various moderator setups. Since the detector response largely depends on the spectrum shape, energy spectra of neutrons transported from the rock to the laboratory are estimated by Monte-Carlo simulations. The ratio of thermal neutron flux to the total one was found to depend on the thermalizing efficiency in the rock. Therefore, the ratio of the count rate without a moderator to that with a moderator was used to determine this parameter. As a result, the most-likely neutron spectrum predicted by the simulations with the parameters determined by the experimental results was obtained. The result suggests an interesting spectrum shape, which has not been indicated in previous studies. The total ambient neutron flux is $(5.52 \pm 0.16 \ \mathrm{_{stat.}} ^{+0.44}_{-0.50} \ \mathrm{_{sys.}}) \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. This result, especially the energy spectrum information, would be a new and important input for the background estimation in the current and future experiments in the underground laboratory at the Kamioka Observatory.
