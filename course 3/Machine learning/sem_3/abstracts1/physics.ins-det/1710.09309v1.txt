The evolution and the present status of the gaseous photon detectors technologies are reviewed. The most recent developments in several branches of the field are described, in particular the installation and commissioning of the first large area MPGD-based detectors of single photons on COMPASS RICH-1. Investigation of novel detector architectures, different materials and various applications are reported, and the quest for visible light gaseous photon detectors is discussed. The progress on the use of gaseous photon detector related techniques in the field of cryogenic applications and gaseous or liquid scintillation imaging are presented.
