Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN), a plastic scintillator array (10$\times$10), is being constructed for the purpose of electron anti-neutrino ($\overline\nuup_{e}$) detection for reactor monitoring applications. A prototype detector called mini-ISMRAN, which consists of 16$\%$ of ISMRAN, has been setup for studying the detector response, background rates and event characterization in the reactor and non-reactor environment. The data acquisition system based on waveform digitizers is being used for pulse processing and event triggering. Monte-Carlo based simulations using GEANT4 are performed to optimize lead (Pb) and borated polyethylene (BP) shielding for background reduction and to study the positron, neutron and $\gamma$-ray response in the ISMRAN detector. Characterization of plastic scintillator detectors with known radioactive sources is done for energy, timing and position measurements. Using the energy summation and bar multiplicity selection, coincident events from $\mathrm{{}^{60}Co}$ decay are reconstructed in non-reactor environment. Results from background measurements using various detectors are quantified in reactor ON and OFF condition. The shielding of 10 cm Pb and 10 cm BP along with the requirement of hits in multiple bars, reduces the uncorrelated background in reactor ON condition.
