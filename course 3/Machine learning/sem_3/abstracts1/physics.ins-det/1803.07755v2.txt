The mass of axion dark matter is only weakly bounded by cosmological observations, necessitating a variety of detection techniques in many different mass ranges. Axions are expected to convert to photons via the inverse Primakoff effect and cryogenic resonant cavities are often proposed as tools for detecting these photons. However, such structures are inherently narrowband and the range of possible axion dark matter masses spans several orders of magnitude. On the other hand broadband low-mass detectors have been proposed using inductive magnetometer sensors and a gapped toroidal solenoid magnet. In this work we propose an alternative, which uses a capacitive sensor in a conventional solenoidal magnet aligned in the laboratory z-axis, as implemented in standard haloscope experiments. In the presence of the DC magnetic field, the inverse Primakoff effect causes a time varying electric field (or displacement current) in the z-direction to oscillate at the axion Compton frequency. We propose non-resonant techniques to detect this electric field by implementing capacitive sensors coupled to a low noise amplifier. We present the theoretical foundation for this proposal, and the first experimental results. Preliminary results constrain $g_{a\gamma\gamma} >\sim2.35\times10^{-12}$ $\text{GeV}^{-1}$ in the mass range of $2.08\times10^{-11}$ to $2.2\times10^{-11}$ eV, and demonstrate potential sensitivity to axion-like dark matter with masses in the range of $10^{-12}$ to $10^{-8}$ eV.
