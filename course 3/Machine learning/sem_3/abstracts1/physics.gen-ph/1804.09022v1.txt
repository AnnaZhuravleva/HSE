The nonlinear scalar field model of space-time film (Born -- Infeld type nonlinear scalar field model) is considered. Its spherically symmetrical solution is obtained. This solution gives the class of moving solitary solutions or solitons with the Lorentz transformation. We consider the distant interaction between such spheroidal solitons or spherons. This interaction is caused by the nonlinearity of the model. Starting from the static configuration with two spherons we show that the interaction under investigation is similar to electromagnetic one.
