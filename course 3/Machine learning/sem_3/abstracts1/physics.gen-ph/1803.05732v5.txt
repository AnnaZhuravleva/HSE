This paper presents a spectral calculus for computing the spectrum of a causal Lorentz invariant Borel complex measure on Minkowski space, thereby enabling one to compute the density for such a measure with respect to Lebesque measure. It is proved that the convolution of arbitrary causal Lorentz invariant Borel measures exists and the product of such measures exists in a wide class of cases. Techniques for their computation are presented. Divergent integrals in quantum field theory (QFT) are shown to have a well defined existence as Lorentz invariant complex measures. The case of vacuum polarization is considered and the spectral vacuum polarization function is shown to have very close agreement with the vacuum polarization function obtained using dimensional regularization / renormalization in the real mass domain. The spectral running coupling constant is shown to converge for all energies while the running coupling constant obtained using dimensional regularization is shown to diverge for all non-zero energies. The Uehling contributions to the Lamb shifts for the hydrogen atom and the muonic hydrogen atom are computed.
