Quantum mechanics, devoid of any additional assumption, does not give any theoretical constraint on the projection basis to be used for the measurement process. It is shown in this paper that it does neither allow any physical means for an experimenter to determine which measurement bases have been used by another experimenter. As a consequence, quantum mechanics allows a situation in which two experimenters witness incoherent stories without being able to detect such incoherence, even if they are allowed to communicate freely by exchanging iterative and bilateral messages.
