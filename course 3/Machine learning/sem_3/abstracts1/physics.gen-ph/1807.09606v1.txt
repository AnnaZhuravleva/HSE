The name "magneticon" in this paper refers to a magnetically charged spin 1/2 particle predicted by incorporating a symmetry of classical electromagnetism, called dyality symmetry, into a certain model for the structure of point-like fermions. (Actually, it is anticipated that there would be a full spectrum, both hadronic and leptonic, of such magnetically charged particles.) The lightest of these magneticons is anticipated to be leptonic in nature and predicted to have the same magnitude of electromagnetic charge (in Gaussian units) as the electron, except that it is magnetic. Accompanying this spectrum of magnetic fermions, it is suggested that there may also be a second, or magnetic, photon. After a brief introduction, the pair production cross section of magneticons by electron-positron annihilation is derived using a lowest order quantum perturbation approximation suggested by a two-potential Lagrangian form for classical electromagnetism, symmetrized through the use of space-time algebra to include magnetic charge and currents. A discussion of how these ideas might be included in other quantum interactions involving magnetic charges and the magnetic photon is undertaken. These interactions include electron-magneticon scattering and magneticon vacuum polarization loops. Possibilities for the observation of these magnetic particles in past experiments, as well as future experiments, are explored, and some predictions are made.
