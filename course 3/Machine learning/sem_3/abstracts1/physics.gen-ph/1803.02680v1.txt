We explain the origin of the mass for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons when there is a chemical potential in the action which breaks explicitly the symmetry. The method is based on the number of independent histories for the interaction of the pair of Nambu-Goldstone bosons with the degenerate vacuum (triangle relations). The analysis suggests that under some circumstances, pairs of massive Nambu-Goldstone bosons can become a single degree of freedom with an effective mass defined by the superposition of the individual masses of each boson. Possible mass oscillations for the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are discussed.
