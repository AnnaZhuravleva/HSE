Basing on two of our previous works [NPB917,178] and [NPB930,533], we provide here clear and thorough answers to some key questions in black holes physics: i) the title question, ii) the Schwarzschild singularity's resolving, iii) the microscopic essence of black hole entropy and iv) explicitly unitary formulation of Hawking radiations. Our answer is obtained at a quantum mechanic instead of gravitational quantum field theory levels. This is a working level rarely explored by previous researchers but so efficient just as quantum mechanics do between quantum electrodynamic and atom spectrums.
