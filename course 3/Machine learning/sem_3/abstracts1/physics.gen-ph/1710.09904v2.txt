Following earlier studies that provided a consistent theory of kinematics for tachyons (faster-than-light particles) we here embark on a study of tachyon dynamics, both in classical physics and in the quantum theory. Examining a general scattering process we come to recognize that the labels given to "in" and "out" states are not Lorentz invariant for tachyons; and this lets us find a sensible interpretation of negative energy states. For statistical mechanics, as well as for scattering problems, we study what should be the proper expression for density of states for tachyons. We review the previous work on quantization of a Dirac field for tachyons and go on to expand earlier considerations of neutrinos as tachyons in the context of cosmology. We stumble into the realization that tachyon neutrinos would contribute to gravitation with the opposite sign compared to tachyon antineutrinos. This leads to the gobsmacking prediction that the Cosmic Neutrino Background, if they are indeed tachyons, might explain both phenomena of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. This theoretical study also makes contact with the anticipated results from the experiments KATRIN and PTOLEMY, which focus on beta decay and neutrino absorption by Tritium.
