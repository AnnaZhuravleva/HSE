In this essay we conjecture that quantum fields such as the Higgs field is related to a restricted Boltzmann machine for deep neural networks. An accelerating Rindler observer in a flat spacetime sees the quantum fields having a thermal distribution from the quantum entanglement, and a renormalization group process for the thermal fields on a lattice is similar to a deep learning algorithm.   This correspondence can be generalized for the KMS states of quantum fields in a curved spacetime like a black hole.
