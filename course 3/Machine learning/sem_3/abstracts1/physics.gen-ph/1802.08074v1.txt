A simple classical non-local dynamical system with random initial conditions and an output projecting the state variable on selected axes has been defined to mimic a two-channel quantum coincidence experiment. Non-locality is introduced by a parameter connecting the initial conditions to the selection of the projection axes. The statistics of the results shows violations up to 100% of the Bell's inequality, in the form of Clauser-Horne- Shimony-Holt (CHSH), strongly depending on the non-locality parameter. Discussions on the parallelism with Bohmian mechanics are given.
