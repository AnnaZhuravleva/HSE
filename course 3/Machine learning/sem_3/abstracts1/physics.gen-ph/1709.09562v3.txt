We propose an alternative definition for a Tsallis entropy composition-inspired Fourier transform, which we call "$\tau_q$-Fourier transform". We comment about the underlying "covariance" on the set of algebraic fields that motivates its introduction. We see that the definition of the $\tau_q$-Fourier transform is automatically invertible in the proper context. Based on recent results in Fourier analysis, it turns that the $\tau_q$-Fourier transform is essentially unique under the assumption of the exchange of the point-wise product of functions with their convolution.
