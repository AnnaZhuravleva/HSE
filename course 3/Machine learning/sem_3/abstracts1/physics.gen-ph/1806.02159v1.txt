We show that the relativistic matter waves of two particle system contains the SU(2) symmetry; the relativistic matter waves of three particle system contains the SU(3) symmetry. Therefore, the relativistic matter wave is suitable for describing many-particle system such as quarks or gluons etc that are engaged with implicated symmetry problems. The weak interaction and strong interaction are investigated by using the relativistic de Broglie matter wave with SU(n) symmetry. Our results agree well with experiments. This work is to re-discover and re-explore de Broglie matter wave with the SU(n) symmetry and its applications to particle physics. This work was divided into two parts: Chapter 1, Relativistic de Broglie matter wave; Chapter 2, Factory of prosthesis.
