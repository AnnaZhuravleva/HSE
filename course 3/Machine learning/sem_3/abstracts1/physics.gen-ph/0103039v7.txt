General equations of the unified field theory, based on the curved and torsional space-time, are presented. They contain only geometrical parameters of the metric-affine space G4 and describe the distribution and motion of matter, which represents the curvature and torsion of the space-time. Equations, describing the spherically symmetric fields, are derived for various cases: for the metric with singularities and for metric without them, for the gravitational field in vacuum, for an arbitrary material field, and for the massless fluid with spin. Equations, describing the uniform isotropic field, are derived for the closed and open uniform isotropic models of the universe for the gravitational field in vacuum, for an arbitrary material field, and for the massless fluid with spin. The respective solutions were obtained for all these different cases. It is shown that there is no necessity to quantize the obtained general equations. Applying the concept of the unified geometrical field, the hypothetical qualitative explanations of some non-conventional phenomena are proposed.
