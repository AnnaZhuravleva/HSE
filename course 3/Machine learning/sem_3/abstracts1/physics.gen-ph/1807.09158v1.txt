In this paper we show that since we have not observed quarks and gluons outside the hadron due to the confinement of quarks and gluons inside the hadron, the boundary surface term in QCD is at the finite distance which is at the surface of the finite size hadron. Since the boundary surface is at the finite distance we find that the boundary surface term in QCD is non-zero irrespective of the form of the $r$ dependence of the gluon field ${\hat A}_\mu^a(t,r)$ and the $r$ dependence of the quark field ${\hat \psi}_i(t,r)$ where $a=1,...,8$ and $i=1,2,3$ are the color indices. We show that this is consistent with the fact that the cluster decomposition property fails in QCD due to confinement.
