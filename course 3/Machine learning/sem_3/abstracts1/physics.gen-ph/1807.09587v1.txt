In this paper we present a multipartite formulation of gauge gravity theory based on the formalism of space-time algebra for gravitation developed by Lasenby and Doran (Lasenby, A. N., Doran, C. J. L, and Gull, S.F.: Gravity, gauge theories and geometric algebra. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, 582, 356:487 (1998)). We associate the gauge fields with description of fermionic and bosonic states using the generalized graded tensor product. Einstein's equations are deduced from the graded projections and an algebraic Hopf-like structure naturally emerges from formalism. A connection with the theory of the quantum information is performed through the minimal left ideals and entangled qubits are derived. In addition applications to black holes physics and standard model are outlined.
