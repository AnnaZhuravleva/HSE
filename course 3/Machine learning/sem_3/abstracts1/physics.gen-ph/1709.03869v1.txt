We explore the physical consequences of a new nonlinear electrodynamics, for which the electric field of a point-like charge is finite at the origin, as in the well-known Born-Infeld electrodynamics. However, contrary to the latter, in this new electrodynamics the phenomenon of birefringence and dichroism take place in the presence of external magnetic fields. Subsequently we study the interaction energy, within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables formalism. Interestingly enough, the static potential profile contains a linear potential leading to the confinement of static charges.
