Recently was advanced the argument that accelerating reference frames can be represented by a proper quantized space-time. Quantum space-time of this form was indicated by the definition of quantum fields in momentum space, called accelerated quantum fields. In this paper, the nature of Unruh-like effect for accelerated fields is analyzed with mass having the key-role instead of acceleration. It is shown that a classical relativistic particle behaves as a black body at a temperature, $T$, which is inversely proportional to its mass, radiating quantum excitations of accelerated field, i.e. quanta of space-time. Comparing with the classical case of curved space-time by a massive object, we deduce that quantum space-time takes the place of the usual spacetime continuum, curvature is substituted by quantum fields and tidal effects of gravity are replaced by Unruh-like effect of accelerated fields. In case of black hole, we find that the temperature $T$ is proportional to Hawking temperature, $T= 4 T_H$. Thus, black hole radiates as any other gravitational object. Finally, the direct association of rest mass with temperature offers an explanation of quantum gravity in thermodynamic terms, namely as a gas of space-time quanta in thermodynamic equilibrium.
