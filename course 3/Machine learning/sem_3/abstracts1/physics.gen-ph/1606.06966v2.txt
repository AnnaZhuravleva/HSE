In this paper we demonstrate that massless particles cannot be considered as limiting case of massive particles. Instead, the usual symmetry structure based on semisimple groups like $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ has to be replaced by less usual solvable groups like the minimal nonabelian group ${\rm sol}_2$. Starting from the proper orthochronous Lorentz group ${\rm Lor}_{1,3}$ we extend Wigner's little group by an additional generator, obtaining the maximal solvable or Borel subgroup ${\rm Bor}_{1,3}$ which is equivalent to the Kronecker sum of two copies of ${\rm sol}_2$, telling something about the helicity of particle and antiparticle states.
