We show explicit the first radiative correction for the vertex and photon-photon 4-point function in Generalized Scalar Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau Quantum Electrodynamcis (GSDKP), utilizing the dimensional regularization method, where the gauge symmetry is manifest. As we shall see one of the consequences of the study is that the DKP algebra ensures the functioning of theWard- Takahashi-Fradkin (WTF) identities in the first radiative corrections prohibiting certain ultraviolet (UV) divergences. This result leads us to ask whether this connection between DKP algebra, UV divergences, and quantum gauge symmetry (WTF) is a general statment.
