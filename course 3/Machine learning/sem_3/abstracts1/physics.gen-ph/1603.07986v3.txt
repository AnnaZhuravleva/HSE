Schr\"odinger's cat is one of the most striking paradoxes of quantum mechanics that reveals the counterintuitive aspects of the microscopic world. Here, I discuss the paradox in the framework of quantum information. Using a quantum networks formalism, I analyse the information flow between the atom and the cat. This reveals that the atom and the cat are connected only through a classical information channel: the detector clicks $\rightarrow$ the poison is released $\rightarrow$ the cat is killed. No amount of local operations and classical communication can entangle the atom and the cat, which are initially in a separable state. This casts a new light on the paradox.
