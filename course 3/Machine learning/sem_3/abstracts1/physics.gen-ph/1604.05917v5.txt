I work on a set of Feynman rules that were derived in order to incorporate the constraint of Gauss's law in the perturbation expansion of gauge field theories and calculate the interaction energy of two static sources. The constraint is implemented via a Lagrange multiplier field, $\lambda$, which, in the case of the non-Abelian theory, develops a radiatively generated effective potential term. After analysing the contributions of various solutions for $\lambda$, the confining properties and the various phases of the theory are discussed.
