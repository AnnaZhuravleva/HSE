In this paper, we consider three types of polynomial equations in quantum computer: linear divisibility equation, which belongs to a special type of binary-quadratic Diophantine equation; quadratic congruence equation with restriction in the solution and exponential congruence equation in finite field. Quantum algorithms based on Grover's algorithm and Shor's algorithm to these problems are given. As for the exponential congruence equation, which has been considered by Dam and Shparlinski \cite{dam} at 2008, a relatively simple quantum algorithm is given here. And some other results and generalizations are discovered.
