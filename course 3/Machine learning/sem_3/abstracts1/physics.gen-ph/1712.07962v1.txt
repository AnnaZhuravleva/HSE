Dark energy and Dark matter constitute 95% of the observable Universe. Yet the physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses, which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the reasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By reconsidering this assumption, I construct a toy model which suggests that both Dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The model indicates that continuously-created negative masses behave identically to the cosmological constant and can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. In three-dimensional N-body simulations, this exotic material seems to naturally form haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are not cuspy. The proposed theory therefore appears to be the only cosmological model that is able to predict the observed distribution of Dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The model makes several testable predictions and seems to be consistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or alternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some limit can be modelled by negative masses. Both cases lead to the surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the Dark Universe may have been due to a simple sign error.
