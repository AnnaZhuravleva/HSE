In this paper, it is pointed out for the first time that the linear effective potential between quarks is intrinsically relating to the bag model while concerning the asymptotically-free nature of colours. Based on the relationship we employ the symmetry method to analyze the quark-anti-quark system. By imposing the Poincare invariance on the quark-anti-quark bound-state, and translating the chiral transformation to its spatial manifestation, we can infer why the chiral symmetry breaking happens. Applying this knowledge to deep inelastic scattering we reach the conclusion that the measured proton spin in scattering experiments should be uncertain quantity.
