We study the charged and spin currents on a coordinate dependent noncommutative space. Starting from the noncommutative extended relativistic equation of motion, the non-relativistic approximation is obtained by using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, and then the charged and spin currents are derived by using the extended Drude model. We find that the charged current is twisted by modifying the off-diagonal elements of the Hall conductivity, however, the spin current is not affected up to leading order of the noncommutative parameter.
