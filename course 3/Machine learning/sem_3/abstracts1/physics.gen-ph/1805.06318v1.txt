The representations in Grassmann space of the subgroups $SU(3) \times U(1)$, $SO(3,1)$ and $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, embedded into the group $SO(13,1)$, are discussed in the context of the second quantized states. While states of the Lorentz group and all its subgroups (in any dimension) are in Clifford space in the fundamental representations, offering also family degrees of freedom, states in Grassmann space manifest with respect to the Lorentz group adjoint representations, allowing no families.
