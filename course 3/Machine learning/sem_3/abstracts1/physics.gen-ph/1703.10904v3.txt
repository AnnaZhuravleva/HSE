A simplified mathematical approach is presented and used to find a suitable free-field Lagrangian to complete previous work on constructing a gauge theory of CPT transformations. The new Lagrangian is a slight but important modification of the previous candidate. The new version satisfies an additional requirement which had been overlooked and not satisfied by the previous candidate.
