Using semi-classical quantization techniques, it is shown that Positronium can exhibit a hitherto overlooked proper quantum-mechanical ground state whose energy level lies $\approx 2m c^2$ below its "hydrogenic (pseudo-) ground state" energy, where $m$ is the empirical rest mass of the electron. While the usual hydrogenic pseudo-ground state is caused by the Coulomb attraction of electron and anti-electron, modified by small spin-spin and radiative QED corrections, the proper ground state is caused by the Biot-Savart type attraction between the anomalous magnetic moments of these particles, the normal, Bohr-magneton size "magnetic moment of the electron" is not contributing to this bound state energy. This finding suggests that the familiar "annihilation" of electron and anti-electron is, in reality, simply yet another transition between two atomic energy levels, with the energy difference radiated off in form of photons --- except that the energy difference is huge: about 1 MeV instead of the few eV in a hydrogenic transition. In their proper ground state configuration the two particles would be so close that they would electromagnetically neutralize each other for most practical purposes, thus giving the appearance of an annihilation. Also, once in such a tightly bound state the pair would hardly interact with normal matter, so would hardly be noticeable --- except through their gravitational effects in bulk!
