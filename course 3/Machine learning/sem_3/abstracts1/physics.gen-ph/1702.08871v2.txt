The existence of the Higgs provides a considerable support to the Standard Model of particles and fields(SM), and also opens the perspective of a renewed physics in four-dimensional space-times. It is shown why and how the Higgs mechanism implies the inclusion of Einstein's gravitational field within the SM, together with a novel massive spin-2 field of geometric nature, acting as a short range carrier of the gravitational field.
