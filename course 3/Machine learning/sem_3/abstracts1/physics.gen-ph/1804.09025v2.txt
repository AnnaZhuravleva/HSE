We propose that the consistent field renormalization of gravity requires a specific Weyl transformation of the metric tensor. As a consequence, proper length and time, as well as energy and momentum, become functions of scale. We estimate the functional form of the field renormalization factor by imposing a minimum resolvable distance scale under an infinitesimal Weyl transformation. The derived transformation is applied to two key problems in quantum gravity, its non-conformal scaling, and non-renormalizability.
