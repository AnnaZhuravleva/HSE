A BIonic diode is constructed of two polygonal manifolds connected by a Chern-Simons manifold. The shape and the angle between atoms of molecules on the boundary of two polygonal manifolds are completely different. For this reason, electrons on the Chern-Simons manifold are repelled by molecules at the boundary of one manifold and absorbed by molecules on the boundary of another manifold. The attractive and repulsive forces between electrons are carried by masive photons. For example, when two non-similar trigonal manifolds join to each other, one non-symmetrical hexagonal manifold is emerged and the exchanged photons form Chern-Simons fields which live on a Chern-Simons manifold in a BIon. While, for a hexagonal manifold, with similar trigonal manifolds, the photons exchanged between two trigonal manifolds cancel the effect of each other and BIonic energy becomes zero. Also, exchanging photons between heptagonal and pentagonal manifolds lead to the motion of electrons on the Chern-Simons manifold and formation of BIonic diode. The mass of photons depend on the shape of molecules on the boundary of manifolds and the length of BIon in a gap between two manifolds.
