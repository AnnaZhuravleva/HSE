It has recently been shown that the observed Hubble function for cosmological expansion can be fitted accurately back to redshift unity (7.33 Gyr ago) with only one free constant, while neglecting cosmic curvature and mass, using the modified Friedmann equation implied by subjecting the Higgs scalar field model to conformal Weyl scaling symmetry. Time-dependent solutions of the relativistic conformal Higgs scalar field equation coupled with the conformal Friedmann equation are shown here to imply dark energy of the observed magnitude. Predicted persistent cosmic acceleration is consistent with the nonclassical parameter inferred by conformal theory from observed excessive galactic rotation velocities and galactic dark halos, all without dark matter.
