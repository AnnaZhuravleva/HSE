The well-known Lagrangian of current superfluid systems is not relativistic covariant, this paper gives a general relativistic covariant Lagrangian of superfluid systems, and naturally finds the non-relativistic Lagrangian and its all corresponding theories after making approximations. The equation of motion obtained from the old non-relativistic Lagrangian density is not complete, it lost some important terms. The new deduced equation can be approximated to the old equations of motion, the new momentum and energy can return to the old expressions of superfluid systems under some conditions, and the energy and momentum from the general Lagrangian density is accurate, no ignoring some terms. This paper reveals that the current classical superfluid Lagrangian density is only an approximation Lagrangian density under conditions: the scalar field is inverse proportional to its complex conjugate field and the square of time derivative of scalar field logarithm approximates to zero. This paper deduces that the divergence of velocity field is zero under classic superfluid, gives two different expressions of Lagrangian, gets the same equation, and finds its solutions. Using two different Lagrangian densities, this paper obtains different forces. Therefore, this paper discovers a general, fundamental and real physics symmetry Lagrangian deducing the real physics equation of the superfluid, and further discover the symmetry breaking processes and the special conditions from the general Lagrangian to the special Lagrangian. This paper gives both superfluid theory of scalar field and comparing investigations with its corresponding theory of quantum mechanics.
