Suppressed SUSY is a new mechanism for `breaking SUSY'. It requires Supergravity. It is independent of and very different from spontaneous or explicit SUSY breaking. A recent paper illustrates some of its results. In this paper, the basic mechanism of Suppressed SUSY is explained in a simple SU(5) Yang Mills Theory, with a special set of Scalars. Supersymmetry is not needed for this limited purpose.
