Using the quantum theory of linearized gravity, gravitational interaction differential cross sections of one fermion by another fermion, a photon and a scalar particle are calculated in the fermion rest-frame. Then, according to the obtained results, it is shown that in the lab frame, the gravitational interaction depends on the spin of the moving particle and is independent of the spin of the rest particle. After that, on the dependency of the gravitational interaction of fermion-photon upon the various states of photons polarization is discussed.
