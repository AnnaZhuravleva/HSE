An Extended Wigner's Friend gedanken experiment proposed by Daniela Frauchiger and Renato Renner in [FR16] (FRE) is a remarkable one, as probably for the first time quantum superposition persuasively contradicts the axioms of classical modal logic. In this paper I discuss various earlier, evolving approaches to this subject, starting from the famous Schr\"odinger's cat. Then I briefly describe a qubit and two-qubit register, the necessary ingredients of the experiments taking part in this evolution. Finally, basing on my proposition of [SL18], I postulate that the smallest possible agent that would implement fallibility that removes the contradiction in the FRE by introducing unpredictable errors in the prescribed FRE setup, is a biological cell that features memory based cell signalling. In the last section I propose a simplified quantum model of cell signalling along two distinct parallel pathways, that cannot be described by modal logic.
