The way Quantum Mechanics (QM) is introduced to people used to Classical Mechanics (CM) is by a complete change of the general methodology) despite QM historically stemming from CM as a means to explain experimental results. Therefore, it is desirable to build a bridge from CM to QM.   This paper presents a generalization of CM to QM. It starts from the generalization of a point-like object and naturally arrives at the quantum state vector of quantum systems in the complex valued Hilbert space, its time evolution and quantum representation of a measurement apparatus of any size. Each time, when generalization is performed, there is a possibility to develop new theory giving up most simple generalizations. It is shown that a measurement apparatus is a special case of a general quantum object. An example of a measurement apparatus of an intermediate size is considered in the end.
