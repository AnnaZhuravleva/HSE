Non-relativistic quantum mechanics is reformulated here based on the idea that relational properties among quantum systems, instead of the independent properties of a quantum system, are the most fundamental elements to construct quantum mechanics. This idea, combining with the emphasis that measurement of a quantum system is a bidirectional interaction process, leads to a new framework to calculate the probability of an outcome when measuring a quantum system. In this framework, the most basic variable is the relational probability amplitude. Probability is calculated as summation of weights from the alternative measurement configurations. The properties of quantum systems, such as superposition and entanglement, are manifested through the rules of counting the alternatives. Wave function and reduced density matrix are derived from the relational probability amplitude matrix. They are found to be secondary mathematical tools that equivalently describe a quantum system without explicitly calling out the reference system. Schr\"{o}dinger Equation is obtained when there is no entanglement in the relational probability amplitude matrix. Feynman Path Integral is used to calculate the relational probability amplitude, and is further generalized to formulate the reduced density matrix. In essence, quantum mechanics is reformulated as a theory that describes physical systems in terms of relational properties.
