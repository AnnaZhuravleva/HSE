The role of quantum groups and braid groups in the description of Standard Model particles is discussed. Some recent results on the use of the quantum group $SU_q(3)$ as a flavour symmetry are reviewed and a connection between two descriptions of Standard Model symmetries, one based on the normed division algebras and the other describing elementary matter as braided objects, is presented.
