According to recent observations, the Dark Energy would represent 70% of the content of our Universe. The most popular way to account for this Dark Energy make use of the Cosmological Constant introduced by Einstein. However, some uncertainty remain about the theoretical value this constant should have. Alternate approaches have to introduce a fluid whose pressure would be negative. In this paper, we present unusual particles which could form a gas with positive thermodynamical pressure, while presenting all the gravitational characteristics of Dark Energy.
