Here we discuss the presence of CPT-even Lorentz violation (LV) in the presence of a deformed Heisenberg algebra that leads to a minimum length (ML). We consider the case of a Maxwell lagrangian modified by the presence of a $K_{F}$ CPT-even LV theory and ML. We then derive a set of modified Maxwell equations in the cases of LV and ML and only ML. We verified that in the case of electromagnetic waves in the vacuum the presence of ML does not change the consequences of LV. On the other hand, in a material media ML changes the whole set of equations that can lead to important effects with respect to the usual equations. We also considered the more general case including LV and the modified equations in terms of matter fields. We then derived the refractive index as a function of the matter fields depending on LV and ML, and in particular we showed the behaviour of the refractive index with respect to the non-commutative parameter.
