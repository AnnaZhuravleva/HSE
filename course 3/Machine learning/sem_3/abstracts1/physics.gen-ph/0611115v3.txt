An ensemble of pure numbers of order near 10^122 is produced naturally from the fundamental parameters of modern cosmology. This new large-number coincidence problem is resolved by demonstrating implicit physical connections that follow from the standard cosmological model. However, the occurrence of the new large-number coincidence combined with the known coincidence among pure numbers of order near 10^40 poses a distinct problem that is resolved with a scaling law for the cosmological constant that was originally proposed by Zel'dovich.
