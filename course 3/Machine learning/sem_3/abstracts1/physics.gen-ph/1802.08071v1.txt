The mainstream textbooks of quantum mechanics explains the quantum state collapses into an eigenstate in the measurement, while other explanations such as hidden variables and multi-universe deny the collapsing. Here we propose an ideal thinking experiment on measuring the spin of an electron with 3 steps. It is simple and straightforward, in short, to measure a spin-up electron in x-axis, and then in z-axis. Whether there is a collapsing predicts different results of the experiment. The future realistic experiment will show the quantum state collapses or not in the measurement.
