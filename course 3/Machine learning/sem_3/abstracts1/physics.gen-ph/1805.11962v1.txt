In this paper we study the modification of thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in the framework of generalized uncertainty principle with correction terms upto fourth order in momentum uncertainty. The mass-temperature relation and the heat capacity for these black holes have been investigated. These have been used to obtain the critical and remnant masses. The entropy expression using this generalized uncertainty principle reveals the area law upto leading order logarithmic corrections and subleading corrections of the form $\frac{1}{A^n}$. The mass output and radiation rate using Stefan-Boltzmann law have been computed which show deviations from the standard case and the case with the simplest form for the generalized uncertainty principle.
