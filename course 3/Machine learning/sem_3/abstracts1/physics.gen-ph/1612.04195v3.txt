We propose a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics with three parameters. Born-Infeld electrodynamics and exponential electrodynamics are particular cases of this model. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is studied. We show that there is not singularity of the electric field at the origin of point-like charged particles. The corrections to Coulomb's law at $r\rightarrow\infty$ are obtained. We calculate the total electrostatic energy of charges for different parameters of the model which is finite.
