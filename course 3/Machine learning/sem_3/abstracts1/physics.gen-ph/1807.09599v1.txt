In this paper, we extend our previous discussion on ontological determinism, non-locality and quantum mechanics to that of the Sarfatti post-quantum mechanics perspective. We examine the nature of quantum equilibrium and non-equilibrium and uncertainty following the Sarfatti description of this theoretical development, which serves to extend the statistical linear unitary quantum mechanics for closed systems to a locally-retrocausal, non-statistical, non-linear, non-unitary theory for open systems. We discuss how the Bohmian quantum potential has a dependence upon the position of its Bell beable and how Complexity mathematics describes the self-organizing feedback between the quantum potential and its beable allowing nonlocal communication.
