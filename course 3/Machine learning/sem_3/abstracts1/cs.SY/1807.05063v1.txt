In this note we develop the theory of the quantum Pontryagin principle for continuous measurements and feedback. The analysis is carried out under the assumption of compatible events in the output channel. The plant is a quantum system, which generally is in a mixed state, coupled to a continuous measurement channel. The Pontryagin Maximum Principle is derived in both the Schr\"{o}dinger picture and Heisenberg picture, in particular in statistical moment coordinates. To avoid solving stochastic equations we derive a LQG scheme which is more suitable for control purposes.
