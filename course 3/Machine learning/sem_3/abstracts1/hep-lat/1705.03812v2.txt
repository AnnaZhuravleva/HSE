Beyond perturbation theory the number of gauge copies drastically increases due to the Gribov-Singer ambiguity. Any way of treating them defines, in principle, a new, non-perturbative gauge, and the gauge-dependent correlation functions can vary between them. Herein various such gauges will be constructed as completions of the Landau gauge inside the first Gribov region. The dependence of the propagators and the running coupling on these gauges will be studied for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in two, three, and four dimensions using lattice gauge theory, and for a wide range of lattice parameters. While the gluon propagator is rather insensitive to the choice, the ghost propagator and the running coupling show a stronger dependence. It is also found that the influence of lattice artifacts is larger than in minimal Landau gauge.
