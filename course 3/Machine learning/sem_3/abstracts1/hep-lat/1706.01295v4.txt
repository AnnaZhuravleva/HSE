We present lattice results for the isovector unpolarized parton distribution with nonperturbative RI/MOM-scheme renormalization on the lattice. In the framework of large-momentum effective field theory (LaMET), the full Bjorken-$x$ dependence of a momentum-dependent quasi-distribution is calculated on the lattice and matched to the ordinary lightcone parton distribution at one-loop order, with power corrections included. The important step of RI/MOM renormalization that connects the lattice and continuum matrix elements is detailed in this paper. A few consequences of the results are also addressed here.
