The mass-preconditioning (MP) technique has become a standard tool to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid Monte-Carlo simulation (HMC) of lattice QCD with dynamical quarks, for 2-flavors QCD with degenerate quark masses, as well as its extension to the case of one-flavor by taking the square-root of the fermion determinant of 2-flavors with degenerate masses. However, for lattice QCD with domain-wall fermion, the fermion determinant of any single fermion flavor can be expressed as a functional integral with an exact pseudofermion action $ \phi^\dagger H^{-1} \phi $, where $ H^{-1} $ is a positive-definite Hermitian operator without taking square-root, and with the chiral structure \cite{Chen:2014hyy}. Consequently, the mass-preconditioning for the exact one-flavor action (EOFA) does not necessarily follow the conventional (old) MP pattern. In this paper, we present a new mass-preconditioning for the EOFA, which is more efficient than the old MP which we have used in Refs. \cite{Chen:2014hyy,Chen:2014bbc}. We perform numerical tests in lattice QCD with $ N_f = 1 $ and $ N_f = 1+1+1+1 $ optimal domain-wall quarks, with one mass-preconditioner applied to one of the exact one-flavor actions, and we find that the efficiency of the new MP is more than 20\% higher than that of the old MP.
