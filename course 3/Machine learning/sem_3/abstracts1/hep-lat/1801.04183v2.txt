Supersymmetric models with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking suffer from the notorious sign problem in stochastic approaches. By contrast, the tensor network approaches do not have such a problem since they are based on deterministic procedures. In this work, we present a tensor network formulation of the two-dimensional lattice $\mathcal{N}=1$ Wess-Zumino model while showing that numerical results agree with the exact solutions for the free case.
