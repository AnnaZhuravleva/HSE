We present results of the eigenvalue spectrum for the staggered Dir\"ac operator obtained using a modified Lanczos algorithm. We identify zero modes and non-zero modes. We derive the chiral Ward identity derived from the conserved $U(1)_A$ symmetry, and check it numerically. This is the first step toward construction of an improved method to identify zero modes reliably with staggered fermions.
