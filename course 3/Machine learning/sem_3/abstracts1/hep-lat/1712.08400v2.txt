We present preliminary results from a lattice calculation of tetraquark states in the charm and bottom sector of the type $ud\bar{b}\bar{b}$, $us\bar{b}\bar{b}$, $ud\bar{c}\bar{c}$ and $sc\bar{b}\bar{b}$. These calculations are performed on $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ MILC ensembles with lattice spacing of $a = 0.12~\mathrm{fm} $ and $a=0.06~\mathrm{fm} $. A relativistic action with overlap fermions is employed for the light and charm quarks while a non-relativistic action with non-perturbatively improved coefficients is used in the bottom sector. Preliminary results provide a clear indication of presence of energy levels below the relevant thresholds of different tetraquark states. While in double charm sector we find shallow bound levels, our results suggest deeply bound levels with double bottom tetraquarks.
