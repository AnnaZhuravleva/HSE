We study correlation functions of spatially separated static quark-antiquark pairs in 2+1 flavor QCD in order to investigate onset and nature of color screening at high temperatures. We perform lattice calculations in a wide temperature range, $140\,{\rm MeV}\le T \le 5814\,{\rm MeV}$, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action and several lattice spacings to control discretization effects. By comparing at high temperatures our lattice results to weak-coupling calculations as well as to the zero temperature result for the energy of a static quark-antiquark pair, we observe that color screening sets in at $rT \approx 0.3$. Furthermore, we also observe that in the range $0.3 \lesssim r T \lesssim 0.6$ weak-coupling calculations in the framework of suitable effective field theories provide an adequate picture of color screening.
