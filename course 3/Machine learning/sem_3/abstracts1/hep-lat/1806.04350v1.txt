It has become increasingly important to include one or more individual flavours of dynamical fermion in lattice QCD simulations. This is due in part to the advent of QCD+QED calculations, where isospin symmetry breaking means that the up, down, and strange quarks must be treated separately. These single-flavour pseudofermions are typically implemented as rational approximations to the inverse of the fermion matrix, using the technique known as Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo (RHMC). Over the years, a wide range of methods have been developed for accelerating simulations of two degenerate flavours of pseudofermion, while there are comparatively fewer such techniques for single-flavour pseudofermions. Here, we investigate two different filtering methods that can be applied to RHMC for simulating single-flavour pseudofermions, namely polynomial filtering (PF-RHMC), and filtering via truncations of the ordered product (tRHMC). A novel integration step-size tuning technique based on the characteristic scale is also introduced. Studies are performed on two different lattice volumes, demonstrating that one can achieve significant reductions in the computational cost of single-flavour simulations with these filtering techniques.
