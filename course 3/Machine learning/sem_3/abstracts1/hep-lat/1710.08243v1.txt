We consider QCD at strong coupling with scalar quarks coupled to a chemical potential. Performing the link integrals we present a diagrammatic representation of the path integral weight. It is based on mesonic and baryonic building blocks, in close analogy to fermionic QCD. Likewise, the baryon loops are subject to a manifest conservation of the baryon number. The sign problem is expected to disappear in this representation and we do confirm this for three flavors, where a scalar baryon can be built and thus a dependence on the chemical potential occurs. For higher flavor number we analyse examples for a potential sign problem in the baryon sector and conjecture that all weights are positive upon exploring the current conservation of each flavor.
