In the investigation of in-medium modifications of quarkonia and for determining heavy quark diffusion coefficients, correlation functions play a crucial role. For the first time we perform a continuum extrapolation of charmonium and bottomonium correlators in the vector channel based on non-perturbatively clover-improved Wilson fermions in quenched lattice QCD. Calculations were done at 4 different lattice spacings, spatial extents between 96 and 192, aspect ratio from 1/6 to 1/2, for 5 temperatures between $T/T_c = 0.75$ and $T/T_c = 2.2$. We interpolate between different quark masses to match to the same vector meson mass over different lattice setups. Afterwards we extrapolate the renormalized correlators to the continuum. While we find a strong temperature dependence for charmonium, bottomonium states are only slightly affected at higher temperatures.
