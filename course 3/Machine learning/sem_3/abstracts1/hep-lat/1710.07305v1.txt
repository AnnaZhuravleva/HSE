Several important observables, like the quark condensate and the Taylor coefficients of the expansion of the QCD pressure with respect to the chemical potential, are based on the trace of the inverse Dirac operator and of its powers. Such traces are traditionally estimated with "noise vectors" sandwiching the operator. We explore alternative approaches based on polynomial approximations of the inverse Dirac operator.
