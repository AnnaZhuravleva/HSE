Mass-split systems based on a conformal infrared fixed point provide a low-energy effective description of beyond the standard model systems with large scale separation. We report results of exploratory investigations with four light and eight heavy flavors using staggered fermions, and up to five different values for the light flavor mass, five different heavy flavor masses, and two values of the bare gauge coupling.
