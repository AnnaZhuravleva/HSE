It is argued that at the small coupling limit ($g\ll 1$) of pure U(1) lattice gauge theories the lowest energy behaves as $E_0\!\propto\!\! - g^2$ while the higher ones as $E_{k\neq }\!\propto\! g^2$. The behavior is based on the Ostrogradsky construction for Hamiltonian formulation of theories with higher-order time-derivatives, applied to the continuum limit of lattice theories. Among the normalizations of the form $1/g^\alpha$ in the definition of the transfer-matrix of 1+1 dimensional theory only the choice $\alpha=1$ is compatible with the expected behaviors.
