We present our recent results of baryon interactions with strangeness $S=-1$ based on Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) correlation functions calculated from lattice QCD with almost physical quark masses corresponding to $(m_\pi,m_K)\approx(146,525)$ MeV and large volume $(La)^4=(96a)^4\approx$ (8.1 fm)$^4$. In order to perform a comprehensive study of baryon interactions, a large number of NBS correlation functions from NN to $\Xi\Xi$ are calculated simultaneously by using large scale computer resources. In this contribution, we focus on the strangeness $S=-1$ channels of the hyperon interactions by means of HAL QCD method. Four sets of three potentials (the $^3S_1-^3D_1$ central, $^3S_1-^3D_1$ tensor, and the $^1S_0$ central potentials) are presented for the $\Sigma N - \Sigma N$ (the isospin $I=3/2$) diagonal, the $\Lambda N - \Lambda N$ diagonal, the $\Lambda N \rightarrow \Sigma N$ transition, and the $\Sigma N - \Sigma N$ ($I=1/2$) diagonal interactions. Scattering phase shifts for $\Sigma N$ $(I=3/2)$ system are presented.
