Building upon our recent study arXiv:1709.04325, we investigate the feasibility to calculate the pion distribution amplitude (DA) from suitably chosen Euclidean correlation functions at large momentum. We demonstrate in this work the advantage of analysing several correlation functions simultaneously and extracting the pion DA from a global fit. This approach also allows us to study higher twist corrections which are a major source of systematic error. Our result for the higher twist parameter $\delta^\pi_2$ is in good agreement with estimates from QCD sum rules. Another novel element is the use of all-to-all propagators, calculated using stochastic estimators, which enables an additional volume average of the correlation functions, thereby reducing statistical errors.
