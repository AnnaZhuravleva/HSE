We propose a method to calculate scattering amplitudes using the Bethe-Salpeter wave function inside the interaction range on the lattice. As an exploratory study of this method, we evaluate a scattering length of $I=2$ S-wave two pions by use of the on-shell scattering amplitude. Our result is confirmed to be consistent with the value obtained from the conventional finite volume method. The half off-shell scattering amplitude is also evaluated.
