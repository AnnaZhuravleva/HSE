We present a study of the finite density lattice Thirring model in 1+1 dimensions using the world-line/fermion-bag algorithm. The model has features similar to QCD and provides a test case for exploring the accuracy of various methods of solving sign problems. In the massless limit and with open boundary conditions we show that the sign problem is an artifact of the auxiliary field approach and is completely eliminated in the fermion bag approach. With periodic boundary conditions the sign problem is mild in the fermion bag method. We present accurate results for various quantities in the model that can be used as a benchmark for comparison with other methods of solving sign problems.
