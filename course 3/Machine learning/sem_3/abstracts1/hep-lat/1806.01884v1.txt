Recently, a convergent series employing a non-Gaussian initial approximation was constructed and shown to be an effective computational tool for the finite size lattice models with a polynomial interaction. Here we numerically examine the applicability of the convergent series method to models defined on infinite lattices. The comparison of the convergent series computations and the infinite lattice extrapolations of the Monte Carlo simulations reveals an agreement between two approaches.
