We report on the status of ongoing investigations aiming at locating the deconfinement critical point with standard Wilson fermions and $N_f=2$ flavors towards the continuum limit (standard Columbia plot); locating the tricritical masses at imaginary chemical potential with unimproved staggered fermions at $N_f=2$ (extended Columbia plot); identifying the order of the chiral phase transition at $\mu=0$ for $N_f=2$ via extrapolation from non integer $N_f$ (alternative Columbia plot).
