We present the energy spectra of the low lying doubly charmed baryons using lattice quantum chromodynamics. We precisely predict the ground state mass of the charmed-strange Omega(cc)(1/2+) baryon to be 3712(10)(12) MeV which could well be the next doubly charmed baryon to be discovered at the LHCb experiment at CERN. We also predict masses of other doubly charmed-strange baryons with quantum numbers 3/2+, 1/2-, and 3/2-.
