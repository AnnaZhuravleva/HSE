We evaluate the spin-$3/2 \to$ spin-$1/2$ electromagnetic transitions of the doubly charmed baryons on 2+1 flavor, $32^3 \times 64$ PACS-CS lattices with a pion mass of $156(9)$ MeV. A relativistic heavy quark action is employed to minimize the systematic errors on charm-quark observables. We extract the magnetic dipole, $M1$, and the electric quadrupole, $E2$, transition form factors. We find that the $M1$ transition is dominant and light degrees of freedom ($u/d$- or $s$-quark) play the leading role. $E2$ form factors, on the other hand, are found to be negligibly small, which in turn, has minimal effect on the helicity and transition amplitudes. We predict the decay widths and lifetimes of $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast +,++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{\ast +}$ based on our results. Differences in kinematical and dynamical factors with respect to the $N\gamma\to\Delta$ transition is discussed. A comparison to $\Omega_c \gamma \rightarrow \Omega_c^\ast$ transition and a discussion on systematic errors related to the choice of heavy quark action are also given.
