We present the unpolarized and helicity parton distribution functions calculated within lattice QCD simulations using physical values of the light quark mass. Non-perturbative renormalization is employed and the lattice data are converted to the MSbar-scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. A matching process is applied together with target mass corrections leading to the reconstruction of light-cone parton distribution functions. For both cases we find a similar behavior between the lattice and phenomenological data, and for the polarized PDF a nice overlap for a range of Bjorken-x values. This presents a major success for the emerging field of direct calculations of quark distributions using lattice QCD.
