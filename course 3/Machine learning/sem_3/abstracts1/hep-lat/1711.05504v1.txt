The introduction of a space-time lattice as a regulator of field theories breaks symmetries associated with continuous space-time, i.e.\ Poincar{\'e} invariance and supersymmetry. A non-zero gluino mass in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory causes an additional soft breaking of supersymmetry. We employ the lattice form of SUSY Ward identities, imposing that their continuum form would be recovered when removing the lattice regulator, to obtain the critical hopping parameter where broken symmetries can be recovered.
