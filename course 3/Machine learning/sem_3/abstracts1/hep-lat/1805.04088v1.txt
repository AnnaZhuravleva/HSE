In this talk I present the formalism we have used to analyze Lattice data on two meson systems by means of effective field theories. In particular I present the results obtained from a reanalysis of the lattice data on the $KD^{(*)}$ systems, where the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2460)$ are found as bound states of $KD$ and $KD^*$, respectively. We confirm the presence of such states in the lattice data and determine the contribution of the $KD$ channel in the wave function of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and that of $KD^*$ in the wave function of $D^*_{s1}(2460)$. Our findings indicate a large meson-meson component in the two cases.
