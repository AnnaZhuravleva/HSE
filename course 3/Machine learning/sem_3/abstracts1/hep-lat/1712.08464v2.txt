An explicit expression for the finite-volume energy shift of shallow three-body bound states for non-identical particles is obtained in the unitary limit. The inclusion of the higher partial waves is considered. To this end, the method of arXiv:1412.4969 (Mei{\ss}ner et al.) is generalized for the case of unequal masses and arbitrary angular momenta. It is shown that in the S-wave and in the equal mass limit, the result from arXiv:1412.4969 is reproduced.
