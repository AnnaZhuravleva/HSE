We present the first chiral-continuum extrapolated up, down and strange quark spin contribution to the proton spin using lattice QCD. We use eleven ensembles of 2+1+1-flavors of Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) generated by the MILC collaboration. They cover 4 lattice spacings covering \{0.15,0.12,0.09,0.06\} fm and two are at the physical pion mass. High-statistics estimates on each ensemble allow us to quantify systematic uncertainties and perform a simultaneous chiral-continnum extrapolation in the lattice spacing and light-quark masses. Our final results are $\Delta u \equiv \langle 1 \rangle_{\Delta u^+} = 0.777(25)$, $\Delta d \equiv \langle 1 \rangle_{\Delta d^+} = -0.438(18)$, and $\Delta s \equiv \langle 1 \rangle_{\Delta s^+} = -0.053(8)$, adding up to a total quark contribution to proton spin of $\sum_{q=u,d,s} (\frac{1}{2} \Delta q) = 0.143(31)(29)$. They are obtained without model assumptions and are in good agreement with the recent COMPASS analysis $0.13 < \frac{1}{2} \Delta \Sigma < 0.18$, and with the $\Delta q$ obtained from various global analyses of polarized beam or target data.
