Simulations at physical quark masses are affected by the critical slowing down of the solvers. Multigrid preconditioning has proved to deal effectively with this problem. Multigrid accelerated simulations at the physical value of the pion mass are being performed to generate $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 2 + 1 + 1$ gauge ensembles using twisted mass fermions. The adaptive aggregation-based domain decomposition multigrid solver, referred to as DD-$\alpha$AMG method, is employed for these simulations. Our simulation strategy consists of an hybrid approach of different solvers, involving the Conjugate Gradient (CG), multi-mass-shift CG and DD-$\alpha$AMG solvers. We present an analysis of the multigrid performance during the simulations discussing the stability of the method. This significant speeds up the Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation by more than a factor $4$ at physical pion mass compared to the usage of the CG solver.
