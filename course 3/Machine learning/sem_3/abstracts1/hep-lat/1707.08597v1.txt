Using the Sigma model to explore the lowest order pseudo-scalar spectrum with SU(3) breaking, this talk considers an additional exact "taste" symmetry to mimic species doubling. Rooting replicas of a valid approach such as Wilson fermions reproduces the desired physical spectrum. In contrast, extra symmetries of the rooted staggered approach leave spurious states and a flavor dependent taste multiplicity.
