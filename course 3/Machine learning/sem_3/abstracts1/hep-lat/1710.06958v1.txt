Simulating thimble regularization of lattice field theory can be tricky when more than one thimble is to be taken into account. A couple of years ago we proposed a solution for this problem. More recently this solution proved to be effective in the case of 0+1 dimensional QCD. A few lessons we can learnt, including the role of symmetries and general hints on algorithmic solutions.
