We present an update on our results of nucleon form factors measured on a large-volume lattice $(8.1\rm{fm})^4$ at almost the physical point in 2+1 flavor QCD. The configurations are generated with the stout-smeared $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved Wilson quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $\beta = 1.82$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing of 0.085 fm. The pion mass at the simulation point is about 145 MeV. We determine the iso- vector electric radius and magnetic moment from nucleon electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors. We also report on preliminary results of the axial-vector ($F_A$), induced pseudo-scalar ($F_P$) and pseudo-scalar ($G_P$) form factors in order to verify the axial Ward- Takahashi identity in terms of the nucleon matrix elements, which may be called as the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation.
