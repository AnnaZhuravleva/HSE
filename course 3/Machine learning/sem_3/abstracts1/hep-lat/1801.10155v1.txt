We examined the instanton contribution to the QCD configurations generated from lattice QCD for $N_F=0$, $N_F=2+1$ and $N_F=2+1+1$ dynamical quark flavors from two different and complementary approaches. First via the use of Gradient flow, we computed instanton liquid properties using an algorithm to localize instantons in the gauge field configurations and studied their evolution with flow time. Then, the analysis of the running at low momenta of gluon Green's functions serves as an independent confirmation of the instanton density which can also be derived without the use of the Gradient flow.
