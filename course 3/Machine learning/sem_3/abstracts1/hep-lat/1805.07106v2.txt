We present lattice calculations of the equation of state of pure SU($2$) gauge theory. The scale-setting of lattice parameters has been carried by using the gradient flow. We propose a reference scale $t_0$ for the SU($2$) gauge theory satisfying $t^2 \langle E \rangle|_{t=t_0} =0.1$. This reference value is fixed by a natural scaling-down of the standard $t_0$-scale for the SU($3$) based on perturbative analyses. We also show the thermodynamic quantities as a function of $T/T_c$, which are derived by the energy-momentum tensor using the small flow-time expansion of the gradient flow.
