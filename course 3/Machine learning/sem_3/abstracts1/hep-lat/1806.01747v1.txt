Motivated by our previous study of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model for non minimal twists, we re-examined the behaviour of the reduced version of the two dimensional principal chiral model. We show that this single matrix model reproduces the same features as the standard lattice model. In particular, scaling towards the continuum limit, the correct value of the internal energy, the magnetic susceptibility and the mass gap. Given our capacity to reach larger values of $N$, we use the reduced model to study the nature and properties of its large $N$ phase transition existing at intermediate coupling. We conclude that the transition is of first order
