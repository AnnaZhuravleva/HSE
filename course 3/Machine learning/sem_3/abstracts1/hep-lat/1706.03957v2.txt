Lattice models with complex actions are important for the understanding of matter at finite densities, but not accessible by the standard Monte Carlo techniques due to the sign problem. Here we derive a new approach for avoiding the complex action/sign problem, by extending the method of convergent series with a non-Gaussian initial approximation. The main features of the new series are demonstrated on the example of the two dimensional oscillating integral.
