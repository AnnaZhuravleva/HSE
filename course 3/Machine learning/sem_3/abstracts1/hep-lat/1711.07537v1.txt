We study the topological charge in $N_f=2$ QCD at finite temperature using M\"obius domain-wall fermions. The susceptibility $\chi_t$ of the topological charge defined either by the index of overlap Dirac operator or a gluonic operator is investigated at several values of temperature $T\ (>T_c)$ varying the quark mass. A strong suppression of the susceptibility is observed below a certain value of the quark mass. The relation with the restoration of $U_A(1)$ is discussed.
