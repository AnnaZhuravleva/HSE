Lattice computations are the only first principle method capable of quantitatively assessing the topological properties of QCD at high temperature, however the numerical determination of the topological properties of QCD, especially in the high temperature phase, is a notoriously difficult problem. We will discuss the difficulties encountered in such a computation and some strategies that have been proposed to avoid (or at least to alleviate) them.
