Renormalization constants (RCs) of overlap quark bilinear operators on 2+1-flavor domain wall fermion configurations are calculated by using the RI/MOM and RI/SMOM schemes. The scale independent RC for the axial vector current is computed by using a Ward identity. Then the RCs for the quark field and the vector, tensor, scalar and pseudoscalar operators are calculated in both the RI/MOM and RI/SMOM schemes. The RCs are converted to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme and we compare the numerical results from using the two intermediate schemes. The lattice size is $48^3\times96$ and the inverse spacing $1/a = 1.730(4) {\rm~GeV}$.
