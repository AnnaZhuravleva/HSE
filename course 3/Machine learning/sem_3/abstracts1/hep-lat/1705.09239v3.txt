In this comment, we address a number of erroneous discussions and conclusions presented in a recent preprint by the HALQCD collaboration, arXiv:1703.07210. In particular, we demonstrate that lattice QCD determinations of bound states at quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 806$ MeV are robust, and that the phases shifts extracted by the NPLQCD collaboration for these systems pass all of the 'sanity checks' introduced in arXiv:1703.07210.
