This article reports on the detailed study of the three-gluon vertex in four-dimensional $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory employing lattice simulations with large physical volumes and high statistics. A meticulous scrutiny of the so-called symmetric and asymmetric kinematical configurations is performed and it is shown that the associated form-factor changes sign at a given range of momenta. The lattice results are compared to the model independent predictions of Schwinger-Dyson equations and a very good agreement among the two is found.
