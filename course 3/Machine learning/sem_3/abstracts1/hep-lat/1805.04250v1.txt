We study the finite-volume correction on the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon g-2 in lattice QCD at physical pion mass using two different volumes: $(5.4~{\rm fm})^4$ and $(8.1~{\rm fm})^4$. We use an optimized AMA technique for noise reduction on $N_f=2+1$ PACS gauge configurations with clover-Wilson fermion action and stout-smeared gluon action at a single lattice cut-off $a^{-1}=2.33$ GeV. The calculation is performed for the quark-connected light-quark contribution in the isospin symmetric limit. We take into account the effects of backward propagating states by extending a temporal boundary condition. In addition we study a quark-mass correction to tune to the exactly same physical pion mass on different volume and compare its correction with chiral perturbation.
