In this note we reexamine the possibility of extracting parton distribution functions from lattice simulations. We discuss the case of quasi-parton distribution functions, the more recent proposal of directly trying to compute the current-current $T$-product on the lattice and the possibility of making reference to the reduced Ioffe-time distribution. We show that the process of renormalization hindered by lattice momenta limitation represent an obstruction to a direct Euclidean calculation of the parton distribution function.
