We perform the Monte Carlo study of the SU(3) non-Abelian Higgs model, which is the Ginzburg-Landau effective theory of dense quark matters. We discuss phase structure and non-Abelian vortices by gauge invariant operators. External magnetic fields induce non-Abelian vortices in the color-flavor locked phase. The spatial distribution of non-Abelian vortices suggests the repulsive vortex-vortex interaction.
