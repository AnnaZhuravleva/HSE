We introduce a method to investigate the static and dynamic properties of both Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge models in 1+1 dimensions. Specifically, we identify a set of transformations that disentangle different degrees of freedom, and apply a simple Gaussian variational ansatz to the resulting Hamiltonian. To demonstrate the suitability of the method, we analyze both static and dynamic aspects of string breaking for the U(1) and SU(2) gauge models. We benchmark our results against tensor network simulations and observe excellent agreement, although the number of variational parameters in the Gaussian ansatz is much smaller.
