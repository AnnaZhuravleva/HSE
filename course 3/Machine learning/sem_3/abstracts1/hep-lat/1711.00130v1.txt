Results are reported for the beta-function of weakly coupled conformal gauge theories on the lattice, SU(3) with Nf=14 fundamental and Nf=3 sextet fermions. The models are chosen to be close to the upper end of the conformal window where perturbation theory is reliable hence a fixed point is expected. The study serves as a test of how well lattice methods perform in the weakly coupled conformal cases. We also comment on the 5-loop beta-function of two models close to the lower end of the conformal window, SU(3) with Nf=12 fundamental and Nf=2 sextet fermions.
