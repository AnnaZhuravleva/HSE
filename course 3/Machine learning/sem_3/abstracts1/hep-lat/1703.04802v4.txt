The gradient flow and its small flow-time expansion provide a very versatile method to represent renormalized composite operators in a regularization-independent manner. This technique has been utilized to construct typical Noether currents such as the energy--momentum tensor and the axial-vector current in lattice gauge theory. In this paper, we apply the same technique to the supercurrent in the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang--Mills theory (4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM) in the Wess--Zumino gauge. Since this approach provides a priori a representation of the properly normalized conserved supercurrent, our result should be useful, e.g., in lattice numerical simulations of the 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM; the conservation of the so-constructed supercurrent can be used as a criterion for the supersymmetric point toward which the gluino mass is tuned.
