Nucleon-structure calculations of isovector vector- and axialvector-current form factors, transversity and scalar charge, and quark momentum and helicity fractions are reported from two recent 2+1-flavor dynamical domain-wall fermions lattice-QCD ensembles generated jointly by the RIKEN-BNL-Columbia and UKQCD Collaborations with Iwasaki $\times$ dislocation-suppressing-determinatn-ratio gauge action at inverse lattice spacing of 1.378(7) GeV and pion mass values of 249.4(3) and 172.3(3) MeV.
