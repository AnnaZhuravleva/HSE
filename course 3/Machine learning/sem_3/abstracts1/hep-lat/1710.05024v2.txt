We calculate the Equation of State at high temperatures in 2+1 flavor QCD using the highly improved staggered quark action. We study the lattice spacing dependence of the pressure at high temperatures using lattices with temporal extent $N_{\tau}=6,~8,~10$ and $12$ and perform continuum extrapolations. We also give a continuum estimate for the Equation of State up to temperatures $T=2$ GeV, which are then compared with results of the weak-coupling calculations. We find a reasonably good agreement with the weak-coupling calculations at the highest temperatures.
