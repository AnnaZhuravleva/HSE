We present results from two projects on lattice calculations for the Higgs-Yukawa model. First we report progress on the search of first-order thermal phase transitions in the presence of a dimension-six operator, with the choices of bare couplings that lead to viable phenomenological predictions. In this project the simulations are performed using overlap fermions to implement the required chiral symmetry. Secondly, our study for applying finite-size scaling techniques near the Gaussian fixed point of the Higgs-Yukawa model is presented. We discuss the analytical formulae for the Higgs Yukawa model and show results for a first numerical study in the pure $O(4)$ scalar sector of the theory.
