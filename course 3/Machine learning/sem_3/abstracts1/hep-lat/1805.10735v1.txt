It is believed that the two-dimensional massless $\mathcal{N}=2$ Wess--Zumino model becomes the $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) in the infrared (IR) limit. We examine this theoretical conjecture of the Landau--Ginzburg (LG) description of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT by numerical simulations on the basis of a supersymmetric-invariant momentum-cutoff regularization. We study a single supermultiplet with cubic and quartic superpotentials. From two-point correlation functions in the IR region, we measure the scaling dimension and the central charge, which are consistent with the conjectured LG description of the $A_2$ and $A_3$ minimal models, respectively. Our result supports the theoretical conjecture and, at the same time, indicates a possible computational method of correlation functions in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT from the LG description.
