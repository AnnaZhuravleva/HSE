Using complex stochastic quantization, we implement a particle-number projection technique on the partition function of spin-1/2 fermions at finite temperature on the lattice. We discuss the method, its application towards obtaining the thermal properties of finite Fermi systems in three spatial dimensions, and results for the first five virial coefficients of one-dimensional, attractively interacting fermions.
