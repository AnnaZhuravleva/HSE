We present the first direct determination of meson-baryon resonance parameters from a scattering amplitude calculated using lattice QCD. In particular, we calculate the elastic $I=3/2$, $p$-wave nucleon-pion amplitude on a single ensemble of $N_{\mathrm{f}}=2+1$ Wilson-clover fermions with $m_{\pi}=280\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m_{K}=460\mathrm{MeV}$. At these quark masses, the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance pole is found close to the $N-\pi$ threshold and a Breit-Wigner fit to the amplitude gives $g^{\mathrm{BW}}_{\Delta N\pi}=19.0(4.7)$ in agreement with phenomenological determinations.
