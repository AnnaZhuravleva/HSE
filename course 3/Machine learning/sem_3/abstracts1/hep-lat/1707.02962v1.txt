We investigate the implications of Nambu-Goto (NG), L\"uscher-Weisz (LW) and Polyakov-Kleinert (PK) string actions for the Casimir energy and the width of the quantum delocalization of the string at two loop order. We focus our numerical study on the 4-dim pure $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory at two temperature scales near the deconfinement point. The region under scrutiny is the long and the intermediate source separation distance before the string breaks in full QCD. The numerical data corresponding to the quark-antiquark ($Q\bar{Q}$) potential and the width profile of the color tube are found to match the leading order free string predictions at the temperature near the end of QCD plateau. However, at a temperature near to the critical point, we found that the next to leading order (NLO) contributions of the self-interacting (NG) string, boundary terms in (LW) string action in addition to the term proportional to the extrinsic curvature in (PK) string action to yield a static potential and broadening profile that is in a good agreement with the lattice data at the intermediate and long distances scales. The string's self-interactions account for the suppressed broadening of the width and the geometrical features along the string profile in the intermediate distance.
