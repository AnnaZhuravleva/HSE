As a first step in the study of $\mathrm{Sp}(2N)$ composite Higgs models, we obtained a set of novel numerical results for the pure gauge $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ lattice theory in 3+1 space-time dimensions. Results for the continuum extrapolations of the string tension and the glueball mass spectrum are presented and their values are compared with the same quantities in neighbouring $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ models.
