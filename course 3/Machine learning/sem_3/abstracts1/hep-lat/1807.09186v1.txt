We show that the Polyakov loop of the two-dimensional lattice Abelian Higgs model can be calculated using the tensor renormalization group approach. We check the accuracy of the results using standard Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the energy gap produced by the insertion of the Polyakov loop obeys universal finite-size scaling which persists in the time continuum limit. We briefly discuss the relevance of these results for quantum simulations.
