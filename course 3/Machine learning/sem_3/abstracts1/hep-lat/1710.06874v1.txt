In this talk I present the current status of a precise first-principles calculation of the quark connected, quark disconnected, and leading QED and strong isospin-breaking contributions to the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations. The lattice data is also combined with experimental $e^+ e^-$ scattering data, consistency between the two datasets is checked, and a combined result with smaller error than the lattice data and $e^+ e^-$ scattering data individually is presented.
