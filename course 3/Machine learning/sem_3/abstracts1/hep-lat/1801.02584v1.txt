We study numerically the chromoelectric-chromomagnetic asymmetry of the dimension two gluon condensate as well as the longitudinal gluon propagator at $T\simeq T_c$ in the Landau-gauge $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that substantial correlation between the asymmetry and the Polyakov loop as well as the correlation between the longitudinal propagator and the Polyakov loop pave the way to studies of the critical behavior of the asymmetry and the longitudinal propagator. The respective values of critical exponents and amplitudes are evaluated.
