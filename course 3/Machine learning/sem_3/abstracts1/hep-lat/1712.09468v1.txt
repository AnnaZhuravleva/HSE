In this talk I present the results obtained using effective field theories in a finite volume from a reanalysis of lattice data on the $KD^{(*)}$ systems, where bound states of $KD$ and $KD^*$ are found and associated with the states $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and $D^*_{s1}(2460)$, respectively. We confirm the presence of such states on the lattice data and determine the weight of the $KD$ channel in the wave function of $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ and that of $KD^*$ in the wave function of $D^*_{s1}(2460)$. Our results indicate a large meson-meson component in both cases.
