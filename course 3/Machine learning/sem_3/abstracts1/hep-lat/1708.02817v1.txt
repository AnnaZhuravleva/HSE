In this letter we explore the perspectives for canonical simulations in the worldline formulation of a lattice field theory. Using the charged $\phi^4$ field in two dimensions as an example we present the details of the canonical formulation based on worldlines and outline algorithmic strategies for canonical worldline simulations. We discuss the steps for converting the data from the canonical approach to the grand canonical picture which we use for cross-checking our results. The canonical approach presented here can easily be generalized to other lattice field theories with a worldline representation.
