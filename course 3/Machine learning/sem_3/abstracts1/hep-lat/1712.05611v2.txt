The color structure of the gluon field magnetic mass is investigated in the lattice SU(2) gluodynamics. To realize that, the interaction between the field of the monopole-antimonopole string and an external Abelian chromomagnetic field is considered. It is found that the presence of the Abelian constant chromomagnetic field does not influence the magnetic mass of the field of the string. This means, that nonzero magnetic mass is produced for the non-Abelian field components, only. Also this confirms the zero magnetic mass of the Abelian field.
