We study the energy-momentum tensor and the equation of state as well as the chiral condensate in (2+1)-flavor QCD at the physical point applying the method of Makino and Suzuki based on the gradient flow. We adopt a nonperturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson quark action and the renormalization group-improved Iwasaki gauge action. At Lattice 2016, we have presented our preliminary results of our study in (2+1)-flavor QCD at a heavy u, d quark mass point. We now extend the study to the physical point and perform finite-temperature simulations in the range T \simeq 155--544 MeV (Nt = 4--14 including odd Nt's) at a \simeq 0.09 fm. We show our final results of the heavy QCD study and present some preliminary results obtained at the physical point so far.
