The completeness of some classical statistical mechanical (SM) models is a recent result that has been developed by quantum formalism for the partition functions. In this paper, we consider a 2D classical $\phi^4$ filed theory whose completeness has been proved in [V. Karimipour and et al, Phys. Rev. A 85, 032316]. We give a general systematic proof for the completeness of such a model where, by a few simple steps, we show how the partition function of an arbitrary classical field theory can be derived from a 2D classical $\phi^4$ model. To this end, we start from various classical field theories containing models on arbitrary lattices and also $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories. Then we convert them to a new classical field model on a non-planar bipartite graph with imaginary kinetic terms. After that, we show that any polynomial function of the field in the corresponding Hamiltonian can approximately be converted to a $\phi^4$ term by adding enough numbers of vertices to the bipartite graph. In the next step, we give a few graphical transformations to convert the final non-planar graph to a 2D rectangular lattice. We also show that the number of vertices which should be added grows polynomially with the number of vertices in the original model.
