The leptonic decay of the charged pion in the presence of background magnetic fields is investigated using quenched Wilson fermions. It is demonstrated that the magnetic field opens up a new channel for this decay. The magnetic field-dependence of the decay constants for both the ordinary and the new channel is determined. Using these inputs from QCD, we calculate the total decay rate perturbatively.
