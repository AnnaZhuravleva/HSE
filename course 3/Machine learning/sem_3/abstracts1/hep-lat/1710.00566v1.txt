We investigate the fate of baryons made out of u, d and s quarks in the hadronic gas and the quark-gluon plasma, using nonperturbative lattice simulations, employing the FASTSUM anisotropic Nf=2+1 ensembles. In the confined phase a strong temperature dependence is seen in the masses of the negative-parity groundstates, while the positive-parity groundstate masses are approximately temperature independent, within the error. At high temperature parity doubling emerges. A noticeable effect of the heavier s quark is seen. We give a simple description of the medium-dependent masses for the negative-parity states and speculate on the relevance for heavy-ion phenomenology via the hadron resonance gas.
