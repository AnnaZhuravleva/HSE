We present lattice QCD results for the matrix elements of $R_2$ and other dimension-7, $\Delta B = 2$ operators relevant for calculations of $\Delta \Gamma_s$, the $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ width difference. We have computed correlation functions using 5 ensembles of the MILC Collaboration's 2+1+1-flavour gauge field configurations, spanning 3 lattice spacings and light sea quarks masses down to the physical point. The HISQ action is used for the valence strange quarks, and the NRQCD action is used for the bottom quarks. Once our analysis is complete, the theoretical uncertainty in the Standard Model prediction for $\Delta \Gamma_s$ will be substantially reduced.
