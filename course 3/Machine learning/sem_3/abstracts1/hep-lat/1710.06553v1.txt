The QCD at finite density is not well understood yet, where standard Monte Carlo simulation suffers from the sign problem. In order to overcome the sign problem, the method of Lefschetz thimble has been explored. Basically, the original sign problem can be less severe in a complexified theory due to the constancy of the imaginary part of an action on each thimble. However, global phase factors assigned on each thimble still remain. Their interference is not negligible in a situation where a large number of thimbles contribute to the partition function, and this could also lead to a sign problem.In this study, we propose a method to resolve this problem by modifying the structure of Lefschetz thimbles such that only a single thimble is relevant to the partition function. It can be shown that observables measured in the original and modified theories are connected by a simple identity. We exemplify that our method works well in a toy model.
