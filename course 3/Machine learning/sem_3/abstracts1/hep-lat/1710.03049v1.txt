It is well-known that staggered fermions do not necessarily satisfy the same global symmetries as the continuum theory. We analyze the mechanism behind this phenomenon for arbitrary dimension and gauge group representation. For this purpose we vary the number of lattice sites between even and odd parity in each single direction. Since the global symmetries are manifest in the lowest eigenvalues of the Dirac operator, the spectral statistics and also the symmetry breaking pattern will be affected. We analyze these effects and compare our predictions with Monte-Carlo simulations of naive Dirac operators in the strong coupling limit.
