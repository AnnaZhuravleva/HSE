The well-known discrepancy in the muon $g-2$ between experiment and theory demands further theory investigations in view of the upcoming new experiments. One of the leading uncertainties lies in the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution (HLbL), that we address with our position-space approach. We focus on exploratory studies of the pion-pole contribution in a simple model and the fermion loop without gluon exchanges in the continuum and in infinite volume. These studies provide us with useful information for our planned computation of HLbL in the muon $g-2$ using full QCD.
