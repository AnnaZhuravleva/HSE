Using non-relativistic effective Lagrangians in the particle-dimer picture, we rederive the expression for the energy shift of a loosely bound three-particle bound state of identical bosons in the unitary limit. The effective field theory formalism allows us to investigate the role of the three-particle force, which has not been taken into account in the earlier treatment of the problem. Moreover, we are able to relax the requirement of the unitary limit of infinite scattering length and demonstrate a smooth transition from the weakly bound three-particle state to a two-particle bound state of a particle and a deeply bound dimer.
