We present a lattice-QCD calculation of the longitudinally polarized isovector parton distribution function (PDF) using ensembles at the physical pion mass with large proton boost momenta $P_z \in \{2.2, 2.6, 3.0\}$~GeV within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). In contrast with our previous physical-pion PDF result in 2017, we increase the statistics significantly, double the boost momentum and increase the investment in controlling excited-state contamination by using six source-sink separations in our analysis. We detail the systematics that affect spin-dependent PDF calculations, providing a guide so that future calculations can further improve the precision of lattice-determined PDFs. We find our final parton distribution to be in reasonable agreement with the current global PDF curves provided by NNPDF, JAM and DSSV.
