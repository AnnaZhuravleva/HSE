We report on an analysis of the average quark momentum fraction of the nucleon and related quantities using $N_\mathrm{f}=2+1$ Wilson fermions. Computations are performed on four CLS ensembles covering three values of the lattice spacing at pion masses down to $M_\pi \approx 200\,\mathrm{MeV}$. Several source-sink separations ($\sim 1.0\,\mathrm{fm}$ to $\sim 1.4\,\mathrm{fm}$) are used to assess the excited-state contamination. To gain further insight, the generalized pencil-of-functions approach has been implemented to reduce the excited-state contamination in the relevant two- and three-point functions. Preliminary results are shown for the isovector nucleon charges from vector, axial vector and tensor derivative (twist-2) operators.
