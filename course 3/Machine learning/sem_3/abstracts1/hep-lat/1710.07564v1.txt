We present the computation of invariants that arise in the strong coupling expansion of lattice QCD. These invariants are needed for Monte Carlo simulations of Lattice QCD with staggered fermions in a dual, color singlet representation. This formulation is in particular useful to tame the finite density sign problem. The gauge integrals in this limiting case $\beta\rightarrow 0$ are well known, but the gauge integrals needed to study the gauge corrections are more involved. We discuss a method to evaluate such integrals.   The phase boundary of lattice QCD for staggered fermions in the $\mu_B-T$ plane has been established in the strong coupling limit. We present numerical simulations away from the strong coupling limit, taking into account the higher order gauge corrections via plaquette occupation numbers. This allows to study the nuclear and chiral transition as a function of $\beta$.
