We study tetraquark resonances with lattice QCD potentials computed for a static bbar bbar pair in the presence of two lighter quarks u d, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the emergent wave method. As a proof of concept we focus on the system with isospin I = 0, but consider different relative angular momenta l of the heavy quarks bbar bbar. For l=0 a bound state has already been predicted with quantum numbers I(JP) = 0(1+). Exploring various angular momenta we now compute the phase shifts and search for S and T matrix poles in the second Riemann sheet. We predict a tetraquark resonance for l =1, decaying into two B mesons, with quantum numbers I(JP) = 0(1-), mass m = 10 \, 576^{+4}_{-4} MeV} and decay width Gamma = 112^{+90}_{-103} MeV.
