We introduce topological non-trivial colorful regions around intersection points of two perpendicular vortex pairs and investigate their influence on topological charge density and eigenmodes of the Dirac operator. With increasing distance between the vortices the eigenvalues of the lowest modes decrease. We show that the maxima and minima of the chiral densities of the low modes follow mainly the distributions of the topological charge densities. The topological non-trivial color structures lead in some low modes to distinct peaks in the chiral densities. The other low modes reflect the topological charge densities of the intersection points.
