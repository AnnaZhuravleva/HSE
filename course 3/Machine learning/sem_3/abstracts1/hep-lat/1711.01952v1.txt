We present the latest lattice QCD results for baryon interactions obtained at nearly physical quark masses. $N_f = 2+1$ nonperturbatively ${\cal O}(a)$-improved Wilson quark action with stout smearing and Iwasaki gauge action are employed on the lattice of $(96a)^4 \simeq (8.1\mbox{fm})^4$ with $a^{-1} \simeq 2.3$ GeV, where $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV and $m_K \simeq 525$ MeV. In this report, we study the two-nucleon systems and two-$\Xi$ systems in $^1S_0$ channel and $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ coupled channel, and extract central and tensor interactions by the HAL QCD method. We also present the results for the $N\Omega$ interaction in $^5S_2$ channel which is relevant to the $N\Omega$ pair-momentum correlation in heavy-ion collision experiments.
