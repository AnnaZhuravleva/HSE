It is well known that investigating QCD at finite density by standard Monte Carlo methods is extremely difficult due to the sign problem. Some years ago, the complex Langevin method with gauge cooling was shown to work at high temperature, i.e., in the deconfined phase. The same method was also applied to QCD in the so-called heavy dense limit in the whole temperature region. In this paper we attempt to apply this method to the high density low temperature regime with reasonably small quark mass using four-flavor staggered fermions on a $4^3\times 8$ lattice. While a straightforward application faces with the singular-drift problem, which spoils the validity of the method, we overcome this problem by the deformation technique proposed earlier. Explicit results for the quark number density and the chiral condensate obtained in this way for $3.2\leq \mu/T\leq 5.6$ are compared with the results for the phase-quenched model obtained by the standard RHMC calculation, which suggests the occurrence of the Silver-Blaze phenomenon.
