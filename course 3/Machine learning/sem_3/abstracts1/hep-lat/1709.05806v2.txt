A possible method to solve the sign problem is developed by modifying the original theory. Considering several modifications of the partition function, the observable in the original theory is reconstructed from the identity connecting the observables in the original and modified theories. We demonstrate that our method gives the correct results even if the original theory has the severe sign problem by using a simple 1-dimensional integral.
