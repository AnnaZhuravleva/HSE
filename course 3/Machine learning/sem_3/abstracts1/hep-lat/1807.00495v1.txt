We present the QCD simulation of the first gauge ensemble of two degenerate light quarks, a strange and a charm quark with all quark masses tuned to their physical values within the twisted mass fermion formulation. Results for the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants confirm that the produced ensemble is indeed at the physical parameters of the theory. This conclusion is corroborated by a complementary analysis in the baryon sector. We examine cutoff and isospin breaking effects and demonstrate that they are suppressed through the presence of a clover term in the action.
