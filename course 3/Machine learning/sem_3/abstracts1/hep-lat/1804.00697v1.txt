We present a general technique for addressing sign problems that arise in Monte Carlo simulations of field theories. This method deforms the domain of the path integral to a manifold in complex field space that maximizes the average sign (therefore reducing the sign problem) within a parameterized family of manifolds. We presents results for the $1+1$ dimensional Thirring model with Wilson fermions on lattice sizes up to $40\times 10$. This method reaches higher $\mu$ then previous techniques while substantially decreasing the computational time required.
