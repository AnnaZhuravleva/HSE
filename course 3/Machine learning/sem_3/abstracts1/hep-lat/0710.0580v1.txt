Using lattice techniques we investigate the generation of long range cosmological magnetic fields during a cold electroweak transition. We will show how magnetic fields arise, during bubble collisions, in the form of magnetic strings. We conjecture that these magnetic strings originate from the alignment of magnetic dipoles associated with EW sphaleron-like configurations. We also discuss the early thermalisation of photons and the turbulent behaviour of the scalar fields after tachyonic preheating.
