The spatial distribution of the stress tensor around the quark--anti-quark ($Q\bar{Q}$) system in SU(3) lattice gauge theory is studied. The Yang-Mills gradient flow plays a crucial role to make the stress tensor well-defined and practically derivable from the numerical simulations on the lattice. Clear evidence of the flux tube formation and its transverse structure are presented from the stress-tensor distribution. The linear confining behavior of the $Q\bar{Q}$ potential at long distances is derived directly from the integral of the local stress tensor.
