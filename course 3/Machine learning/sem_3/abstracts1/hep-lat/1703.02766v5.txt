We present a modular analysis program written in Python devoted to the estimation of autocorrelation times for Monte Carlo simulations by means of the $\Gamma$-method algorithm. We give a brief review of this method and describe the main features of the program. The latter is characterized by a user-friendly interface and an open source environment which, along with its modularity, make it a versatile tool. Finally we present a simple application as an operational test for the program.
