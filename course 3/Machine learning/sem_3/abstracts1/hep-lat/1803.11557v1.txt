Quarkonia are some of the most important probes of the medium created in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments, but it is still difficult to get quantitative results for its behavior in the plasma. Here I discuss the decay width of a heavy quarkonium system, and calculate the gluodissociation width of bottomonia. In the end I comment on study of quarkonia as open quantum systems.
