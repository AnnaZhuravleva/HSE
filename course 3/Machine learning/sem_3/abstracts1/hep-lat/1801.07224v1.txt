We present a first-principles lattice QCD+QED calculation at physical pion mass of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. The total contribution of up, down, strange, and charm quarks including QED and strong isospin breaking effects is found to be $a_\mu^{\rm HVP~LO}=715.4(16.3)(9.2) \times 10^{-10}$, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. By supplementing lattice data for very short and long distances with experimental R-ratio data using the compilation of Ref. [1], we significantly improve the precision of our calculation and find $a_\mu^{\rm HVP~LO} = 692.5(1.4)(0.5)(0.7)(2.1) \times 10^{-10}$ with lattice statistical, lattice systematic, R-ratio statistical, and R-ratio systematic errors given separately. This is the currently most precise determination of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. In addition, we present the first lattice calculation of the light-quark QED correction at physical pion mass.
