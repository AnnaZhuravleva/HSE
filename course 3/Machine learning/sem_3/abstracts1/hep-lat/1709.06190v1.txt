We report preliminary results on the finite temperature behavior of SU(4) gauge theory with dynamical quarks in both the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. This system is a candidate to present scale separation behavior, where fermions in different representations condense at different temperature or coupling scales. Our simulations, however, reveal a single finite-temperature phase transition at which both representations deconfine and exhibit chiral restoration. It appears to be strongly first order. We compare our results to previous single-representation simulations. We also describe a Pisarski-Wilczek stability analysis, which suggests that the transition should be first order.
