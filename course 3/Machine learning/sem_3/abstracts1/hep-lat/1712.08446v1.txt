We present preliminary results on the light, charmed and bottom baryon spectra using overlap valence quarks on the background of 2+1+1 flavours HISQ gauge configurations of the MILC collaboration. These calculations are performed on three different gauge ensembles at three lattice spacings (a ~ 0.12 fm, 0.09 fm and 0.06 fm) and for physical strange, charm and bottom quark masses. The SU(2) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is used to extrapolate baryon masses to the physical pion mass and the continuum limit extrapolations are also performed. Our results are consistent with the well measured charmed baryons. We predict the masses of many other states which are yet to be discovered.
