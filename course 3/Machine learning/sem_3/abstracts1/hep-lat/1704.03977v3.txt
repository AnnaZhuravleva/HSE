According to the Ideal Walking Technicolor paradigm large mass anomalous dimensions arise in gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models when the four-fermion coupling is sufficiently strong to induce spontaneous symmetry breaking in an otherwise conformal gauge theory. We therefore study the $SU(2)$ gauged NJL model with two adjoint fermions using lattice simulations. The model is in an infrared conformal phase at small NJL coupling while it displays a chirally broken phase at large NJL couplings. In the infrared conformal phase we find that the mass anomalous dimension varies with the NJL coupling reaching $\gamma_m \sim 1$ close to the chiral symmetry breaking transition, de facto making the present model the first explicit realization of the Ideal Walking scenario.
