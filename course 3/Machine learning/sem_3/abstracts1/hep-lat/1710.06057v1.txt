We present results for Wilson loops smoothed with the Yang-Mills gradient flow and matched through the scale $t_0$. They provide renormalized and precise operators allowing to test the $1/N^2$ scaling both at finite lattice spacing and in the continuum limit. Our results show an excellent scaling up to $1/N = 1/3$. Additionally, we obtain a very precise non-perturbative confirmation of factorization in the large $N$ limit.
