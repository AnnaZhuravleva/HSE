We report the ground state masses of hadrons containing at least one charm and one bottom quark using lattice quantum chromodynamics. These include mesons with spin (J)-parity (P) quantum numbers J(P): 0(-), 1(-), 1(+) and 0(+) and the spin-1/2 and 3/2 baryons. Among these hadrons only the ground state of 0(-) is known experimentally and therefore our predictions provide important information for the experimental discovery of all other hadrons with these quark contents.
