We present an exploratory study of leading isospin breaking effects in mesonic masses using $O(a)$ improved Wilson fermions. Isospin symmetry is explicitly broken by distinct masses and electric charges of the up and down quarks. In order to be able to make use of existing isosymmetric QCD gauge ensembles we apply reweighting techniques. The path integral describing QCD+QED is expanded perturbatively in powers of the light quarks' mass deviations and the electromagnetic coupling. We employ QED$_{\mathrm{L}}$ as a finite volume formulation of QED.
