We determine two improvement coefficients which are relevant to cancel mass-dependent cutoff effects in correlation functions with operator insertions of the non-singlet local QCD vector current. This determination is based on degenerate three-flavor QCD simulations of non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson fermions with tree-level improved gauge action. Employing a very robust strategy that has been pioneered in the quenched approximation leads to an accurate estimate of a counterterm cancelling dynamical quark cutoff effects linear in the trace of the quark mass matrix. To our knowledge this is the first time that such an effect has been determined systematically with large significance.
