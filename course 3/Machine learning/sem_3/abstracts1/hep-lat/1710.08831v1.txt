Numerical QCD is often extremely resource demanding and it is not rare to run hundreds of simulations at the same time. Each of these can last for days or even months and it typically requires a job-script file as well as an input file with the physical parameters for the application to be run. Moreover, some monitoring operations (i.e. copying, moving, deleting or modifying files, resume crashed jobs, etc.) are often required to guarantee that the final statistics is correctly accumulated. Proceeding manually in handling simulations is probably the most error-prone way and it is deadly uncomfortable and inefficient! BaHaMAS was developed and successfully used in the last years as a tool to automatically monitor and administrate simulations.
