We report on our progress in studying exotic, heavy tetraquark states, $qq\prime \bar Q\bar Q\prime$. Using publicly available dynamical $n_f =2+1$ Wilson-Clover gauge configurations, generated by the PACS-CS collaboration, with pion masses $\simeq$164, 299 and 415 MeV, we extend our previous analysis to heavy quark components containing heavier than physical bottom quarks $\bar Q\bar Q\prime=\bar b\prime\bar b\prime$ or $\bar Q\bar Q\prime=\bar b\bar b\prime$, charm and bottom quarks $\bar c\bar b$ and also only charm quarks $\bar c\bar c$. Throughout we employ NRQCD and relativistic heavy quarks for the heavier than bottom, bottom and charm quarks. Using our previously established diquark-antidiquark and meson-meson operator basis we comment in particular on the dependence of the binding energy on the mass of the heavy quark component $\bar Q\bar Q$, with heavy quarks ranging from $m_Q=0.85\ldots 6.3\cdot m_b$. In the heavy flavor non-degenerate case, $\bar Q\bar Q\prime$, and especially for the tetraquark channel $ud\bar c\bar b$, we extend our work to utilize a $3\times 3$ GEVP to study the ground and threshold states thereby enabling a clear identification of possible binding. Finally, we present initial work on the $\bar Q\bar Q\prime=\bar c\bar c$ system where a much larger operator basis is available in comparison to flavor combinations with NRQCD quarks.
