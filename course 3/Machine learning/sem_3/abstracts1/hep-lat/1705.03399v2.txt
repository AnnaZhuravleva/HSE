We present results on the nucleon axial and induced pseudo-scalar form factors using an ensemble of two degenerate twisted mass clover-improved fermions generated at the physical value of the pion mass. We evaluate the isovector and the isoscalar, as well as, the strange and the charm axial form factors. The disconnected contributions are evaluated using recently developed methods that include deflation of the lower eigenstates, allowing us to extract the isoscalar, strange and charm axial form factors. We find that the disconnected quark loop contributions are non-zero and particularly large for the induced pseudo-scalar form factor.
