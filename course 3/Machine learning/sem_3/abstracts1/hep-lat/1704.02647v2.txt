The masses of the low-lying baryons are evaluated using an ensemble with two degenerate light twisted mass clover-improved quarks with mass tuned to reproduce the physical pion mass. The Iwasaki improved gluonic action is employed. The coupling constant value corresponds to a lattice spacing of $a=0.0938(3)(2)$ fm, determined from the nucleon mass. We find that the clover term supresses isospin symmetry breaking as compared to our previous results using $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions. The masses of the hyperons and charmed baryons evaluated using this ensemble are in agreement with the experimental values. We provide predictions for the mass of the doubly charmed $\Xi_{cc}^*$, as well as of the doubly and triply charmed $\Omega$s that have not yet been determined experimentally.
