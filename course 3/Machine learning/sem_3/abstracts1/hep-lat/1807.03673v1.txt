In this paper we test an approximate method that is often used in lattice studies of the Landau gauge three-gluon vertex. The approximation consists in describing the lattice correlator with tensor bases from the continuum theory. With the help of vertex reconstruction, we show that this "continuum" approach may lead, for general kinematics, to significant errors in vertex tensor representations. Such errors are highly unwelcome, as they can lead to wrong quantitative estimates for vertex form factors and related quantities of interest, like the three-gluon running coupling. As a possible solution, we demonstrate numerically and analytically that there exist special kinematic configurations for which the vertex tensor structures can be described exactly on the lattice. For these kinematics, the dimensionless tensor elements are equal to the continuum ones, regardless of the details of the lattice implementation. We ran our simulations for an $SU(2)$ gauge theory in two and three spacetime dimensions, with Wilson and $\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ tree-level improved gauge actions. Our results and conclusions can be straightforwardly generalised to higher dimensions and, with some precautions, to other lattice correlators, like the ghost-gluon, quark-gluon and four-gluon vertices.
