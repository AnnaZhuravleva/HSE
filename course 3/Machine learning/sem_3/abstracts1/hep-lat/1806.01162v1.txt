We calculate the topological susceptibility at 2.5 Tc and 4.1 Tc in SU(3) pure Yang-Mills theory. We define topology with the help of gradient flow and we largely overcome the problem of poor statistics at high temperatures by applying a reweighting technique in terms of the topological charge, measured after a specific small amount of gradient flow. This allows us to obtain a sample of configurations which compares topological sectors with good statistics, with enhanced tunneling between topologies. We quote continuum extrapolated results at these two temperatures and conclude that our method is viable and can be extended without new conceptual problems to the case of full QCD with fermions.
