We perform a systematic study of the correlation functions of two quark currents in a pion using lattice QCD. We obtain good signals for all but one of the relevant Wick contractions of quark fields. We investigate the quark mass dependence of our results and test the importance of correlations between the quark and the antiquark in the pion. Our lattice data are compared with predictions from chiral perturbation theory.
