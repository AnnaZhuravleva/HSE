Recent $N_f=2+1$ lattice data for meson-meson scattering in $p$-wave and isospin $I=1$ are analyzed using a unitarized model inspired by Chiral Perturbation Theory in the inverse-amplitude formulation for two and three flavors. Chiral extrapolations are performed that postdict phase shifts extracted from experiment quite well. In addition, the low-energy constants are compared to the ones from a recent analysis of $N_f=2$ lattice QCD simulations to check for the consistency of the hadronic model used here. Some inconsistencies are detected in the fits to $N_f=2+1$ data, in contrast to the previous analysis of $N_f=2$ data.
