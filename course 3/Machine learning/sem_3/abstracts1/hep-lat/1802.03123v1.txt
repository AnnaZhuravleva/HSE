The surface operator in an SU(2) gauge field theory is studied. We analyze Abelian projection of the SU(2) symmetry to the U(1) group calculating the surface parameter. The surface parameter dependence on the surface area and volume is studied in confinement and deconfinement phases. It is shown the spatial and temporal surface operators exhibit nontrivial area dependence in the confinement and deconfinement phases. It is shown also that there is no volume law for the operators defined on a cubic surface.
