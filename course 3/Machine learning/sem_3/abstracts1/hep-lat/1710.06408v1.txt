We show the first results for parton distribution functions within the proton at the physical pion mass, employing the method of quasi-distributions. In particular, we present the matrix elements for the iso-vector combination of the unpolarized, helicity and transversity quasi-distributions, obtained with $N_f=2$ twisted mass clover-improved fermions and a proton boosted with momentum $|\vec{p}|=0.83\mbox{ GeV}$. The momentum smearing technique has been applied to improve the overlap with the proton boosted state. Moreover, we present the renormalized helicity matrix elements in the RI$'$ scheme, following the non-perturbative renormalization prescription recently developed by our group.
