Application of multigrid solvers in shifted linear systems is studied. We focus on accelerating the rational approximation needed for simulating single flavor operators. This is particularly useful, in the case of twisted mass fermions for mass non-degenerate quarks and can be employed to accelerate the $N_f=1+1$ sector of $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermion simulations. The multigrid solver is accelerated by employing suitable initial guesses. We propose a novel strategy for proposing initial guesses for shifted linear systems based on the Lagrangian interpolation of the previous solutions.
