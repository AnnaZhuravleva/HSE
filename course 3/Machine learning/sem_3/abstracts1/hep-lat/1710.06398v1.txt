The lattice studies of maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (MSYM) theory at strong coupling and large N is important for verifying gauge/gravity duality. Due to the progress made in the last decade, based on ideas from topological twisting and orbifolding, it is now possible to study these theories on the lattice while preserving an exact supersymmetry on the lattice. We present some results from the lattice studies of two-dimensional MSYM which is related to Type II supergravity. Our results agree with the thermodynamics of different black hole phases on the gravity side and the phase transition (Gregory--Laflamme) between them.
