We report the results on the proton mass decomposition and also on the related quark and glue momentum fractions. The results are based on overlap valence fermions on four ensembles of $N_f = 2+1$ DWF configurations with three lattice spacings and volumes, and several pion masses including the physical pion mass. With 1-loop perturbative calculation and proper normalization of the glue operator, we find that the $u, d,$ and $s$ quark masses contribute 9(2)\% to the proton mass. The quark energy and glue field energy contribute 31(5)\% and 37(5)\% respectively in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV. The trace anomaly gives the remaining 23(1)\% contribution. The $u,d,s$ and glue momentum fractions in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme are consistent with the global analysis at $\mu = 2$ GeV.
