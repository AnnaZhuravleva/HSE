This talk summarizes the results of the DESY-M\"unster collaboration for $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the gauge group SU(3). It is an updated status report with respect to our preliminary data presented at the last conference. In order to control the lattice artefacts we have now considered a clover improved fermion action and different values of the gauge coupling.
