We propose a lattice field theory formulation which overcomes some fundamental difficulties in realizing exact supersymmetry on the lattice. The Leibniz rule for the difference operator can be recovered by defining a new product on the lattice, the star product, and the chiral fermion species doublers degrees of freedom can be avoided consistently. This framework is general enough to formulate non-supersymmetric lattice field theory without chiral fermion problem. This lattice formulation has a nonlocal nature and is essentially equivalent to the corresponding continuum theory. We can show that the locality of the star product is recovered exponentially in the continuum limit. Possible regularization procedures are proposed.The associativity of the product and the lattice translational invariance of the formulation will be discussed.
