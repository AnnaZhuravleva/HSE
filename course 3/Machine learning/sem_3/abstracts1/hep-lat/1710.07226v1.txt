We report the performance of Wilson and Domainwall Kernels on a new Intel Xeon Phi Knights Landing based machine named Oakforest-PACS, which is co-hosted by University of Tokyo and Tsukuba University and is currently fastest in Japan. This machine uses Intel Omni-Path for the internode network. We compare performance with several types of implementation including that makes use of the Grid library. The code is incorporated with the code set Bridge++.
