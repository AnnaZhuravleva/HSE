We present our preliminary results on the calculation of hadronic light-by-light forward scattering amplitudes using vector four-point correlation functions computed on the lattice. Using a dispersive approach, forward scattering amplitudes can be described by $\gamma^* \gamma^* \to$ hadrons fusion cross sections and then compared with phenomenology. We show that only a few states are needed to reproduce our data. In particular, the sum rules considered in this study imply relations between meson$-\gamma\gamma$ couplings and provide valuable information about individual form factors which are often used to estimate the meson-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the $(g-2)$ of the muon.
