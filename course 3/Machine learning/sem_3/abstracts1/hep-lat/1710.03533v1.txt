A positive representation for a set of complex densities is constructed. In particular, complex measures on a direct product of U(1) groups are studied. After identifying general conditions which such representations should satisfy, several explicit realizations are proposed. Their utility is illustrated in few concrete examples representing problems in abelian lattice gauge theories.
