We consider the heavy-dense limit of QCD at finite fermion density in the canonical formulation and approximate it by a 3-state Potts model. In the strong coupling limit, the model is free of the sign problem. Away from the strong coupling, the sign problem is solved by employing a cluster algorithm which allows to average each cluster over the Z(3) sectors. Improved estimators for physical quantities can be constructed by taking into account the triality of the clusters, that is, their transformation properties with respect to Z(3) transformations.
