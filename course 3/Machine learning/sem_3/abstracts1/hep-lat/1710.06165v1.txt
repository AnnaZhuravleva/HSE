The sign problem appears in lattice QCD as soon as a non-zero chemical potential is introduced. This prevents direct simulations to determine the phase structure of the strongly interacting matter. Complex Langevin methods have been successfully used for various models or approximations of QCD. However, in some scenarios it converges to incorrect results. We present developments of our new method that helps to improve the convergence by keeping the system closer to the SU(3) manifold and discuss preliminary tests and results.
