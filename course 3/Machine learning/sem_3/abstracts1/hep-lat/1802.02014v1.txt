We report Lee-Yang zeros behavior at finite temperature and density using the canonical approach in lattice QCD. The quark number densities are calculated at the pure imaginary chemical potential in lattice QCD. Canonical partition functions Z_C(n,T,V) up to some maximal values of n are obtained through fitting the theoretically motivated functions to the quark number densities and used to compute the Lee-Yang zeros. We study the temperature dependence of the distributions of the Lee-Yang zeros around the pseudo-critical temperature region T/T_c = 0.84-1.35. A Roberge-Weiss phase transition at T/T_c > 1.20 is observed in the distributions of the Lee-Yang zeros. We also discuss the dependence of the behaviors of Lee-Yang zeros on the maximal value of n.
