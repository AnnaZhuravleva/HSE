We study tetraquark resonances with lattice QCD potentials computed for two static quarks and two dynamical quarks, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the emergent wave method of scattering theory. As a proof of concept we focus on systems with isospin $I = 0$, but consider different relative angular momenta $l$ of the heavy $b$ quarks. We compute the phase shifts and search for $\mbox{S}$ and $\mbox{T}$ matrix poles in the second Riemann sheet. We predict a new tetraquark resonance for $l = 1$, decaying into two $B$ mesons, with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$, mass $m = 10576_{-4}^{+4} \, \textrm{MeV}$ and decay width $\Gamma = 112_{-103}^{+90} \, \textrm{MeV}$.
