Quantum simulations would be highly desirable in order to investigate the finite density physics of QCD. $(1+1)$-d $\mathbb{C}P(N-1)$ quantum field theories are toy models that share many important features of QCD: they are asymptotically free, have a non-perturbatively generated massgap, as well as $\theta$-vacua. $SU(N)$ quantum spin ladders provide an unconventional regularization of $\mathbb{C}P(N-1)$ models that is well-suited for quantum simulation with ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice. In order to validate future quantum simulation experiments of $\mathbb{C}P(2)$ models at finite density, here we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations on classical computers to investigate $SU(3)$ quantum spin ladders at non-zero chemical potential. This reveals a rich phase structure, with single- or double-species Bose-Einstein "condensates", with or without ferromagnetic order.
