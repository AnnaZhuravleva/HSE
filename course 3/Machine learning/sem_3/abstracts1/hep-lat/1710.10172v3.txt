We formulate ${\cal N} = 2^*$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a Euclidean spacetime lattice using the method of topological twisting. The lattice formulation preserves one scalar supersymmetry charge at finite lattice spacing. The lattice theory is also local, gauge invariant and free from doublers. We can use the lattice formulation of ${\cal N} = 2^*$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills to study finite temperature nonperturbative sectors of the theory and thus validate the gauge-gravity duality conjecture in a nonconformal theory.
