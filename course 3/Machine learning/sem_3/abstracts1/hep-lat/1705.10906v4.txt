We compute the topological susceptibility $\chi_t$ of lattice QCD with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors described by the M\"obius domain wall fermion. Violation of chiral symmetry as measured by the residual mass is kept at $\sim$1 MeV or smaller. We measure the fluctuation of the topological charge density in a "slab" sub-volume of the simulated lattice using the method proposed by Bietenholz et al. The quark mass dependence of $\chi_t$ agrees with the prediction of chiral perturbation theory, from which the chiral condensate is extracted as $\Sigma^{\overline{\rm MS}}(\mbox{2GeV}) = [248(11)(17)\mbox{MeV}]^3$, where the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic. Combining the results for the pion mass $M_\pi$ and decay constant $F_\pi$, we obtain $\chi_t = 0.230(01)(09)M_\pi^2F_\pi^2$ at the physical point.
