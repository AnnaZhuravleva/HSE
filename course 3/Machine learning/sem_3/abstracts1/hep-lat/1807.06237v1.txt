We investigate finite size effect on pseudoscalar meson masses and decay constants using a partial set of the "PACS10" configurations which are generated keeping the space-time volumes over (10 fm$)^4$ in 2+1 flavor QCD at the physical point. We have tried two kinds of analyses fixing $\kappa$ values or measured axial Ward identity quark masses. Comparing the results on (5.4 fm$)^4$ and (10.8 fm$)^4$ lattices we have found sizable finite size effect on the pseudoscalar meson sector in the former analysis: 2.1%, 4.8% and 0.36% finite size effect on $m_\pi$, $m_{\rm ud}$ and $f_\pi$, respectively, on the (5.4 fm$)^4$ lattice. For the latter analysis the finite size effect on the pseudoscalar meson decay constants is 0.67% for $f_\pi$ and 0.26% for $f_K$, which are roughly a factor of three larger than the prediction of the full one-loop SU(3) chiral perturbation theory, while the finite size effect on the pseudoscalar meson masses is hardly detected under the current statistical precision.
