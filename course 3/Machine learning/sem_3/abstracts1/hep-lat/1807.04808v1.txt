We want to find indications that magnetic monopoles in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) exist; therefore we add a pair of a monopole and an anti-monopole in the QCD vacuum of the quenched SU(3) by acting the monopole creation operator on the vacuum. We investigate the catalytic effects of monopoles on the chiral symmetry breaking, using the Dirac operator of the overlap fermions which preserves the chiral symmetry in the lattice gauge theory. First, we confirm that the eigenstate of the monopole creation operator becomes the coherent state and the added monopoles and anti-monopoles condense in the QCD vacuum. We then find the catalytic effects of monopoles by varying the values of the magnetic charges of the additional monopole and anti-monopole as follows: (i) The decay constants of the pseudoscalar increase. (ii) The values of the chiral condensate, which is defined as a minus value decrease. (iii) The masses of the light quarks and the pseudoscalar mesons become heavier. The catalytic effects of monopoles on the partial decay width and the lifetime of the charged pion are estimated using the numerical results of the pion decay constant and the pion mass. (iv) The decay width of the charged pion becomes wider and the lifetime of the charged pion becomes shorter. These are the catalytic effects of monopoles in QCD, which we find in this research.
