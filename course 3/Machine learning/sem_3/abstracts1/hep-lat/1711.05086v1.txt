Supersymmetric gauge theories are an important building block for extensions of the standard model. As a first step towards Super-QCD we investigate the pure gauge sector with gluons and gluinos on the lattice, in particular the low energy mass spectrum: meson-like gluinoballs, gluino-glueballs and pure glueballs. We report on some first calculations performed with clover improved Wilson fermions on rather small lattices. The supersymmetric continuum limit and particle masses are discussed and compared to predictions from effective field theory.
