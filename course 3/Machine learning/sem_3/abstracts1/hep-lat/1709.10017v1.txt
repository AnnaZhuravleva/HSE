It is expected that when the number of light flavors of gauge theories is increased near or beyond some critical value, new and interesting behavior occurs. We discuss the qualitative properties of the RG flows for a local $SU(3)$ theory with $N_f$ light fundamental flavors for $N_f$ near 12. We discuss the realization of the chiral symmetry and remind that the Wigner mode seems an unlikely alternative. We propose to use a linear sigma model to describe the light $\sigma$ masses found in recent lattice calculations for $N_f$=8 and 12. Progress made after the conference are reported in arXiv:1709.09264, where it is claimed that the breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ is a key ingredient to get a small $\sigma$ mass. For SU(3) lattice gauge theory with 12 flavors of unimproved staggered fermions, the scaling of the imaginary part of the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling plane is consistent with a first order phase transition for small values of the mass. Zech Gelzer and Diego Floor are investigating the scaling near the endpoint of the line of first order phase transition in the mass-coupling plane where a light and weakly interacting scalar is expected. We briefly discuss recent calculations of the second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy and estimations of the central charge using the Tensor Renormalization Group method for the two-dimensional O(2) model and the possibility to extend these calculations to higher dimensions.
