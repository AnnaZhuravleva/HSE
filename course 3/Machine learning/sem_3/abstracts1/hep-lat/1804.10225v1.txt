In this work we present the analysis of the energy spectrum from a recent two-flavor ($N_f=2$) lattice QCD calculation for pion-pion scattering in the scalar, isoscalar channel (the $\sigma$-meson). The lattice simulation was performed for two quark masses corresponding to a pion mass of 315 MeV and 227 MeV. The $\sigma$-meson parameters are extracted using various parametrizations of the scattering amplitude. The results obtained from a chiral unitary parametrization are extrapolated to the physical point and read $M_\sigma =( 440^{+10}_{-16}(50) - i\,240(20)(25))$ MeV, where the uncertainties in the parentheses denote the stochastic and systematic ones. The behavior of the $\sigma$-meson parameters with increasing pion mass is discussed as well.
