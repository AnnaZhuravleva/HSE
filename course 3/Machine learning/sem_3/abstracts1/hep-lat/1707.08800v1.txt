A sanity check rules out certain types of obviously false results, but does not catch every possible error. After reviewing such a sanity check for $NN$ bound states with the L\"uscher's finite volume formula[1-3], we give further evidences for the operator dependence of plateaux, a symptom of the fake plateau problem, against the claim in [4]. We then present our critical comments on [5] by NPLQCD: (i) Operator dependences of plateaux in NPL2013[6,7] exist with the $P$-values of 4--5%. (ii) The volume independence of plateaux in NPL2013 does not prove their correctness. (iii) Effective range expansion (ERE) fits in NPL2013 violate the physical pole condition. (iv) Ref.[5] is partly based on new data and analysis different from the original ones[6,7]. (v) A new ERE in Refs.[5,8] does not satisfy the L\"uscher's finite volume formula.   [1] T.
