An extended multi-hadron operator is developed to extract the spectra of irreducible representations in the finite volume. The irreducible representations of the cubic group are projected using a coordinate-space operator. The correlation function of this operator is computationally efficient to extract lattice spectra. In particular, this new formulation only requires propagator inversions from two distinct locations, at fixed physical separation. We perform a proof-of-principle study on a $24^3 \times 48$ lattice volume with $m_\pi\approx 900$~MeV by isolating the spectra of $A^+_1$, $E^+$ and $T^+_2$ of the $\pi\pi$ system with isospin-2 in the rest frame.
