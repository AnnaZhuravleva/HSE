We investigate several examples of Yang-Mills gauge configurations containing center vortex structures, including intersection points between vortices and nontrivial color structures residing on the vortex world-surfaces. Various topological charge contributions of the color structures and intersection points are studied in these configurations. Low-lying eigenmodes of the (overlap) Dirac operator in the presence of these vortex backgrounds are analyzed. The results indicate characteristic properties for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.
