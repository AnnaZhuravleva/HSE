We address the operator-mixing pattern of a class of nonlocal quark bilinear operators that involve a straight Wilson line in a spatial direction. In recent years, this type of nonlocal operator has received a lot of attention in the context of the lattice QCD calculations needed to extract the Bjorken-x dependence of the parton distribution functions (PDFs). The mixing is complicated by the breaking of symmetries on the lattice. Analyzing the behavior of the operators under the symmetries of the lattice action and the equation of motion, we classify the structure of O(a) relevant operators. Going beyond the symmetry point of view, we also investigate the perturbative structure of the O(a) operators due to lattice discretization effects. Since we need a large hadron momentum in the quasi-PDF approach to reduce higher-twist effects, the O(a)-improvement operator will be necessary to obtain a better determination of PDFs, and the analysis provided in this work gives a basis for the improvement.
