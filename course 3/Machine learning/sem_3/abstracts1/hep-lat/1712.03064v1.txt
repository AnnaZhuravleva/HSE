Various approaches to construction of dual formulations of non-abelian lattice gauge theories are reviewed. In the case of U(N) LGT we use a theory of the Weingarten functions to construct a dual formulation. In particular, the dual representations are constructed 1) for pure gauge models in all dimensions, 2) in the strong coupling limit for the models with arbitrary number of flavours and 3) for two-dimensional U(N) QCD with staggered fermions. Applications related to the finite temperature/density QCD are discussed.
