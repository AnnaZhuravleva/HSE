We investigate the ground state energies of vector $\rho^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm *}$ mesons depending on the magnetic field value in the $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. It has been shown that the energy of a vector particle depends on its spin projection on the field axis. The magnetic dipole polarizability and hyperpolarizabilities give significant contributions to the energy value which prevents the formation of the charged vector meson condensate at high magnetic fields. We calculate the g-factor of $\rho^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm*}$ mesons and the dipole magnetic polarizability of $\rho^{\pm}$ mesons.
