The framework of shifted boundary conditions has proven to be a very powerful tool for the non-perturbative investigation of thermal quantum field theories. For instance, it has been successfully considered for the determination of the equation of state of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with high accuracy. The set-up can be generalized to QCD and it is expected to lead to a similar breakthrough. We present first results for QCD with three flavours of non-perturbatively O($a$)-improved Wilson fermions and shifted boundary conditions.
