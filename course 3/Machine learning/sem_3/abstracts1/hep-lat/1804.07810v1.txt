In the last few years, numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice have reached a new level of accuracy. A wide range of thermodynamic quantities is now available in the continuum limit and for physical quark masses. This allows a comparison with measurements from heavy ion collisions for the first time. Furthermore, calculations of dynamical quantities are also becoming available. The combined effort from first principles and experiment allows us to gain an unprecedented understanding of the properties of quark-gluon plasma. I will review the state-of-the-art results from lattice simulations and connect them to the experimental information from RHIC and the LHC.
