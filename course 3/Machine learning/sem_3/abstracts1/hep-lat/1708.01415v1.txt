Euclidean two-point correlators of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) in SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice are studied on the basis of the Yang-Mills gradient flow. The entropy density and the specific heat obtained from the two-point correlators are shown to be in good agreement with those from the one-point functions of EMT. These results constitute a first step toward the first principle simulations of the transport coefficients with the gradient flow.
