We propose a continuous real space renormalization group transformation based on gradient flow, allowing for a numerical study of renormalization without the need for costly ensemble matching. We apply our technique in a pilot study of SU$(3)$ gauge theory with $N_f = 12$ fermions in the fundamental representation, finding the mass anomalous dimension to be $\gamma_m = 0.23(6)$, consistent with other perturbative and lattice estimates. We also present the first lattice calculation of the nucleon anomalous dimension in this theory, finding $\gamma_N = 0.05(5)$.
