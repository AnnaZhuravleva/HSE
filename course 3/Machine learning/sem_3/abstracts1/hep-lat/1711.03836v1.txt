We present an update of BQCD, our Hybrid Monte Carlo program for simulating lattice QCD. BQCD is one of the main production codes of the QCDSF collaboration and is used by CSSM and in some Japanese finite temperature and finite density projects. Since the first publication of the code at Lattice 2010 the program has been extended in various ways. New features of the code include: dynamical QED, action modification in order to compute matrix elements by using Feynman-Hellman theory, more trace measurements, a more flexible integration scheme, polynomial filtering, term-splitting for RHMC, and a portable implementation of performance critical parts employing SIMD.
