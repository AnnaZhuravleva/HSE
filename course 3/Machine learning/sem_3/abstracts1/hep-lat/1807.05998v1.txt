We show that the 3450 U(1) chiral fermion theory can appear as the low energy effective theory of a truly local 1+1D lattice model, where the U(1) symmetry is realized as an on-site symmetry and the interaction range is bounded by a finite distance. Our construction can be generalized to regularize any anomaly-free 1+1D U(1) chiral fermion theory by a lattice, thanks to the equivalence between the U(1) 't Hooft anomaly free condition and the U(1) symmetric interaction gapping rule.
