It has become customary to use a smoothing algorithm called "gradient flow" to fix the lattice spacing in a simulation, through a parameter called $t_0$. It is shown that in order to keep the length $t_0$ fixed with respect to mesonic or gluonic observables as the number of colors $N_c$ is varied, the fiducial point for the flow parameter must be scaled nearly linearly in $N_c$. In simulations with dynamical fermions, the dependence of $t_0$ on the pseudoscalar meson mass flattens as the number of colors rises, in a way which is consistent with large $N_c$ expectations.
