The quenched gluon and ghost propagator data published in [1] is reanalysed following the suggestion of [2] to resolve the differences between the infrared data of the simulations. Our results confirms that the procedure works well either for the gluon or for the ghost propagator but not for both propagators simultaneously as the observed deviations in the data follow opposite patterns. Definitive conclusions require improving the determination of the (ratios) of lattice spacings. A simple procedure for the relative calibration of the lattice spacing in lattice simulations is suggested.
