We compute the running of the coupling in SU(2) gauge theory with six fermions in fundamental representation of the gauge group. We establish an infrared stable fixed point at strong coupling and measure also the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass operator at the fixed point. This theory therefore likely lies close to the boundary of the conformal window and will display novel infrared dynamics if coupled with the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.
