We evaluate the electromagnetic $\Xi_c \gamma \rightarrow\Xi_c^\prime$ transition on 2+1 flavor lattices corresponding to a pion mass of $\sim 156$ MeV. We extract the magnetic Sachs and Pauli form factors which give the $\Xi_c$-$\Xi_c^\prime$ transition magnetic moment and the decay rates of $\Xi_c^\prime$ baryons. We did not find a signal for the magnetic form factor of the neutral transition $\Xi_c^0 \gamma \rightarrow\Xi_c^{\prime 0}$, which is suppressed by the U-spin flavor symmetry. As a byproduct, we extract the magnetic form factors and the magnetic moments of $\Xi_c$ and $\Xi_c^\prime$ baryons, which give an insight to the dynamics of $u/d$, $s$ and $c$ quarks having masses at different scales.
