We present results for the isospin-0 $\pi\pi$ s-wave scattering length calculated with Osterwalder-Seiler valence quarks on Wilson twisted mass gauge configurations. We use three $N_f = 2$ ensembles with unitary (valence) pion mass at its physical value (250$\sim$MeV), at 240$\sim$MeV (320$\sim$MeV) and at 330$\sim$MeV (400$\sim$MeV), respectively. By using the stochastic Laplacian Heaviside quark smearing method, all quark propagation diagrams contributing to the isospin-0 $\pi\pi$ correlation function are computed with sufficient precision. The chiral extrapolation is performed to obtain the scattering length at the physical pion mass. Our result $M_\pi a^\mathrm{I=0}_0 = 0.198(9)(6)$ agrees reasonably well with various experimental measurements and theoretical predictions. Since we only use one lattice spacing, certain systematics uncertainties, especially those arising from unitary breaking, are not controlled in our result.
