We find that the quark propagator constructed from the domain-wall fermion operator has $L_s-1$ extra poles as well as the pole that realizes the physical quark in the continuum limit. We show the energy-momentum dispersion relation for the physical and unphysical poles of M\"obius domain-wall fermions in free field theory at finite $L_s$. The dependence of extra pole energies on the M\"obius parameter $b-c$ and on the domain-wall height $M_5$ is investigated. Our result suggests that small values of $b-c$ set a large lower bound on the unphysical pole masses and the contribution of these poles could be suppressed well by calculating with small $b-c$.
