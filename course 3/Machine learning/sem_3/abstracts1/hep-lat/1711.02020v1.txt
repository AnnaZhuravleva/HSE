Explorations of the properties of light nuclear systems beyond their lowest-lying spectra have begun with Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. While progress has been made in the past year in pursuing calculations with physical quark masses, studies of the simplest nuclear matrix elements and nuclear reactions at heavier quark masses have been conducted, and several interesting results have been obtained. A community effort has been devoted to investigate the impact of such Quantum Chromodynamics input on the nuclear many-body calculations. Systems involving hyperons and their interactions have been the focus of intense investigations in the field, with new results and deeper insights emerging. While the validity of some of the previous multi-nucleon studies has been questioned during the past year, controversy remains as whether such concerns are relevant to a given result. In an effort to summarize the newest developments in the field, this talk will touch on most of these topics.
