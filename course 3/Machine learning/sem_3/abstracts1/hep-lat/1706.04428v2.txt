We show that a recent interesting idea to circumvent the difficulties with the continuation of parton distribution functions to the Euclidean region, that consists in looking at equal time correlators between proton states of infinite momentum, encounters some problems related to the power divergent mixing pattern of DIS operators, when implemented within the lattice regularization.
