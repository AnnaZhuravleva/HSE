We present a general strategy aimed at generating $N_f=2+1+1$ configurations with quarks at their physical mass using maximally twisted mass fermions to ensure automatic $O(a)$ improvement, in the presence of a clover term tuned to reduce the charged to neutral pion mass difference. The target system, for the moment, is a lattice of size $64^3 \times 128$ with a lattice spacing $a\sim 0.08$ fm. We show preliminary results on the pion and kaon mass and decay constants.
