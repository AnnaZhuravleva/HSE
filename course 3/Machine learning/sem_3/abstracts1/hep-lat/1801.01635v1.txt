We present results for the isovector axial, induced pseudoscalar, electric, and magnetic form factors of the nucleon. The calculations were done using $2+1+1$-flavor HISQ ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration with lattice spacings $a \approx$ 0.12, 0.09, 0.06$\mathrm{fm}$ and pion masses $M_\pi \approx$ 310, 220, 130$\mathrm{MeV}$. Excited-states contamination is controlled by using four-state fits to two-point correlators and by comparing two- versus three-states in three-point correlators. The $Q^2$ behavior is analyzed using the model independent z-expansion and the dipole ansatz. Final results for the charge radii and magnetic moment are obtained using a simultaneous fit in $M_\pi$, lattice spacing $a$ and finite volume.
