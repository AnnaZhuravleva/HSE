The charmonium-nucleon effective central interactions have been computed by the time-dependent HAL QCD method. This gives an updated result of a previous study based on the time-independent method, which is now known to be problematic because of the difficulty in achieving the ground-state saturation. We discuss that the result is consistent with the heavy quark symmetry. No bound state is observed from the analysis of the scattering phase shift; however, this shall lead to a future search of the hidden-charm pentaquarks by considering channel-coupling effects.
