In gauge theories, the physical, experimentally observable spectrum consists only of gauge-invariant states. In the standard model the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism shows that these states can be adequately mapped to the gauge-dependent elementary W, Z, Higgs, and fermions. In theories with a more general gauge group and Higgs sector, appearing in various extensions of the standard model, this has not to be the case. In this work we determine analytically the physical spectrum of $\mathrm{SU}(N>2)$ gauge theories with a Higgs field in the fundamental representation. We show that discrepancies between the spectrum predicted by perturbation theory and the observable physical spectrum arise. We confirm these analytic findings with lattice simulations for $N=3$.
