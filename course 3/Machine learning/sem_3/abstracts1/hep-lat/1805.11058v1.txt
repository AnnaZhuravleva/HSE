We study the topological charge density distribution using the two-dimensional CP(N-1) model. We numerically compute not only the topological susceptibility, which is a global quantity to probe topological properties of the whole system, but also the topological charge correlator with finite momentum. We perform Fourier power spectrum analysis for the topological charge density for various values of the coupling constant $\beta$. We propose to utilize the Fourier entropy as a measure to characterize spatial distribution patterns and demonstrate that the Fourier entropy exhibits nontrivial $\beta$ dependence. We also consider the snapshot entropy defined with the singular value decomposition, which also turns out to behave nonmonotonically with $\beta$.
