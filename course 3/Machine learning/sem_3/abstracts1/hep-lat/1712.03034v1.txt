We study the double-winding Wilson loops in the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on the lattice. We discuss how the area law falloff of the double-winding Wilson loop average is modified by changing the enclosing contours C1 and C2 for various values of the number of color N. By using the strong coupling expansion, we evaluate the double-winding Wilson loop average in the lattice SU(N) Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, we compute the double-winding Wilson loop average by lattice Monte Carlo simulations for SU(2) and SU(3). We further discuss the results from the viewpoint of the Non-Abelian Stokes theorem in the higher representations.
