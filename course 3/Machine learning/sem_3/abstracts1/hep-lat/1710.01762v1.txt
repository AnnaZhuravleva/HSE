We construct a lattice theory with one exact supersymmetry which consists of fields transforming in both the adjoint and fundamental representations of a U(Nc) gauge group. In addition to gluons and gluinos, the theory contains Nf flavors of fermion in the fundamental representation along with their scalar partners and is invariant under a global U(Nf) flavor symmetry. The lattice action contains an additional Fayet-Iliopoulos term which can be used to generate a scalar potential. We perform numerical simulations that corroborate the theoretical expectation that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken for Nf<Nc.
