We study $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) on the lattice. The non-perturbative nature of supersymmetric field theories is still largely unknown. Similarly to QCD, SYM is confining and contains strongly bound states. Applying the variational method together with different smearing techniques we extract masses of the lightest bound states such as gluino-glue, glueball and mesonic states. As these states should form supermultiplets, this study allows to check whether SYM remains supersymmetric also on the quantum level.
