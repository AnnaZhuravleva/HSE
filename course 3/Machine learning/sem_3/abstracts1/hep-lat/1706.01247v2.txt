We perform a high statistics study of the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ and $1^{+}$ charmed-strange mesons, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, respectively. The effects of the nearby $DK$ and $D^{*}K$ thresholds are taken into account by employing the corresponding four quark operators. Six ensembles with $N_f=2$ non-perturbatively ${\cal O}(a)$ improved clover Wilson sea quarks at $a=0.07$ fm are employed, covering different spatial volumes and pion masses: linear lattice extents $L/a=24,32,40,64$, equivalent to 1.7 fm to 4.5 fm, are realised for $m_{\pi}=290$ MeV and $L/a=48,64$ or 3.4 fm and 4.5 fm for an almost physical pion mass of $150$ MeV. Through a phase shift analysis and the effective range approximation we determine the scattering lengths, couplings to the thresholds and the infinite volume masses. Differences relative to the experimental values are observed for these masses, however, this is likely to be due to discretisation effects as spin-averaged quantities and splittings are reasonably compatible with experiment. We also compute the weak decay constants of the scalar and axialvector and find $f_V^{0^+}=114(2)(0)(+5)(10)$ MeV and $f_A^{1^+}=194(3)(4)(+5)(10)$ MeV, where the errors are due to statistics, renormalisation, finite volume and lattice spacing effects.
