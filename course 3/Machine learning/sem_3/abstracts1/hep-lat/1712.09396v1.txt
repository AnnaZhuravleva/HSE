We investigate the dispersion relation of M\"obius domain-wall fermions in free field theory at finite $L_s$. We find that there are $L_s-1$ extra poles of M\"obius domain-wall fermions in addition to the pole which realizes the physical mode in the continuum limit. The unphysical contribution of these extra poles could be significant when we introduce heavy quarks. We show in this report the fundamental properties of these unphysical poles and discuss the optimal choice of M\"obius parameters to minimize their contribution to four-dimensional physics.
