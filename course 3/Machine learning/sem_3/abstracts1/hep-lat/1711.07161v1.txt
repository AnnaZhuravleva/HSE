The introduction of a uniform background magnetic field breaks three-dimensional spatial symmetry for a charged particle and introduces Landau mode effects. Standard quark operators are inefficient at isolating the nucleon correlation function at nontrivial field strengths. We introduce novel quark operators constructed from the two-dimensional Laplacian eigenmodes that describe a charged particle on a finite lattice. These eigenmode-projected quark operators provide enhanced precision for calculating nucleon energy shifts in a magnetic field. Preliminary results are obtained for the neutron and proton magnetic polarisabilities using these methods.
