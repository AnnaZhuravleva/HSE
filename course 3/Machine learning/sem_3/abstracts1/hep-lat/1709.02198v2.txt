We investigate the real and imaginary chemical-potential dependence of pion and $\rho$-meson screening masses in both the confinement and the deconfinement region by using two-flavor lattice QCD. The spatial meson correlators are calculated in the imaginary chemical potential region with lattice QCD simulations. We extract pion and $\rho$-meson screening masses from the correlators. The obtained meson screening masses are extrapolated to the real chemical potential region by assuming some analytic function. In the real chemical potential region, the resulting pion and $\rho$-meson screening masses monotonically increase as real chemical potential becomes large.
