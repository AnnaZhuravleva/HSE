We study a tensor network formulation of the two dimensional lattice $\mathcal{N}=1$ Wess-Zumino model with Wilson derivatives for both fermions and bosons. The tensor renormalization group allows us to compute the partition function without the sign problem, and basic ideas to obtain a tensor network for both fermion and scalar boson systems were already given in previous works. In addition to improving the methods, we have constructed a tensor network representation of the model including the Yukawa-type interaction of Majorana fermions and real scalar bosons. We present some numerical results.
