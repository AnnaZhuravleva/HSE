We present results of a study of the Chiral Separation Effect (CSE) in quenched finite-density QCD. Using a recently developed numerical method we calculate the conserved axial current for exactly chiral overlap fermions at finite density for the first time. We compute the anomalous transport coefficient for the CSE in the confining and de-confining phase and investigate possible deviations from the universal value. In both phases we find that non-perturbative corrections to the CSE are absent and we reproduce the universal value for the transport coefficient within small statistical errors. Our results suggest that the CSE can be used to determine the renormalisation factor of the axial current.
