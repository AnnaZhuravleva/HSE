We calculate the ${{\rm O}}(\alpha^3)$ hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment for the first time from $ab$-$initio$ lattice QCD. We employ previously-published results for the Taylor coefficients of the renormalized vacuum polarization function that were obtained on four-flavor QCD gauge-field configurations with physical light-quark masses. We obtain $10^{10} a_\mu^{\rm HVP,HO} = -9.3(1.3)$, in agreement with determinations from $e^+e^- \to {\rm hadrons}$ data plus dispersion relations. The total uncertainty is below the target precision of the Muon $g-2$ Experiment. We also provide new expressions suitable for computing the ${{\rm O}}(\alpha^3)$ hadronic vacuum polarization contributions from the renormalized vacuum polarization function ${\widehat\Pi}(q^2)$, or directly from the lattice vector-current correlator in Euclidean space.
