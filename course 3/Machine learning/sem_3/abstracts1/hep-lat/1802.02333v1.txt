Matching of the quasi parton distribution functions between continuum and lattice is addressed using lattice perturbation theory specifically with Wilson-type fermions. The matching is done for nonlocal quark bilinear operators with a straight Wilson line in a spatial direction. We also investigate operator mixing in the renormalization and possible O(a) operators for the nonlocal operators based on a symmetry argument on lattice.
