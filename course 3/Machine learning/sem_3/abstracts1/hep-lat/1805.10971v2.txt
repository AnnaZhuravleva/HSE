The leptonic decay of charged pions is investigated in the presence of background magnetic fields. It is found that the background field opens up a new decay channel that proceeds via the vector part of the electroweak current, and is characterized by a new fundamental decay constant. We calculate the magnetic field-dependence of both the usual and the new decay constant non-perturbatively on the lattice. We employ both Wilson and staggered quarks and extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. With this non-perturbative input we calculate the tree-level electroweak amplitude for the full decay rate in strong magnetic fields. We find that the muonic decay of the charged pion is enhanced drastically by the magnetic field. We comment on possible astrophysical implications.
