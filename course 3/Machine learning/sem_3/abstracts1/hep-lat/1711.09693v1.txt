We study the hadron properties at finite temperature from measurement of the screening masses, using two-flavor full QCD of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm with the renormalization group improved Iwasaki gauge action and the clover improved Wilson quark action on a $16^3 \times 4$ lattice. We explore rather heavy quark mass regions. Disconnected quark diagram is dropped. We observe the tendency that the screening masses in all the channels degenerate, which is in accord with the effective restoration of U$_{\rm A}$(1) symmetry, and then eventually approach 2$\pi T$, i.e. the free quark value. In the low temperature region below pseudocritical temperature $T_c$, the screening masses in all the channels decrease. We discuss the different features between these calculations and the previous ones.
