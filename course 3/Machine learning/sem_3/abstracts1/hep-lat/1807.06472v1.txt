The QCD equation of state at finite baryon density is studied in the framework of a Cluster Expansion Model (CEM), which is based on the fugacity expansion of the net baryon density. The CEM uses the two leading Fourier coefficients, obtained from lattice simulations at imaginary $\mu_B$, as the only model input and permits a closed analytic form. Excellent description of the available lattice data at both $\mu_B = 0$ and at imaginary $\mu_B$ is obtained. We also demonstrate how the Fourier coefficients can be reconstructed from baryon number susceptibilities.
