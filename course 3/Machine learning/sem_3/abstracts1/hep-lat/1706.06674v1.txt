Tensor currents are the only quark bilinear operators lacking a non-perturbative determination of their renormalisation group (RG) running between hadronic and electroweak scales. We develop the setup to carry out the computation in lattice QCD via standard recursive finite-size scaling techniques, and provide results for the RG running of tensor currents in $N_f = 0$ and $N_f = 2$ QCD in the continuum for various Schr\"odinger Functional schemes. The matching factors between bare and renormalisation group invariant currents are also determined for a range of values of the lattice spacing relevant for large-volume simulations, thus enabling a fully non-perturbative renormalization of physical amplitudes mediated by tensor currents.
