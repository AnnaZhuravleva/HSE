We present results from our recent lattice QCD study of $N\pi$ scattering in the positive-parity nucleon channel, where the puzzling Roper resonance $N^*(1440)$ resides in experiment. Using a variety of hadron operators, that include $qqq$-like, $N\pi$ in $p$-wave and $N\sigma$ in $s$-wave, we systematically extract the excited lattice spectrum in the nucleon channel up to 1.65 GeV. Our lattice results indicate that N$\pi$ scattering in the elastic approximation alone does not describe a low-lying Roper. Coupled channel effects between $N\pi$ and $N\pi\pi$ seem to be crucial to render a low-lying Roper in experiment, reinforcing the notion that this state could be a dynamically generated resonance. After giving a brief motivation for studying the Roper channel and the relevant technical details to this study, we will discuss the results and the conclusions based on our lattice investigation and in comparison with other lattice calculations.
