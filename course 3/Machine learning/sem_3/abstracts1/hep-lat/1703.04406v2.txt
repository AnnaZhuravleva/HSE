Numerical stochastic perturbation theory is a powerful tool for estimating high-order perturbative expansions in lattice field theory. The standard algorithms based on the Langevin equation, however, suffer from several limitations which in practice restrict the potential of this technique. In this work we investigate some alternative methods which could in principle improve on the standard approach. In particular, we present a study of the recently proposed Instantaneous Stochastic Perturbation Theory, as well as a formulation of numerical stochastic perturbation theory based on Generalized Hybrid Molecular Dynamics algorithms. The viability of these methods is investigated in $\varphi^4$ theory.
