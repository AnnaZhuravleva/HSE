The hypothesis that the QCD vacuum can be modeled as a dual superconductor is a powerful tool to describe the distribution of the color field generated by a quark-antiquark static pair and, as such, can provide useful clues for the understanding of confinement. In this work we investigate, by lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the $SU(3)$ pure gauge theory and of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical mass settings, some properties of the chromoelectric flux tube at zero temperature and their dependence on the physical distance between the static sources. We draw some conclusions about the validity domain of the dual superconductor picture.
