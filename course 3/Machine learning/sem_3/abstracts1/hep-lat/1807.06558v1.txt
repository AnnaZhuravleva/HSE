In this paper we investigate, by means of numerical lattice simulations, the topological properties of the trace deformed $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory defined on $S_1\times\mathbb{R}^3$. More precisely, we evaluate the topological susceptibility and the $b_2$ coefficient (related to the fourth cumulant of the topological charge distribution) of this theory for different values of the lattice spacing and of the compactification radius. In all the cases we find results in good agreement with the corresponding ones of the standard $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb{R}^4$.
