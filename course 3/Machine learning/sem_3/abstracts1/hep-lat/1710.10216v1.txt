Based on a recent proposal according to which elementary particle masses could be generated by a non-perturbative dynamical phenomenon, alternative to the Higgs mechanism, we carry out lattice simulations of a model where a non-abelian strongly interacting fermion doublet is also coupled to a doublet of complex scalar fields via a Yukawa and an "irrelevant" Wilson-like term. In this pioneering study we use naive fermions and work in the quenched approximation. We present preliminary numerical results both in the Wigner and in the Nambu-Goldstone phase, focusing on the observables relevant to check the occurrence of the conjectured dynamical fermion mass generation effect in the continuum limit of the critical theory in its spontaneously broken phase.
