The ${\cal N} = 2^*$ Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions is a non-conformal theory that appears as a mass deformation of maximally supersymmetric ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang-Mills theory. This theory also takes part in the AdS/CFT correspondence and its gravity dual is type IIB supergravity on the Pilch-Warner background. The finite temperature properties of this theory have been studied recently in the literature. It has been argued that at large $N$ and strong coupling this theory exhibits no thermal phase transition at any non-zero temperature. The low temperature ${\cal N} = 2^*$ plasma can be compared to the QCD plasma. We provide a lattice construction of ${\cal N} = 2^*$ Yang-Mills on a hypercubic lattice starting from the ${\cal N} = 4$ gauge theory. The lattice construction is local, gauge-invariant, free from fermion doubling problem and preserves a part of the supersymmetry. This nonperturbative formulation of the theory can be used to provide a highly nontrivial check of the AdS/CFT correspondence in a non-conformal theory.
