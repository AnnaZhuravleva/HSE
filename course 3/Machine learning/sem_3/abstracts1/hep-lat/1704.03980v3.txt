We investigate the potential for using the canonical ensemble approach to determine the QCD phase diagram in the temperature - density plane. This approach allows us to study the finite baryon density regions where the well-known sign problem obstructs the standard lattice QCD numerical study. In order to make the canonical approach a reliable lattice QCD method, we perform careful error estimation, and estimate the reliable regions in real chemical potential which are related to truncation of higher canonical partition function terms, Zn. We compute the higher moments of the baryon number density including the kurtosis, and compare our results with information from relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments.
