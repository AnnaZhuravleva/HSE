We develop the dual description of $2+1$ SU(2) lattice gauge theory as interacting `abelian like' electric loops by using Schwinger bosons. "Point splitting" of the lattice enables us to construct explicit Hilbert space for the gauge invariant theory which in turn makes dynamics more transparent. Using path integral representation in phase space, the interacting closed loop dynamics is analyzed in the weak coupling limit to get the mass gap.
