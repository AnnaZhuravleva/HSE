In this paper we report our results on quarkonium spectral functions in the vector channel obtained from quenched lattice QCD simulations at $T\in[0.75, 2.25]~T_c$. The calculations have been performed on very large and fine isotropic lattices where both charm and bottom quarks can be treated relativistically. The spectral functions are reconstructed using the Maximum Entropy Method. We study the dissociation of quarkonium states from the temperature dependence of the spectral functions and estimate heavy quark diffusion coefficients using the low-frequency behavior of the vector spectral functions.
