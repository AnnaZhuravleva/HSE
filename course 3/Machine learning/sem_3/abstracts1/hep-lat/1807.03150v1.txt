In the basis of Fourier modes in field-space the elements of transfer-matrix for pure U(1) lattice gauge theory are explicitly obtained in terms of the plaquette-link matrix and summations on multiplicative Bessel functions. In this basis it is shown, 1) the transfer-matrix is block-diagonal, 2) all consisting vectors of a block are known based on an arbitrary block's vector, 3) the ground-state belongs to the zero-mode's block. The emergence of maximum in matrix elements as functions of gauge coupling is clarified. To illustrate the computational benefits in the Fourier basis, three matrix elements for $3\times 3$ and $10\times 10$ lattices in a range of gauge couplings are computed.
