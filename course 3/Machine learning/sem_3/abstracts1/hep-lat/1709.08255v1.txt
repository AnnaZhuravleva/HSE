In present work, we study an numerical approach to one dimensional finite volume three-body interaction, the method is demonstrated by considering a toy model of three spinless particles interacting with pair-wise $\delta$-function potentials. The numerical results are compared with the exact solutions of three spinless bosons interaction when strength of short-range interactions are set equal for all pairs.
