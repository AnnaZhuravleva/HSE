We show that, prepotential formulation of gauge theories on honeycomb lattice yields local loop states, which are free from any spurious loop degrees of freedom and hence exact and orthonormal. We also illustrate that, the dynamics of orthonormal loop states are exactly same in both the square and honeycomb lattices. We further extend this construction to arbitrary dimensions. Utilizing this result, we make a mean field ansatz for loop configurations for SU(2) lattice gauge theory in $2+1$ dimension contributing to the low energy sector of the spectrum. Using variational analysis, we show that, this type of mean loop configurations has two distinct phases in the strong and weak coupling regime and shows a first order transition at $g=1$. We then propose a reduced Hamiltonian to describe the dynamics of the theory within the mean field ansatz. We further work with the mean loop configuration obtained at the weak coupling regime and analytically calculate the spectrum of the reduced Hamiltonian. The spectrum matches with that of the existing literature in this regime, establishing our ansatz to be a valid alternate one which is far more easier to handle for computation.
