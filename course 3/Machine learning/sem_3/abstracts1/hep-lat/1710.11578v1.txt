Numerical simulations provide a controlled, non-perturbative method to investigate properties of conformal systems. These simulations can be performed using different lattice discretizations. It is, however, of utmost importance to ensure that the lattice simulations are in the same universality class as their continuum counterpart. Universality of lattice fermions is well established for QCD-like systems. In particular for staggered fermions the correct continuum QCD symmetries are recovered and flavor (taste) breaking terms disappear if the gauge coupling is tuned to the Gaussian fixed point at vanishing coupling. Conformal systems have an infrared fixed point where the gauge coupling does not vanish. A priori there is no reason for the taste breaking terms to vanish at the conformal fixed point. Thus in conformal systems staggered fermions might not be in the same universality class as continuum fermions.   We address the issue of fermion universality at a conformal fixed point by calculating the renormalized $\beta$ function using domain wall fermions with Symanzik gauge action and fully $O(a^2)$-improved Zeuthen gradient flow. First we investigate a system with ten fundamental flavors to validate our simulations and analysis methods. Next we test fermion universality in systems with twelve fundamental flavors. We find a qualitatively and quantitatively different renormalized $\beta$ function compared to results obtained with staggered fermions. This leads to the conclusion that the two fermion formulations are not in the same universality class which strongly impacts lattice field theory studies of conformal or near-conformal systems using staggered fermions.
