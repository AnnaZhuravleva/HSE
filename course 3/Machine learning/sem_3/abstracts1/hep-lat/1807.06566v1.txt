We present a detailed lattice calculation of the unpolarized isovector quark PDF from the large-momentum effective theory approach. In this calculation, the quasi-PDF is defined by a spatial correlator that is free from mixing with operators of the same dimension, and is nonperturbatively renormalized in a regularization-independent momentum subtraction scheme. The renormalized quasi-PDF is then matched to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ PDF at one-loop order in perturbative QCD. The lattice simulation is done using Gaussian-momentum-smeared source at $M_\pi=310$ MeV with the nucleon momentum $P_z \in \{1.7,2.15,2.6\}$ GeV. Five source-sink separations have been used in our analysis to control the systematics associated with excited-state contamination. The systematic errors due to renormalization and perturbative matching are carefully studied. The final result is in reasonable agreement with the PDF from the latest phenomenological analyses.
