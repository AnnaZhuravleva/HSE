We study theoretically entanglement and operator growth in a spin system coupled to an environment, which is modeled with classical dephasing noise. Since classical noise retains the unitarity of the time evolution, it does not destroy the quantum information. As a consequence, the main effect of noise is to introduce a new time scale which is proportional to the noise strength, as we obtain from a perturbative treatment. We numerically simulate the noisy spin dynamics and show that entanglement growth and its fluctuations are described by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Moreover, we find that the wavefront in the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC), which is a measure for the operator growth, propagates linearly with the butterfly velocity and broadens diffusively, with a diffusion constant that is larger than the one of spin transport. A comparison between the entanglement and butterfly velocities unveils that both of them are strongly suppressed with noise, consistent with our perturbative calculation, with the former being smaller than the latter. In our study, we focus on Markovian white noise but also discuss the role of non-Markovian noise.
