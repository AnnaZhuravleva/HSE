1/f noise at arbitrary low frequences is the way of existence of irreversibility in thermal motion governed by reversible laws of mechanics. This statement not once was confirmed in statistical mechanics beyond its traditional kinetical roughenings. Here we point out that in case of quantum statistical mechanics in principle it is sufficient to avoid such the roughening as the "Fermi golden rule". This means taking into account the time-energy uncertainty principle (time-frequency one in classical limit) and thus uncertainties in characteristics of real collisions and scatterings of particles and/or quanta. We consider the resulting "pseudo-kinetics" and demonstrate how it produces quantum 1/f-noise
