The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which dictates that all diagonal matrix elements within a small energy shell be almost equal, is a major candidate to explain thermalization in isolated quantum systems. According to the typicality argument, the maximum variations of such matrix elements should decrease exponentially with increasing the size of the system, which implies the ETH. We show, however, that the typicality argument does not apply to most few-body observables for few-body Hamiltonians when the width of the energy shell decreases at most polynomially with increasing the size of the system.
