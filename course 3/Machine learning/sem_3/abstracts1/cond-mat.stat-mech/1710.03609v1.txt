We study the 19-vertex model of Statistical Mechanics in a square with the domain wall boundary condition. Using the minimal set of generating flip actions we build a parametrized dynamic version of the model. For all observed dynamic weight values the equilibrium states exhibit clear limit shapes. Although the model in a way incorporates the 6-vertex model, the reason for the existence of the limit shape is fundamentally more general. We conclude with a further study relating the local path geometry to the macroscopic shape geometry.
