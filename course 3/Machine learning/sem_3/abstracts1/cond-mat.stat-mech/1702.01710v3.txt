We elaborate on the methodology to simulate bulk systems in the absence of time-reversal symmetry by the phase-fixed path-integral Monte Carlo method under (possibly twisted) periodic boundary conditions. Such systems include two-dimensional electrons in the quantum Hall regime and rotating ultracold Bose and Fermi gases; time-reversal symmetry is broken by an external magnetic field and the Coriolis force, respectively. We provide closed-form expressions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions for the thermal density matrix (or the Euclidean propagator) of a single particle on a flat torus under very general conditions. We then modify the multi-slice sampling method in order to sample paths by the magnitude of the complex-valued thermal density matrix. Finally, we demonstrate that these inventions let us study the vortex melting process of a two-dimensional Yukawa gas in terms of the de Boer interaction strength parameter, temperature, and rotation (Coriolis force). The bosonic case is relevant to ultracold Fermi-Fermi mixtures of widely different masses under rotation.
