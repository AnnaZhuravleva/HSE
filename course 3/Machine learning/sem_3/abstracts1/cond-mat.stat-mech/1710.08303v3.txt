A one-parametric stochastic dynamics of the interface in the quantized Laplacian growth with zero surface tension is introduced. The quantization procedure regularizes the growth by preventing the formation of cusps at the interface, and makes the interface dynamics chaotic. In a long time asymptotic, by coupling a conformal field theory to the stochastic growth process we introduce a set of observables (the martingales), whose expectation values are constant in time. The martingales are connected to degenerate representations of the Virasoro algebra, and can be written in terms of conformal correlation functions. A direct link between Laplacian growth and the conformal Liouville field theory with the central charge $c\geq25$ is proposed.
