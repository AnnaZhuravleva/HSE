In this work, we show that the dissipation in a many-body system under an arbitrary non-equilibrium process is related to the R\'{e}nyi divergences between two states along the forward and reversed dynamics under very general family of initial conditions. This relation generalizes the links between dissipated work and Renyi divergences to quantum systems with conserved quantities whose equilibrium state is described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble. The relation is applicable for quantum systems with conserved quantities and can be applied to protocols driving the system between integrable and chaotic regimes. We demonstrate our ideas by considering the one-dimensional transverse quantum Ising model which is driven out of equilibrium by the instantaneous switching of the transverse magnetic field.
