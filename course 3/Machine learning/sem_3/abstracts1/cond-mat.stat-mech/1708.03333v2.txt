We present two applications of emergent local Hamiltonians to speed up quantum adiabatic protocols for isolated noninteracting and weakly interacting fermionic systems in one-dimensional lattices. We demonstrate how to extract maximal work from initial band-insulating states, and how to adiabatically transfer systems from linear and harmonic traps into box traps. Our protocols consist of two stages. The first one involves a free expansion followed by a quench to an emergent local Hamiltonian. In the second stage, the emergent local Hamiltonian is "turned off" quasistatically. For the adiabatic transfer from a harmonic trap, we consider both zero- and nonzero-temperature initial states.
