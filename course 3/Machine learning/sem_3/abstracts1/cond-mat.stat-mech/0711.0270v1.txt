We study how the two-point density correlation properties of a point particle distribution are modified when each particle is divided, by a stochastic process, into an equal number of identical "daughter" particles. We consider generically that there may be non-trivial correlations in the displacement fields describing the positions of the different daughters of the same "mother" particle, and then treat separately the cases in which there are, or are not, correlations also between the displacements of daughters belonging to different mothers. For both cases exact formulae are derived relating the structure factor (power spectrum) of the daughter distribution to that of the mother. These results can be considered as a generalization of the analogous equations obtained in ref. [1] (cond-mat/0409594) for the case of stochastic displacement fields applied to particle distributions. An application of the present results is that they give explicit algorithms for generating, starting from regular lattice arrays, stochastic particle distributions with an arbitrarily high degree of large-scale uniformity.
