Spin models are widely studied in the natural sciences, from investigating magnetic materials in condensed matter physics to studying neural networks. Previous work has demonstrated that there exist simple classical spin models that are universal, in the sense that they can replicate the physics of all other classical spin models to any desired precision. However, all classical spin models which were previously known to be universal broke translational invariance. In this paper we demonstrate that there exist translationally invariant universal models. Our main result is to construct a translationally invariant Hamiltonian described by a single parameter that is universal. This means that there exists a single Hamiltonian which can replicate all classical spin physics, including every universality class, just by tuning a single parameter in the Hamiltonian and varying the size of the system that the Hamiltonian is acting on. This demonstrates that universality is not merely a consequence of inhomogeneous couplings in the Hamiltonian, and significantly strengthens previous results.
