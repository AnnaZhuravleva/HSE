We find the statistical weight of excitations at long times following a quench in the Kondo problem. The weights computed are directly related to the overlap between initial and final states that are, respectively, states close to the Kondo ground state and states close to the normal metal ground state. The overlap is computed making use of the Slavnov approach, whereby a functional representation method is adopted, in order to obtain definite expressions.
