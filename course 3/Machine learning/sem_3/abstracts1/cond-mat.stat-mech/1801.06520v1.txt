We provide a complete derivation of hydrodynamic equations for nonrelativistic systems based on quantum field theories of spinless Schr\"odeinger fields, assuming that an initial density operator takes a special form of the local Gibbs distribution. The constructed optimized/renormalized perturbation theory for real-time evolution enables us to separately evaluate dissipative and nondissipative parts of constitutive relations. It is shown that the path-integral formula for local thermal equilibrium together with the symmetry properties of the resulting action---the nonrelativistic diffeomorphism and gauge symmetry in the thermally emergent Newton-Cartan geometry---provides a systematic way to derive the nondissipative part of constitutive relations. We further show that dissipative parts are accompanied with the entropy production operator together with two kinds of fluctuation theorems by the use of which we derive the dissipative part of constitutive relations and the second law of thermodynamics. After obtaining the exact expression for constitutive relations, we perform the derivative expansion and derive the first-order hydrodynamic (Navier-Stokes) equation with the Green-Kubo formula for transport coefficients.
