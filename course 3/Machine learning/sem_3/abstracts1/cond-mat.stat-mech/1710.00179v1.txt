Hyperuniformity is a feature of some processes where correlations suppress fluctuations. Using a map to an interface picture we prove that a sequence of avalanche sizes of the Oslo Model are hyperuniform on long macroscopic timescales $M\gg M^*$ and Poisson-like on short timescales $M\ll M^*$, where the crossover point $M^*=L^{D(\tau-1)}$ is determined by the characteristic vertical fluctuations of the interfaces. Our results imply that, counterintuitively, more precise estimates of the moments of the avalanche size are obtained if the samples are correlated rather than if the samples are independent, implying a reduction of computing time for reliable estimates. We further show that when the driving site is chosen at random, the dominance of the drive noise over the interface noise prevents hyperuniformity. We support our findings with numerical results.
