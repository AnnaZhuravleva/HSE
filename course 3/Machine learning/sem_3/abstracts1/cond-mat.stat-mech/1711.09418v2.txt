Similarly to the system Hamiltonian, a subsystem's reduced density matrix is composed of blocks characterized by symmetry quantum numbers (charge sectors). We present a geometric approach for extracting the contribution of individual charge sectors to the subsystem's entanglement measures within the replica trick method, via threading appropriate conjugate Aharonov-Bohm fluxes through a multi-sheet Riemann surface. Specializing to the case of 1+1D conformal field theory, we obtain general exact results for the entanglement entropies and spectrum, and apply them to a variety of systems, ranging from free and interacting fermions to spin and parafermion chains, and verify them numerically. We find that the total entanglement entropy, which scales as $\ln L$, is composed of $\sqrt{\ln L}$ contributions of individual subsystem charge sectors for interacting fermion chains, or even $\mathcal{O} (L^0)$ contributions when total spin conservation is also accounted for. We also explain how measurements of the contribution to the entanglement from separate charge sectors can be performed experimentally with existing techniques.
