A four stroke quantum engine which alternately interacts with a measurement apparatus and a single heat bath is discussed in detail with respect to the average work and heat as well as to the fluctuations of work and heat. The efficiency and the reliability of such an engine with a harmonic oscillator as working substance are analyzed under different conditions such as different speeds of the work strokes, different temperatures of the heat bath and various strengths of the energy supplying measurement. For imperfect thermalization strokes of finite duration also the power of the engine is analyzed. A comparison with a two-temperature Otto engine is provided in the particular case of adiabatic work and ideal thermalization strokes.
