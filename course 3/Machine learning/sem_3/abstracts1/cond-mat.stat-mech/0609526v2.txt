The pathway model of Mathai (2005) mainly deals with the rectangular matrix-variate case. In this paper the scalar version is shown to be associated with a large number of probability models used in physics. Different families of densities are listed here, which are all connected through the pathway parameter 'alpha', generating a distributional pathway. The idea is to switch from one functional form to another through this parameter and it is shown that basically one can proceed from the generalized type-1 beta family to generalized type-2 beta family to generalized gamma family when the real variable is positive and a wider set of families when the variable can take negative values also. For simplicity, only the real scalar case is discussed here but corresponding families are available when the variable is in the complex domain. A large number of densities used in physics are shown to be special cases of or associated with the pathway model. It is also shown that the pathway model is available by maximizing a generalized measure of entropy, leading to an entropic pathway. Particular cases of the pathway model are shown to cover Tsallis statistics (Tsallis, 1988) and the superstatistics introduced by Beck and Cohen (2003).
