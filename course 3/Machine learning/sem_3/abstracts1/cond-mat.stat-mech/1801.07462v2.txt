We study the unitary dynamics of a one-dimensional gas of hard-core bosons trapped into a harmonic potential which varies periodically in time with frequency $\omega(t)$. Such periodic systems can be classified into orbits of different monodromies corresponding to two different physical situations, namely the case in which the bosonic cloud remains stable during the time-evolution and the case where it turns out to be unstable. In the present work we derive in the large particle number limit exact results for the stroboscopic evolution of the energy and particle densities in both physical situations.
