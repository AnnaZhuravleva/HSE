Floquet systems hold the promise to realize novel phases of matter without equilibrium counterpart. The coupling to a bath can stabilize a stationary state at finite energy density. We address here the nature of phase transitions in such systems at rapid drive, complementary to the Kibble-Zurek scenario at slow drive. While the infinitely rapidly driven limit exhibits a second order phase transition, here we reveal a universal mechanism showing that fluctuations associated to the first rotating wave correction drive the transition first order at any finite driving. The effect is rooted in the degeneracy of critical poles in weakly coupled higher Floquet-Brillouin zones, in some analogy to the Coleman-Weinberg or Halperin-Lubensky-Ma phenomenon. The critical exponents of the infinitely rapidly driven fixed point -- including a new, independent one -- can be probed experimentally upon smoothly tuning towards that limit.
