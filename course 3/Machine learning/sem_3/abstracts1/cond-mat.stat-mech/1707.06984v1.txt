The Dirac oscillator in a homogenous magnetic field exhibits a chirality phase transition at a particular (critical) value of the magnetic field. Recently, this system has also been shown to be exactly solvable in the context of noncommutative quantum mechanics featuring the interesting phenomenon of re-entrant phase transitions. In this work we provide a detailed study of the thermodynamics of such quantum phase transitions (both in the standard and in the noncommutative case) within the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics pointing out that the magnetization has discontinuities at critical values of the magnetic field even at finite temperatures.
