The issue of how time reversible microscopic dynamics gives rise to macroscopic irreversible processes has been a recurrent issue in Physics since the time of Boltzmann whose ideas shaped, and essentially resolved, such an apparent contradiction. Following Boltzmann's spirit and ideas, but employing Gibbs's approach, we advance the view that macroscopic irreversibility of Hamiltonian systems of many degrees of freedom can be also seen as a result of the symplectic non-squeezing theorem.
