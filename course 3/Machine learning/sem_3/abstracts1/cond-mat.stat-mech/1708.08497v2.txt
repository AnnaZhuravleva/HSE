We apply the method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to nonequilibrium systems. For unitary dynamics, the system Hamiltonian is separated into two parts. One of them defines the adiabatic states for the state to follow and the nonadiabatic transitions are prevented by the other part. This property is implemented to the nonequilibrium entropy production and we find that the entropy is separated into two parts. The separation represents the Pythagorean theorem for the Kullback-Leibler divergence and an information-geometric interpretation is obtained. We also study a lower bound of the entropy, which is applied to derive a trade-off relation between time, entropy and state distance.
