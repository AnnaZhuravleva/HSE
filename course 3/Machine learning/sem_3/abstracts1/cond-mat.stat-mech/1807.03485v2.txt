We study the decoherence properties of a two-level (qubit) system homogeneously coupled to an environmental many-body system S at a quantum transition (QT), considering both continuous and first-order quantum transitions (CQTs and FOQTs respectively). In particular, we consider a d-dimensional quantum Ising model as environment system S, and study the qubit decoherence (QD) dynamics along the global quantum evolution starting from pure states of the qubit and the ground state of S. This issue is discussed within dynamic finite-size scaling (DFSS) frameworks. We analyze the DFSS of appropriate QD functions. At CQTs they develop power laws of the size of S, with a substantial enhancement of the growth rate of the QD with respect to the case S is in normal noncritical conditions. The enhancement of the QD growth rate appears much larger at FOQTs, leading to exponential laws when increasing the size of S.
