The concurrence between first and the last sites of a fermionic spin chain containing a single boson is rigorously investigated at finite low temperature in the vicinity of a weak homogeneous magnetic field. We consider the boson as a mobile spin-1 particle through the chain and study concurrence without/under decoherence and express some interesting phase flip and bit flip reactions of the pairwise entanglement between first and the last half-spins in the chain. Our investigations show that the concurrence between two considered half-spins has different behavior for various positions of the single boson along the chain. Indeed, we realize that the single boson mobility has an essential role to probe the pairwise entanglement intensity between two spins located at the opposite ends of a fermionic chain. Interestingly, the entanglement remains alive for higher temperatures when the boson is the nearest neighbor of the first fermion. When the boson is at the middle of chain, it is demonstrated that the threshold temperature (at which the concurrence vanishes) versus decoherence rate can be considered as a threshold temperature boundary. These results pave the way to set and interpret the numerical and analytical expressions for utilizing quantum information in realistic scenarios such as quantum state transmission, quantum communication science and quantum information processing, where the both fermion-fermion and fermion-boson correlations should be taken in to account.
