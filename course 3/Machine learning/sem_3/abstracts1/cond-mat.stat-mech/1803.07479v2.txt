We study the melting of a domain wall, prepared as a certain low-energy excitation above the ferromagnetic ground state of the XY chain. In a well defined parameter regime the time-evolved magnetization profile develops sharp kink-like structures in the bulk, showing features of a phase transition in the hydrodynamic scaling limit. The transition is of purely dynamical nature and can be attributed to the appearance of a negative effective mass term in the dispersion. The signatures are also clearly visible in the entanglement profile measured along the front region, which can be obtained by covariance-matrix methods despite the state being non-Gaussian.
