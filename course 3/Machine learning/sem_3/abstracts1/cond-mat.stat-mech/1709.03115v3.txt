As an application of the classically decayable correlation in a quantum chaos system maintained over an extremely long time-scale (Matsui et al, Europhys.Lett. 113(2016),40008), we propose a minimal model of quantum damper composed of a quantum harmonic oscillator (HO) weakly interacting with a bounded quantum chaos system. Although the whole system obeys unitary evolution dynamics of only three quantum degrees of freedom, the mechanical work applied to the HO is stationary converted into the "internal energy" characterized by an effective temperature in an irreversible way over a sufficiently long time-scale, if the components of the quantum chaos system are mutually entangled enough. A paradoxical dependence of the duration time of the stationary conversion on the driving strength is also discussed.
