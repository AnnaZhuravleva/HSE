We study static and dynamical expectation values for a class of pure states. This class mimics non-equilibrium density matrices via the concept of quantum typicality and allows for a controlled preparation of expectation values close to or far away from their equilibrium values at arbitrary temperatures. While these pure states do not require specific types of observables, we investigate so-called binary operators such as local fermionic occupation numbers or local energy densities in the isotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain. For these two examples, we use numerical forward-propagation methods in real and imaginary time to demonstrate the accuracy of the pure-state approach within and outside the linear-response regime. At high temperatures, our numerical results show that the dynamics in all regimes is generated by a single correlation function. These numerical results are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions for binary operators.
