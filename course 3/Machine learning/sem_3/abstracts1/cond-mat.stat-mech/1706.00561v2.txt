The quantum fluctuations of the entropy production for fermionic systems in the Landauer-Buttiker non-equilibrium steady state are investigated. The probability distribution, governing these fluctuations, is explicitly derived by means of quantum field theory methods and analysed in the zero frequency limit. It turns out that microscopic processes with positive, vanishing and negative entropy production occur in the system with non-vanishing probability. In spite of this fact, we show that all odd moments (in particular, the mean value of the entropy production) of the above distribution are non-negative. This result extends the second principle of thermodynamics to the quantum fluctuations of the entropy production in the Landauer-Buttiker state. The impact of the time reversal is also discussed.
