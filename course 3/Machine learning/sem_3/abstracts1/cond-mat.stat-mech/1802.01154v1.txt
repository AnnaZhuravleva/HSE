We study charge transport and fluctuations of the (3+1)-dimensional massive Dirac theory. In particular, we focus on the steady state that emerges following a local quench whereby two independently thermalized halves of the system are connected and let to evolve unitarily for a long time. Based on the two-time von Neumann measurement statistics and exact computations, the scaled cumulant generating function associated with the charge transport is derived. We find that it can be written as a generalization of Levitov-Lesovik formula to the case in three spatial dimensions. In the massless case, we note that only the first four scaled cumulants are nonzero. Our results provide also a direct confirmation for the validity of the extended fluctuation relation in higher dimensions. An application of our approach to Lifshitz fermions is also briefly discussed.
