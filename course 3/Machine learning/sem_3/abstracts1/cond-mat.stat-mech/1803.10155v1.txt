We present detailed calculations for the partition function and the free energy of the finite two-dimensional Ising model with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions, variable aspect ratio, and anisotropic couplings on the square lattice, as well as for the corresponding free energy scaling functions. Therefore we discuss the dimer mapping, the interplay between its topology and the different types of boundary conditions. As a central result we show how both the finite system as well as the scaling form decay into contributions for the bulk, a characteristic finite-size part, and - if present - the surface tension and its emergence due to at least one antiperiodic boundary in the system. For the scaling limit we expand the proper finite-size scaling theory to the anisotropic case and show how this anisotropy can be absorbed into suitable scaling variables.
