We have investigated some of the thermodynamic properties of spin polarized liquid $^3\mathrm{He}$ at finite temperature using the lowest order constrained variational method. For this system, the free energy, entropy and pressure are calculated for different values of the density, temperature and polarization. We have also presented the dependence of specific heat, saturation density and incompressibility on the temperature and polarization.
