We compare results of the exact field theory of phase separation in two dimensions with Monte Carlo simulations for the $q$-state Potts model with boundary conditions producing an interfacial region separating two pure phases. We confirm in particular the theoretical predictions that below critical temperature the surplus of non-boundary colors appears in drops along a single interface, while for $q>4$ at critical temperature there is formation of two interfaces enclosing a macroscopic disordered layer. These qualitatively different structures of the interfacial region can be discriminated through a measurement at a single point for different system sizes.
