The classical cubic-lattice dimer model undergoes an unconventional transition between a columnar crystal and a dimer liquid, in the same universality class as the deconfined quantum critical point in spin-1/2 antiferromagnets but with very different microscopic physics and microscopic symmetries. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this transition has an emergent SO(5) symmetry relating quantities characterizing the two adjacent phases. While the low-temperature phase has a conventional order parameter, the defining property of the Coulomb liquid on the high-temperature side is deconfinement of monomers, and so the SO(5) symmetry relates fundamentally different types of objects. We study linear system sizes up to $L=96$, and find that this symmetry applies with an excellent precision that consistently improves with system size over this range. It is remarkable that SO(5) emerges in a system as basic as the cubic dimer model, with only simple discrete degrees of freedom. Our results are important evidence for the generality of the SO(5) symmetry that has been proposed for the NCCP$^1$ field theory. We describe a possible interpretation for these results in terms of a consistent hypothesis for the renormalization-group flow structure, allowing for the possibility that SO(5) may ultimately be a near-symmetry rather than an exact one.
