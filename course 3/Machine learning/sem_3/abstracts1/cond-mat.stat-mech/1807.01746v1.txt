We present our view in a standing debate about the definition and meaning of power-law entropies for continuous systems. Our suggestion is that such arguments should take into account the generalized operations of addition and multiplication induced by the power-law entropies' composition properties. To be concrete, we highlight our view using the case of the $q$- also known as "Tsallis", entropy.
