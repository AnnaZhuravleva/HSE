We explore the question as to whether quantum effects can yield a speedup of the non-equilibrium evolution of spin systems towards a classical thermal state. In our approach we exploit the fact that the thermal state of a spin system can be mapped onto a node-free quantum state whose coefficients are given by thermal weights. This perspective permits the construction of a dissipative -- yet quantum -- dynamics which encodes in its stationary state the thermal state of the original problem. We show for the case of an all-to-all connected Ising spin model that an appropriate transformation of this dissipative dynamics allows to interpolate between a regime in which the order parameter obeys the classical equations of motion under Glauber dynamics, to a quantum regime with an accelerated approach to stationarity. We show that this effect enables in principle a speedup of pattern retrieval in a Hopfield neural network.
