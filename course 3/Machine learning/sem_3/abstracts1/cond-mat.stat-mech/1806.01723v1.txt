We study noise-averaged observables for a system of exchange-coupled quantum spins (qubits), each subject to a stochastic drive, by establishing mappings onto stochastic models in the strong-noise limit. Averaging over noise yields Lindbladian equations of motion; when these are subjected to a strong-noise perturbative treatment, classical master equations are found to emerge. The dynamics of noise averages of operators displays diffusive behaviour or exponential relaxation, depending on whether the drive conserves one of the spin components or not. In the latter case, the second moment of operators -- from which the average subsystem purity and out-of-time-order correlation functions can be extracted -- is described by the Fredrickson-Andersen model, originally introduced as a model of cooperative relaxation near the glass transition. It is known that fluctuations of a ballistically propagating front in the model are asymptotically Gaussian in one dimension. We extend this by conjecturing, with strong numerical evidence, that in two dimensions the long-time fluctuations are in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, complementing a similar observation in random unitary circuits.
