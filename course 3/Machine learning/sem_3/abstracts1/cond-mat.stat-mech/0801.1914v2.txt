We give a closer look at the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) behavior in quasi-stationary states of the Hamiltonian Mean Field model, a paradigmatic one for long-range-interacting classical many-body systems. We present new calculations which show that, following their time evolution, we can observe and classify three kinds of long-standing quasi-stationary states (QSS) with different correlations. The frequency of occurrence of each class depends on the size of the system. The different microsocopic nature of the QSS leads to different dynamical correlations and therefore to different results for the observed CLT behavior.
