The standard approach in solving stochastic equations is eigenvector decomposition. Using separation ansatz $P(i,t)=u(i)e^{\mu t}$ one obtains standard equation for eigenvectors $Ku=\mu u$, where $K$ is, e.g., the rate matrix of the master equation. While universally accepted, the standard approach is not the only possibility. Using additive separation ansatz $S(i,t)=W(i)-\nu t$ one arrives at additive eigenvectors. Here we suggest a theory of such eigenvectors. We argue that additive eigenvectors describe conditioned Markov processes and derive corresponding equations. The formalism is illustrated by analyzing one-dimensional random walk. Differential equations for additive eigenvectors are derived for stochastic process corresponding to the telegraph equation. The equations are similar to the one-dimensional Dirac equations and have similar properties. Solutions of the obtained equations are compared with that of the Dirac equations and numerical simulations. We conjecture that the Dirac equations describe the additive eigenvectors for diffusion dynamics. The proposed theory of additive eigenvectors provides a new self-consistent description of stochastic processes with peculiar properties very different from that of the standard approach.
