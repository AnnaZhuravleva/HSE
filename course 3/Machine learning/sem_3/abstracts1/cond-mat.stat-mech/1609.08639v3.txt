We study an anisotropic variant of the $d$-dimensional imperfect Bose gas, where the asymptotic behaviour of the dispersion $\epsilon_{\bf k}$ at vanishing momentum $\bf{k}$ may differ from the standard quadratic form. The analysis reveals the key role of the shift exponent $\psi$ governing the asymptotic behaviour of the critical temperature $T_c(\mu)$ as a function of the chemical potential $\mu$ at $T_c\to 0$. We argue that the universality classes of Bose-Einstein condensation admitted by the model may be classified according to the allowed values of $\psi$ so that spatial dimensionality has only an indirect impact on the transition properties. We analyse the correlation function of the model and discuss its asymptotics depending on the direction. Both for the perfect and imperfect anisotropic Bose gases, the correlation function $\chi({\bf x})$ at $T>T_c$ turns out to show either exponential decay or exponentially damped oscillatory behaviour depending on the orientation of ${\bf x}$ with respect to the dispersion anisotropies.
