We study a fermion chain under continuous monitoring of local occupation numbers with arbitrary measurement rate. The resulting stochastic quantum trajectories preserve state pureness and Gaussianity, enabling numerical simulation of quantum trajectories with hundreds of fermions. We find that any amount of measurement becomes relevant beyond a cross-over scale, which is inverse proportional to the measurement/hopping ratio. At that scale, entanglement growth saturates and transport becomes classical-diffusive instead of coherent-ballistic. Fluctuations of entanglement are bounded and have Gaussian statistics. We provide a generalized hydrodynamics theory that agrees perfectly with numerical simulations. Implications for more general many-body systems under continuous monitoring are discussed.
