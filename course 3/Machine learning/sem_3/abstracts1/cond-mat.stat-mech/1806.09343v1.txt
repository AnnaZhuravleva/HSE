By exploring phase space hydrodynamics description of one-dimensional free Fermi gas, we discuss how systems settle down to steady states described by the generalized Gibbs ensembles through quantum quenches. We investigate time evolutions of the Fermions which are trapped in external potentials or a circle for a variety of initial conditions and quench protocols. We analytically compute local observables such as particle density and show that they always exhibit power law relaxation at late times. We find a simple rule which determines the exponent of the relaxation. Our findings are, in principle, observable in experiments in one dimensional free Fermi gas or Tonk's gas (Bose gas with infinite repulsion).
