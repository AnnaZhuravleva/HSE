We propose and study a conformal field theory (CFT) model with random position-dependent velocity that, as we argue, naturally emerges as an effective description of heat transport in certain one-dimensional quantum many-body systems with static random impurities. We present exact analytic results for this model that elucidate how purely ballistic heat waves in standard CFT can acquire normal and anomalous diffusive contributions due to static impurities. Our results include impurity-averaged Green's functions describing the time evolution of the energy density and the heat current, and an explicit formula for the thermal conductivity that, in addition to a universal Drude peak, has a non-trivial real regular contribution depending sensitively on the impurity correlations.
