In the present work, initially a mixed-three-spin (1/2,1,1/2) cell of a mixed-N-spin chain with Ising-XY model is introduced, for which pair spins (1,1/2) have Ising-type interaction and pair spins (1/2,1/2) have both XY-type and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya(DM) interactions together. An external homogeneous magnetic field B is considered for the system in thermal equilibrium. Integer-spins have a single-ion anisotropy property with coefficient {\zeta}. Then, we investigate the quantum entanglement between half-spins (1/2,1/2), by means of the concurrence. Classical correlation(CC) for this pair of spins is investigated as well as the concurrence and some interesting the temperature, the magnetic field and the DM interaction properties are expressed. Moreover, single-ion anisotropy effects on the correlation between half-spins is verified. According to the verifications based on the communication channels category by D. Rossini, V. Giovannetti and R. Fazio 63, we theoretically consider such tripartite spin model as an ideal quantum channel, then calculate its information transmission rate and express some differences in behaviour between this suggested model and introduced simple models in the previous works(chains without spin integer and DM interaction) from information transferring protocol point of view.
