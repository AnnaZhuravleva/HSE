We address systematically an apparent non-physical behavior of the free energy moment generating function for several instances of the logarithmically correlated models: the Fractional Brownian Motion with Hurst index $H = 0$ (fBm0) (and its bridge version), a 1D model appearing in decaying Burgers turbulence with log-correlated initial conditions, and finally, the two-dimensional logREM introduced in [Cao et al., Phys.Rev.Lett.,118,090601] based on the 2D Gaussian free field (GFF) with background charges and directly related to the Liouville field theory. All these models share anomalously large fluctuations of the associated free energy, with a variance proportional to the log of the system size. We argue that a seemingly non-physical vanishing of the moment generating function for some values of parameters is related to the termination point transition (a.k.a pre-freezing). We study the associated universal log corrections in the frozen phase, both for log-REMs and for the standard REM, filling a gap in the literature. For the above mentioned integrable instances of logREMs, we predict the non-trivial free energy cumulants describing non-Gaussian fluctuations on the top of the Gaussian with extensive variance. Some of the predictions are tested numerically.
