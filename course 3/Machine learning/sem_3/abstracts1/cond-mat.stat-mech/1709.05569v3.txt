We demonstrate a generalized notion of eigenstate thermalization for translation-invariant quasifree fermionic models: the vast majority of eigenstates satisfying a finite number of suitable constraints (e.g. fixed energy and particle number) have the property that their reduced density matrix on small subsystems approximates the corresponding generalized Gibbs ensemble. To this end, we generalize analytic results by Lai and Yang (Phys. Rev. B 91, 081110 (2015)) and illustrate the claim numerically by example of the Jordan-Wigner transform of the XX spin chain.
