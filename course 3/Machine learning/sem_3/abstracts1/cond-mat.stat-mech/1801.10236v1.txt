In this investigation, the displacement operator is revisited. We established a connection of the Hermitian version of this operator with the well-known Weyl ordering. Besides, we characterized the quantum properties of a simple displaced harmonic oscillator, as well as of a displaced anisotropic two-dimensional non-Hermitian harmonic oscillator. By constructing the partition functions for both oscillators, we were able to derive several thermodynamic quantities from their energy spectra. The features of these quantities were depicted and analyzed in details.
