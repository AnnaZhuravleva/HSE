The general formalism for the nonextensive statistics based on the Landsberg-Vedral entropy was derived. The formula for the first law of thermodynamics and the exact relations of the thermodynamic quantities to their ensemble averages were obtained. It was found that under the transformation $q\to 2-q$ the probabilities of microstates of the nonextensive statistics based on the Landsberg-Vedral entropy formally resemble the corresponding probabilities of the Tsallis statistics with escort probabilities. However, the nonextensive statistics with the Landsberg-Vedral entropy does not require introduction of the escort probabilities and generalized expectation values which are used in this version of the Tsallis statistics.
