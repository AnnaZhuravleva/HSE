We investigate the critical behavior and the duality property of the ferromagnetic $q$-state clock model on the square lattice based on the tensor-network formalism. From the entanglement spectra of local tensors defined in the original and dual lattices, we obtain the exact self-dual points for the model with $q \leq 5 $ and approximate self-dual points for $q \geq 6$. We calculate accurately the lower and upper critical temperatures for the six-state clock model from the fixed-point tensors determined using the higher-order tensor renormalization group method and compare with other numerical results.
