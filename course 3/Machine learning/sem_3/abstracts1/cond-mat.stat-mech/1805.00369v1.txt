Based on the results published recently [arXiv:1803.10155], the influence of surfaces and boundary fields are calculated for the anisotropic square lattice Ising model on finite lattices as well as in the finite-size scaling limit. Starting with the open cylinder, we apply first one and then two boundary fields along the perpendicular direction which can be homogeneous or staggered, representing open, symmetry-breaking, and the so called Brascamp-Kunz boundary conditions. Furthermore we examine the emergence of the surface tension due to one antiperiodic boundary in the system in the presence of symmetry breaking boundary fields, again for finite systems as well as in the scaling limit.
