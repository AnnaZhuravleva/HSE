We present the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) for an inhomogeneous medium with a position-dependent mass particle by making use of the Langevin equation in the context of an algebra inspired in nonextensive statistics. We show that the FPE for an inhomogeneous medium with non-constant diffusion coefficient is equivalent to a deformed FPE where the position space is deformed, the usual derivative is generalized, and the mass and diffusion coefficient remain constant. We obtain a deformed version of Theorem $H$, from which emerges a functional entropy that can be identified as the Kullback-Leibler one between the probability distributions of the particles and that of the medium. The formalism is illustrated when the confining potential is given by a square infinite well potential and a linear one. As a consequence, an asymmetry of the diffusion of the position space deformation is reported in both cases. In absence of a potential confining, the mean squared displacement is associated with an exponential law spreading corresponding to an hyper-ballistic diffusion.
