For the recently introduced $\mu$-deformed analog of Bose gas model ($\mu$-Bose gas model), its thermodynamical aspects e.g. total number of particles and the partition function are certain functions of the parameter $\mu$. This basic $\mu$-dependence of thermodynamics of the $\mu$-Bose gas arises through the so-called $\mu$-calculus, an alternative to the known $q$-calculus (Jackson derivative, etc.), so we include main elements of $\mu$-calculus. Likewise, virial expansion of EOS and virial coefficients, the internal energy, specific heat and the entropy of $\mu$-Bose gas show $\mu$-dependence. Herein, we study thermodynamical geometry of $\mu$-Bose gas model and find the singular behavior of (scalar) curvature, signaling for Bose-like condensation. The critical temperature of condensation $T^{(\mu)}_c$ depending on $\mu$ is given and compared with the usual $T_c$, and with known $T_c^{(p,q)}$ of $p,q$-Bose gas model. Using the results on $\mu$-thermodynamics we argue that the condensate of $\mu$-Bose gas, like the earlier proposed infinite statistics system of particles, can serve for effective modeling of dark matter.
