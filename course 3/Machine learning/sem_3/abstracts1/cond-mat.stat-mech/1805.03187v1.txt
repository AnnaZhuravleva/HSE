Height fluctuations are studied in the one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with periodic boundaries, with a focus on how late time relaxation towards the non-equilibrium steady state depends on the initial condition. Using a reformulation of the matrix product representation for the dominant eigenstate, the statistics of the height at large scales is expressed, for arbitrary initial conditions, in terms of extremal values of independent standard Brownian bridges. Comparison with earlier exact Bethe ansatz asymptotics leads to explicit conjectures for some conditional probabilities of non-intersecting Brownian bridges with exponentially distributed distances between the endpoints.
