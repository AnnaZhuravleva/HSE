We study quantum transport after an inhomogeneous quantum quench in the presence of a localised defect. We focus on free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice with a hopping defect and use an initial state with different densities on the left and right half of the system. By analytically deriving and numerically verifying the asymptotics of particle density and current at large times and distances, we demonstrate how the defect obstructs particle transport, resulting in partial preservation of the initial density difference between the two sides and in reduced steady state current in comparison with the defectless case. Our analytical results are exactly reproduced by a semiclassical treatment and generalised to an arbitrary non-interacting particle-conserving defect.
