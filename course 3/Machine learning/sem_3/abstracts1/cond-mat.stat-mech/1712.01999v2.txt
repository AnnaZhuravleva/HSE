This paper is a Reply paper to the Comment paper by Mondaini et.al. [arXiv:1711.06279]. We first distinguish the diagonal and the off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in each sector and in the whole Hilbert space, and then clarify their properties and their roles in thermalization. We argue that our formulation of the ETH in our letter is a standard and natural one in the context of thermalization, and that our results are qualitatively new and unexpected.
