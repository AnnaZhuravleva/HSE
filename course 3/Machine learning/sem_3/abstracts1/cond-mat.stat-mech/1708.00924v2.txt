The Lorentz symmetry and the space and time translational symmetry are fundamental symmetries of nature. Crystals are the manifestation of the continuous space translational symmetry being spontaneously broken into a discrete one. We argue that, following the space translational symmetry, the continuous Lorentz symmetry should also be broken into a discrete one, which further implies that the continuous time translational symmetry is broken into a discrete one. We deduce all the possible discrete Lorentz and discrete time translational symmetries in 1+1-dimensional spacetime, and show how to build a field theory or a lattice field theory that has these symmetries.
