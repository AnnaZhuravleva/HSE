We have proved the quantum mechanical H-theorem for dilute Bose and Fermi gases by generalizing the quantum Boltzmann equation for all possible many-body elastic collisions among the particles in the quantum gases within the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism. Previous study by Pauli did almost the same only for binary elastic collisions. We are considering all possible many-body elastic collisions for the current study. Our proof offers a better understanding to the foundation of the second law of thermodynamics for quantum gases.
