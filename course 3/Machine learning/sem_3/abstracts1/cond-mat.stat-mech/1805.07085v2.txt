Dynamical typicality refers to the property that two pure states, which initially exhibit (almost) the same expectation value for some given observable $A$, are very likely to exhibit also very similar expectation values when evolving in time according to the pertinent Schr\"odinger equation. We unify and generalize a variety of previous findings of this type for sufficiently high dimensional quantum mechanical model systems. Particular emphasize is put on the necessary and sufficient conditions, which the initial expectation value and the spectrum of $A$ have to fulfill.
