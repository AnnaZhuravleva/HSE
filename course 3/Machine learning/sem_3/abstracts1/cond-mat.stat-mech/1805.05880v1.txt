We present rigorous results for fluctuations and two-tag correlations of bounded functionals of ergodic Markov processes with a diagonalizable propagator, including projection-induced non-Markovian dynamics. They relate the statistics of functionals on arbitrary time-scales to the relaxation eigenspectrum. Exact results are derived for one- and two-tag local times in single-file diffusion, revealing non-trivial correlations between tagged particle histories and emerging collective dynamics at elevated densities. Our results unveil the intricate meaning of projection-induced memory on a trajectory level, invisible to ensemble-average observables, and allow for a detailed analysis of single-file experiments probing tagged particle exploration statistics. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of collective fluctuations breaking Markovianity and leading to subdiffusion.
