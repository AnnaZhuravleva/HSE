We study theoretically nonlinear dynamics in the Josephson junction, which maps onto an oscillating motion of an artificial atom under external forces and damping. With an appropriate driving condition, the Josephson particle undergoes the intriguing bistable dynamics near a saddle point in the energy landscape. The bifurcation mechanism provides a crucial component in superconducting quantum circuits with relevance to nondemolition measurements such as a high-fidelity readout of qubit states. We address the question of what the probability is of capture into either basin of attraction and answer to it both in classical and quantum dynamics. Consequently, we derive Arnold's probability formula and numerically analyze its implementation of the controlled dynamical switching between two steady states under the various nonequilibrium conditions.
