The topological theory of phase transitions was proposed on the basis of different arguments, the most important of which are: a direct evidence of the relation between topology and phase transitions for some exactly solvable models; an explicit relation between entropy and topological invariants of certain submanifolds of configuration space, and, finally, two theorems stating that, for a wide class of physical systems, phase transitions should necessarily stem from topological changes of some submanifolds of configuration space. It has been recently shown that the $2D$ lattice $\phi^4$-model provides a counterexample that falsifies the mentioned theorems. On the basis of a numerical investigation, the present work indicates the way to overcome this difficulty: in spite of the absence of critical points of the potential in correspondence of the transition energy, the phase transition of this model stems from an asymptotic ($N\to\infty$) change of topology of the energy level sets.
