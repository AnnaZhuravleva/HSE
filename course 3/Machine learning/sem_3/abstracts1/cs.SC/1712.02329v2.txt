In this paper we briefly discuss Rings --- an efficient lightweight library for univariate and multivariate polynomial arithmetic over arbitrary coefficient rings. Basic algebra, GCDs and factorization of polynomials are implemented with the use of modern asymptotically fast algorithms. Rings provides a clean API for algebra and a fully typed hierarchy of mathematical structures. Scala API additionally brings powerful strongly typed functional programming model which allows to write short and expressive code for applications. Performance achieved in Rings is similar to such well known specialized solutions like Singular and considerably better than in some general-purpose systems like Mathematica.
