Computations with integro-differential operators are often carried out in an associative algebra with unit, and they are essentially non-commutative computations. By adjoining a cocommutative co-product, one can have those operators perform act on a bialgebra isomorphic to an enveloping algebra. That gives an adequate framework for a computer-algebra implementation via monoidal factorization, (pure) transcendence bases and Poincar\'e--Birkhoff--Witt bases. In this paper, we systematically study these deformations, obtaining necessary and sufficient conditions for the operators to exist, and we give the most general cocommutative deformations of the shuffle co-product and an effective construction of pairs of bases in duality. The paper ends by the combinatorial setting of local systems of coordinates on the group of group-like series.
