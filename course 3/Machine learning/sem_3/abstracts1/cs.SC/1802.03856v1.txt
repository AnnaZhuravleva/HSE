In this paper, we give quantum algorithms for two fundamental computation problems: solving polynomial systems and optimization over finite fields. The quantum algorithms can solve these problems with any given probability and have complexities polynomial in the size of the input and the condition number of certain polynomial system related to the problem. So, we achieved exponential speedup for these problems when their condition numbers are small. As special cases of the optimization problem, quantum algorithms are given for the polynomial systems with noise, the short integer solution problem, cryptanalysis for the lattice based NTRU cryptosystems. The main technical contribution of the paper is how to reduce polynomial system solving and optimization over finite fields into the determination of Boolean solutions of a polynomial system over C, under the condition that the number of variables and the total sparseness of the new system is well controlled.
