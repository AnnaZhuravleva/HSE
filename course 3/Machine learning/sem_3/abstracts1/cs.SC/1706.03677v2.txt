An improved multi-summation approach is introduced and discussed that enables one to simultaneously handle indefinite nested sums and products in the setting of difference rings and holonomic sequences. Relevant mathematics is reviewed and the underlying advanced difference ring machinery is elaborated upon. The flexibility of this new toolbox contributed substantially to evaluating complicated multi-sums coming from particle physics. Illustrative examples of the functionality of the new software package RhoSum are given.
