Verifiable blind quantum computing allows a client with poor quantum devices to delegate universal quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that the client's privacy is protected and the honesty of the server is verified. In existing protocols, the client has to send single-qubit states to the server. These states might be decohered by the channel noise. Furthermore, the client hides some "trap" qubits in the server's register so that the client can detect the server's deviation. In reality, however, these trap qubits are disturbed by imperfect operations by the server, which reduces the probability that the client accepts the honest server. To solve these problems, we propose a new gadget that allows the client to remotely prepare encoded logical single-qubit states in the server's place. Importantly, in our fault-tolerant verifiable blind quantum computing protocol, the client needs only the ability of physical single-qubit measurements in $X$ and $Z$ bases.
