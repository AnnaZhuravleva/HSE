This article discusses the essential difficulties in developing model-checking techniques for quantum systems that are never present in model checking classical systems. It further reviews some early researches on checking quantum communication protocols as well as a new line of researches pursued by the authors and their collaborators on checking general quantum systems, applicable to both physical systems and quantum programs.
