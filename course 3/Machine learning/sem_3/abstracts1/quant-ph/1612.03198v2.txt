Macroscopic mechanical qubits are fundamental both to test the classical-quantum boundary and present suitable candidates for quantum information processing. Motivated by these, we propose a feasible probabilistic scheme to generate an on-demand mechanical qubit, as well as Schr\"{o}dinger's cat and Fock number states. In order to accomplish this proposal, we study an open dispersive spin-mechanical system in the absence of any external driving. The procedure is solely based on spin post-selection in the weak coupling regime. Through this scheme we demonstrate that the achieved superposition is closely related to the amplification of the mean values of the mechanical quadratures as they are associated to the maximum quantum coherence.
