In this paper, a method to accelerate population transfer by designing nonadiabatic evolution paths is proposed. We apply the method to realize robust and accelerated population transfer with a transmon qutrit. By numerical simulation, we show that this method allows a robust population transfer between the ground states in a $\Lambda$ system. Moreover, the total pulse area for the population transfer is low as 1.9$\pi$ that verifies the evolution is accelerated without increasing the pulse intensity. Therefore, the method is easily implementable based on the modern pulse shaper technology and it provides selectable schemes with interesting applications in quantum information processing.
