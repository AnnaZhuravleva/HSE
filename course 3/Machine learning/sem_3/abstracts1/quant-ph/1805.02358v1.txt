We theoretically study the effects of loss on the phase sensitivity of an SU(1,1) interferometer with parity detection with various input states. We show that although the sensitivity of phase estimation decreases in the presence of loss, it can still beat the shot-noise limit with small loss. To examine the performance of parity detection, the comparison is performed among homodyne detection, intensity detection, and parity detection. Compared with homodyne detection and intensity detection, parity detection has a slight better optimal phase sensitivity in the absence of loss, but has a worse optimal phase sensitivity with a significant amount of loss with one-coherent state or coherent $\otimes$ squeezed state input.
