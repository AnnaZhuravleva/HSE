Finding strategies to preserve quantum resources in open systems is nowadays a main requirement for reliable quantum-enhanced technologies. We address this issue by considering structured cavities embedding qubits whose transition frequency is modulated by a driving field. We first focus on a single-qubit system to determine the optimal modulation parameters and the qubit-cavity coupling regime allowing a long-time preservation of both coherence and quantum Fisher information. We relate this behavior to the inhibition of the qubit effective decay rate rather than to stronger memory effects (non-Markovianity) of the system. We then use these findings to efficiently control resources like entanglement, discord and coherence in a system of two separated qubits. We discuss the feasibility of the system and show that individual qubit frequency modulation can produce quantum resource lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than their natural (uncontrolled) decay times. These results provide new useful insights towards efficient experimental strategies against decoherence.
