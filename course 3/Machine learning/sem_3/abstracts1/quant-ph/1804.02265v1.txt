We reconstruct finite-dimensional quantum theory from categorical principles. That is, we provide properties ensuring that a given physical theory described by a dagger compact category in which one may "discard" systems is equivalent to a generalised finite-dimensional quantum theory over a suitable ring S. The principles used resemble those due to Chiribella, D'Ariano and Perinotti. Unlike previous reconstructions, our axioms and proof are fully categorical in nature, in particular not requiring tomography assumptions. Specialising the result to probabilistic theories we obtain either traditional quantum theory with S being the complex numbers, or that over real Hilbert spaces with S being the reals.
