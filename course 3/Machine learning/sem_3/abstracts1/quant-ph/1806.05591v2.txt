Traditionally, quantum state correlation can be obtained with calculations on a state density matrix already known. Here, we propose a model with which correlations of unknown quantum states can be obtained. There are no needs of classical communication in the course of coupling, optimization and complicated calculations. All we need are weak coupling and ancillary systems. We detail the model on the state in which particles belong to the different owners. A concisely example is elaborated in the last part of this paper.
