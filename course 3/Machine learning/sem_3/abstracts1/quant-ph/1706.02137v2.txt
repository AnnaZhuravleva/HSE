We investigate an operational description of identical noninteracting particles in multiports. In particular we look for physically motivated restrictions that explain their bunching probabilities. We focus on a symmetric 3-port in which a triple of superquantum particles admitted by our generalized probabilistic framework would bunch with probability 3/4. The bosonic bound of 2/3 can then be restored by imposing the additional requirement of product evolution of certain input states. These states are characterized by the fact that, much like composite systems, their entropy equals the sum of entropies of its one-particle substates. This principle is however not enough to exclude the possibility of superquantum particles in higher-order multiports.
