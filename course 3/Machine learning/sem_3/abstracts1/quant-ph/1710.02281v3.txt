A fundamental requirement of quantum information processing is the protection from the adverse effects of decoherence and noise. Decoherence-free subspaces and geometric processing are important steps of quantum information protection. Here, we provide a new experimentally feasible scheme to combine decoherence-free subspaces with nonadiabatic geometric manipulations to attain a universal quantum computation. The proposed scheme is different from previous proposals and is based on the typical XY interaction coupling, which can be set up in various nano-engineered systems and therefore open up for realization of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces.
