In the present article we extend our study (BJP 45 (2015) 369) of generalized coherent states (GCS) of a one-dimensional particle considering such important physical system as a 3-dimensional charged particle in electric and magnetic fields. Constructing GCS in many-dimensional case, we meet nontrivial technical complications that make the consideration nontrivial and instructive. The GCS of a system under consideration are constructed. We study properties of these GCS such as completeness relations, minimization of uncertainty relations and so on. We point out which family of the obtained GCS of a charged particle in magnetic field is related with the CS constructed first by Malkin and Man'ko. We obtain conditions under which some of the GCS can be considered as semiclassical states.
