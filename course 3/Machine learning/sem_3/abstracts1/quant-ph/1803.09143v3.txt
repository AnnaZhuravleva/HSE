Majorana geometric representation of pure N-qubit states obeying exchange symmetry is em- ployed to explore spin squeezing properties in the family of states with two distinct spinors. Dicke states are characterized by two orthogonal spinors and belong to this family - but they are not spin squeezed. On the otherhand, those constituted by two non-orthogonal spinors exhibit spin squeezing.
