Inspired by the works of [F. Caruso, New J. Phys. 16, 055015 (2014)] and [T. Scholak et al, J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 44 184012 (2011)], which state that for a large class of complex noisy networks, the optimal efficiency of quantum transport is universally obtained by mixing coherent (Hamiltonian) and incoherent (noisy) parts where the contribution of the coherent part is strictly more than incoherent one, we examine the effect of oscillatory deformations on two simple prototypes in order to study their effects on the efficiency of coherent and incoherent energy transport. The prototypes are interchangeable to each other only by a simple phase modulation, such that the dynamics for the first type is only coherent, while for the second one the coherent evolution is completely suppressed and the evolution of the system is only incoherent (noisy). In this regard, it is shown that there exist a special deformation by which the efficiency of incoherent transport becomes better than the coherent one. This result suggests that in the noisy networks with collective harmonic motions, the optimality of transport can be occurred in such a way that the contribution of incoherent term is more than the coherent one.
