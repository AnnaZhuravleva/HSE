"action at a distance" is a weird concept in quantum theory which people always avoid mentioning in most occasions. In this work, without involving any concept about "action at a distance", we naturally construct a physical structure that resembles quantum entanglement only based on the nonlocality of the wave function. To achieve this, we propose a nonlocal structure of the single particle wave function by means of a double-well potential model. In order to better describe this nonlocal system, we have also developed two kinds of representations: local representation and nonlocal representation. Based on this nonlocal structure, we obtain a generalized exclusion principle in the case of antisymmetric nonlocal wave function of the multiparticle, with which we construct the entangled physical structure as mentioned before. In addition, we invent a diagram method to describe this entanglement structure and obtained some general conclusions.
