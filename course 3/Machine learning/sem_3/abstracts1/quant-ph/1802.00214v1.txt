Entanglement in multipartite quantum systems is much more elusive than its bipartite counterpart. In recent past the usefulness of multipartite entangled states in several information theoretic tasks have been demonstrated. Being a resource, the detection of multipartite entanglement is an imperative necessity. Among the different classes of multipartite entangled states the Dicke state has found importance in several tasks due to its permutation symmetric nature. In this work we propose a simple and elegant way of detecting n qubit Dicke states using permutation symmetric Bell operators. We conjecture that maximal expectation value of the operator corresponds to the detection of Dicke states.
