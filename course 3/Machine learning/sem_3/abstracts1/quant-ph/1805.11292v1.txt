Recently, an explicit relation between a measure of entanglement and a geometric entity has been reported in Quantum Inf. Process. (2016) 15:1629-1638. It has been shown that if a qubit gets entangled with another ancillary qubit then negativity, up to a constant factor, is equal to square root of a specific Riemannian metric defined on the metric space corresponding to the state space of the qubit. In this article, we consider the different class of bi-partite entangled states and show explicit relation between two measures of entanglement and Riemannian metric.
