Recently a complete set of entropic conditions has been derived for the interconversion structure of states under quantum operations that respect a specified symmetry action, however the core structure of these conditions is still only partially understood. Here we develop a coarse-grained description with the aim of shedding light on both the structure and the complexity of this general problem. Specifically, we consider the degree to which one can associate a basic `shape' property to a quantum state or channel that captures coarse-grained data either for state interconversion or for the use of a state within a simulation protocol. We provide a complete solution for the two-qubit case under the rotation group, give analysis for the more general case and discuss possible extensions of the approach.
