A quantum walk describes the discrete unitary evolution of a quantum particle on a graph. Some quantum walks, referred to as the Weyl and Dirac quantum walks, provide a description the free evolution of relativistic quantum fields in a regime where the wave-vectors involved in the particle state are small. The clash between the intrinsic discreteness of quantum walks and the symmetries of the dynamic equations they give rise to, can be resolved by rethinking the notion of a change of inertial reference frame. We give here a definition of the latter that avoids a pre-defined space-time geometry, and apply it to the case of the Dirac walk in 1+1 dimensions. The change of inertial reference frame is defined as a change of values of the constants of motion that leaves the walk operator unchanged. Remarkably, if one considers the Dirac walk with a fixed value of the mass parameter, the group of allowed changes of reference frame reduces to the trivial group. We then introduce a unique walk encompassing all values of mass as an extra degree of freedom, that is the value of the mass parameter. After deriving the graph corresponding to the new walk, we proceed to the analysis of the symmetry group, and we find that it consists in a realization of the Poincare group in 2+1 dimensions. Since one space-like dimension does not correspond to an actual spatial degree of freedom, representing instead the mass, the group is interpreted as a 2+1 dimensional version of the de-Sitter group.
