Quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes without entanglement have huge advantages in scalability and are easier to realize as they only require sequential communications of a single quantum system. However, these schemes often come with drawbacks such as exact (n; n) structure, flaws in security and in lack of effective cheating detection, which need urgent optimizations. To address this, we propose a verifiable framework of utilizing entanglement-free states to construct (t; n)-QSS schemes. Our work is the first step towards perfect security in entanglement-free QSS, and it sheds light on how to establish effective verification mechanism against cheating. As a result, the proposed framework has a significant importance in constructing QSS schemes for versatile applications in quantum networks due to its intrinsic scalability, flexibility and perfect security.
