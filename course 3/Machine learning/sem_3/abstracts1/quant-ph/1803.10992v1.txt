We observe the unconventional photon blockade effect in quantum dot cavity QED, which, in contrast to conventional photon blockade, operates in the weak coupling regime. A single quantum dot transition is simultaneously coupled to two orthogonally polarized optical cavity modes, and by careful tuning of the input and output state of polarization, the unconventional photon blockade effect is observed. We find a minimum second-order correlation $g^{(2)}(0)\approx0.37$ which corresponds to $g^{(2)}(0)\approx0.005$ when corrected for detector jitter, and observe the expected polarization dependency and photon bunching and anti-bunching very close-by in parameter space, which indicates the abrupt change from phase to amplitude squeezing.
