Tomographic probability representation of multimode electromagnetic field states in the scheme of center-of-mass tomography is reviewed. Both connection of the field state Wigner function and observable Weyl symbols with the center-of-mass tomograms as well as connection of Gr\"onewold kernel with the center-of-mass tomographic kernel determining the noncommutative product of the tomograms are obtained. The dual center-of-mass tomogram of the photon states are constructed and the dual tomographic kernel is obtained. The models of other generalised center-of-mass tomographies are discussed. Example of two-mode Schr\"odinger cat states is presented in details
