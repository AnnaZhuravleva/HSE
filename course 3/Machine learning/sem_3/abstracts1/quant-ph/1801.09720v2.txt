In this paper, we present a fixed-quantum circuit design for the simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamics, $\mathcal{H}(t)$, through the truncated Taylor series method described by Berry et al. [1]. The circuit is general and can be used to simulate any given matrix in the phase estimation algorithm by only changing the angle values of the quantum gates implementing the time variable $t$ in the series. In addition, a simple divide and conquer method is presented for mapping the Hamiltonians which are not given as sums of unitary matrices into the circuit. The circuit complexity depends on the number of summation terms composing the Hamiltonian and is bounded by $O(N^2)$ number of $CNOT$ gates for any matrix of dimension $N$. We also discuss how to use the circuit in adaptive processes and eigenvalue related problems along with a slight modified version of the iterative phase estimation algorithm.
