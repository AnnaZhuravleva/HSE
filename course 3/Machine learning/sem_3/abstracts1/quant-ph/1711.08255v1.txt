Side channel effects such as temporal disparity and intensity fluctuation of photon pulses caused by random bit generation with multiple laser diodes in high-speed polarization-based BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can be eliminated by increasing DC bias current condition. However, background photons caused by the spontaneous emission process under high DC bias current degrade the performance of the QKD systems. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the effects of spontaneously emitted photons on the system performance in a high-speed QKD system at a clock rate of 400 MHz. Also, we further show improvements of system performance without side channel effects by utilizing temporal filtering technique with real-time FPGA signal processing.
