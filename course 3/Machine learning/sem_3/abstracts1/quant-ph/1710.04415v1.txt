Floquet exceptional points correspond to the coalescence of two (or more) quasi-energies and corresponding Floquet eigenstates of a time-periodic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. They generally arise when the oscillation frequency satisfies a multiphoton resonance condition. Here we discuss the interplay between Floquet exceptional points and the chiral dynamics observed, over several oscillation cycles, in a wide class of non-Hermitian systems when they are slowly cycled in opposite directions of parameter space.
