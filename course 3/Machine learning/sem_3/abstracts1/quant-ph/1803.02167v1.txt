A dissipative scheme is proposed to prepare tripartite $W$ state in a Rydberg-atom-cavity system. It is an organic combination of quantum Zeno dynamics, Rydberg antiblockade and atomic spontaneous emission to turn the tripartite $W$ state into the unique steady state of the whole system. The robustness against the loss of cavity and the feasibility of the scheme are demonstrated thoroughly by the current experimental parameters, which leads to a high fidelity above $98\%$.
