We find a simple model of an insulating state of a quantum wire which has a single isolated edge mode. We argue that, when brought to proximity, the edge modes on independent wires naturally form Bell entangled states which could be used for elementary quantum processes such as teleportation. We give an example of an algorithm which teleports the spin state of an electron from one quantum wire to another.
