In the first paper of this series, I introduced a non-linear, Hamiltonian, generalization of Schroedinger's theory that blocks formation of macroscopic dispersion ("cats"). But that theory was entirely deterministic, and so the origin of random outcomes in experiments such as Stern-Gerlach or EPRB was left open. Here I propose that Schroedinger's wavefunction has a random component and demonstrate that such an improvised stochastic theory can violate Bell's inequality. Repeated measurements and the back-reaction on the microsystem are discussed in a toy example. Experiments that might falsify the theory are described.
