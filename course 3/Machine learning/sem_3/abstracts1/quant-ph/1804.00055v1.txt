The Schur transform is a unitary operator that block diagonalizes the action of the symmetric and unitary groups on an $n$ fold tensor product $V^{\otimes n}$ of a vector space $V$ of dimension $d$. Bacon, Chuang and Harrow \cite{BCH07} gave a quantum algorithm for this transform that is polynomial in $n$, $d$ and $\log\epsilon^{-1}$, where $\epsilon$ is the precision. Following this, it had been an open question whether one can obtain an algorithm that is polynomial in $\log d$. In a footnote in Harrow's thesis \cite{H05}, a brief description of how to make the algorithm of \cite{BCH07} polynomial in $\log d$ is given using the unitary group representation theory (however, this has not been explained in detail anywhere). In this article, we present a quantum algorithm for the Schur transform that is polynomial in $n$, $\log d$ and $\log\epsilon^{-1}$ using a different approach. We build this transform using the representation theory of the symmetric group and in this sense our technique can be considered a "dual" algorithm to \cite{BCH07}. A novel feature of our algorithm is that we construct the quantum Fourier transform over permutation modules that could have other applications.
