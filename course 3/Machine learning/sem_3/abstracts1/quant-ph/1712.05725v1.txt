This letter provides an exact formula for the signal $n$-point correlation functions of detectors continuously measuring an arbitrary quantum system. The derivation uses only continuous stochastic calculus techniques, but the final result is easily understood from a discrete picture of repeated interactions with qubits. Aside from its theoretical interest, this result allows to straightforwardly estimate system parameters directly from experimental data.
