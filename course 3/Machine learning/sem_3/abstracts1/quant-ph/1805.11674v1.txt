Quantum optimal control can play a crucial role to realize a set of universal quantum logic gates with error rates below the threshold required for fault-tolerance. Open-loop quantum optimal control relies on accurate modeling of the quantum system under control, and does not scale efficiently with system size. These problems can be avoided in closed-loop quantum optimal control, which utilizes feedback from the system to improve control fidelity. In this paper, two closed-loop quantum optimal control algorithms, the hybrid quantum-classical approach (HQCA) described in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 150503 (2017)] and the finite-difference (FD) method, are experimentally investigated and compared to open-loop quantum optimal control. We employ a solid-state ensemble of coupled electron-nuclear spins serving as a two-qubit system. Our experimental results demonstrate closed-loop quantum optimal control outperforms open-loop quantum optimal control. Furthermore, simulations reveal that HQCA is more robust to measurement noise than the FD method, but is susceptible to control field distortions due to hardware limitations.
