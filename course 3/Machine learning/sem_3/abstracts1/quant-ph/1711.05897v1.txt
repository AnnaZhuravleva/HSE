Quantum-optical research on semiconductor quantum dots puts special emphasis on the measurement of the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, arguing that $g^{(2)}(0)<1/2$ implies the source field represents a good single-photon light source. We analyze this claim theoretically. A quantum state of light having no projection on the single-photon Fock state can not give a value of $g^{(2)}(0)<1/2$. However, with solely the value of $g^{(2)}(0)$, the amplitude of this single-photon projection can be arbitrarily small, owing to vacuum contributions. Yet, one can determine a lower bound on the ratio of single-to-multi-photon emission from $g^{(2)}(0)$. For a fixed ratio of single-to-multi-photon emission, $g^{(2)}(0)$ is artificially enhanced by the vacuum contributions. We derive an effective second-order correlation function, which corrects this enhancement, substantially improving the lower bound. The results are applied to theoretical and realized experimental setups and indicate that the quality of solid-state single-photon sources, at least with respect to this criterion, is often underestimated.
