Measurement Device Independent Quantum Private Query (MDI QPQ) with qutrits is presented. We identified that this variant of QPQ protocol resists the optimization of both database security and client's privacy simultaneously. We compare the database security and client's privacy in MDI QPQ for qubits with qutrits. For some instances, we observe that qutrit will provide better security for database than qubit. However, when it comes to the question of client's privacy qubit will provide better security than qutrit. Hence we conclude that though in case of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) higher dimension provides better security but in case of QPQ this is not obvious.
