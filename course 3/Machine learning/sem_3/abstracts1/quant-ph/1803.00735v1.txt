The N-queens problem is to find the position of N queens on an N by N chess board such that no queens attack each other. The excluded diagonals N-queens problem is a variation where queens cannot be placed on some predefined fields along diagonals. The problem is proven NP-complete and for the excluded-diagonals variation the parameter regime to generate hard instances that are intractable with current classical algorithms are known. We propose a special purpose quantum simulator with the aim to solve the excluded diagonals N-queens completion problem using atoms and cavity mediated long range interactions. Our implementation has no overhead from the embedding allowing to directly probe for a possible quantum advantage in near term devices for optimization problems.
