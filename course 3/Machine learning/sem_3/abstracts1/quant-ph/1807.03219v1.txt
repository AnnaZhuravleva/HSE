Quantum secret sharing is a way to share secret messages amongst a number of clients in a group with unconditional security. For the first time, Hillery et al. [Phys. Rev. A 59, 1829 (1999)] proposed the quantum version of classical secret sharing protocol using GHZ states. Here, we implement this quantum secret sharing protocol in IBM 5-qubit quantum processor 'ibmqx4' and compare the experimentally obtained results with the theoretically predicted ones. The results are analyzed through quantum state tomography technique and the fidelity of these states were calculated for different number of executions made in the device. It is concluded that the experimental results match with the theoretical values with a high fidelity.
