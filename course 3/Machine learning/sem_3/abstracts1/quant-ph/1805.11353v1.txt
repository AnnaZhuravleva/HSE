The quantum-thermodynamical properties of (quasi-normal) overdamped electromagnetic modes (eddy currents) are investigated in the context of the magnetic Casimir-Polder interaction. The role of the material response in terms of spatially local and nonlocal material models is clarified. In particular, the focus is set on the systems entropy and a detailed discussion of the applicability of the Nernst theorem. In specific circumstances the spatially local (Drude) model reveals an "entropy defect", while spatial dispersion leads to a more regular behavior. The aim of this study is to present a physical explanation of the different mechanism at work in terms of the role that eddy modes play in the determination of the zero-temperature entropy.
