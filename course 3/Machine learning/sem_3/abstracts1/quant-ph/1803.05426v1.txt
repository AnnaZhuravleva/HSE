Tracking the behaviour of stochastic systems is a crucial task in the statistical sciences. It has recently been shown that quantum models can faithfully simulate such processes whilst retaining less information about the past behaviour of the system than the optimal classical models. We extend these results to the case of general temporal and symbolic dynamics in the continuous-time regime. Our construction relies only on the process' transition dynamic, and systematically self-assembles the corresponding causal architecture, in contrast to classical constructions, where equivalence relations must be explicitly applied. We illustrate our method with an example exhibiting an apparent unbounded memory advantage of the quantum model compared to the optimal classical.
