We propose a method for quantum enhanced phase estimation based on continuous variable (CV) quantum teleportation. The phase shift probed by a coherent state can be enhanced by repeatedly teleporting the state back to interact with the phase shift again using a supply of two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In this way, both super resolution and super sensitivity can be obtained due to the coherent addition of the phase shift. The protocol enables Heisenberg limited sensitivity and super- resolution given sufficiently strong squeezing. The proposed method could be implemented with current or near-term technology of CV teleportation.
