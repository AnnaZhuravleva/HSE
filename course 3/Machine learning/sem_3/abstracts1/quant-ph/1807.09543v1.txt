Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation has widespread applications in many fields. A challenging issue is to protect the estimation precision against the noise-induced decoherence. Previous approaches either regard the decoherence as given or try to eliminate all kinds of decoherence. Here we propose a very different but general method to improve the estimation precision by monitoring the noise-induced quantum trajectories without applying any corrective operations. This reveals how the noise-induced state collapses degrade the estimation precision, and further allows intercepting the information loss while avoiding faulty corrective operations. It can improve the estimation precision of an arbitrary parameter. Application of this method to estimate the level splitting and decoherence rate of a spin-1/2 under typical decoherence channels demonstrate that it can avoid the long-time exponential loss of the estimation precision and even recover the Heisenberg scaling. This paves a new way for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in noisy environments.
