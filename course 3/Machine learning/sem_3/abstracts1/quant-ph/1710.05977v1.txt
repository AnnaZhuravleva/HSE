When confined to small regions quantum systems exhibit electronic and structural properties different from their free space behavior. These properties are of interest, for example, for molecular insertion, hydrogen storage and the exploration of new pathways for chemical and nuclear reactions. Here, a confined three-body problem is studied, with emphasis on the study of the "quantum scars" associated to dynamical collisions. For the particular case of nuclear reactions it is proposed that a molecular cage might simply be used as a confining device with the collision states accessed by quantum control techniques.
