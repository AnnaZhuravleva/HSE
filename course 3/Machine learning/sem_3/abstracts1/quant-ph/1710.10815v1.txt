Realizing perfect two-photon entanglement from quantum dots has been a long-standing scientific challenge. It is generally thought that the nuclear spins limit the entanglement fidelity through spin flip dephasing processes. However, this assumption lacks experimental support. Here, we show dephasing-free two-photon entanglement from an Indium rich single quantum dot comprising of nuclear spin 9/2 when excited quasi-resonantly. This remarkable finding is based on a perfect match between our entanglement measurements with our model that assumes no dephasing and takes into account the detection system's timing jitter and dark counts. We discover that neglecting the detection system is responsible for not reaching perfect entanglement in the past and not the nuclear spins. Therefore, the key to unity entanglement from quantum dots comprises of a resonant excitation scheme and a detection system with ultra-low timing jitter and dark counts.
