Efficient coupling of single quantum emitters to guided optical modes of integrated optical devices is of high importance for applications in quantum information science as well as in the field of sensing. Here we present the design and fabrication of a platform for on-chip experiments based on dielectric optical single-mode waveguides(Ta2O5 on SiO2). The design of the waveguide is optimized for broadband (600-800 nm) evanescent coupling to a single quantum emitter (expected efficiency: up to 36%) and efficient off-chip coupling to single-mode optical fibers using inverted tapers. First test samples exhibit propagation losses below 1.8 dB/mm and off-chip coupling efficiencies exceeding 57%. These results are promising for efficient coupling of solid state quantum emitters like NV- and SiV-centers to a single optical mode of a nanoscale waveguide.
