The celebrated BB84 protocol was proposed in 1984 by Bennett and Brassard to distribute a secret key between two legitimate parties with a promise for unconditional security. An optimal unitary attack on this protocol using an ensemble of probes was first established by Fuchs \etal.~[\hyperref{http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.56.1163}{category}{name}{Phys. Rev. A, 1997}]. They derived the maximum information that could be learned by an eavesdropper, and specified an optimal interaction (post-interaction joint state) for that. Infinitely many such optimal interactions were derived by Acharyya \etal.~[\hyperref{http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.022326}{category}{name}{Phys. Rev. A, 2017}]. For practical purposes, all an eavesdropper needs to know is the specification of the optimal unitary evolution and the subsequent optimal measurement, as part of her optimal strategy. Finding an optimal unitary from a particular optimal post-interaction state is easy. But finding a closed form of the optimal unitaries for the whole family of optimal interactions is not so straightforward. Here we address this issue.
