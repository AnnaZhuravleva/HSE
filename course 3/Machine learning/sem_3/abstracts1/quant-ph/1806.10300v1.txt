Reducing the noise below the shot-noise limit in sensing devices is one of the key promises of quantum technologies. Here, by means of experiments and supported by a thorough theoretical analysis, we study quantum plasmonic sensing based on an attenuated total reflection configuration with single photons as input. Our sensor is the Kretschmann configuration with a gold film, and a blood protein in an aqueous solution with different concentrations serves as an analyte. The estimation of the refractive index is performed using heralded single photons. We also determine the estimation error from a statistical analysis over a number of repetitions of identical and independent experiments. We show that the errors of our plasmonic sensor with single photons are below the shot-noise limit even in the presence of various experimental imperfections. Our results demonstrate the practical application of quantum plasmonic sensing and paves the way for a future generation of quantum plasmonic applications based on similar techniques.
