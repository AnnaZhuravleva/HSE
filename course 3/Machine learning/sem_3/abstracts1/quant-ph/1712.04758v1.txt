We study the emission spectrum of a qubit under deep strong driving in the high-frequency dispersive regime when the driving frequency and strength exceed significantly the qubit transition frequency. Closed-form expressions for the steady-state first-order field correlation function and the multiphoton emission spectrum are obtained. The spectrum comprises a series of narrow delta-like lines that stem from coherent processes and Lorenzian peaks that result from the incoherent scattering of photons. The oscillating dependence of the widths of the emission lines on the driving strength is predicted. We show how the features of this dependence are governed by the qubit dephasing and relaxation rates.
