We study a system of spins (qubits) coupled to a common noisy environment, each precessing at its own frequency. The correlated noise experienced by the spins implies long-lived correlations that relax only due to the differing frequencies. We use a mapping to a non-Hermitian integrable Richardson-Gaudin model to find the exact spectrum of the quantum master equation in the high-temperature limit, and hence determine the decay rate. Our solution can be used to evaluate the effect of inhomogeneous splittings on a system of qubits coupled to a common bath.
