We propose a new method for implementing mutually unbiased generation and measurement of time-bin qudits using a cascade of electro-optic phase modulator -- coded fiber Bragg grating pairs. Our approach requires only a single spatial mode and can switch rapidly between basis choices. We obtain explicit solutions for dimensions $d=2,3,4$ that realize all $d+1$ possible mutually unbiased bases and analyze the performance of our approach in quantum key distribution. Given its practicality and compatibility with current technology, our approach provides a promising springboard for scalable processing of high-dimensional time-bin states.
