We propose a protocol which exploits the collective thermalisation of a bipartite system to extract work from another system. The protocol is based on a recently proposed work definition not requiring measurements and involving the presence of a single bath. A general description of the protocol is provided without specifying the characteristics of the bipartite system. We quantify both the extracted work and the ideal efficiency of the process also giving a maximum bound to the extracted work. Then, we apply the protocol to the case when the bipartite system is governed by the Rabi Hamiltonian while using a zero temperature bath. For very strong couplings, an extraction of work comparable with the typical energies of the subsystems and an efficiency greater than one half can be obtained.
