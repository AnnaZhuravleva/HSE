The photonic framework offers clues leading to a possible update of the foundations of quantum mechanics yet preserving its mathematical grounds. Reconsideration of quantum theoretic measurement theory warrants removal of ideological prejudices brought in by von Neumann Copenhagen interpretation. Conditions required to bridge abstract to laboratory space formulations of QM permit underscoring fundamental differences to the standard view; entanglement and sustainment concepts help in this task. Entanglement events integrate probing devices leading to q-measurements seen as physical processes. Representation elements based on classical physics pictures are removed. A non-representational framework stands up as a result.
