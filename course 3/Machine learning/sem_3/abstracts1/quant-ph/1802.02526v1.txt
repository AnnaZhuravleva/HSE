It is possible for two parties, Alice and Bob, to establish a secure communication link by sharing an ensemble of entangled particles, and then using these particles to generate a secret key. One way to establish that the particles are indeed entangled is to verify that they violate a Bell inequality. However, it might be the case that Bob is not trustworthy and wishes Alice to believe that their communications are secure, when in fact they are not. He can do this by managing to have prior knowledge of Alice's measurement device settings and then modifying his own settings based upon this information. In this case it is possible for shared particle states that must satisfy a Bell inequality to appear to violate this inequality, which would also make the system appear secure. When Bob modifies his measurement settings, however, he produces false correlations. Here we demonstrate experimentally that Alice can detect these false correlations, and uncover Bob's trickery, by using loop-state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) tomography. More generally, we demonstrate that loop SPAM tomography can detect false correlations (correlated errors) in a two-qubit system without needing to know anything about the prepared states or the measurements, other than the dimensions of the operators that describe them.
