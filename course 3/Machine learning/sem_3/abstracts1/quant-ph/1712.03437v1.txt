Chaos in Bohmian Quantum Mechanics is an open field of research. In general, most of the 3-d Bohmian trajectories are free to wander around the 3-d space. However there are cases where the evolution of the trajectories is dictated by exact or approximate integrals of motion. A first case corresponds to partial integrability, where the trajectories (ordered and chaotic) evolve on certain integral surfaces. A second case corresponds to ordered trajectories. In this paper we extend our previous work in 3-d Bohmian Chaos by using both forms of integrability and discuss their physical implications.
