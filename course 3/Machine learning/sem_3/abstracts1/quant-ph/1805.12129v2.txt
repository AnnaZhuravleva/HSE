Consider a unitary beam splitter $\rightrightarrows U \rightrightarrows $, i.e. a unitary map where we have divided the input and output into pairs of `ports'. Dimensions of the ports are arbitrary, finite or infinite. Now connect one output port with an input port by a feedback loop, so that only single external ports remain, $\rightarrow \underset{\circlearrowright}{U}\rightarrow$. The question is: Can we find such a $U$ that a part of an input signal will get trapped in the loop? If so, we could produce an interferometric analogue of a black hole. We prove that this is impossible. No matter which $U$ one selects the process $\psi_{\rm in}\rightarrow \underset{\circlearrowright}{U}\rightarrow \psi_{\rm out}$ implies $||\psi_{\rm in}||=||\psi_{\rm out}||$, i.e. a looped beam splitter is always fully reflecting. Since properties of both $U$ and the looped dynamics get encoded in the scattering phase shift, one can probe the otherwise unaccessible loop region by a Mach-Zehnder interferometry. The Elitzur-Vaidman `bomb' test with the bomb placed in the loop can be interpreted as an interferometric analogue of the `grandfather problem' in the presence of a closed time-like curve. However, here the `grandfather paradox' is absent in consequence of the looped interference. The formalism we employ is based on the standard superposition principle. As opposed to the Deutsch formalism, the loop does not lead to a nonlinear evolution. This is not surprising: An analogous topology occurs in Michelson interferometers but their description does not require nonlinear electrodynamics.
