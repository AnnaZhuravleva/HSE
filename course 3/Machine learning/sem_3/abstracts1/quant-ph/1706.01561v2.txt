The primary question in the emerging field of quantum machine learning (QML) is: can we achieve quantum speed-up of machine learning? and/or what and how the quantum effects contribute to the speed-up? The positive answers to such questions have recently been provided, for example, by the quantum support vector machine (QSVM) which classifies many quantum data vectors exponentially fast. However, to realize such an exponential learning speed-up, it is demanded to develop full-scale quantum computer with a specific quantum device, so-called "quantum random access memory (QRAM)"---which stores the classical big data, extremely fast, in the novel form of being quantum-mechanically superposed. Therefore, another question now arises: is it possible to attain quantum learning speed-up even with the classical training data, and hence, requiring no full-scale quantum computer and QRAM? To seek a satisfactory answer to this question, we consider a binary classification learning where the classicality of the training data are preserved. We then focus on a small unit structure for whole classification task, in which the minimum achievable quantum learning speed-up would be exhibited. We provide the analysis and proof-of-principle experimental validation of a certain degree of quantum learning speed-up in such a small unit, advocating an affirmative answer to the aforementioned main question. Through further investigation, it is also shown that our QML scheme is quite robust against the decoherence.
