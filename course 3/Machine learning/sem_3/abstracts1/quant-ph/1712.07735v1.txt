The efficiency of the frequency conversion process at the heart of Raman heterodyne spectroscopy was improved by nearly four orders of magnitude by resonant enhancement of both the pump and signal optical fields. Our results using an erbium doped Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal at temperatures near 4K suggest that such an approach is promising for the quantum conversion of microwave to optical photons.
