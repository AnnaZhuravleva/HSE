The negative-AND (NAND) gate is universal for classical computation making it an important target for development. A seminal quantum computing algorithm by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann has demonstrated its realization by means of quantum scattering yielding a quantum algorithm that evaluates the output faster than any classical algorithm. Here, we derive the NAND outputs analytically from scattering theory using a tight-binding (TB) model and show the restrictions on the TB parameters in order to still maintain the NAND gate function. We map the quantum NAND tree onto a conjugated molecular system, and compare the NAND output with non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) transport calculations using density functional theory (DFT) and TB Hamiltonians for the electronic structure. Further, we extend our molecular platform to show other classical gates that can be realized for quantum computing by scattering on graphs.
