Recently Gerard 't Hooft proposed a structure for a universe overwhelmed with a control by a Theory of Everything (arXiv:1709.02874). He concludes, among many other things, that such a universe could be fully deterministic and that, accordingly, the divine intervention will be eliminated. Here I discuss such a possibility and show that a fully deterministic universe will turn out to become the divine himself, thus verifying the consistency of Einstein's belief.
