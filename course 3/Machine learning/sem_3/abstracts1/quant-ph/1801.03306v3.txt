We consider the secure quantum communication over a network with the presence of the malicious adversary who can eavesdrop and contaminate the states. As the main result, when the maximum number m1 of the attacked channels is less than a half of network transmission rate m0 (i.e., m1 < m0 / 2), our protocol achieves secret and correctable quantum communication of rate m0 - 2m1 by asymptotic n uses of the network. Our protocol requires no classical communication and no knowledge of network structure, but instead, a node operation is limited to the application of an invertible matrix to bit basis states. Our protocol can be thought as a generalization of honest-dealer verifiable quantum secret sharing.
