Models of spontaneous wave function collapse predict a small heating rate for a bulk solid, as a result of coupling to the noise field that causes collapse. This rate is small enough that ambient radioactivity and cosmic ray flux on the surface of the earth can mask the heating due to spontaneous collapse. In this paper we estimate the background noise due to gamma-radiation and cosmic ray muon flux, at different depths. We demonstrate that a low-temperature underground experiment at a depth of about 6.5 km.w.e. can detect the bulk heating for a collapse rate $\lambda$ of $10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ using presently available technology.
