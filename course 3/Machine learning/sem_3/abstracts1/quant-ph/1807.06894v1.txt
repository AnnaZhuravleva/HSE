Clarifying the nature of the quantum state $|\Psi\rangle$ is at the root of the problems with insight into (counter-intuitive) quantum postulates. We provide a direct empirical derivation of this object as an element of a vector space. Establishing the linearity of this structure -- quantum superposition -- is based on a set-theoretic construction of ensemble formations and invokes the following three principia: $(\textbf{I})$ quantum statics, $(\textbf{II})$ physical theory and the notion of a number, and $(\textbf{III})$ mathematization of matching the two observations with each other (quantum principle of invariance). This is sufficient for producing a $\mathbb C$-number domain, axioms of the linear vector space (superposition principle), statistical mixtures of states, eigenstates and their spectra, and a noncommutativity of observables. No use is required of the concept of time. As a result, foundations of the theory are liberated to a significant extent from the problems associated with physical interpretations, philosophical exegeses, and mathematical reconstruction of the entire quantum edifice.
