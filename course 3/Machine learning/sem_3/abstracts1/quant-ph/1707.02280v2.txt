We examine the applicability of wireless indoor quantum key distribution (QKD) in hybrid quantum-classical networks. We propose practical configurations that would enable wireless access to such networks. The proposed setups would allow an indoor wireless user, equipped with a QKD-enabled mobile device, to communicate securely with a remote party on the other end of the access network. QKD signals, sent through wireless indoor channels, are combined with classical ones and sent over shared fiber links to the remote user. Dense wavelengthdivision multiplexing would enable the simultaneous transmission of quantum and classical signals over the same fiber. We consider the adverse effects of the background noise induced by Raman scattered light on the QKD receivers due to such an integration. In addition, we consider the loss and the background noise that arise from indoor environments. We consider a number of discrete and continuous-variable QKD protocols and study their performance in different scenarios.
