We theoretically investigate a scattering configuration in Compton scattering, in which the orientation of the electron spin is reversed and simultaneously, the photon polarization changes from linear polarization into circular polarization. The intrinsic angular momentum of electron and photon are computed along the coincident propagation direction of the incoming and outgoing photon. We find that this intrinsic angular momentum is not conserved in the considered scattering process. We also discuss the generation of entanglement for the considered scattering setup and present an angle dependent investigation of the corresponding differential cross section, Stokes parameters and spin expectation.
