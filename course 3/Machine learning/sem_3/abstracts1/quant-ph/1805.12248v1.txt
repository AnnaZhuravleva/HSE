The Jaynes--Cummings system is one of the most fundamental models of how light and matter interact. When driving the system with a coherent state (e.g. laser light), it is often assumed that whether the light couples through the cavity or atom plays an important role in determining the dynamics of the system and its emitted field. Here, we prove that the dynamics are identical in either case except for the offset of a trivial coherent state. Further, this offset coherent state can be interferometrically canceled by appropriately homodyning the emitted light, which is especially important for nanocavity quantum electrodynamics where driving the atom is much more difficult than driving the cavity.
