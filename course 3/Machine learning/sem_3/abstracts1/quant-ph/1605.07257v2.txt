Fundamentally, the dynamics of micro-macro transitions is instrumental to understanding the process of quantum-to-classical transitions; technologically, it can also facilitate the detection of the microscopic signals in quantum experiments via convenient detectors. Here, we demonstrate a scheme to characterize micro-macro transitions based on a four-wave mixing linear optical amplification process in a hot rubidium vapor. The linear optical amplifier provides a large optical gain of $10^7$ for injected single-photon-level pulses, enabling photon-number-resolving detection by average via non-single-photon counting detectors with a large dynamic range. The scheme exhibits strong dispersion which is sensitive to the input's change at the single-photon level, resulting in the group-velocity delay time scaling with $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the average input photon number. The output probe and conjugate modes have different coefficients of this $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling, indicating the coefficient can serve as an efficient parameter to characterize the specified micro-macro transitions. The demonstrated results are generally applicable for quantum detection and optical signal processing in light-atom interfaces. Furthermore, the present system is suitable for the study of relevant time-resolved dynamics of the quantum-to-classical transitions.
