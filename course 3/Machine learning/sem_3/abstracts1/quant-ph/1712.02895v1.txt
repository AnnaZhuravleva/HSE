We introduce several families of quantum fingerprinting protocols to evaluate the equality function on two $n$-bit strings in the simultaneous message passing model. The original quantum fingerprinting protocol uses a tensor product of a small number of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-qubit high dimensional signals [Buhrman et al. 2001], whereas a recently-proposed optical protocol uses a tensor product of $\mathcal{O}(n)$ single-qubit signals, while maintaining the $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ information leakage of the original protocol [Arrazola and L\"utkenhaus 2014]. We find a family of protocols which interpolate between the original and optical protocols while maintaining the $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ information leakage, thus demonstrating a trade-off between the number of signals sent and the dimension of each signal.   There has been interest in experimental realization of the recently-proposed optical protocol using coherent states [Xu et al. 2015, Guan et al. 2016], but as the required number of laser pulses grows linearly with the input size $n$, eventual challenges for the long-time stability of experimental set-ups arise. We find a coherent state protocol which reduces the number of signals by a factor $1/2$ while also reducing the information leakage. Our reduction makes use of a simple modulation scheme in optical phase space, and we find that more complex modulation schemes are not advantageous. Using a similar technique, we improve a recently-proposed coherent state protocol for evaluating the Euclidean distance between two real unit vectors [Kumar et al. 2017] by reducing the number of signals by a factor $1/2$ and also reducing the information leakage.
