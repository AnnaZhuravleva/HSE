Schr\"odinger equation with potential $-g/r^2$ exhibits a limit cycle, described in the literature in a broad range of contexts using various regularizations of the singularity at $r=0$. Instead, we use the renormalization group transformation based on Gaussian elimination, from the Hamiltonian eigenvalue problem, of high momentum modes above a finite, floating cutoff scale. The procedure identifies a richer structure than the one we found in the literature. Namely, it directly yields an equation that determines the renormalized Hamiltonians as functions of the floating cutoff: solutions to this equation exhibit, in addition to the limit-cycle, also the asymptotic-freedom, triviality, and fixed-point behaviors, the latter in vicinity of infinitely many separate pairs of fixed points in different partial waves for different values of $g$.
