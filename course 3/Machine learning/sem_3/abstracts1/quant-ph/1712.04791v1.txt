Quantum measurements disturb the quantum system being measured, and this is known as measurement-induced backaction. In this work, we consider a double quantum dot monitored by a nearby quantum point contact where the measurement-induced backaction plays an important role. Taking advantage of the quantum master equation approach, we calculate the tunnelling current, and propose a simple feedbackcontrol law to realize and stabilize the tunnelling current. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the feedback control law can make the current quickly convergent to the desired value.
