In a $m$ particle quantum system, one can have $k=1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,m$ body interactions. The rank of interactions and the nature of particles (fermions or bosons) can strongly affect the dynamics of the system. To explore this in detail, we study quenched quantum dynamics in many particle systems varying rank of interactions, both for fermionic and bosonic particles. We represent the system Hamiltonian by Fermionic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles (FEGOE) and Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal Ensembles (BEGOE) respectively. We show that generating function for $q$-Hermite polynomials describes the semi-circle to Gaussian transition in spectral densities of FEGOE$(k)$ and BEGOE$(k)$ (also the Unitary variants FEGUE$(k)$ and BEGUE$(k)$) as a function of rank of interactions $k$. Importantly, numerical Fourier transform of generating function of $q$-Hermite polynomials explains the short-time decay of survival probability in FEGOE$(1+k)$ and BEGOE$(1+k)$. The parameter $q$ describing these properties is related to excess parameter $\gamma_2$ and we give a formula for FEGOE$(k)$, FEGUE$(k)$, BEGOE$(k)$ and BEGUE$(k)$. We illustrate that the dynamics strongly depends on the rank of interactions and nature of particles and these universal features may be relevant to modeling non-equilibrium quantum systems.
