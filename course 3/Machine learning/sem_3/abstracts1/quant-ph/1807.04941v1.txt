Device-independent certification refers to the characterization of an apparatus without reference to the internal description of other devices. It is a trustworthy certification method, free of assumption on the underlying Hilbert space dimension and on calibration methods. We show how it can be used to quantify the quality of a Bell state measurement, whether deterministic, partial or probabilistic. Our certification is noise resistant and opens the way towards the device-independent self-testing of Bell state measurements in existing experiments.
