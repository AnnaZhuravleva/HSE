We propose and analyze a novel realization of a solid-state quantum network, where separated silicon-vacancy centers are coupled via the phonon modes of a quasi-1D diamond waveguide. In our approach, quantum states encoded in long-lived electronic spin states can be converted into propagating phonon wavepackets and be reabsorbed efficiently by a distant defect center. Our analysis shows that under realistic conditions, this approach enables the implementation of high-fidelity, scalable quantum communication protocols within chip-scale spin-qubit networks. Apart from quantum information processing, this setup constitutes a novel waveguide QED platform, where strong-coupling effects between solid-state defects and individual propagating phonons can be explored at the quantum level.
