The uncertainty principle, a jewel at the heart of quantum theory, has been expressed by completely different forms, such as universal uncertainty relations, an uncertainty principle in the presence of quantum memory and a fine-grained uncertainty relation. We unify these uncertainty relations based on a special formalization of probability relations, namely introducing quasi-fine-grained uncertainty relations (QFGURs), which combine different measurements performed on spacelike-separated systems. Our generalized probability relations determine whether a quantum measurement exhibits typical quantum correlations and reveal a fundamental connection between basic elements of quantum theory, specifically, uncertainty measures, combined outcomes for different measurements, quantum memory, entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Furthermore, we derive a universal form for entanglement and steering inequalities explicitly by applying our QFGURs.
