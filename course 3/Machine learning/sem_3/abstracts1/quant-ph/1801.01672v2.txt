High-quality sources of single photons are of paramount importance for quantum communication, sensing and metrology. To these ends, resonantly excited two-level systems based on self-assembled quantum dots have recently generated widespread interest. Nevertheless, we have recently shown that for resonantly excited two-level systems, emission of a photon during the presence of the excitation laser pulse and subsequent re-excitation results in a degradation of the obtainable single-photon purity. Here, we investigate a new scheme for generating single photons from self-assembled quantum dots, based on two-photon excitation of the biexciton, and demonstrate that it yields superior performance with an ultra-low multi-photon probability. In this method, re-excitation is strongly suppressed improving the obtainable multi-photon error rate by several orders of magnitude. Specifically, the pulse-length dependence of the multi-photon error rate reveals a quadratic dependence in contrast to the linear dependence of resonantly excited two-level systems. We support our experiments with a new theoretical framework and simulation methodology to understand few-photon sources.
