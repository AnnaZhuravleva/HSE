A method is presented by which uncertainty relations in the absence of quantum memory can be converted to those in the presence of quantum memory. It is shown that the lower bounds obtained through the method are tighter than those having been achieved so far. The method is also used to obtain the uncertainty relations for multiple measurements in the presence of quantum memory. For a given state, the lower bounds on the sum of the relative entropies of unilateral coherence are provided using uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory, and it is shown which bound is tighter.
