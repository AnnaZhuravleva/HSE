We consider the Molecular Opto-mechanical systems in back-action amplification of single molecule Raman imaging. Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) is mapped into the dissipative cavity opto-mechanics system of coupled resonators. We investigate the plasmon molecular vibration interactions in strong coupling regimes of cavity opto-mechanics in the presence of impurities. Eigenfunction spectrum is analyzed for the normal mode splitting of photonic and mechanical hybrid system. Back-action transduction of photons into mechanical modes is investigated by avoided crossing due to the nonlinear interactions and Casimir forces in the presence of virtual photons and radiation pressure. In input-output coupled cavity scheme, both cavity and driving fields are analyzed for the absorption and dissipation of heat in weak and strong coupling regimes of the cascaded cavity setup. In terms of the second order coherence functions, thermodynamic work and heat engine are investigated via phonon lasing of mechanical mode in opto-mechanical implementation of Brownian motors by tuning the competing coupling strengths of impurities and nonlinearities.
