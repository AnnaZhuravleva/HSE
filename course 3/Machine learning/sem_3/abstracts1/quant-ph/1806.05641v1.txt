We experimentally demonstrate a hybrid configuration for Quantum Key Distribution, that combines the simplicity of Distributed Phase Reference protocols with the self-referencing features and polarization insensitivity of the so-called Plug & Play system. Additionally, all the components are arranged in a server-client scheme to allow for practical key distribution. Blank, coherent pulse pair trains are generated at the reception end of the link by means of a pulse sequence and an unbalanced interferometer, and sent to the other end. The emitter writes the qubits by erasing one of the pulses from the pair as in a Coherent-One Way protocol. Detection, as well as eavesdropping monitoring is performed at the receiver side, using the same interferometer that was used to generate the initial phase-referenced pulses.
