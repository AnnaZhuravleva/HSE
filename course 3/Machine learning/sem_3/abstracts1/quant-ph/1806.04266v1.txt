We propose a technique for robust optomechanical cooling using phase-tailored composite pulse driving with constant amplitude. Our proposal is inspired by coherent control techniques in lossless driven qubits. Using phase-tailored composite pulse sequences, we demonstrate that there exist optimal phases for maximally robust excitation exchange in lossy strongly-driven optomechanical cooling. However, this driving can take the system out of its steady state. For this reason, we use these optimal phases to produce smooth sequences that both maintain the system close to its steady state and optimize the robustness of optomechanical cooling.
