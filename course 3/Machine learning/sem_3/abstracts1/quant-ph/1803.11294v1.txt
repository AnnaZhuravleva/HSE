We study the back action on a coupled multiple-qubit system induced by a quantum cavity probe in a non-demolition quantum measurement scheme. The exact quantum state stochastic Schr\"{o}dinger equation is derived to systematically investigate the dynamics of quantum entanglement of the multiple-qubit system inside the cavity probe. Although quantum entanglement cannot be directly measured through experiments, the back action on quantum entanglement in the multi-qubit system is witnessed by applying the exact quantum state stochastic equations. Our results demonstrate that the analysis on the sensitivity of the quantum measurement should include not only the standard quantum limit of the canonical operators, but also the back action on the quantum entanglement. Our new method proposed a theoretical approach to investigate the effects of the measurement back action on the multi-qubit systems induced by the cavity probe.
