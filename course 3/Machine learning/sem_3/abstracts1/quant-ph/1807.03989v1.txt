Random numbers are an essential resource to many applications, including cryptography and Monte Carlo simulations. Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) represent the ultimate source of randomness, as the numbers are obtained by sampling a physical quantum process that is intrinsically probabilistic. However, they are yet to be widely employed to replace deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNG) for practical applications. QRNGs are regarded as interesting devices. However they are slower than PRNGs for simulations and are typically seen as clumsy laboratory prototypes, prone to failures and unreliable for cryptographic applications. Here we overcome these limitations and demonstrate a compact and self-contained QRNG capable of generating random numbers at a pace of 8 Gbit/s uninterruptedly for 71 days. During this period, the physical parameters of the quantum process were monitored in real time by self-checking functions implemented in the generator itself. At the same time, the output random numbers were analyzed with the most stringent suites of statistical tests. The analysis shows that the QRNG under test sustained the continuous operation without physical instabilities or hardware failures. At the same time, the output random numbers were analyzed with the most stringent suites of statistical tests, which were passed during the whole operation time. This extensive trial demonstrates the reliability of a robustly designed QRNG and paves the way to its use in practical applications based on randomness.
