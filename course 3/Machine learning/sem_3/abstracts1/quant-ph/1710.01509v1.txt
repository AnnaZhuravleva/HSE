We discuss the Casimir effect for boundary conditions involving perfect electromagnetic conductors (PEMCs). Based on the corresponding reciprocal Green's tensor we construct the Green's tensor for two perfectly reflecting plates with magnetoelectric coupling (non-reciprocal media) within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. We calculate the Casimir force between two PEMC plates in terms of the PEMC parameter M and the duality transformation angle ${\theta}$ resulting in a universal analytic expression that connects the attractive Casimir force with the repulsive Boyer force. We relate the results to the duality symmetry of electromagnetism.
