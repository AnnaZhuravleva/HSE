The violation of certain Bell inequalities allows for device-independent information processing secure against non-signalling eavesdroppers. However, this only holds for the Bell network, in which two or more agents perform local measurements on a single shared source of entanglement. To overcome the practical constraint that entangled systems can only be transmitted over relatively short distances, large-scale multi-source networks have been employed. Do there exist analogues of Bell inequalities for such networks, whose violation is a resource for device-independence? In this paper, the violation of recently derived polynomial Bell inequalities will be shown to allow for device-independence on multi-source networks, secure against non-signalling eavesdroppers.
