As the fascinating performance of hyperentanglement of photon system in quantum communication, the hyperentanglement purification protocol (hyper-EPP) becomes a vital project work and the quality of accomplishment attracts much attention. Here we present a scheme of heralded hyper-EPP for two-photon system in two degrees of freedom (DOFs) working without secondary pollution and with its inherent efficiency. With the heralded hyper-EPP, the bit-flip errors in polarization and spatial-mode DOFs can be corrected. Meanwhile the fidelity of the two-photon system in mixed hyperentangled Bell states can be improved gradually through multiple-round heralded hyper-EPP. In addition, the method of using SWAP gates make the heralded hyper-EPP universal to the case of purification for two-photon systems hyperentangled in polarization and multiple-spatial-mode DOFs.
