This work aims to provide an alternative approach to modeling a two-state system (qubit) coupled to a nonlinear oscillator. Within a single algebraic scheme based upon the f-deformed oscillator description, hard and soft nonlinearities are proposed to be simulated by making use of fitting algebraic models extracted from the trigonometric and modified P\"oschl-Teller potentials, respectively. In the regime where the strength of the coupling is considered to be moderate, this approach allows for an analytic, albeit approximate, diagonalization process of the proposed Hamiltonian through using the Van Vleck perturbation theory and embracing the two types of nonlinear features. In the ultrastrong-coupling regime, the effect of such nonlinearities upon the squeezing and phase space properties of the ground state of the composite system is also explored by numerical means.
