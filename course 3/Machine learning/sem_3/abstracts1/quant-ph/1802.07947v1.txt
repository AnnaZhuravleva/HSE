We report a single-stage bi-directional interface capable of linking Sr$^+$ trapped ion qubits in a long-distance quantum network. Our interface converts photons between the Sr$^+$ emission wavelength at 422 nm and the telecoms C-band to enable low-loss transmission over optical fiber. We have achieved both up- and down-conversion at the single photon level with efficiencies of 9.4 $\%$ and 1.1 $\%$ respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the noise introduced during the conversion process is sufficiently low to implement high-fidelity interconnects suitable for quantum networking.
