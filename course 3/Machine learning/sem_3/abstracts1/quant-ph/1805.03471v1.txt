Measuring entanglement is a demanding task in the field of quantum computation and quantum information theory. Very recently some authors [J. C. Loredo et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 070503 (2016)] experimentally demonstrate an embedding quantum simulator, using it to efficiently measure two-qubit entanglement. Here, we review some measures of entanglement (pure and mixed states). Furthermore, we report the efficient measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement.
