A semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol allows a quantum user and a limited "classical" user to establish a shared secret key secure against an all-powerful adversary. In this work, we present a new SQKD protocol where the quantum user is also limited in her measurement capabilities. We describe the protocol, prove its security, and show its noise tolerance is as high as "fully quantum" QKD protocols.
