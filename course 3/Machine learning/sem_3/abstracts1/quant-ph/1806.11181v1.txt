Using the space-time analogy, we compare the performance of quantum temporal imaging with its classical counterpart. We consider a temporal imaging scheme, based on the sum-frequency generation (SFG) time lens, but our results can be applied to other temporal imaging schemes such as, for instance, four-wave mixing. Extending the theory presented in our previous publications, in this paper we take into account the finite time aperture of the imaging system, characterized by its pupil function. Using the quantum theory, we obtain a unitary transformation of the quantum field from the input to the output of the imaging scheme and identify the contribution of the vacuum fluctuations missing in the classical theory. This contribution plays a key role in the quantum temporal imaging of nonclassical temporal waveforms, characterized by nonclassical fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. As an example, we consider quantum temporal imaging of broadband squeezed light and formulate the criteria for conservation of its squeezing properties at the output of the system.
