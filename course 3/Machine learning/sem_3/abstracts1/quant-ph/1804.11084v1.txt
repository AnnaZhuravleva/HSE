It is often the case in quantum Hamiltonian complexity (e.g. in the context of quantum simulations, adiabatic algorithms, perturbative gadgets and quantum NP theory) that one is mainly interested in the properties of the groundstate(s) of a Hamiltonian, and not in the rest of the spectrum. We capture this situation using a notion we call gap-simulation and initiate the study of the resources required for gap-simulating a Hamiltonian $H$ by a Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$. In particular we focus on two notions: degree-reduction and dilution. In degree-reduction, one aims to simulate a high degree Hamiltonian $H$ by a constant degree Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$; whereas in dilution, the total number of edges (interactions) is reduced. Our main result is a proof that unlike in the classical case, general quantum degree-reduction is impossible. We provide two example Hamiltonians $H_A$ and $H_B$, and show, using an adaptation of Hastings-Koma decay of correlation, that no bounded degree Hamiltonian with bounded-norm terms (i.e. bounded interaction strength) can gap-simulate these Hamiltonians. We further establish several possibility results if one relaxes some of the requirements such as the norm of the individual terms, or the coherence of the gap-simulation. Finally, we connect these impossibility results to the attempt to construct quantum PCP reductions, and provide partial impossibility results of degree-reduction in this context as well. We believe that this work leads to a rich set of new questions in quantum Hamiltonian complexity.
