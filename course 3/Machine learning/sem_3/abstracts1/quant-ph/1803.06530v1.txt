Quantum router is an essential ingredient in a quantum network. Here, we propose a new quantum circuit for designing quantum router by using IBM's five-qubit quantum computer. We design an equivalent quantum circuit, by the means of single-qubit and two-qubit quantum gates, which can perform the operation of a quantum router. Here, we show the routing of signal information in two different paths (two signal qubits) which is directed by a control qubit. According to the process of routing, the signal information is found to be in a coherent superposition of two paths. We demonstrate the quantum nature of the router by illustrating the entanglement between the control qubit and the two signal qubits (two paths), and confirm the well preservation of the signal information in either of the two paths after the routing process. We perform quantum state tomography to verify the generation of entanglement and preservation of information. It is found that the experimental results are obtained with good fidelity.
