An Extended Wigner's Friend gedankenexperiment devised by Daniela Frauchiger and Renato Renner consisting of a quantum system containing an agent who draws conclusion, upon observing the outcome of a measurement of a quantum system prepared by another agent lead them to conclude that no "single-world" interpretation of quantum mechanics can be self-consistent. Jeffrey Bub in turn proposed to consider this experiment in a context of many-body entangled quantum system. In this paper I show that the logical paradoxes of such an experimental setup stem from the very assumption of perfection of the actions based on inherently imperfect measurements.
