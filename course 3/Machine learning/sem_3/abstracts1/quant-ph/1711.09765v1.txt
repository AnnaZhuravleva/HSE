Within the general context of the architecture in quantum computer design, this paper aims is to provide a general strategy to obtain a block-matrix representation of quantum gates applied to qubits placed in arbitrary positions over an arbitrary dimensional input state. The model is also extended to the framework of quantum computation with qudits. An application in the context of the quantum computational logic is provided.
