State-of-the art quantum simulators allow to explore static and dynamical quantum properties of strongly correlated matter. In many ways, however, it is the measurement and read-out that limits such quantum simulations. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm of experimental read-out exploiting coherent non-interacting dynamics and available measurement techniques in order to access new observables. Specifically, we present a novel tomographic reconstruction method allowing to indirectly measure second moments of quadratures of cold atomic systems of a type inaccessible to direct measurements. This is done by connecting data from different evolution times through known dynamical equations that can be efficiently kept track of. Formally, we make use of signal processing and semi-definite programming to perform a reliable reconstruction of covariance matrices of eigenmodes of phase and density fluctuation operators which describe elementary quasiparticle excitations of one-dimensional superfluids. This method gives rise to a new window into dynamical quantum simulators which, as we show, allows to predict coherent revivals in a cold atoms system based on seemingly dephased data and to study the dynamics of quasiparticle occupation numbers.
