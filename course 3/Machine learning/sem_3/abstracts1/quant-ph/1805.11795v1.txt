The effect of a local instantaneous quantum dynamical process (QDP), either unitary or non- unitary, on the quantum state transfer through a unitary Hamiltonian evolution is investigated for both integrable and non-integrable dynamics. There are interference effects of the quantum state propagation and the QDP signal propagation. The state transfer fidelity is small for further sites, from the site where the information is coded, indicating a finite speed for the propagation of the quantum correlation. There is a small change in the state transfer fidelity for the case of non- unitary QDP intervening the background unitary dynamics. In the case of unitary QDP, the change is more pronounced, with a substantial increase in the fidelity for appropriate sites and times. The Loschmidt echo is investigated to track the effect of the local QDP. It is also quite sensitive to whether the background dynamics is integrable or not. For the integrable case, viz. the Heisenberg model, the Loschmidt echo falls off as a function of the time of QDP occurrence, and saturates to a value, depending on the parameter values. For the non-integrable case, viz. a kicked Harper model, it exhibits an oscillatory behaviour around a larger value. The state transfer fidelity, in this case, is quite large for further sites for short times, indicating a finite speed for the propagation of the quantum correlation cannot be defined.
