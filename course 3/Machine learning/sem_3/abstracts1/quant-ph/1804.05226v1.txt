Adaptive measurements have recently been shown to significantly improve the performance of quantum state and process tomography. However, the existing methods either cannot be straightforwardly applied to high-dimensional systems or are prohibitively computationally expensive. Here we propose and experimentally implement a novel tomographic protocol specially designed for the reconstruction of high-dimensional quantum states. The protocol shows qualitative improvement in infidelity scaling with the number of measurements and is fast enough to allow for complete state tomography of states with dimensionality up to 36.
