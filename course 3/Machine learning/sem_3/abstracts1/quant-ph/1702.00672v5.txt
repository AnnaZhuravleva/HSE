Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a form of quantum nonlocality which is weaker than Bell nonlocality, but stronger than entanglement. Here we present a method to check Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in the scenario where the steering party performs two black-box measurements and the trusted party performs projective qubit measurements corresponding to two arbitrary mutually unbiased bases. This method is based on decomposing the measurement correlations in terms of extremal boxes of the steering scenario. In this context, we propose a measure of steerability called steering cost. We show that our steering cost is a convex steering monotone. We illustrate our method to check steerability with two families of measurement correlations and find out their steering cost.
