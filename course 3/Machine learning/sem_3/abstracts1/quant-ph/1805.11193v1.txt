Interaction among harmonic oscillators described by a trilinear Hamiltonian $\hbar \xi (a^{\dagger} b c + a b^{\dagger} c^{\dagger}$) is one of the most fundamental models in quantum optics. By employing the anharmonicity of the Coublomb potential in a linear trapped three-ion crystal, we experimentally implement it among three normal modes of motion in the strong-coupling regime, where the coupling strength is much larger than the decoherence rate of the ions motion. We use it to simulate the interaction of atom and light as described by the Tavis-Cummings model and the process of nondegenerate parametric down conversion in the regime of depleted pump.
