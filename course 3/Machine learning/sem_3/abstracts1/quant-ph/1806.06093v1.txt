We present a new quantum-limited Josephson-junction-based 3-wave-mixing parametric amplifier, the SNAIL Parametric Amplifier (SPA), which uses an array of SNAILs (Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLements) as the source of tunable nonlinearity. We show how to engineer the nonlinearity over multiple orders of magnitude by varying the physical design of the device. As a function of design parameters, we systematically explore two important amplifier nonidealities that limit dynamic range: the phenomena of gain compression and intermodulation distortion, whose minimization are crucial for high-fidelity multi-qubit readout. Through a comparison with first-principles theory across multiple devices, we demonstrate how to optimize both the nonlinearity and the input-output port coupling of these SNAIL-based parametric amplifiers to achieve higher saturation power, without sacrificing any other desirable characteristics. The method elaborated in our work can be extended to improve all forms of parametrically induced mixing that can be employed for quantum information applications.
