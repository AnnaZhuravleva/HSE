In this paper we examine Interaction-free measurement (IFM) where both the probe and the object are quantum particles. We argue that in this case the description of the measurement procedure must by symmetrical with respect to interchange of the roles of probe and object. A thought experiment is being suggested that helps to determine what does and what doesn't happen to the state of the particles in such a setup. It seems that unlike the case of classical object, here the state of both the probe and the object must change. A possible explanation of this might be that the probe and the object form an entangled pair as a result of non-interaction.
