Dirac particle represents a fundamental constituent of our nature. Simulation of Dirac particle dynamics by a controllable quantum system will allow us to investigate non-classical nature of our physical world. In this work, starting from a modified version of one-spatial dimensional general inhomogeneous split-step discrete quantum walk we derive an effective Hamiltonian which mimics a single massive Dirac particle dynamics in curved $(1+1)$ space-time dimension coupled to $U(1)$ gauge potential---which is a forward step towards the simulation of the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational forces in lower dimension and at the single particle level. Implementation of this simulation scheme in simple qubit-system has been demonstrated. We show that the same Hamiltonian can represent $(2+1)$ space-time dimensional Dirac dynamics when one of the spatial momentum remains fixed. The emergence of curvature in the two-particle split-step quantum walk has also been investigated while the particles are interacting through their entangled coin operation.
