We have built up a magneto-optical trap (MOT) recoil ion momentum spectroscopy (RIMS) (MOTRIMS) apparatus for studies of Rb atom in strong infrared laser field. Three cold Rb target modes namely two-dimensional (2D) MOT, 2D molasses MOT, and 3D MOT can be provided in the setup and the profiles for the density and the velocity of 3D MOT are characterized using absorption imaging and photoionization approaches. The momentum distributions of Rb${^+}$ for three types of atom targets are detected with standard RIMS method and the resolution of 0.15 a.u. is achieved along the extraction direction.
