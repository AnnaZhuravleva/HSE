We study the entropy dynamics of a dephasing model, where a two-level system (TLS) is coupled with a squeezed thermal bath via non-demolition interaction. This model is exactly solvable, and the time dependent states of both the TLS and its bath can be obtained exactly. Based on these states, we calculate the entropy dynamics of both the TLS and the bath, and find that the dephasing rate of the system relies on the squeezing phase of the bath. In zero temperature and high temperature limits, we prove that both the system and bath entropy increases monotonically. Moreover, we find that the dephasing rate of the system relies on the squeezing phase of the bath, and this phase dependence cannot be precisely derived from the Born-Markovian approximation which is widely adopted in open quantum systems.
