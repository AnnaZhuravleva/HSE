We develop the point of view where Quantum Mechanics results from the interplay between the quantized number of "modalities" accessible to a quantum system, and the continuum of "contexts" that are required to define these modalities. We point out the specific roles of "extracontextuality" and "extravalence" of modalities, and relate them to the Kochen-Specker and Gleason theorems.
