We use the method of Laplace transformation to determine the dynamics of a wave packet that passes a barrier by tunneling. We investigate the transmitted wave packet and find that it can be resolved into a sequence of subsequent wave packages. This result sheds new light on the Hartmann effect for the tunneling time and gives a possible explanation for an experimental result obtained by Spielmann et. al.
