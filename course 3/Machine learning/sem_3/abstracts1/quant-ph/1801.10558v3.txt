A central task in quantum information processing is to characterize quantum processes. In the realm of optical quantum information processing, this amounts to characterizing the transformations of the mode creation and annihilation operators. This transformation is unitary for linear optical systems, whereas these yield the well-known Bogoliubov transformations for systems with Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the mode operators. In this paper, we show that a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer can characterize both these kinds of evolutions for multimode systems. While it suffices to use coherent states for the characterization of linear optical systems, we additionally require single photons to characterize quadratically nonlinear optical systems.
