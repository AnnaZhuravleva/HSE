Ultimate sensitivity for quantum magnetometry using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond is limited by number of NV centers and coherence time. Microwave irradiation with a high and homogeneous power density for a large detection volume is necessary to achieve highly sensitive magnetometer. Here, we demonstrate a microwave resonator to enhance the power density of the microwave field and an optical system with a detection volume of 1.4e-3 mm$^3$. The strong microwave field enables us to achieve 48 ns Rabi oscillation which is sufficiently faster than the phase relaxation time of NV centers. This system combined with a decoupling pulse sequence, XY16, extends the spin coherence time (T2) up to 27 times longer than that with a spin echo method. Consequently, we obtained an AC magnetic field sensitivity of 10.8 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ using the dynamical decoupling pulse sequence.
