Physics is studying a system based on the information available about it. There are two approaches to physics, deterministic and the nondeterministic. The deterministic approaches assume everything is known about the system. Since everything about the system is almost never known, nondeterministic approaches such as statistical physics and quantum physics are of high importance. After a tour through informational interpretation of quantum physics and required mathematical tools, we go into the notion of time.   We address the problem of time and a cluster of problems around measurement in quantum mechanics. I present a new approach to interpreting time in terms of information changes. Time will emerge from the non-commutativity of quantum theory. In the third section we review information thermodynamics and later derive some relations between our notion of time and the thermal time.
