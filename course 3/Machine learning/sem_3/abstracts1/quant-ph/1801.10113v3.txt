One of the principal objectives of quantum thermodynamics is to explore quantum effects and their potential beneficial role in thermodynamic tasks like work extraction or refrigeration. So far, even though several papers already shown that quantum effect could indeed bring quantum advantages, a global and deeper understanding is still lacking. Here, we extend previous models of autonomous machines to arbitrary systems. We establish their actual efficiency, which allows us to derive an efficiency upper bound, called maximal achievable efficiency, shown to be always acheivable, in contrast to previous upper bounds based only on the Second Law. Such maximal achievable efficiency can be expressed simply in term of the apparent temperature of the ancillary system. This important result appears to be a powerful tool to understand how quantum features like coherence but also many-body correlations and non-thermal population distribution can be harnessed to increase the efficiency of thermal machines.
