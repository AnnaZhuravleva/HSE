We have studied the non-Markovianity of dichotomously driven spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime in both memory kernel and time convolutionless master equation formulations. A strong correlation between the decay time of the environmental correlation function and the non-zero non-Markovianity is found in the absence of the external noise. Stochastic driving is shown to create strong non-Markovianity when the dynamics of the system without driving is Markovian. Also, exact analytical expressions for the trace distance distinguishability and the non-Markovianity were obtained for the certain range of the parameters that describe the system and its environment.
