A crucial limit to measurement efficiencies of superconducting circuits comes from losses involved when coupling to an external quantum amplifier. Here, we realize a device circumventing this problem by directly embedding a two-level artificial atom, comprised of a transmon qubit, within a flux-pumped Josephson parametric amplifier. Surprisingly, this configuration is able to enhance dispersive measurement without exposing the qubit to appreciable excess backaction. This is accomplished by engineering the circuit to permit high-power operation that reduces information loss to unmonitored channels associated with the amplification and squeezing of quantum noise. By mitigating the effects of off-chip losses downstream, the on-chip gain of this device produces end-to-end measurement efficiencies of up to 80 percent. Our theoretical model accurately describes the observed interplay of gain and measurement backaction, and delineates the parameter space for future improvement. The device is compatible with standard fabrication and measurement techniques, and thus provides a route for definitive investigations of fundamental quantum effects and quantum control protocols.
