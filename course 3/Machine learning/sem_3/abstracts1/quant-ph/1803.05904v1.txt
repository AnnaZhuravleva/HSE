For every $d \geq 2$, we present a generalization of the CHSH inequality with the property that maximal violation self-tests the maximally entangled state of local dimension $d$. This is the first example of a family of inequalities with this property. Moreover, we provide a conjecture for a family of inequalities generalizing the tilted CHSH inequalities, and we conjecture that for each pure bipartite entangled state there is an inequality in the family whose maximal violation self-tests it. All of these inequalities are inspired by the self-testing correlations of [Nat. Comm. 8, 15485 (2017)].
