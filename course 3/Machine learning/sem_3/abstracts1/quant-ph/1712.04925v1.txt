We test Hardy's paradox of non-locality experimentally on the IBM five-qubit quantum computer for the first time. The quantum circuit is constructed on superconducting qubits corresponding to the original Hardy's test of non-locality. Results confirmed the theory that any non-maximally entangled state of two qubits violates Hardy's Equations, whereas any maximally entangled state and product state of two qubits do not exhibit Hardy's non-locality. We also point out the difficulties associated with the practical implementation of any Hardy's paradox based quantum protocol and propose three performance measures for any two qubits of any quantum computer.
