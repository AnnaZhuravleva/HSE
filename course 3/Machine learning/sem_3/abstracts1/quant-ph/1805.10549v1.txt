We present two quantum algorithms based on evolution randomization, a simple variant of adiabatic quantum computing, to prepare a quantum state $\vert x\rangle$ that is proportional to the solution of the linear system of equations $A \vec{x}=\vec{b}$. The time complexities of our algorithms are nearly of order $\kappa^2$ and $\kappa$, respectively, and linear in $1/\epsilon$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number of $A$ and $\epsilon$ is the precision. Both algorithms are constructed using families of Hamiltonians that are linear combinations of products of $A$, the projector onto the initial state $\vert b \rangle$, and single-qubit Pauli operators. The first algorithm aims at preparing the ground states of the Hamiltonians while the second algorithm aims at preparing excited states. The algorithms are simple: they are not obtained using equivalences between the gate model and adiabatic quantum computing, they do not use phase estimation, and they do not use variable-time amplitude amplification. We provide numerical simulations and use methods for Hamiltonian simulation to show the optimality of our second algorithm in terms of $\kappa$. Like previous solutions of this problem, our techniques yield an exponential quantum speedup under some assumptions on $A$ and $\vert b \rangle$. Our results emphasize the role of Hamiltonian-based models of quantum computing for the discovery of important algorithms.
