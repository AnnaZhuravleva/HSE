To implement fault-tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables, the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit has been recognized as an important technological element. We have proposed a method to reduce the required squeezing level to realize large scale quantum computation with the GKP qubit [arXiv: 1712.00294 (2017)], harnessing the virtue of analog information in the GKP qubits. In the present work, to reduce the number of qubits required for large scale quantum computation, we propose the tracking quantum error correction, where the logical-qubit level quantum error correction is partially substituted by the single-qubit level quantum error correction. In the proposed method, the analog quantum error correction is utilized to make the performances of the single-qubit level quantum error correction almost identical to those of the logical-qubit level quantum error correction in a practical noise level. The numerical results show that the proposed tracking quantum error correction reduces the number of qubits during a quantum error correction process by the reduction rate $(n-1)/2n$ for $n$-cycles of the quantum error correction process. Hence, the proposed tracking quantum error correction has great advantage in reducing the required number of physical qubits, and will open a new way to bring up advantage of the GKP qubits in practical quantum computation.
