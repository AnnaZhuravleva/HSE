We present a modular design for integrated programmable multimode sources of arbitrary Gaussian states of light. The technique is based on current technologies, in particular recent demonstrations of on-chip photon manipulation and generation of highly squeezed vacuum states in semiconductors. While the design is generic and independent of the choice of integrated platform, we adopt recent experimental results on compound semiconductors as a demonstrative example. Such a device would be valuable as a source for many quantum protocols that range from imaging to communication and information processing.
