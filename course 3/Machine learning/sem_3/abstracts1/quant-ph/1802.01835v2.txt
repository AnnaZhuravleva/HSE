The quantum measurement problem, namely how the deterministic quantum evolution leads to probabilistic measurement outcomes, remains a profound question to be answered. In the present work, we propose a spectacular demonstration and test of the subtle and peculiar character of the quantum measurement process. We show that a bright soliton supported by a Bose-Einstein condensate can be reflected as a whole by an electron beam, with neither attraction nor repulsion between the condensate's neutral atoms and the beam's electrons. This macroscopic reflection is purely due to the quantum Zeno dynamics induced by the frequent position measurement of the condensate's atoms by the electron beam. As an example of application, just as a soccer player would stop a coming ball, an electron beam moving backward with half the velocity of the bright soliton can precisely stop the soliton. This offers an entirely new and useful tool for manipulating bright solitons.
