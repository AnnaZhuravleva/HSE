The main topic of this thesis is the proof of two fundamental entropic inequalities for quantum Gaussian channels. Quantum Gaussian channels model the propagation of electromagnetic waves through optical fibers and free space in the quantum regime, and provide the mathematical model to determine the maximum rates achievable by quantum communication devices for communication and quantum key distribution. The first inequality proven in this thesis is the quantum Entropy Power Inequality, which provides a lower bound to the output entropy of the beam-splitter or of the squeezing in terms of the entropies of the two inputs. The second inequality states that Gaussian states minimize the output entropy of the one-mode quantum Gaussian attenuator among all the input states with a given entropy, and was a longstanding conjecture in quantum communication theory. The generalization of this inequality to the multimode attenuator would determine its triple trade-off region and its capacity region for broadcast communication to two receivers. The thesis contains further results in Gaussian quantum information, quantum statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum information. The most important of these results concerns the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH). The ETH is an assumption in quantum statistical mechanics stating that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian of a system+bath compound look as thermal states if we can access only the system. We prove that the ETH must hold if the system thermalizes for any initial product state of the system+bath compound with a well-defined temperature.
