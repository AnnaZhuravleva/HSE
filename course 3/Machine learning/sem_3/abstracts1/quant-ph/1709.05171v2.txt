The Braess paradox encountered in classical networks is a counterintuitive phenomenon when the flow in a road network can be impeded by adding a new road or, more generally, the overall net performance can degrade after addition of an extra available choice. In this work, we discuss the possibility of a similar effect in a phase-coherent quantum transport and demonstrate it by example of a simple Y-shaped metallic fork. To reveal the Braess-like partial suppression of the charge flow in such device, it is proposed to transfer two outgoing arms into a superconducting state. We show that the differential conductance-vs-voltage spectrum of the hybrid fork structure varies considerably when the extra link between the two superconducting leads is added and it can serve as an indicator of quantum correlations which manifest themselves in the quantum Braess paradox.
