The thorough experimental study for the measure of sustainability of the atmospheric turbulence of the entangled photons for two qubit has been analysed by G. Puentes et al. [Phys. Rev. A 75, 032319 (2007)]. Here in this paper we propose a scheme to measure the effect of entanglement in three entangled photon GHZ state with the help of simulated atmospheric turbulence. We simulate the result of affected entangled GHZ state by introducing turbulence in three entangled photon path alternatively. We observe, by introducing the turbulence in photon path we are loosing the entanglement property, because of the increase in entropy. We compare our result with Werner curve and observe that the simulated result perfectly fit with the theoretical result.
