The uncertainty relation is a distinguishing feature of quantum theory, characterizing the incompatibility of noncommuting observables in the preparation of quantum states. Recently, many uncertainty relations were proposed with improved lower bounds and were deemed capable of incorporating multiple observables. Here we report an experimental verification of seven uncertainty relations of this type with single-photon measurements. The results, while confirming these uncertainty relations, show as well the relative stringency of various uncertainty lower bounds.
