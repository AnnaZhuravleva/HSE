Constructing a large scale quantum processor will require gate operations that are robust in the presence of noise and experimental imperfection. We experimentally demonstrate, making use of a pair of trapped ions, how a new type of M\o lmer-S\o rensen gate protects against infidelity caused by heating of the motional mode used during the gate. Furthermore, we show how the same technique simultaneously provides significant protection against slow fluctuations and mis-sets in the frequency of the mode. Since this sensitivity is further enhanced in cases where the ions are not ground state cooled, our method provides a path towards relaxing ion cooling requirements in practical realisations of quantum computing and simulation.
