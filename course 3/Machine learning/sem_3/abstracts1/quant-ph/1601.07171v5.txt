A previous publication in Phys. Rev. D, (Part A of this paper) pointed out that vacuum energy fluctuations implied mass fluctuations which implied curvature fluctuations which then implied fluctuations of the metric tensor. The metric fluctuations were taken as fundamental and a stochastic space-time was theorized. A number of results of quantum mechanics were derived. This paper (Part B), in addressing some of the difficulties of Part A, required the extension of the model. A further number of phenomena of quantum mechanics and also General Relativity are accounted for. Some results/deductions: Time as we know it is emergent from an analogous coordinate, t-prime, $t'$, where '$t'$-Time Leaves No Tracks' (that is to say, in the sub-quantum domain, there is no 'history'); $\Psi$ is a periodic fluctuation in space-time; The Planck mass is the smallest purely classical mass; The Schwarzschild metric is obtained without using General Relativity; Space-time is granular with the grains having constant volume; Space-time is five-dimensional with the fifth dimension being time-like and rolled-up at the Planck scale; and finally, $\pi=3$ for extremely small circles.   The aim is to fold the seemingly incomprehensible behaviors of quantum mechanics into the (one hopes) less incomprehensible properties of space-time.
