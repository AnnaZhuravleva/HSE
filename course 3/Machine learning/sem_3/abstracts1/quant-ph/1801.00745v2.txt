In this paper we present a new proof technique for semi-quantum key distribution protocols which makes use of a quantum entropic uncertainty relation to bound an adversary's information. Our new technique provides a more optimistic key-rate bound than previous work relying only on noise statistics (as opposed to using additional mismatched measurements which increase the noise tolerance of this protocol, but at the cost of requiring four times the amount of measurement data). Our new technique may hold application in the proof of security of other semi-quantum protocols or protocols relying on two-way quantum communication.
