We address the problem of the minus sign sampling for two electron systems using the path integral approach. We show that this problem can be reexpressed as one of computing free energy differences and sampling the tails of statistical distributions. Using Metadynamics, a realistic problem like that of two electrons confined in a quantum dot can be solved. We believe that this is a strategy that can possibly be extended to more complex systems.
