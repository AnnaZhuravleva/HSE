The uncertainty relation, one of the fundamental principles of quantum physics, captures the incompatibility of noncommuting observables in the preparation of quantum states. In this work, we derive two tight uncertainty relations for $N (N\ge2)$ observables, one in multiplicative form and another in additive form. Here the incompatibility is characterized by the non-orthogonality of the system state with the eigenstates of observables, which provides a new way to probe the relation between uncertainty and non-orthogonality. To verify their validity, for illustration, we implement in spin-1/2 system an experiment with single-photon measurement. The experimental results exhibit the validity of these uncertainty relations, and indicate the existence of stringent lower bounds.
