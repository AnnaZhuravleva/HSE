In this work, a mechanism for improving the quantum state transfer efficiency in a spin chain, which is in contact with a dissipative structured reservoir, is investigated. The efficiency of the method is based on the addition of similar non-interacting auxiliary chains into the reservoir. In this regard, we obtain the exact solution for the master equation of the spin chain in the presence of dissipation. It is found out that entering more auxiliary chains into the reservoir causes, in general, the better improvement of the fidelity of state transfer along the mentioned chain. Furthermore, it is reveal that the protocol has better efficiency for a chain with longer length. Therefore, by this method, quantum state transfer along a linear chain with an arbitrary number of qubits, can be well-protected against the dissipative noises.
