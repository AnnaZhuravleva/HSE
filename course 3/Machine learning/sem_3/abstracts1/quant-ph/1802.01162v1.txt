The state spaces of both classical and quantum systems have a point-asymmetry about the maximally mixed state except for bit and qubit systems. In this paper, we find an informational origin of this asymmetry: In any operationally valid probabilistic model, the state space has a point-asymmetry in order to store more than a single bit of information. In particular, we introduce a storable information as a natural measure of the storability of information and show the quantitative relation with the so-called Minkowski measure of the state space, which is an affinely invariant measure for point-asymmetry of a convex body. We also show the relation between these quantities and the dimension of the model, inducing some known results in \cite{ref:KNI} and \cite{ref:FMPT} as its corollaries. Also shown are a generalization of weaker form of the dual structure of quantum state spaces, and a generalization of the maximally mixed states as points of the critical set.
