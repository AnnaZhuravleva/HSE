We define a summoning task to require propagating an unknown quantum state to a point in space-time belonging to a set determined by classical inputs at points in space-time. We consider the classical analogue, in which a known classical state must be returned at precisely one allowed point. We show that, when the inputs are unconstrained, any summoning task that is possible in the classical case is also possible in the quantum case.
