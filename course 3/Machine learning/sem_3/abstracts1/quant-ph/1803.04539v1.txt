We propose and demonstrate a modular architecture for reconfigurable on-chip linear-optical circuits. Each module contains 10 independent phase-controlled Mach-Zehnder interferometers; several such modules can be connected to each other to build large reconfigurable interferometers. With this architecture, large interferometers are easier to build and characterize than with traditional, bespoke, monolithic designs. We demonstrate our approach by fabricating three modules in the form of UV-written silica-on-silicon chips. We characterize these chips, connect them to each other, and implement a wide range of linear optical transformations. We envisage that this architecture will enable many future experiments in quantum optics.
