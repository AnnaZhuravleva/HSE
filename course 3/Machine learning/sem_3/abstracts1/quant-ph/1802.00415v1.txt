In this paper we attempt to consider quantum superpositions from the perspective of the logos categorical approach presented in [26]. We will argue that our approach allows us not only to better visualize the structural features of quantum superpositions providing an anschaulich content to all terms, but also to restore --through the intensive valuation of graphs and the notion of immanent power-- an objective representation of what QM is really talking about. In particular, we will discuss how superpositions relate to some of the main features of the theory of quanta, namely, contextuality, paraconsistency, probability and measurement.
