The eigenstates of a quantum spin glass Hamiltonian with long-range interaction are examined from the point of view of localisation and entanglement. In particular, low particle sectors are examined and an anomalous family of eigenstates is found that is more delocalised but also has larger inter-spin entanglement. These are then identified as particle-added eigenstates from the one-particle sector. This motivates the introduction and the study of random promoted two-particle states, and it is shown that they may have large delocalisation such as generic ran- dom states and scale exactly like them. However, the entanglement as measured by two-spin concurrence displays different scaling with the total number of spins. This shows how for different classes of complex quantum states entanglement can be qualitatively different even if localisation measures such as participation ratio are not.
