A remarkable feature of typical ground states of strongly-correlated many-body systems is that the entanglement entropy is not an extensive quantity. In one dimension, there exists a proof that a finite correlation length sets a constant upper-bound on the entanglement entropy, called the area law. However, the known bound exists only in a hypothetical limit, rendering its physical relevance highly questionable. In this paper, we give a simple proof of the area law for entanglement entropy in one dimension under the condition of exponentially decaying correlations. Our proof dramatically reduces the previously known bound on the entanglement entropy, bringing it, for the first time, into a realistic regime. The proof is composed of several simple and straightforward steps based on elementary quantum information tools. We discuss the underlying physical picture, based on a renormalization-like construction underpinning the proof, which transforms the entanglement entropy of a continuous region into a sum of mutual informations in different length scales and the entanglement entropy at the boundary.
