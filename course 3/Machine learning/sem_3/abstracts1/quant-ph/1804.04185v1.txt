In this paper, we propose a novel quantum backscatter communications (QBC) protocol, inspired by the quantum illumination (QI) concept. In the QBC paradigm, the transmitter generates entangled photon pair. The signal photon is transmitted and the idler photon is kept at the receiver. The tag antenna communicates by performing the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), binary phase shift keying (BPSK) or quadratic phase shift keying (QPSK) on the signal impinging at the antenna. Using the sum-frequency-generation receiver, our QBC protocol achieves a 6 dB error exponent gain for PAM and BPSK, and 3 dB gain for QPSK over its classical counterpart. Finally, we discuss the QI-enhanced secure backscatter communication.
