Device independent dimension witnesses (DW) are a remarkable way to test the dimension of a quantum system in a prepare-and-measure scenario imposing minimal assumptions on the internal features of the devices. However, as the dimension increases, the major obstacle in the realization of DW arises due to the requirement of many outcome quantum measurements. In this article, we propose a new variant of a widely studied communication task (random access code) and take its average payoff as the DW. The presented DW applies to arbitrarily large quantum systems employing only binary outcome measurements.
