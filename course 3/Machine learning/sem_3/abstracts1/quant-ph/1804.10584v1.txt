The interdependence between long range correlations and topological signatures in fermionic arrays is examined. End-to-end correlations, in particular classical correlations, maintain a characteristic pattern in the presence of delocalized excitations and this behavior can be used as an operational criterion to identify Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. The study discusses how to obtain the chain eigenstates in tensor-state representation together with the proposed assessment of correlations. Outstandingly, the final result can be written as a simple analytical expression that underlines the link with the system's topological phases.
