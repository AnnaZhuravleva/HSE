Atom-surface forces using excited states have a host of compelling applications, including repulsive and lateral forces. However, such states can be fragile and difficult to prepare. Here we report an explicit normal-mode based calculation of the Casimir-Polder potential between a ground-state atom and a non-dispersive surface in the presence of an external quantised field. The potential we derive shares some features with that of excited-state Casimir-Polder forces even though we consider a ground-state atom. Our work provides a physically transparent and intuitive picture of driven Casimir-Polder potentials, as well as expanding on previous investigations by providing analytic results that fully include retardation, as well as being applicable for any choice of mutual alignment of the atom's dipole moment, the external field, and the surface normal.
