Using the Ermakov-Lewis invariants appearing in KvN mechanics, the time-dependent frequency harmonic oscillator is studied. The analysis builds upon the operational dynamical model, from which it is possible to infer quantum or classical dynamics; thus, the mathematical structure governing the evolution will be the same in both cases. The Liouville operator associated with the time-dependent frequency harmonic oscillator can be transformed using an Ermakov-Lewis invariant, which is also time dependent and commutes with itself at any time. Finally, because the solution of the Ermakov equation is involved in the evolution of the classical state vector, we explore some analytical and numerical solutions.
