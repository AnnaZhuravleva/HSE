Review of tomographic probability representation of quantum states is presented both for oscillator systems with continious variables and spin--systems with discrete variables. New entropic--information inequalities are obtained for Franck--Condon factors. Density matrices of qudit states are expressed in terms of probabilities of artificial qubits as well as the quantum suprematism approach to geometry of these states using the triadas of Malevich squares is developed. Examples of qubits, qutrits and ququarts are considered.
