We address the quantum metrology for two modes of a Dirac field described by relatively accelerated parties; an inertial observer Alice and a uniformly accelerated observer Bob moving with a constant acceleration $ a $ and experiencing the Unruh effect. By using the quantum Fisher information (QFI), we investigate in detail how the weak measurements, before and after accelerating Bob, affect the optimal estimation of information encoded into the weight and phase parameters of the initial state shared between the parties. Our results show that we can improve the parameter estimation compared to the scenario in which no measurements are carried out. Studying the QFI, associated with weight parameter $ \vartheta $, we find that the acceleration at which the optimal estimation occurs may be controlled by weak measurements, although the optimal value of the QFI is completely unaffected by the strength of the measurements. Moreover, the post-measurement plays the role of a quantum key for manifestation of the Unruh effect. On the other hand, investigating the phase estimation optimization and assuming that there is no control over the initial state, we show that the weak measurements may be utilized to match the optimal $ \vartheta $ to its predetermined value. Moreover, in addition to determination of a lower bound on the QFI with the local quantum uncertainty in the presence of Unruh effect, for the first time, we reveal an important upper bound on the precision of phase estimation, given by the maximal steered coherence (MSC). We also obtain a compact expression of the MSC for general X states.
