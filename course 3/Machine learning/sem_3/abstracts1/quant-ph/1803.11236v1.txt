Paper I of this series introduced a nonlinear version of quantum mechanics that blocks cats, and paper II postulated a random part of the wavefunction to explain outcomes in experiments such as Stern-Gerlach or EPRB. However, an ad hoc extra parameter was assumed for the randomness. Here I provide some analytic and simulation evidence that the nonlinear theory exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions in measurement scenarios, perhaps implying that the magnitude of randomness required is determined by structural features of the model, and does not require a free parameter.
