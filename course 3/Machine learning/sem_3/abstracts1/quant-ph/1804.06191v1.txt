Constructive techniques to establish state-independent uncertainty relations for the sum of variances of arbitrary two observables are presented. We investigate the range of simultaneously attainable pairs of variances, which can be applied to a wide variety of problems including detection of quantum entanglement. Resulting uncertainty relations are state-independent, semianalytical, bound-error and can be made arbitrarily tight. The advocated approach allows one to improve earlier numerical works and to derive semianalitical tight bounds for the uncertainty relation for the sum of variances constrained to finding roots of a polynomial of a single real variable. In several cases it is possible to solve the problem completely by establishing exact analytical bounds.
