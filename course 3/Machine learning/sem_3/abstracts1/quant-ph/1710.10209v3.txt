We study the quantum Brownian motion of a harmonic oscillator undergoing a sequence of generalized position measurements. Our exact analytical results capture the interplay of the measurement backaction and dissipation. Here we demonstrate that no freeze-in Zeno effect occurs upon increasing the monitoring frequency. A similar behavior is also found in the presence of generalized momentum measurements.
