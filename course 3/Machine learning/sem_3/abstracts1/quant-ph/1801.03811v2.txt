In all practical communication channels, the code word consist of Gaussian states and the measurement strategy is often a Gaussian detector such as homodyning or heterodyning. In this paper we investigate the communication performance using a phase conjugated alphabet and joint Gaussian detection in an phase-insensitive amplifying channel. We find that a communication scheme consisting of a phase conjugating alphabet of coherent states and a joint detection strategy, significantly outperforms a standard coherent state strategy based in individual detection. Moreover, we show that the performance can be further enhanced by using entanglement and that the performance is completely independent on the gain of the phase-insensitively amplifying channel.
