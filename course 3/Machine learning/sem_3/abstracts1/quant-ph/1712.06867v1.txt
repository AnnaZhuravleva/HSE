We extend a recent method to detect lower bounds to the quantum capacity of quantum communication channels by considering realistic scenarios with general input probe states and arbitrary detection procedures at the output. Realistic certification relies on a new bound for the coherent information of a quantum channel that can be applied with arbitrary bipartite mixed input states and generalized output measurements.
