Inspired by the recent work of Carleo and Troyer[1], we apply machine learning methods to quantum mechanics in this article. The radial basis function network in a discrete basis is used as the variational wavefunction for the ground state of a quantum system. Variational Monte Carlo(VMC) calculations are carried out for some simple Hamiltonians. The results are in good agreements with theoretical values. The smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix can also be acquired using VMC calculations. Our results demonstrate that machine learning techniques are capable of solving quantum mechanical problems.
