Gauge-independent Husimi function ($Q-$function) of states of charged quantum particles in the electro-magnetic field is introduced using the gauge-independent Stratonovich-Wigner function, the corresponding dequantizer and quantizer operators transforming the density matrix of state to the Husimi function and vice versa are found explicitly, and the evolution equation for such function is derived. Also own gauge-independent non-Stratonovich Wigner function is suggested and its Husimi function is obtained. Dequantizers and quantizers for these Wigner and Husimi functions are given.
