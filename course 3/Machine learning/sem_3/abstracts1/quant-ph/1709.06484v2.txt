We review the unconventional photon blockade mechanism. This quantum effect remarkably enables a strongly sub-Poissonian light statistics, even from a system characterized by a weak single photon nonlinearity. We revisit the past results, which can be interpreted in terms of quantum interferences or optimal squeezing, and show how recent developments on input-output field mixing can overcome the limitations of the original schemes towards passive and integrable single photon sources. We finally present some valuable alternative schemes for which the unconventional blockade can be directly adapted.
