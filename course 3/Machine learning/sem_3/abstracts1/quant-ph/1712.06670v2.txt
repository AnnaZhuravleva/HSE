It was recently shown [S. Lorenzo et al., Sci. Rep. 7, 42729 (2017)] that the presence of static disorder in a bosonic bath - whose normal modes thus become all Anderson-localised - leads to non-Markovianity in the emission of an atom weakly coupled to it (a process which in absence of disorder is fully Markovian). Here, we extend the above analysis beyond the weak-coupling regime for a finite-band bath so as to account for band edge effects. We study the interplay of these with static disorder in the emergence of non-Markovian behaviour in terms of a suitable non-Markovianity measure.
