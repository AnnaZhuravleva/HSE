Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), as one of the most promising schemes to realize quantum machine learning algorithms on near-term quantum computers, have been designed to solve machine earning tasks with quantum advantages. In this paper, we explain why PQCs with different structures can achieve generative tasks in the discrete case from the perspective of probability estimation. Although different kinds of PQCs are proposed for generative tasks, the current methods often encounter the following three hurdles: (1) the mode contraction problem; (2) unexpected data are often generated with a high proportion; (3) target data cannot be sampled directly. For the purpose of tackling the above hurdles, we devise Bayesian quantum circuit (BQC) through introducing ancillary qubits to represent prior distributions. BQC advances both generative and semi-supervised quantum circuit learning tasks, where its effectiveness is validated by numerical simulations using the Rigetti Forest platform.
