Chakraborty and Leonardo have shown that a spatial search by quantum walk is optimal for almost all graphs. However, we observed that on some graphs, certain states cannot be searched optimally. We present a method for constructing an optimal graph that searches an arbitrary state and provides the optimal condition. We also analyze the monotonicity of the search performance and conclude that the search performance can be improved by adding edges.
