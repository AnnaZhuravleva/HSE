We study nonclassical features of multiphoton light emitted by clusters of single-photon emitters. As signatures of nonclassicality, we use violation of inequalities for normalized correlation functions of different orders or the probabilities of multiphoton detection. In experiment, for clusters of 2 to 14 colloidal CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods we observe nonclassical behavior, which gets even more pronounced for larger clusters.
