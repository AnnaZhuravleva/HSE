We present a new scheme for teleporting a quantum state between two parties whose local reference frames are misaligned by the action of a finite symmetry group. Unlike other proposals, our scheme requires the same amount of classical communication and entangled resources as conventional teleportation, does not reveal any reference frame information, and is robust against changes in reference frame alignment while the protocol is underway. The mathematical foundation of our scheme is a unitary error basis which is permuted up to a phase by the conjugation action of the group. We completely classify such unitary error bases for qubits, exhibit constructions in higher dimension, and provide a method for proving nonexistence in some cases.
