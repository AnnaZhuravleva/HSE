We report a proof-of-concept demonstration of a tunable infrared (IR) optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique with detection of only visible range photons. Our method is based on the nonclassical interference of frequency correlated photon pairs. The nonlinear crystal, introduced in the Michelson-type interferometer, generates photon pairs with one photon in the visible and another in the IR range. The intensity of detected visible photons depends on the phase and loss of IR photons, which interact with the sample under study. This enables us to perform imaging and characterize sample properties in the IR range by detecting visible photons. The technique possesses broad tunability and yields a fair axial and lateral resolution. The work contributes to the development of versatile 3D imaging and material characterization systems working in a broad range of IR wavelengths, which do not require the use of IR-range equipment.
