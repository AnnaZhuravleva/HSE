Recent years have seen significant progress in capturing and classifying phases of matter within the framework of tensor networks. In this work, we study symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases protected by subsystem symmetries. Building upon the general framework laid out, we demonstrate how they can be used in notions of measurement-based quantum computing. We define subsystem symmetries via quantum cellular automata (QCA) and use tensor networks to show that non-trivial SPT order under these symmetries is characterized by the presence of the QCA on the virtual level of the tensor network. This provides a possible avenue to classify SPT phases protected by subsystem symmetries. We then show that all QCA defining diagonal line-like or fractal symmetries can be used to construct new computationally universal phases of matter, in which every state is a resource for universal measurement-based quantum computation.
