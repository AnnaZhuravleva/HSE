The entanglement detection via local measurements can be experimentally implemented. Based on mutually unbiased measurements and general symmetric informationally complete positive-operator-valued measures, we present separability criteria for bipartite quantum states, which, by theoretical analysis, are stronger than the related existing criteria via these measurements. Two detailed examples are supplemented to show the efficiency of the presented separability criteria.
