We perform a protocol for multipartite quantum clock synchronization in a relativistic setting. The dynamics of the multipartite quantum system consisting of Unruh-DeWitt detectors when one of the detectors under accelerated motion is obtained. To estimate the time difference between the clocks, we calculate the time probability and analyze how the probability is influenced by the Unruh thermal noise and other factors. It is shown that both relativistic motion and the interaction between atom and the external scalar field affect the choice of optimal number of excited atoms in the initial state, which leads to a higher clock adjustment accuracy. The time probabilities for different types of initial states approach to the same value in the limit of infinite acceleration, while they tend to different minimums with increasing number of atoms. In addition, the accuracy of clock synchronization using bipartite initial state is found always higher than multipartite systems, while the $Z$-type multipartite initial states always perform better than the $W$-type states.
