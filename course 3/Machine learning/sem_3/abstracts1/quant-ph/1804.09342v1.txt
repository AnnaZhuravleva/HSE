Major obstacles against all-optical implementation of scalable quantum communication are photon losses during transmission and the probabilistic nature of Bell measurements causing exponential scaling in time and resource with distance. To overcome these obstacles, while conventional quantum repeaters require matter-based operations with long-lived quantum memories, recent proposals have employed encoded multiple photons in entanglement providing an alternative way of scalability. In pursuing global scale quantum networks, naturally arising questions are then (i) whether or not any ultimate limit exists in all-optical implementations, and (ii) whether and how it can be achieved (if the limit exists). Motivated by these questions, we here address the fundamental limits of the efficiency and loss tolerance of the Bell measurement, restricted not by protocols but by the laws of physics, i.e. linear optics and no-cloning theorem. We then propose a Bell measurement scheme with linear optics and multiple photons, which enables one to reach both the fundamental limits: one by linear optics and the other by no-cloning theorem. Remarkably, the quantum repeater based on our scheme allows one to achieve fast and efficient quantum communication over arbitrary long distances, outperforming previous all-photonic and matter-based protocols. Our work provides a fundamental building block for all-optical scalable quantum networks with current optical technologies.
