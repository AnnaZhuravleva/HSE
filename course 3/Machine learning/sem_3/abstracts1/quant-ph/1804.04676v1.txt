Topological phases of matter have widely been explored in equilibrium closed systems, but richer properties appear in nonequilibrium open systems that are effectively described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. While several properties unique to non-Hermitian topological systems were uncovered, the fundamental role of symmetry in non-Hermitian physics has yet to be understood. In particular, it has remained unclear whether symmetry protects non-Hermitian topological phases. Here we show that time-reversal and particle-hole symmetries are topologically equivalent in the complex energy plane and hence unified in non-Hermitian physics. A striking consequence of this symmetry unification is the emergence of nonequilibrium topological phases that are absent in Hermitian systems and hence unique to non-Hermitian systems. We illustrate this by presenting a non-Hermitian counterpart of the Majorana chain in an insulator with time-reversal symmetry and that of the quantum spin Hall insulator in a superconductor with particle-hole symmetry. Our work establishes the fundamental symmetry principle in non-Hermitian physics and paves the way toward a unified framework for nonequilibrium topological phases of matter.
