We study the approximate scattering state solutions of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation (DKPE) and the spinless Salpeter equation (SSE) with the Hellmann potential. The eigensolutions, scattering phase shifts, partial-waves transitions and the total cross section for all the partial waves are obtained and discussed. The dependence of partial-waves transitions on total angular momentum number, angular momentum number, mass combination and potential parameters were presented in the figures.
