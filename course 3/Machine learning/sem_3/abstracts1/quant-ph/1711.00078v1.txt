We propose a method for using ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, to form an analog model of a scalar field in five dimensional space-time, where one of the spatial dimensions is compact. In the analog system the extra dimension is discrete, and realized using the internal degrees of freedom of the system. In the low energy regime, the Kaluza-Klein tower of masses is recovered, and the effective radius of the compact dimension is identified.
