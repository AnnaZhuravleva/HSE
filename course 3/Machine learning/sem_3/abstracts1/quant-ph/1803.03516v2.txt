Gaussian channels are the typical way to model the decoherence introduced by the environment in continuous-variable quantum states. It is known that those channels can be simulated by a teleportation protocol using as a resource state either a maximally entangled state passing through the same channel, i.e., the Choi-state, or a state that is entangled at least as much as the Choi-state. Since the construction of the Choi-state requires infinite mean energy and entanglement, i.e. it is unphysical, we derive instead every physical state able to simulate a given channel through teleportation with finite resources, and we further find the optimal ones, i.e., the resource states that require the minimum energy and entanglement. We show that the optimal resource states are pure and equally entangled to the Choi-state as measured by the entanglement of formation. We also show that the same amount of entanglement is enough to simulate an equally decohering channel, while even more entanglement can simulate less decohering channels. We, finally, use that fact to generalize a previously known error correction protocol by making it able to correct noise coming not only from pure loss but from thermal loss channels as well.
