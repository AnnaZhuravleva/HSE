Accelerating non-spreading wavepackets in nonrelativistic free particle system, with probability distribution having an Airy function profile, were discovered by Berry and Balazs (Am. J. Phys., 47, 264 (1979)), and have been subsequently realised in several optical experiments. It is shown that these wavepackets are actually coherent states. It is found that the Galilean invariance of the Schrodinger equation plays a key role in making these states unique and giving rise to their unusual propagation properties.
