Quantum applications transmit and receive data through quantum and classical communication channels. Channel capacity, the distance and the photon path between transmitting and receiving parties and the speed of the computation links play an essential role in timely synchronization and delivery of information using classical and quantum channels. In this study, we analyze and optimize the parameters of the communication channels needed for the quantum application to successfully operate. We also develop algorithms for synchronizing data delivery on classical and quantum channels.
