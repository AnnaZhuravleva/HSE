Coherent quantum oscillators are basic physical system both in quantum statistical physics and quantum thermodynamics. We discuss and compare two thermodynamic coefficients (generalized heat capacities) characterizing optomechanical oscillator strongly coupled to a thermal bath. The coupling is strong enough for the observed oscillator energy levels to be dependent on bath temperature. The capacities are related to two different experiments. One measurement is a differential scanning calorimetry, the second probes the second statistical moment of the oscillator position. As we analyze, the strong coupling allows both localization and purification of the oscillator induced by increasing the bath temperature. The capacities can be negative and can witness certain types of the energy-levels temperature dependence. Our findings are stimulating for current development of optomechanical and thermomechanical experiments.
