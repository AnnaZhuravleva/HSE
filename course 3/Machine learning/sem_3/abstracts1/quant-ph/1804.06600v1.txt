Flexible Rydberg aggregates, assemblies of few Rydberg atoms coherently sharing electronic excitations while undergoing directed atomic motion, show great promise as quantum simulation platform for nuclear motional dynamics in molecules or quantum energy transport. Here we study additional features that are enabled by the presence of more than a single electronic excitation, thus considering multi-exciton states. We describe cases where these can be decomposed into underlying single exciton states and then present dynamical scenarios with atomic motion that illustrate exciton-exciton collisions, exciton routing, and strong non-adiabatic effects in simple one-dimensional settings.
