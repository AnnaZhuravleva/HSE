The problem of photon-photon interaction controlled by a two-level system is studied in this paper. Specifically, we have proposed two scenarios: Case 1, how a two-level system changes the pulse shapes of two initially uncorrelated input photons in a single input channel; and Case 2, how a two-level system entangles two counter-propagating photons, one in each input channel. The steady-state output field states for both cases are derived explicitly. For Case 1, the Wigner spectrum is used to exhibit the interesting properties of the output field state. For Case 2, the nonlinear property of the interaction between the two-level system and the two input photons has been revealed by the probabilities of observing photons in the output channels. In addition, two-photon interference, similar to Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, occurs when the two input photons are chosen with the same pulse shape.
