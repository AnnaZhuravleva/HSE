In this paper, we model exchange of energy between electrons in solids and the phonon bath as electron-phonon collisions. Phonons are modelled as packets which create a lattice deformation potential of which electrons scatter. We show how these collisions exchange energy between electrons and phonons, leading to Fermi-Dirac distribution for electrons. Using these collisions, we derive the temperature dependence of resistivity of metals and the Bloch's $T$ and $T^5$ law for high and low temperature regime respectively. Unlike standard derivations of $T$ dependence of high temperature resistivity, our derivation rests fundamentally on the temperature dependence of the scattering angle.
