We find one-shot bounds for concentration of maximally coherent states in the so called assisted scenario. In this setting, Bob is restricted to performing incoherent operations on his quantum system, however he is assisted by Alice, who holds a purification of Bob's state and can send classical data to him. We further show that in the asymptotic limit our one-shot bounds recover the previously computed rate of asymptotic assisted concentration.
