Paramagnetic centres in a solid hold promise in future sensing applications. Numerous sensing applications have been theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. However, sensitivity improvements remain challenging. One approach to overcome this is hybrid quantum sensing with quantum memories. We propose hybrid quantum sensing with virtual quantum memories using dressed states. We also observe the generation of more than four dressed states in a single paramagnetic centre based on Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) and demonstrate the extension of the coherence time to $T_2 \sim$ 1.5 ms for dressed states, which is more than two orders of magnitude longer than that of the undressed spin. Furthermore, we theoretically estimate the enhancement of sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude compared with that without memory. The results and our approach will pave the way for new hybrid quantum sensing.
