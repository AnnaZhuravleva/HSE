We report on the detection of free nanoparticles in a micromachined, open-access Fabry-P\'erot microcavity. With a mirror separation of $130\,\mu$m, a radius of curvature of $1.3\,$mm, and a beam waist of $12\,\mu$m, the mode volume of our symmetric infrared cavity is smaller than $15\,$pL. The small beam waist, together with a finesse exceeding 34,000, enables the detection of nano-scale dielectric particles in high vacuum. This device allows monitoring of the motion of individual $150\,$nm radius silica nanospheres in real time. We observe strong coupling between the particles and the cavity field, a precondition for optomechanical control. We discuss the prospects for optical cooling and detection of dielectric particles smaller than $10\,$nm in radius and $1\times10^7\,$amu in mass.
