Discrete-time quantum walks are considered a counterpart of random walks and the study for them has been getting attention since around 2000. In this paper, we focus on a quantum walk which generates a probability distribution splitting to two parts. The quantum walker with two coin states spreads at points, represented by integers, and we analyze the chance of finding the walker at each position after it carries out a unitary evolution a lot of times. The result is reported as a long-time limit distribution from which one can see an approximation to the finding probability.
