Nonclassicality of temporal correlations pertaining to non-commutative sequential measurements is defined through the violation of macrorealistic inequalities, known as Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGI). We investigate the energy cost of the process associated with the Leggett-Garg test in the context of noiseless and Markovian noise for arbitrary initial states. We prove that in the noiseless and certain noisy scenarios, the maximal violations of LGI under the energy constraint occurs when the average energy of the process is equal to the negative of the energy of the initial state. Such a dependence of LGI on the choice of the initial state is not seen in the unconstrained case. Moreover, we find that in presence of a moderate amount of Markovian noise, the amount of violation of LGI remains almost unaltered with suitable choice of the evolution and dephasing operators in the neighborhood of the maximal violation line, thereby showing the robustness of temporal correlations under environmental effects.
