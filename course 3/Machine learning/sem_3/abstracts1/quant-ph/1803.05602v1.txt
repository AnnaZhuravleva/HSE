The correspondence principle suggests that a quantum description for the microworld should be naturally transited to a classical description within the classical limit. However, it seems that there is a large gap between quantum no-cloning and classical duplication. In this paper, we prove that a classical duplication process can be realized using a universal quantum cloning machine. In the classical world, information is encoded in a large number of quantum states instead of one quantum state. When tolerable errors occur in a small number of the quantum states, the fidelity of duplicated copies of classical information can approach unity. That is, classical information duplication is equivalent to a redundant quantum cloning process with self-correcting.
