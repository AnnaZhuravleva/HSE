We describe a method to analyze and decompose the dynamics of a control system on a Lie group subject to symmetries. The method is based on the concept of generalized Young symmetrizers of representation theory. It naturally applies to the situation where the system evolves on a tensor product space and there exists a finite group of symmetries for the dynamics which interchanges the various factors. This is the case for quantum mechanical multipartite systems, such as spin networks, where each factor of the tensor product represents the state of one of the component systems. We present several examples of applications and indicate directions for future research.
