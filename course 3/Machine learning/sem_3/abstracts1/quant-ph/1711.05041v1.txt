It is a computationally hard task to certify genuine multipartite entanglement (GME). We investigate the relation between the norms of the correlation vectors and the detection of GME for tripartite quantum systems. A sufficient condition for GME and an effective lower bound for the GME concurrence are derived. Several examples are considered to show the effectiveness of the criterion and the lower bound of GME concurrence.
