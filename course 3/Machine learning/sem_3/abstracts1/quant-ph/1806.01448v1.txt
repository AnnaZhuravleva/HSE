Mobility edge transitions from localized to extended states have been observed in two and three dimensional systems, for which sound theoretical explanations have also been derived. One-dimensional lattice models have failed to predict their emergence, offering no clues on how to actually probe this phenomenon in lower dimensions. This work reports results for a class of tight-binding models with electron-mass position dependence, for which localized-extended wave function transitions can be identified. We show that it is possible to control the density of localized and extended states by tuning the transition-related parameter for a continuous range of energy values. Mathematically exact results for extended or localized states are derived in two extreme conditions of this parameter, as well as an exact energy value for the mobility edge transition in the intermediate regime. Our framework provides a clear point of view on the phenomena and can also be harnessed for setting up experiments to probe to precisely evaluate the associated mobility edges using state-of-the-art technology.
