The superposition of quantum states is one of the hallmarks of quantum physics, and clear demonstrations of superposition have been achieved in a number of quantum systems. However, mechanical systems have remained a challenge, with only indirect demonstrations of mechanical state superpositions, in spite of the intellectual appeal and technical utility such a capability would bring. This is due in part to the highly linear response of most mechanical systems, making quantum operation difficult, as well as their characteristically low frequencies, making it difficult to reach the quantum ground state. In this work, we demonstrate full quantum control of the mechanical state of a macroscopic mechanical resonator. We strongly couple a surface acoustic wave resonator to a superconducting qubit, using the qubit to control and measure quantum states in the mechanical resonator. Most notably, we generate a quantum superposition of the zero and one phonon states and map this and other states using Wigner tomography. This precise, programmable quantum control is essential to a range of applications of surface acoustic waves in the quantum limit, including using surface acoustic waves to couple disparate quantum systems.
