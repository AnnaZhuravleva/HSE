We show how to generate tripartite entanglement in a cavity magnomechanical system which consists of magnons, cavity microwave photons, and phonons. The magnons are embodied by a collective motion of a large number of spins in a macroscopic ferrimagnet, and are driven directly by an electromagnetic field. The cavity photons and magnons are coupled via magnetic dipole interaction, and the magnons and phonons are coupled via magnetostrictive (radiation pressure-like) interaction. We show optimal parameter regimes for achieving the tripartite entanglement where magnons, cavity photons, and phonons are entangled with each other. The entanglement is robust against temperature. Our results indicate that cavity magnomechanical systems could provide a promising platform for the study of macroscopic quantum phenomena.
