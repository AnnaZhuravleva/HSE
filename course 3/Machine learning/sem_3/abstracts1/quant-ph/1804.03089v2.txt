When quantum information is spread over a system through nonclassical correlation, it makes retrieving information by local measurements difficult---making global measurement necessary for optimal parameter estimation. In this paper, we consider temperature estimation of a system in a Gibbs state and quantify the separation between the estimation performance of the global optimal measurement scheme and a greedy local measurement scheme by diagonal quantum discord. In a greedy local scheme, instead of global measurements, one performs sequential local measurement on subsystems, which is potentially enhanced by feed-forward communication. We show that, for finite-dimensional systems, diagonal discord quantifies the difference in the quantum Fisher information quantifying the precision limits for temperature estimation of these two schemes, and we analytically obtain the relation in the high-temperature limit. We further verify this result by employing the examples of spins with Heisenberg's interaction.
