A unifying framework for the control of quantum systems with non-Abelian holonomy is presented. It is shown that, from a control theoretic point of view, holonomic quantum computation can be treated as a control system evolving on a principal fiber bundle. An extension of methods developed for these classical systems may be applied to quantum holonomic systems to obtain insight into the control properties of such systems and to construct control algorithms for two established examples of the computing paradigm.
