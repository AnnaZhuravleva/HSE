Time has been an illusive concept to grasp. Although we do not yet understand it properly, there has been advances made in regards as to how we could explain it. One of such advances is the Page-Wootters mechanism. In the mechanism time is seen as an inaccessible coordinate and the apparently passage of time arises as a consequence of correlations between the subsystems of a global state. Here we propose a measure that captures the relational character of the mechanism, showing that it is the internal coherence the necessary ingredient to the emergence of time in the Page-Wootters model. Also, we connect it to works done in quantum thermodynamics, showing that it is directly related to the extractable work from quantum coherence.
