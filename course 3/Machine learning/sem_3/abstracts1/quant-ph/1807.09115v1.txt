To answer John Wheeler's "Really Big Question," "Why the quantum?" via quantum information theory according to Bub, one must explain both why the world is quantum rather than classical and why the world is quantum rather than superquantum, i.e., "Why the Tsirelson bound?" We propose an answer to these questions based on the assumption that the world is not "quantum rather than classical" (reductionism) but is fundamentally both (quantum-classical contextuality), as constrained by conservation principles from the spacetime symmetry group. We illustrate this using the spin singlet state and the `Mermin photon state', which uniquely produce the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) quantity, showing how quantum correlations satisfy conservation of angular momentum for binary (quantum) outcomes while both classical and superquantum correlations violate this constraint. Accordingly, as Unnikrishnan has pointed out, expecting the Bell inequality to be satisfied for quantum outcomes per classical probability theory means abandoning the conservation of angular momentum. Thus, that experiments have produced violations of the Bell inequality up to the Tsirelson bound and not beyond can be explained by conservation of angular momentum for quantum outcomes per quantum-classical reality as constrained by the spacetime symmetry group.
