Classical thermodynamics is built with the concept of equilibrium states. However, it is less clear how equilibrium thermodynamics emerges through dynamics that follows the principle of quantum mechanics. In this paper, we develop a theory to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems which is applicable to arbitrary small systems, even for a single particle system, in contact with a reservoir. We generalize the concept of temperature beyond equilibrium that depends on the details of quantum states of the system and their dynamics. This nonequilibrium theory for quantum thermodynamics unravels (1) the emergence of classical thermodynamics from quantum dynamics of a single particle system in the weak system-reservoir coupling regime, without introducing any hypothesis on equilibrium state; (2) the breakdown of classical thermodynamics in the strong coupling regime, induced by non-Markovian memory dynamics; and (3) the occurrence of negative temperature associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition. The corresponding dynamical criticality provides the border separating the classical and quantum thermodynamics, and it may also reveal the origin of universe inflation. The third law of thermodynamics, allocated in the deep quantum realm, is also proved in this theory.
