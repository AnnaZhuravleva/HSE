We show that one can quantum simulate the dynamics of a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with $N$ Majorana modes for time $t$ to precision $\epsilon$ with gate complexity $O(N^{7/2} t + N \log(1 / \epsilon) / \log\log(1/\epsilon))$. In addition to scaling sublinearly in the number of Hamiltonian terms, this gate complexity represents an exponential improvement in $1/\epsilon$ and large polynomial improvement in $N$ and $t$ over prior state-of-the-art algorithms which scale as $O(N^{10} t^2 / \epsilon)$. Our approach involves a variant of the qubitization technique in which we encode the Hamiltonian $H$ as an asymmetric projection of a signal oracle $U$ onto two different signal states prepared by state oracles, $A\left\vert{0}\right\rangle \mapsto \left\vert{A}\right\rangle$ and $B \left\vert{0}\right\rangle \mapsto \left\vert{B}\right\rangle$, such that $H = \left\langle{B}\right\vert U\left\vert{A}\right\rangle$. Our strategy for applying this method to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model involves realizing $B$ using only Hadamard gates and realizing $A$ as a random quantum circuit.
