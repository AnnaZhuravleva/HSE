In this letter, the generalization of geometric phase in density matrix is presented, we show that the extended sub-geometric phase have unified expression whatever in adiabatic or nonadiabatic procedure, the relations between them and the usual Berry phase or Aharonov-Anandan phase are established. We also demonstrated the influence of sub-geometric phases on the physical observables. Finally, our treatment is naturally used to investigate the geometric phase in mixed state.
