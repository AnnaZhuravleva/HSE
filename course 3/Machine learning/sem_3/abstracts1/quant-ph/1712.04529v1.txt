It is a long standing question whether or not one can change the nature of spontaneous emission by a free electron through shaping the electron wavefunction. On one hand, shaping the electron wavefunction changes the respective charge and current densities of the electron. On the other hand, spontaneous emission of an electron is an incoherent process and can often be insensitive to the shape of the electron wavefunction. In this work, we arrive at an affirmative answer examining Bremsstrahlung radiation by free electron superposition states. We find that the radiation can be markedly different from an incoherent sum of the radiations of the two states because of interference of the radiation amplitudes from the two components of the superposition. The ability to control free electron spontaneous emission via interference may eventually result in a new degree of control over radiation over the entire electromagnetic spectrum in addition to the ability to deterministically introduce quantum behavior into normally classical light emission processes.
