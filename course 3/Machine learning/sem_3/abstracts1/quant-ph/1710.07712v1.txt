Hamiltonians of quantum many-body systems incorporate few-body nature of interactions among its constituents. Classical random matrix ensembles are ensembles of many-body interactions and thus, it is more appropriate to model these systems by embedded ensembles for fermions and bosons. Embedded ensembles account for few-body nature of interactions. We provide a brief overview of classical random matrix ensembles and embedded ensembles. Decoherence of a quantum bit interacting with an environment modeled by embedded ensemble for fermions and bosons is studied. Numerical calculations bring out the dependence of decoherence on the nature of the environment.
