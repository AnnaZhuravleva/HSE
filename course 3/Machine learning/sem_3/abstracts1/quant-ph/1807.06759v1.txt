We show that it is possible to simulate an anyon by a trapped atom which possesses an induced electric dipole momentum in the background of electromagnetic fields consisting of a uniform magnetic field and two electric fields. We find that the atom behaves like an anyon because its angular momentum takes fractional values when the atom is cooled down to the limit that its effective kinetic energy is negligibly small. The fractional part of the angular momentum is determined by both the intensity of the magnetic field and the electric charge density of one of the sources of electric fields. Roles the electric fields played in the simulation of the anyon are analyzed.
