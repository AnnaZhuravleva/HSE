We study how the quantum coherence and classical correlation influence energy transport in a unitary evolved system under weak coupling limit. The ratio relation between the transported energy and the change of coherence is explicitly derived. The conditions for the quantum coherence and the classical correlation as the unique mandatary are presented. Detailed examples are studied for two two-level quantum systems.
