The absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states play key roles in quantum information processing. We provide an explicit expression of the generalized Bloch representation of AME states for general dimension $d$ of individual subsystems and arbitrary number of partite $n$. Based on this analytic formula, we prove that the trace of the squared support for any given weight is given by the so-called hyper-geometric function and is irrelevant with the choices of the subsystems. The optimal point for the existence of AME states is obtained.
