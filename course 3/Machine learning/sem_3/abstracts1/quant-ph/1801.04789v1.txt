We investigate theoretically the model of two \qubits" system (one qubit having an auxiliary level) interacting with a single-mode resonator in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single photon could simultaneously excite two qubits without breaking the parity symmetry of system by properly encoding the excited states of qubits. The optimal parameter regime for achieving high probability approaching one is identified in the case of ignoring the system dissipation. Moreover, using experimentally feasible parameters, we also analyze the dissipation dynamics of the system, and present the realization of two-qubit excitation induced by single-photon. This work offers an alternative approach to realize the single-photon-induced two qubits excitation, which should advance the development of single-photon quantum technologies and have potential applications in quantum information science.
