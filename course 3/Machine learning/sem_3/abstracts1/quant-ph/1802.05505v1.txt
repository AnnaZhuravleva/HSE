Hybrid systems of ultracold atoms and trapped ions or Rydberg atoms can be useful for quantum simulation purposes. By tuning the geometric arrangement of the impurities it is possible to mimic solid state and molecular systems. Here we study a single trapped atom interacting with a set of arbitrarily arranged static impurities and show that the problem admits an analytical solution. We analyze in detail the case of two impurities, finding multiple trap-induced resonances which can be used for entanglement generation. Our results serve as a building block for the studies of quantum dynamics of complex systems.
