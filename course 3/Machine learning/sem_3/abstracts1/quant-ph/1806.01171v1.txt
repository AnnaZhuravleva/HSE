Recently, an interesting form of non-classical effect which can be considered as a form of contextuality within quantum mechanics, has been demonstrated for a four-level system by discriminating the different routes that are taken for measuring a single observable. In this paper, we provide a simpler version of that proof for a single qutrit, which is also within the formalism of quantum mechanics and without recourse to any realist hidden variable model. The degeneracy of the eigenvalues and the L$\ddot{u}$der projection rule play important role in our proof.
