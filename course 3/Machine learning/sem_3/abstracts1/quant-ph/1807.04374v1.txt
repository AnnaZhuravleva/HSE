In classical mechanics, external constraints on the dynamical variables can be easily implemented within the Lagrangian formulation and form the basis for several interesting mechanical phenomena and devices. Conversely, the extension of this idea to the quantum realm, which dates back to Dirac, has proven notoriously difficult due to the non-commutativity of observables. Motivated by recent progress in the experimental control of quantum systems, we propose here an implementation of quantum constraints based on the idea of work protocols, which are dynamically engineered to enfore the constraints. As a proof of principle, we consider a quantum harmonic oscillator and show how the combination of two work protocols can be used to implement non-trivial constraints in quantum phase space which couple together the first and second moments of the quadrature operators. We find that such constraints affect the equations of motion for the system in a non-trivial way, inducing non-linear behavior and even classical chaos, although Gaussianity is preserved at all times. A discussion concerning the robustness of this approach to possible experimental errors is also presented.
