In recent years, there have been many studies on local stabilizer codes. Under the assumption of translation and scale invariance Yoshida classified such codes. His result implies that translation invariant 2D color codes are equivalent to copies of toric codes. Independently, Bombin, Duclos-Cianci, and Poulin showed that a local translation invariant 2D topological stabilizer code is locally equivalent to a finite number of copies of Kitaev's toric code. In this paper we focus on 2D topological color codes and relax the assumption of translation invariance. Using a linear algebraic framework we show that any 2D color code (without boundaries) is locally equivalent to two copies of a related surface code. This surface code is induced by color code. We study the application of this equivalence to the decoding of 2D color codes over the bit flip channel as well as the quantum erasure channel. We report the performance of the color code on the square octagonal lattice over the quantum erasure channel. Further, we provide explicit circuits that perform the transformation between 2D color codes and surface codes. Our circuits do not require any additional ancilla qubits.
