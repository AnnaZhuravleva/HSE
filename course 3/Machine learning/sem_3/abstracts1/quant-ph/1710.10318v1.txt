We show how a generalized kind of chiral symmetry can be used to construct highly-efficient reservoir engineering protocols for bosonic lattices. These protocols exploit only a single squeezed reservoir coupled to a single lattice site; this is enough to stabilize the entire system in a pure, entangled steady state. Our approach is applicable to lattices in any dimension, and does not rely on translational invariance. We show how the relevant symmetry operation directly determines the real space correlation structure in the steady state, and give several examples that are within reach in several one and two dimensional quantum photonic platforms.
