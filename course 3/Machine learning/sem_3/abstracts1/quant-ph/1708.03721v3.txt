This study concerns with the thermalization process of a single mode radiation field by an atomic reservoir. In particular, the temporal evolution of quantum thermalization of a single mode radiation field weakly coupled to an atomic reservoir analysed in the framework of a quantum micromaser model both analytically and numerically. The findings show that the system thermalizes by both multi-atom and multi-level atom reservoir. It's shown that different reservoirs constitute different scaling laws with respect to their typical parameters on thermalization time. Moreover, a quantum reservoir parameter dependent thermalization time which can be used for faster heating or cooling a single radiation mode field derived analytically and verified numerically. We believe that obtained results will contribute convenient parameter selection options for expanding or reducing the open system thermalization time on demand. These results are of importance for boosting the efficiency of quantum photonic heat engines using radiation fields as working substances operating at finite time.
