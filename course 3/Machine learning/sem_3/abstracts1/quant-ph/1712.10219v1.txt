We propose a protocol for multipartite secret sharing of quantum information through an \textit{amplitude damping} quantum channel. This network is, for example, of two organizations communicating with their own employees connected via classical channels locally. We consider a GHZ state distributed among four members in an asymmetric fashion where the members of a sub-party collaborate to decode the received information at their end. The target is to send two bits of information in \textit{one execution} of the protocol. Firstly, we consider an ideal channel and observe that our protocol enables decoding of a secret 2-bit information with unit probability. This is accomplished by one of the senders by the use of a globally operated \textit{quantum teleportation operator}. Secondly, we implement the same protocol in a realistic scenario under energy dissipation by the use of a parameterized \textit{amplitude damping channel} with variable noise. This noise is associated with energy dissipation and hence, loss of probability to distinguish and decode the information at the receiving end. Finally, we make this task possible through an optimization algorithm. Various channel \textit{quality measures} are also quantitatively ascertained.
