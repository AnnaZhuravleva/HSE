Quantum error detection has always been a fundamental challenge in a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Hence, it is of immense importance to detect and deal with arbitrary errors to efficiently perform quantum computation. Several error detection codes have been proposed and realized for lower number of qubit systems. Here we present an error detection code for a (2n+1)-qubit entangled state using two syndrome qubits and simulate it on IBM's 16-qubit quantum computer for a 13-qubit entangled system. The code is able to detect an arbitrary quantum error in any one of the first 2n qubits of the (2n+1)-qubit entangled state and detects any bit-flip error on the last qubit of the (2n+1)-qubit entangled state via measurements on a pair of ancillary error syndrome qubits. The protocol presented here paves the way for designing error detection codes for the general higher number of entangled qubit systems.
