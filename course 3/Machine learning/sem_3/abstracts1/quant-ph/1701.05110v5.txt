Quantum coherence is a key resource in quantum information processing scenarios, and quantifying coherence is an important task for both quantum foundation and quantum technology. However, until now, all most of coherence measures are basis-dependent that does not accord with physical reality, since the physical properties of the physical system should not be changed with the different choice of coordinate systems. Here, we propose an \textit{intrinsic basis-independent quantum coherence measure} which satisfies all conditions for quantifying coherence. This measurement not only reveals physical essence of quantum coherence of the quantum state itself clearly, but also simplifies the measurement procedure by avoiding the optimization procedure of distance measure.
