A pair of quantum channels are said to be incompatible if they cannot be realized as marginals of a single channel. This paper addresses the general structure of the incompatibility of completely positive channels with a fixed quantum input space and with general outcome operator algebras. We define a compatibility relation for such channels by identifying the composite outcome space as the maximal (projective) $C^\ast$-tensor product of outcome algebras. We show theorems that characterize this compatibility relation in terms of the concatenation and conjugation of channels, generalizing the recent result for channels with quantum outcome spaces. These results are applied to the positive operator valued measures (POVMs) by identifying each of them with the corresponding quantum-classical (QC) channel. We also give a characterization of the maximality of a POVM with respect to the post-processing preorder in terms of the conjugate channel of the QC channel. We consider another definition of compatibility of normal channels by identifying the composite outcome space with the normal tensor product of the outcome von Neumann algebras. We prove that for a given normal channel the class of normally compatible channels is upper bounded by a special class of channels called tensor conjugate channels. We show the inequivalence of the $C^\ast$- and normal compatibility relations for QC channels, which originates from the possibility and impossibility of copying operations for commutative von Neumann algebras in $C^\ast$- and normal compatibility relations, respectively.
