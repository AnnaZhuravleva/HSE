We find the laws for the spreading of the spatial widths (parallel and transverse to the direction of average motion) of the relativistic position probability density for a massive, spinless particle. We find that when the momentum width of the wavepacket is small compared to the average momentum, there is a long time over which spreading is minimal. This result may be useful in particle accelerator design. We also demonstrate the Lorentz contraction of a wavepacket using relativistic probability amplitudes.
