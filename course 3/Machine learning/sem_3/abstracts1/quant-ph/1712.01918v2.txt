Recently the Many-Interacting-Worlds (MIW) approach to a quantum theory without wave functions was proposed. This approach leads quite naturally to numerical integrators of the Schr\"odinger equation. It has been suggested that such integrators may feature advantages over fixed-grid methods for higher numbers of degrees of freedom. However, as yet, little is known about concrete MIW models for more than one spatial dimension and/or more than one particle. In this work we develop the MIW approach further to treat arbitrary degrees of freedom, and provide a systematic study of a corresponding numerical implementation for computing one-particle ground and excited states in one dimension, and ground states in two spatial dimensions. With this step towards the treatment of higher degrees of freedom we hope to stimulate their further study.
