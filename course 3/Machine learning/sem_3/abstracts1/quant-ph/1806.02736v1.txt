Quantum processors with sizes in the 10-100 qubit range are now increasingly common. However, with increased size comes increased complexity for benchmarking. The effectiveness of a given device may vary greatly between different tasks, and will not always be easy to predict from single and two qubit gate fidelities. For this reason, it is important to assess processor quality for a range of important tasks. In this work we propose and implement tests based on random quantum circuits. These are used to evaluate multiple different superconducting qubit devices, with sizes from 5 to 19 qubits, from two hardware manufacturers: IBM Research and Rigetti. The data is analyzed to give a quantitive description of how the devices perform. We also describe how it can be used for a qualititive description accessible to the layperson, by being played as a game.
