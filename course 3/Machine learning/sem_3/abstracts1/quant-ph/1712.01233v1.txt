A computing platform based on low temperature superconductors (LTS) has already been proven both theoretically and experimentally. However, qubits based on high Tc superconductors (HTS) are not yet well understood. Here we study the Andreev bounds states (ABS) in the later materials in order to show that a formal correspondence exists between the Mathieu levels in a Cooper Pair Box qubit built with LTS and the Andreev levels in HTS junctions.
