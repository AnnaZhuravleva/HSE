Quantum key distribution is an effective encryption technique which can be used to perform secure quantum communication between satellite and ground stations. Quantum cryptography enhances security in various networks such as optical fibers and wireless networks. In addition to this, these networks become vulnerable in presence of high attenuation due to atmospheric effects and noise. Hence, errors occur due to decoherence. The noisy quantum channel is modeled and implemented by the redundancy-free quantum error correction scheme which provides better security and throughput efficiency as shown in simulation results.
