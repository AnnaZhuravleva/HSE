The modification of the effect of interactions of a particle as a function of its pre- and postselected states is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. The universality property of this modification in the case of local interactions of a spatially pre- and postselected particle has been found. It allowed to define an operational approach for characterization of the presence of a quantum particle in a particular place: the way it modifies the effect of local interactions. The experiment demonstrating this universality property provides an efficient interferometric alignment method, in which the beam on a single detector throughout one phase scan yields all misalignment parameters.
