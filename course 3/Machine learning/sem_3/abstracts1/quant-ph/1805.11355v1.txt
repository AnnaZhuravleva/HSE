It is well known that certain quantum correlations like quantum steering exhibit a monogamous relationship. In this paper, we exploit the asymmetric nature of quantum steering and show that there exist states which exhibit a kind of polygamous correlation, where the state of one party, Alice, can be steered only by the joint effort of the other two parties, Bob and Charlie. %This is in any way not in contradiction with the existing literature. Since, instead of looking at whether Alice can steer both Bob and Charlie simultaneously or not, we investigate whether there exists states such that Alice can only be steered by Bob and Charlie together. As an example, we explicitly single out a particular set of $3$ qubit states which exhibit polygamous relationship and also provide a recipe to identify the complete set of such states. We also provide a possible application of such states to an information theoretic task, we term as quantum key authentication (QKA). QKA can also be used in conjunction with other well known cryptography protocols to improve their security and we provide one such example with quantum private comparison (QPC).
