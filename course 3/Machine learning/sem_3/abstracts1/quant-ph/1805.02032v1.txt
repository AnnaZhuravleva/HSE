Measurement incompatibility is the most basic resource that distinguishes quantum from classical physics. Contextuality is the critical resource behind the power of some models of quantum computation and a necessary ingredient for many applications in quantum information. A fundamental problem is thus identifying when incompatibility produces contextuality. Here we show that, given a structure of incompatibility characterized by a graph in which nonadjacent vertices represent incompatible ideal measurements, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum realization producing contextuality is that this graph contains induced cycles of size larger than three. This result completes one by Ramanathan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050404 (2012)], points out the fundamental importance of the results of Ara\'ujo et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88, 022118 (2013)], and allows us to identify all experimental scenarios with quantum contextuality, unveiling new interesting cases.
