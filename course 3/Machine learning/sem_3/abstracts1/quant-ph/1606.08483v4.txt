A group of two-level atoms in dark state in the framework of Tavis-Cummings model cannot emit a photon, though, it has a non-zero energy. Dark states can serve as a controllable energy reservoir from which we can extract the photons by differentiated impact on atoms, for example, by their spatial separation. A type of dark states are invisible states, which can neither absorb nor emit a photon. The subspace of invisible states is the simplest example of a subspace that is free from decoherence, and therefore are of interest for quantum computing. It is proved that any dark state is a linear combination of tensor products of EPR singlets and the ground state of individual atoms. The dimension of the dark subspaces with the different energies are Catalan numbers. Every invisible state is a linear combination only of the products of singlets. The proof essentially uses the concept of amplitude quanta - small amplitude portions, the trajectory of which under the action of the Hamiltonian is determined uniquely; quantization of the amplitude is defined only for initial states of a special type, which includes dark states. The almost-dark states are combinations of triplets, which do not emit photons for a long time at low excitation energy of the atoms.
