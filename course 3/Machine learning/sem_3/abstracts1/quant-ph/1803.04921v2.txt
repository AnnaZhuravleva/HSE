This article concludes our critical analysis on the role of non-commutativity in quantum theory. After a brief introduction of the necessary notions on point processes, we re-analyse model B proposed in "On non-commutativity in quantum theory (II): toy models for non-commutative kinematics", using the point process theory. This viewpoint allows to generalize and modify the space process of model B in a simple manner, obtaining a new model (model C). This new model allows the recovery of non-relativistic quantum mechanics in a suitable limit.
