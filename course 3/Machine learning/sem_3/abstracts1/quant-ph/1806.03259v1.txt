Grover's algorithm achieves a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms, however, it can't maintain high success probability when there exist multiple target items, and is considered necessary to know the number of target items exactly [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 150501 (2005); Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 210501 (2014)]. In this paper, we find out that the Grover algorithm can also apply to the case that only the range of the fraction of target items is known. Moreover, a complementary-multiphase quantum search algorithm is proposed, % with an optimal number of queries in which multiple phases complement each other so that the overall high success probability can be maintained. Compared to the existing algorithms, in the case defined above, for the first time our algorithm achieves the following three goals simultaneously: (1) the algorithm is applicable to the entire range of the fraction of target items, (2) the success probability can be not less than any given value between 0 and 1, and (3) the number of iterations is almost the same as that of Grover's algorithm. Especially compared to the optimal fixed-point algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 210501 (2014)], our algorithm uses fewer iterations to achieve success probability greater than 82.71\%, e.g. when the minimum success probability is required to be 99.25\%, the number of iterations can be reduced by 50\%.
