We present an alternative form of master equation, applicable on the analysis of non-equilibrium dynamics of fermionic open quantum systems. The formalism considers a general scenario, composed by a multipartite quantum system in contact with several reservoirs, each one with a specific chemical potential and in thermal equilibrium. With the help of Jordan-Wigner transformation, we perform a fermion-to-qubit mapping to derive a set of Lindblad superoperators that can be straightforwardly used on a wide range of physical setups.To illustrate our approach, we explore the effect of a charge sensor, acting as a probe, over the dynamics of electrons on coupled quantum molecules. The probe consists on a quantum dot attached to source and drain leads, that allows a current flow. The dynamics of populations, entanglement degree and purity show how the probe is behind the sudden deaths and rebirths of entanglement, at short times. Then, the evolution leads the system to an asymptotic state being a statistical mixture. Those are signatures that the probe induces dephasing, a process that destroys the coherence of the quantum system.
