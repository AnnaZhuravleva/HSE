Starting from the idea that energy exchanges are the essence of Thermodynamics, we show that out-of-equilibrium quantum systems are well characterised, at least when it comes to energy exchanges with external systems, by the introduction of apparent temperatures. We show that such apparent temperatures contain crucial information on the role of correlations and coherence in energy exchanges: both behave as populations. This can be traced back to the energy flows between out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. This counter-intuitive phenomena can affect dramatically the population balance and therefore the apparent temperatures. We show how seminal results can be re-obtained, offering an interesting alternative point of view. Our results show how genuine quantum effects can be used advantageously, finding applications in quantum thermal machine designs but also in collective-effect phenomena.
