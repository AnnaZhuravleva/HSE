Quantum amplifier is an essential device in quantum information processing. As in the classical (non-quantum) case, its characteristic uncertainty needs to be suppressed by feedback, and in fact such a control theory for a single quantum amplifier has recently been developed. This paper extends this result to the case of cascaded quantum amplifier. In particular, we consider two types of structures: the case where controlled amplifiers are connected in series, and the case where a single feedback control is applied to the cascaded amplifier. Then, we prove that the latter is better in the sense of sensitivity to the uncertainty. A detailed numerical simulation is given to show actual performance of these two feedback schemes.
