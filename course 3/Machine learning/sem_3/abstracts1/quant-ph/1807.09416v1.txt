We propose an interferometry technique, by using electromagnetically induced transparency phenomena, for measuring classical force. The classical force is estimated by measuring the phase at the output of the interferometer. The proposed measurement mechanism satisfies quantum non-demolition measurement conditions leading to back-action evasion. We further derive the sufficient condition under which the thermal noise in the interferometer is negligible. With no back-action noise and no thermal noise, the sensitivity of this technique is limited by shot noise only.
