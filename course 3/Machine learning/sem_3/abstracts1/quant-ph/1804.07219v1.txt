The nuclear spin bath (NSB) dynamics and quantum control have primary significance for the storage and processing of quantum information within a semiconductor environment. In the presence of a carrier spin, it is the hyperfine interaction that rules the NSB characteristics. Here, we study the overall coherence decay and rephasings in hyperfine-driven NSB through the temporal and spectral behavior of the so-called Loschmidt echo (LE). Unlike prevailing emphasis on spin-1/2, NSB with larger spin quantum numbers are equally considered. First, the dependences of LE on the size, initial polarization, coupling inhomogeneity, and phase-flip rate of NSB are separately investigated. Based on this insight, a simple phenomenological expression is offered that can account for all of these features. This is then used to interpret the computed power spectra of two realistic semiconductor systems, namely, a donor center and a quantum dot that represent small and large nanoscale NSB examples, respectively. We observe that large-spin nuclei are highly vulnerable to phase-flip dephasing giving rise to significant broadening in the spectrum, reaching 100~MHz range for typical quantum dots. On the other hand for small reservoirs, as in donor centers this width narrows down by two orders of magnitude making them readily amenable for dynamical decoupling techniques. This hyperfine-driven LE response by itself can serve for discriminating its contribution from other sources in the noise spectrum, and generally, it can be helpful for the optimal utilization and control of the nuclear spin reservoir.
