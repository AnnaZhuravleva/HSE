The classical Second Law of Thermodynamics demands that an isolated system evolves with a non-diminishing entropy. This holds as well in quantum mechanics if the evolution of the energy-isolated system can be described by a unital quantum channel. At the same time, the entropy of a system evolving via a non-unital channel can, in principle, decrease. Here, we analyze the behavior of the entropy in the context of the H-theorem. As exemplary phenomena, we discuss the action of a Maxwell demon (MD) operating a qubit and the processes of heating and cooling in a two-qubit system. We further discuss how small initial correlations between a quantum system and a reservoir affect the increase in the entropy under the evolution of the quantum system.
