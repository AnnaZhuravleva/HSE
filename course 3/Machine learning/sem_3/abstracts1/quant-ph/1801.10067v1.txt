We present a simplified BB84 protocol with only three quantum states and one decoy-state level. We implement this scheme using the polarization degree of freedom at telecom wavelength. Only one pulsed laser is used in order to reduce possible side-channel attacks. The repetition rate of 625 MHz and the achieved secret bit rate of 23 bps over 200 km of standard fiber are the actual state of the art.
