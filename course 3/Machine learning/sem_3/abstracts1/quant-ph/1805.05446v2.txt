We use a simple example to illustrate why it is not possible to consider that a measurement reveals an underlying objective reality of a property of a quantum system. This kind of incompatibility between realism and quantum mechanics is theoretically demonstrated with an example where sequential angular momentum measurements are performed on a quantum system. We discuss the relation of this result with other investigations about realism and quantum mechanics. In particular, we criticize the realistic view adopted on recent discussions about the reality of the quantum state.
