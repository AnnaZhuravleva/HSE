In this paper we explore the entanglement of two relativistic spin-$1/2$ particles with continuous momenta. The spin state is described by the Bell state and the momenta are given by Gaussian distributions of product form. Transformations of the spins are systematically investigated in different boost scenarios by calculating the orbits and concurrence of the spin degree of freedom. By visualizing the behavior of the spin state we get further insight into how and why the entanglement changes in different boost situations.
