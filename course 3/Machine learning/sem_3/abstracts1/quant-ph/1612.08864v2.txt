Recently Pikovski et al. have proposed in [ Pikovski I et al. 2015 Nature Phys. 11, 668] an intriguing universal decoherence mechanism, suggesting that gravitation may play a conceptually important role in the quantum-to-classical transition, albeit vanishingly small in everyday situations. Here we analyze information transfer induced by this mechanism. We show that generically on short time-scales, gravitational decoherence leads to a redundant information encoding, which results in a form of objectivization of the center-of-mass position in the gravitational field. We derive the relevant time-scales of this process, given in terms of energy dispersion and quantum Fisher information. As an example we study thermal coherent states and show certain robustness of the effect with the temperature. Finally, we draw an analogy between our objectivization mechanism and the fundamental problem of point individuation in General Relativity as emphasized by the Einstein's Hole argument.
