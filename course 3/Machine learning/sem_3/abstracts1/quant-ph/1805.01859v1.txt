Employing a completely-positive trace preserving map that is able to interpolate between weak and projective measurements, we extend a recently proposed notion of realism-based nonlocality [V. S. Gomes and R. M. Angelo, Phys. Rev. 97, 012123 (2018)] to the regime of weak measurements. We also look at a symmetrical scenario where weak measurements are locally conducted in both sites. Moreover, we indicate apropriate interpretations for the proposed quantities.
