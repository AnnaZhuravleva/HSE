The unavoidable interaction of quantum systems with their environment usually results in the loss of desired quantum resources. Suitably chosen system Hamiltonians, however, can, to some extend, counteract such detrimental decay, giving rise to the set of stabilizable states. Here, we discuss the possibility to stabilize Gaussian states in continuous variable systems. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such stabilizability and elaborate these on two benchmark examples, a single, damped mode and two locally damped modes. Implications on the stabilizability of non-Gaussian states, by means of quadratic Hamiltonians, are also discussed.
