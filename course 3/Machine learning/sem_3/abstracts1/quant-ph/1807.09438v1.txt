We consider a collective quantum spin-$s$ in contact with Markovian spin-polarized baths. Using a conserved super-operator charge, a differential representation of the Liouvillian is constructed to find its exact spectrum and eigen-modes. We study the spectral properties of the model in the large-$s$ limit using a semi-classical quantization condition and show that the spectral density may diverge along certain curves in the complex plane. We exploit our exact solution to characterize steady-state properties, in particular at the discontinuous phase transition that arises for unpolarized environments, and to determine the decay rates of coherences and populations. Our approach provides a systematic way of finding integrable Liouvillian operators with non-trivial steady-states as well as a way to study their spectral properties and eigen-modes.
