Theoretical studies indicating the presence of long-lived coherence in the radical pair system have engendered questions about the utilitarian role of sustained coherence in the avian compass. In this manuscript, we investigate this for a realistic multi-nuclear radical pair system, along with the related question of its sensitivity to the geomagnetic field. Firstly, we find that sustenance of long-lived coherence is unlikely in a realistic hyperfine environment. Secondly, probing the role of the hyperfine interactions on the compass sensitivity, we establish the hyperfine anisotropy as an essential parameter for the sensitivity. Thereby, we are able to identify a parameter regime where the compass would exhibit sensitivity even without sustained coherence.
