We propose Fisher information as a measure of similarity of input particle states in a measurement basis, in which we infer the quantum interference of particles by the Fisher information. Interacting bosonic and fermionic particles by beam-splitting type operations, i.e., a 50:50 beam splitter and the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, we observe the relation between the similarity of the input particle states and the Fisher information which is derived by counting the number of particles in one of the output modes. For the Fisher information of an input state parameter in a 50:50 beam splitter, we obtain that the Fisher information is proportional to the similarity of the input particle states without discriminating the class of the particles, which is utilized to reproduce the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip with bosonic and fermionic particles. For the Fisher information of a phase parameter in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, however, the relation is transformed with discriminating the class of the particles such that we can devise a scenario to infer an unknown input state parameter via the Fisher information. We extend the scenario of inferring a parameter to detect two-particle entanglement.
