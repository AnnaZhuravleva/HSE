We prove that the spin-coherent-state POVM, which is an optimal measurement for estimating the pure state of an unknown qubit with a finite number of copies [Massar1995], is achieved asymptotically by measuring the total ensemble spin component collectively, weakly, and isotropically. We demonstrate this protocol in numerical simulations of weak measurements of the collective spin component, chosen as a sequence of random directions or as a continuous measurement with a simultaneous, time-dependent control. Both simulations well approximate the optimal bound.
