In this work, we investigate the joint measurability of quantum effects and connect it to the study of free spectrahedra. Free spectrahedra typically arise as matricial relaxations of linear matrix inequalities. An example of a free spectrahedron is the matrix diamond, which is a matricial relaxation of the $\ell_1$-ball. We find that joint measurability of binary POVMs is equivalent to the inclusion of the matrix diamond into the free spectrahedron defined by the effects under study. This connection allows us to use results about inclusion constants from free spectrahedra to quantify the degree of incompatibility of quantum measurements. In particular, we completely characterize the case in which the dimension is exponential in the number of measurements. Conversely, we use techniques from quantum information theory to obtain new results on spectrahedral inclusion for the matrix diamond.
