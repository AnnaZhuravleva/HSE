The exactly analytical solutions for the dynamics of the dissipative three-level V-type and $\Lambda$-type atomic systems in the vacuum Lorentzian environments are presented. Quantum interference phenomenon between the two transitions in V-type atomic system is studied and the intuitive interference conditions are derived. For the dissipative $\Lambda$-type atomic system, we demonstrate that the similar quantum interference phenomenon does not exist. Finally, we study the dynamical evolution of quantum Fisher information, quantum entanglement and quantum coherence for the V-type atomic system. We find that quantum interference plays a positive role to the protection of quantum entanglement and quantum coherence. The difference between the two typical measures of the quantum coherence is also demonstrated in the considered systems.
