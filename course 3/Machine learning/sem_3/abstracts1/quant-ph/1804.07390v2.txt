We propose a method to deterministically prepare a desired quantum state in a one-dimensional (1D) continuum by a shaped photon pulse. This method is based on time-reverse of the quantum emission process. We show that the desired quantum state such as Dicke or timed-Dicke state can be successfully prepared with very high fidelity even if the dissipation to the environment is nonnegligible and the pulse shaping is not perfect. We also show that large quantum entanglement between emitters can be created by just a single photon pulse. This method is experimentally feasible in 1D waveguide-QED or circuit-QED system.
