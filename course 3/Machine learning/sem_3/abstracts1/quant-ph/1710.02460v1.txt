Assessing the quality of a multi-qubit state is a multi-faceted problem, It involves considering disparate aspects, and, while some of these are collective indicators such as purity and degree of entanglement, others look more in detail at the form of the correlations between subsystems. Obtaining a visualisation of these details would give at least a qualitative indication, but the density matrix, with its large number of parameters, hardly offers insights. Here we show how relying on the Wigner function of a multipartite system provides rich information on the state, both at an illustrative level, by choosing proper slicing on the phase space, and at a quantitative one, by introducing new figures of merit for the state quality. We test this concept on a GHZ and W state produced in a photonic architecture making use of the multiple degrees of freedom of two photons.
