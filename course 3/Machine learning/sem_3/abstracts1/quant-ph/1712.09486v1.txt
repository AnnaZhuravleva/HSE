We investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit-oscillator system embedded in a noisy environment by employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach. It is found that the decoherence rate of the whole qubit-oscillator-bath system can be significantly suppressed by enhancing the coupling strength between the qubit and the harmonic oscillator. Moreover, we find that the non-Markovian memory character of the bath is able to facilitate a robust quantum coherent dynamics in this qubit-oscillator-bath system. Our findings may be used to engineer some tunable coherent manipulations in mesoscopic quantum circuits.
