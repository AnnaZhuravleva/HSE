We obtain analytic solutions to various models of dissipation of the quantum harmonic oscillator, employing a simple method in the Wigner function Fourier transform description of the system; and study as an exemplification, the driven open quantum harmonic oscillator. The environmental models we use are based on optical master equations for the zero and finite temperature bath and whose open dynamics are described by a Lindblad master equation, and also we use the Caldeira-Leggett model for the high temperature limit, in the the under damped an the over damped case. Under the Wigner Fourier transform or chord function as it has been called, it becomes particularly simple to solve the dynamics of the open oscillator in the sense that the dynamics of the system are reduced to the application of an evolution matrix related to the damped motion of the oscillator.
