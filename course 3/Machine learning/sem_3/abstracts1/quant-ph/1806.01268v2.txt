Elaboration of some fundamental relations in three dimensional quantum mechanics is considered in connection to taking into account the restriction on domains in radial distance. In such cases the boundary behavior of the radial wave function and singularity of operators at the origin of coordinates contribute to these relations. In particular, we derive the relation between the average value of operator time derivative and the time derivative of mean value of this operator, which usually is considered as the same by definition. The deviation from known result is deduced manifested by extra term, which depends on boundary behavior mentioned above. The general form for this extra term participates to the hypervirial like theorems. As a particular case, the virial theorem for a Coulomb potential is considered and correction to the Kramers sum rule is derived. Moreover the corrected Ehrenfest theorem is deduced also and its consistency with real physical picture is demonstrated.
