The demonstration of coherence between a large number of quantum emitters is essential for the realization of many paradigmatic experiments in quantum optics. Here we present the observation of controlled interference of light scattered from crystal strings of up to 53\,trapped ions. The scattered light is collected along the crystal symmetry axis, which guarantees spatial indistinguishability of photons scattered by different ions and allows for convenient scaling of the number of contributing particles. The interference phase is tuned by changing the mutual distance between the ions and the observed pattern corresponds qualitatively to a simple theoretical model considering point-like emitters. The observed interference visibility remains in the 0.34 to 0.53 range for all the measured string sizes, limited mostly by the spatially inhomogeneous laser intensity seen by the long ion strings. The presented results open the possibility for experimental investigation of a whole range of fundamental physical phenomena, including engineered directional photon emission, direct detection of quadrature squeezing of atomic resonance fluorescence, and optical generation of genuine multi-partite entanglement between a large number of trapped ions.
