In this paper we investigate the relationship between direct-sum majorization formulation of uncertainty relations and entanglement, for the case of two and many observables. Our primary results are entanglement detection methods based on direct-sum majorization uncertainty relations. These nonlinear detectors provide a set of necessary conditions for detecting entanglement whose number grows with the dimension of the state being detected.
