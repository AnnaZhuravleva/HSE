We consider the interaction between distinct superradiance (SR) systems and use the dressed state formalism to solve the case of two interacting two-atom SR samples at resonance. We show that the ensuing entanglement modifies the transition rates and intensities of radiation, as well as introduces a potentially measurable frequency chirp in the SR cascade, the magnitude of which being a function of the separation between the samples. For the dominant SR cascade we find a significant reduction in the duration and an increase of the intensity of the SR pulse relative to the case of a single two-atom SR sample.
