A non-perturbative treatment, the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variation is employed to examine dynamics of the Landau-Zener model with both diagonal and off-diagonal qubit-bath coupling using the multiple Davydov trial states. It is shown that steady-state transition probabilities agree with analytical predictions at long times. Landau-Zener dynamics at intermediate times is little affected by diagonal coupling, and is found to be determined by off-diagonal coupling and tunneling strength between two diabatic states. We investigate effects of bath spectral densities, coupling strengths and interaction angles on Laudau-Zener dynamics. Thanks to the multiple Davydov trial states, detailed boson dynamics can also be analyzed in Landau-Zener transitions. Results presented here may help provide guiding principles to manipulate the Laudau-Zener transitions in circuit QED architectures by tuning off-diagonal coupling and tunneling strength.
