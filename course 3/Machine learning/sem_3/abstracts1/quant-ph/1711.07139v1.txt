In this work, we investigate the heat exchange between two quantum systems whose initial equilibrium states are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble. First, we generalize the fluctuation relations for heat exchange discovered by Jarzynski and W\'ojcik to quantum systems prepared in the equilibrium states described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble at different generalized temperatures. Second, we extend the connections between heat exchange and R\'enyi divergences to quantum systems with very general initial conditions.These relations are applicable for quantum systems with conserved quantities and are universally valid for quantum systems in the integrable and chaotic regimes.
