We investigate quantum steering for multipartite systems by using entropic uncertainty relations. We introduce entropic steering inequalities whose violation certifies the presence of different classes of multipartite steering. These inequalities witness both steerable states and genuine multipartite steerable states. Furthermore, we study their detection power for several classes of states of a three-qubit system.
