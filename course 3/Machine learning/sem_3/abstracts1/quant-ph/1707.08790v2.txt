Quantum metrology overcomes standard precision limits and plays a central role in science and technology. Practically it is vulnerable to imperfections such as decoherence. Here, we demonstrate quantum metrology for noisy channels such that entanglement with ancillary qubits enhances the quantum Fisher information for phase estimation but not otherwise. Our photonic experiment covers a range of noise for various types of channels, including for two randomly alternating channels such that assisted entanglement fails for each noisy channel individually. We have simulated noisy channels by implementing space-multiplexed dual interferometers with quantum photonic inputs. We have demonstrated the advantage of entanglement-assisted protocols in phase estimation experiment run with either single-probe or multi-probe approach. These results establish that entanglement with ancillae is a valuable approach for delivering quantum-enhanced metrology. Our new approach to entanglement-assisted quantum metrology via a simple linear-optical interferometric network with easy-to-prepare photonic inputs provides a path towards practical quantum metrology.
