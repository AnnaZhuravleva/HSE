We study magnetic orders of fermions under cavity-assisted Raman couplings in a one-dimensional lattice at half filling. The cavity-enhanced atom-photon coupling introduces a dynamic long-range interaction between the fermions, which competes with the short-range on-site interaction and leads to a variety of magnetic orders. Adopting a numerical density-matrix-renormalization-group method, we investigate the various magnetic orders and map out the steady-state phase diagram. Interestingly, as all the phase transitions take place outside the superradiant regime, the magnetic orders are associated with cavity-field fluctuations with a vanishing number of photons on the mean-field level.
