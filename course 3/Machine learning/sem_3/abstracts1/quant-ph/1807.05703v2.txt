We investigate the quantum fluctuations of a single atom in a weakly driven cavity, with an intracavity optical lattice. The weak driving field is on resonance with the atoms and the cavity, and is the second-harmonic of the lattice beam. In this special case we can find eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in terms of Mathieu functions.We present analytic results for the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ and the intensity-field correlation function $h_{\theta}(\tau)$, for both transmitted and fluorescent light for weak driving fields. We find that the coupling of the center of mass motion to the intracavity field mode can be deleterious to nonclassical effects in photon statistics; less so for the intensity-field correlations, and compare the use of trapped atoms in a cavity to atomic beams.
