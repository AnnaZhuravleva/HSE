A nonlinear quantum-classical transition wave equation is proposed for dissipative systems within the Caldirola-Kanai model. Equivalence of this transition equation to a scaled Schr\"{o}dinger equation is proved. The dissipative dynamics is then studied in terms of what we call scaled trajectories following the standard procedure used in Bohmian mechanics. These trajectories depend on a continuous parameter allowing us a smooth transition from Bohmian to classical trajectories. Arrival times and actual momentum distribution functions are also analyzed. The propagation of a Gaussian wave packet in a viscid medium under the presence of constant, linear and harmonic potentials is studied. The gradual decoherence process and localization are easily visualized and understood within this theoretical framework.
