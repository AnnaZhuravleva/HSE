We have observed the unconventional photon blockade effect for microwave photons using two coupled superconducting resonators. As opposed to the conventional blockade, only weakly non-linear resonators are required. The blockade is revealed through measurements of the second order correlation function $g^{(2)}(t)$ of the microwave field inside one of the two resonators. The lowest measured value of $g^{(2)}(0)$ is 0.4 for a resonator population of approximately $10^{-2}$ photons. The time evolution of $g^{(2)}(t)$ exhibits an oscillatory behavior, which is characteristic of the unconventional photon blockade.
