Quantum back action (QBA) of a measurement limits the precision of observation of the motion of a free mass. This profound effect dabbed the "Heisenberg microscope" in the early days of quantum mechanics, leads to the standard quantum limit (SQL) stemming from the balance between the measurement sensitivity and the QBA. Here we consider the measurement of motion of a free mass performed in a quantum reference frame with an effective negative mass which is not limited by QBA. As a result, the disturbance on the motion of a free mass can be measured beyond SQL. QBA-limited detection of motion for a free mass is extremely challenging, but there are devices where this effect is expected to play an essential role, namely, gravitational wave detectors (GWD) such as LIGO and VIRGO. Recent reports on observation of gravitational waves have opened new horizons in cosmology and astrophysics. Here we present a general idea and a detailed numerical analysis for QBA-evading measurement of the gravitational wave effect on the GWD mirrors which can be considered free masses under relevant conditions. The measurement is performed by two entangled beams of light probing the GWD and an auxiliary atomic spin ensemble, respectively. The latter plays a role of a free negative mass. We show that under realistic conditions the sensitivity of the GWD can be significantly increased over the entire frequency band of interest.
