Quantum coherence and nonlocality are two intriguing features of quantum mechanics. We relate the nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC) to Bell nonlocality, and show geometrically that the NAQC created by the local von Neumann measurements on one subsystem of a two-qubit state exhibits quantum correlation which is stronger than Bell nonlocality. This complements the hierarchy of various quantum correlation measures. As a direct application, we also show that the NAQC can be used for witnessing entanglement and distinguishing quantum channels for nonclassical teleportation.
