We present a flexible scheme to realize non-artificial non-Markovian dynamics of an electronic spin qubit, using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond where the inherent nitrogen spin serves as a regulator of the dynamics. By changing the population of the nitrogen spin, we show that we can smoothly tune the non-Markovianity of the electron spin's dynamic. Furthermore, we examine the decoherence dynamics induced by the spin bath to exclude other sources of non-Markovianity. The amount of collected measurement data is kept at a minimum by employing Bayesian data analysis. This allows for a precise quantification of the parameters involved in the description of the dynamics and a prediction of so far unobserved data points.
