In 19th century (in the process of transition from mechanics to the field theory) the German school of theoretical physics confronted problems similar to the basic problems in the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM). Hertz tried to resolve such problem through analysis of the notion of a scientific theory and interrelation of theory and experiment. This analysis led him to the Bild (image) conception of theory (which was latter essentially developed, but also modified by Boltzmann). In this paper we claim that to resolve the basic foundational problems of QM, one has to use the Bild conception and reject the observational viewpoint on physical theory. As an example of a Bild theory underlying QM (treated as an observational theory), we consider prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT): theory of random subquantum fields.
