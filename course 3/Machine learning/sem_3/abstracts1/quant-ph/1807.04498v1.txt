Entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science and associated emerging technologies. Photonic systems offer a large range of exploitable entanglement degrees of freedom such as frequency, time, polarization, and spatial modes. Hyperentangled photons exploit multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously to enhance the performance of quantum information protocols. Here, we report a fully guided-wave approach for generating and analyzing polarization and energy-time hyperentangled photons at telecom wavelengths. Moreover, by demultiplexing the broadband emission spectrum of the source into five standard telecom channel pairs, we demonstrate compliance with fiber network standards and improve the effective bit rate capacity of the quantum channel by one order of magnitude. In all channel pairs, we observe a violation of a generalized Bell inequality by more than 27 standard deviations, underlining the relevance of our approach.
