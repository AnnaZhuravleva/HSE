Anomaly detection is used for identifying data that deviate from `normal' data patterns. Its usage on classical data finds diverse applications in many important areas like fraud detection, medical diagnoses, data cleaning and surveillance. With the advent of quantum technologies, anomaly detection of quantum data, in the form of quantum states, may become an important component of quantum applications. Machine learning algorithms are playing pivotal roles in anomaly detection using classical data. Two widely-used algorithms are kernel principal component analysis and one-class support vector machine. We find corresponding quantum algorithms to detect anomalies in quantum states. We show that these two quantum algorithms can be performed using resources logarithmic in the dimensionality of quantum states. For pure quantum states, these resources can also be logarithmic in the number of quantum states used for training the machine learning algorithm. This makes these algorithms potentially applicable to big quantum data applications.
