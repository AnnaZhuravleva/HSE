This paper examines the coherence in multipartite systems. We first discuss the distribution of total coherence in a given multipartite quantum state into discord between subsystems and coherent dissonance in each individual subsystem, using the relative entropy as a distance measure. Then we give some trade-off relations between various types of coherence and discord within a bipartite system,and extend these results to the multipartite setting. Finally, the change of coherence in entanglement distribution is studied.
