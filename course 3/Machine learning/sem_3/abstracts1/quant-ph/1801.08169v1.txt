We show that entanglement between two solitary qubits in quasi one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates can be spontaneously generated due to quantum fluctuations. Recently, we have shown that dark solitons are an appealing platform for qubits due to their appreciably long lifetime. We explore the creation of entanglement between dark soliton qubits by using the superposition of two maximally entangled states in the dissipative process of spontaneous emission. By driving the qubits with the help of Raman lasers, we observe the formation of long distance steady-state concurrence. Our results suggest that dark-soliton qubits are a good candidates for quantum information protocols based purely on matter-wave phononics.
