Adopting the geometric description of steering assemblages and local hidden states (LHS) model, we propose a geometric LHS model for some two-qubit states under continuous projective measurements of the steering side. We show that the model is the optimal LHS model for these states, and obtain a sufficient steering criterion for all two-qubit states. Then we demonstrate asymmetric steering using the results we get.
