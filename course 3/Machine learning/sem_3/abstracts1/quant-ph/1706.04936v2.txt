We characterize photonic transport in a boundary driven array of nonlinear optical cavities. We find that the output field suddenly drops when the chain length is increased beyond a threshold. After this threshold a highly chaotic and unstable regime emerges, which marks the onset of a super-diffusive photonic transport. We show the scaling of the threshold with pump intensity and nonlinearity. Finally, we address the competition of disorder and nonlinearity presenting a diffusive-insulator phase transition.
