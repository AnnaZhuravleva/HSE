The advantages of quantum information processing are in many cases obtained as consequences of quantum interactions, in particular, for computational tasks where two-qubit interactions have the significant and essential role. In this work, we establish the framework of analyzing and quantifying loss or gain of information on a quantum system experiencing interactions with its environment. Namely, we present the information-theoretic interpretation to the information flow of the theory of open quantum systems as the rate of minimum uncertainty given quantum states. We analyze information exchange on subsystems during quantum algorithms, for instance, amplitude amplification algorithms where the computational process relies fully on quantum evolution, and investigate how it is related to the efficient and optimal quantum process. It is shown that the computational speedup of the algorithms is directly connected to and can be indicated by the information flow than entanglement generation.
