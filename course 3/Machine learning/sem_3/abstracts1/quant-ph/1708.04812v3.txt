The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is the best known and studied among collapse models, which modify quantum mechanics and identify the fundamental reasons behind the unobservability of quantum superpositions at the macroscopic scale. Albeit several tests were performed during the last decade, up to date the CSL parameter space still exhibits a vast unexplored region. Here, we study and propose an unattempted non-interferometric test aimed to fill this gap. We show that the angular momentum diffusion predicted by CSL heavily constrains the parametric values of the model when applied to a macroscopic object.
