Color centers in diamond are promising spin qubits for quantum computing and quantum networking. In photon-mediated entanglement distribution schemes, the efficiency of the optical interface ultimately determines the scalability of such systems. Nano-scale optical cavities coupled to emitters constitute a robust spin-photon interface that can increase spontaneous emission rates and photon extraction efficiencies. In this work, we introduce the fabrication of 2D photonic crystal slab nanocavities with high quality factors and cubic wavelength mode volumes -- directly in bulk diamond. This planar platform offers scalability and considerably expands the toolkit for classical and quantum nanophotonics in diamond.
