We study the problem of decoding classical information encoded on quantum states at the output of a quantum channel, with particular focus on increasing the communication rates towards the maximum allowed by Quantum Mechanics. After a brief introduction to the main theoretical formalism employed in the rest of the thesis, i.e., continuous-variable Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Communication Theory, we consider several decoding schemes. First, we treat the problem from an abstract perspective, presenting a method to decompose any quantum measurement into a sequence of easier nested measurements through a binary-tree search. Furthermore we show that this decomposition can be used to build a capacity-achieving decoding protocol for classical communication on quantum channels and to solve the optimal discrimination of some sets of quantum states. These results clarify the structure of optimal quantum measurements, showing that it can be recast in a more operational and experimentally-oriented fashion. Second, we consider a more practical approach and describe three receiver structures for coherent states of the electromagnetic field with applications to single-mode state discrimination and multi-mode decoding at the output of a quantum channel. We treat the problem bearing in mind the technological limitations faced nowadays in the field of optical communications: we evaluate the performance of general decoding schemes based on such technology and report increased performance of two schemes, the first one employing a non-Gaussian transformation and the second one employing a code tailored to be read out easily by the most common detectors. Eventually we characterize a large class of multi-mode adaptive receivers based on common technological resources, obtaining a no-go theorem for their capacity.
