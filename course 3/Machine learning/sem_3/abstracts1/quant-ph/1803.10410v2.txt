It is known that high intensity fields are usually required to implement shortcuts to adiabaticity via Transitionless Quantum Driving (TQD). Here, we show that this requirement can be relaxed by exploiting the gauge freedom of generalized TQD, which is expressed in terms of an arbitrary phase when mimicking the adiabatic evolution. We experimentally investigate the performance of generalized TQD in comparison with both traditional TQD and adiabatic dynamics. By using a $^{171}$Yb$^+$ trapped ion hyperfine qubit, we implement a Landau-Zener adiabatic Hamiltonian and its (traditional and generalized) TQD counterparts. We show that the generalized theory provides optimally implementable Hamiltonians for TQD, with no additional fields required. In addition, the energetically optimal TQD Hamiltonian for the Landau-Zener model is investigated under dephasing. Remarkably, even using less intense fields, optimal TQD exhibits fidelities that are more robust against a decohering environment, with performance superior than that provided by the adiabatic dynamics.
