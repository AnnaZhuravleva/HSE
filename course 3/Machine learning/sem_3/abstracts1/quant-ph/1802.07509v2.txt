We propose a quantum optimal control algorithm that performs a gradient descent in a reduced basis named GRadient Optimization Using Parametrization (GROUP). We compare this optimization algorithm to the other state-of-the-art algorithms in quantum control namely, Gradient-Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE), Krotov's method and Nelder-Mead using Chopped Random Basis (CRAB). We find that GROUP converges much faster than Nelder-Mead with CRAB and achieves better results than GRAPE and Krotov's method on the control problem presented here.
