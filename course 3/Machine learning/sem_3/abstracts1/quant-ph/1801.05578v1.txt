Quantum coherence can be used to infer presence of a detector without triggering it. Here we point out that according to quantum formalism such interaction-free measurements cannot be perfect, i.e. in a single-shot experiment one has strictly positive probability to activate the detector. We provide a quantitative relation between the probability of activation and probability of inconclusive interaction-free measurement in quantum theory and in a more general framework of density cubes. It turns out that the latter does allow for perfect interaction-free measurements. Their absence is therefore a natural postulate expected to hold in all physical theories.
