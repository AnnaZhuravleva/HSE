We present a bi-confluent Heun potential for the Schr\"odinger equation involving inverse fractional powers and a repulsive centrifugal-barrier term the strength of which is fixed to a constant. This is an infinite potential well defined on the positive half-axis. Each of the fundamental solutions for this conditionally integrable potential is written as an irreducible linear combination of two Hermite functions of a shifted and scaled argument. We present the general solution of the problem, derive the exact energy spectrum equation and construct a highly accurate approximation for the bound-state energy levels.
