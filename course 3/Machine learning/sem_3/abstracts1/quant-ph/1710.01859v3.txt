Universal quantum gates and quantum error correction~(QEC) lie in the heart of quantum information science. Large-scale quantum computing depends on a universal set of quantum gates, in which some gates may be easily carried out, while others are hard with a certain physical system. There is a unique three-qubit quantum gate called the Deutsch gate~[$\mathbb{D}(\theta)$], from which alone a circuit can be constructed so that any feasible quantum computing is attainable. As far as we know, however, $\mathbb{D}(\theta)$ has not been demonstrated. Here we design an easily realizable $\mathbb{D}(\theta)$ by using Rydberg blockade of neutral atoms, where $\theta$ can be tuned to any value in $[0,\pi]$ by adjusting the strengths of external control fields. Using similar protocols, we further show that both the Toffoli and CNOT gates can be achieved with only three laser pulses. The Toffoli gate, being universal for classical reversible computing, is also useful for QEC that plays an important role in quantum communication and fault-tolerant quantum computation. The possibility and briefness to realize these gates shed new light on the study of quantum information with neutral atoms.
