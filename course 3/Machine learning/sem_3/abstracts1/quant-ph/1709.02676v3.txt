We propose a quantum speedup method for adiabatic generation of cat states in bosonic Josephson junctions via shortcuts to adiabaticity. We apply approximated counter-diabatic driving to a bosonic Josephson junction using the Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In order to avoid the problem of divergence in counter-diabatic driving, we take finite-size corrections into account. The resulting counter-diabatic driving is well-defined over whole processes. Schedules of the counter-diabatic driving consist of three steps; the counter-diabatic driving in the disordered phase, smoothly and slowly approaching the critical point, and the counter-diabatic driving in the ordered phase. Using the counter-diabatic driving, adiabatic generation of cat states is successfully accelerated. The enough large quantum Fisher information ensures that generated cat states are highly entangled.
