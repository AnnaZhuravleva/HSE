We investigate bipartite and tripartite entanglement in an open quantum system, specifically three qubits, all of which are damped, and one of which is driven. We adapt a systematic approach in calculating the entanglement of various bipartite splits usinga generalized concurrence as an indicator of entanglement. Our calculations are based on a direct detection scheme that is a particular unravelling of the density matrix. This system has a collective dipole-dipole energy shift that couples the atoms and the dissipation is via partially collective spontaneous emission described by the Lehmberg-Agarwal master equation.Our results are unravelling dependent, but apply to applications of entanglement based on direct detection. We also calculate the three-way tangle or residual entanglement for this system. We present calculations for a variety of driving and damping rates, and examine what decay rate is adequate for the system to be reduced to two qubits with a readout port. We also consider a specific model of three atoms located at particular positions in free space.
