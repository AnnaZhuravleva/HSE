Magnetic sensors are typically much more sensitive to oscillating (AC) magnetic fields than static (DC) fields, due to the presence of more noise at lower frequency, typically scaling with a $1/f$ dependence. For quantum magnetometers, this characteristic noise is reflected in the ensemble dephasing time $T_2^*$, the relevant sensing time for a DC field, being much lower than the spin coherence time $T_2$, which determines the sensitivity to AC fields. Here, we demonstrate measurement of DC magnetic fields using a physically rotating ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres at a precision limited by the electron spin coherence time, $T_2$. We rotate the host diamond with a period comparable to $T_2$, such that the angle between the NV axis and the magnetic field to be detected changes as a function of time, upconverting the static magnetic field to an oscillating field in the physically rotating frame. Using spin-echo interferometry, we observe an order of magnitude improvement in DC magnetometer response compared to a conventional Ramsey experiments. Enhancements to our scheme could realise DC sensitivities equivalent to demonstrated AC magnetic field sensitivities with NV centres.
