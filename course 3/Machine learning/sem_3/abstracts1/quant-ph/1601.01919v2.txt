We study the full time evolution of one- and two-mode bosonic quantum systems that interact through single- and two-mode squeezing Hamiltonians. We establish that the single- and two-mode cases are formally equivalent, leading to the same differential equations encoding the full time evolution. These differential equations can be easily employed in any application. We analytically predict a dramatic transition in the population of the modes when the coupling takes a specific critical value, leading to exponential growth of the excitation population. We discuss the validity, scope and generality of our results.
