In this paper, different from the other existing methods that only the special and limited numbers of qubits transmit between Alice and Bob, a general method is proposed to implement Bidirectional Quantum Controlled/uncontrolled Teleportation (BQCT/BQT) that Alice and Bob can transmit each type of arbitrary n and m-qubits to each other, simultaneously. This protocol is based on Controlled-NOT (CNOT) operation, appropriate single-qubit unitary operations and single-qubit measurement in the Z-basis and X-basis. Also, the quantum channel can be created by using Hadamard and CNOT operations. One of the advantages of this method is using the single-qubit measurements which are more efficient than two-qubit measurements.
