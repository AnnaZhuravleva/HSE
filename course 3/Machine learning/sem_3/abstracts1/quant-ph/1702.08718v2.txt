Open quantum dynamics in a tripartite scenario including a system, its environment and a passive reference is shown to resolve several open questions regarding not completely positive (NCP) dynamical maps as valid descriptions of open quantum evolution. The steering states of the system and the environment with respect to the reference, reduced down to a dense, compact set of states of the system alone, provides a well defined domain of action for a bonafide dynamical map describing the open evolution of the system. The map is not restricted to being completely positive (CP) but it preserves the positivity of all states in its domain. NCP open dynamics corresponding to different initial configurations of the tripartite system are explored.
