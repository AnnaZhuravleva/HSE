We introduce the third five-parametric ordinary hypergeometric energy-independent quantum-mechanical potential, after the Eckart and P\"oschl-Teller potentials, which is proportional to an arbitrary variable parameter and has a shape that is independent of that parameter. Depending on an involved parameter, the potential presents either a short-range singular well (which behaves as inverse square root at the origin and vanishes exponentially at infinity) or a smooth asymmetric step-barrier (with variable height and steepness). The general solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for this potential, which is a member of a general Heun family of potentials, is written through fundamental solutions each of which presents an irreducible linear combination of two Gauss ordinary hypergeometric functions.
