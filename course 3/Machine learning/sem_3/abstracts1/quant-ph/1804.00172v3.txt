The atmospheric turbulence is the main factor that influences quantum properties of propagating optical signals and may sufficiently degrade the performance of quantum communication protocols. The probability distribution of transmittance (PDT) for free-space channels is the main characteristics of the atmospheric links. Applying the law of total probability, we derive the PDT by separating the contributions from turbulence-induced beam wandering and beam-spot distortions. As a result, the obtained PDT varies from log-negative Weibull to truncated log-normal distributions depending on the channel characteristics. Moreover, we show that the method allows one to consistently describe beam tracking, a procedure which is typically used in practical long-distance free-space quantum communication. We analyze the security of decoy-state quantum key exchange through the turbulent atmosphere and show that beam tracking does not always improves quantum communication.
