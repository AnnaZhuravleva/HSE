Light propagating in a nondispersive medium is accompanied by a mass density wave (MDW) of atoms set in motion by the optical force of the field itself. In many photonic materials, the atoms carry majority of the total momentum of light and their motion also gives rise to net transfer of medium mass with a light pulse. We show that accounting for the MDW in the analysis of the angular momentum gives for a bare photon a share of the angular momentum that is generally a fraction of $\hbar$. In contrast, the total angular momentum of the mass-polariton quasiparticle, which is a coupled state of the bare photon and the MDW, is a multiple of $\hbar$. Thus, the angular momentum of a single quantum becomes entangled between the field and medium components. The same entanglement is found for orbital and spin angular momenta of light. Our results strongly suggest that a single quantum of light in nondispersive media should be understood to include entangled field and medium components. The physical picture of the angular momentum of light emerging from our theory is fundamentally more general than earlier theoretical models, in which the total angular momentum of light is assumed to be carried by the electromagnetic field only. We simulate the MDW of Laguerre-Gaussian light pulses in silicon and present a schematic experimental setup for measuring the contribution of the atomic MDW to the total angular momentum of light.
