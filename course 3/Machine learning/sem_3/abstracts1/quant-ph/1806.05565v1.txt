Quantum states with genuine multipartite entanglement, such as hypergraph states, are of central interest in quantum information processing and foundational studies. Efficient verification of these states is a key to various applications. Here we propose a simple method for verifying hypergraph states which requires only two distinct Pauli measurements for each party, but its efficiency is comparable to the best nonlocal collective strategy. For a given state, the overhead is bounded by the chromatic number and degree of the underlying hypergraph. Our protocol is exponentially more efficient than all known candidates based on local measurements, including tomography and direct fidelity estimation. Moreover, our protocol enables the verification of hypergraph states and genuine multipartite entanglement of thousands of qubits. Furthermore, our approach can be applied even in the adversarial scenario and is thus particularly appealing to applications like blind measurement-based quantum computation.
