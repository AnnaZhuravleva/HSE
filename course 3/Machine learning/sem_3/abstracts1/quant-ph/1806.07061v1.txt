In this paper, a novel protocol is proposed for implementing BQCT by using five-qubit en The proposed protocol depends on the Controlled-NOT operation, proper single-qubit unitary operations and single-qubit measurement in the Z-basis and X-basis. The results showed that the protocol is more efficient from the perspective such as lower shared qubits and, single qubit measurements compared to the previous work. Furthermore, the probability of obtaining Charlie's qubit by eavesdropper is reduced, and supervisor can control one of the users or every two users. Also, we present a new method for transmitting n and m-qubits entangled states between Alice and Bob using proposed protocol.tangled states as a quantum channel which in the same time, the communicated users can teleport each one-qubit state to each other under permission of controller.
