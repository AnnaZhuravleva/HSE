Classical chimera states are paradigmatic examples of partial synchronization patterns emerging in nonlinear dynamics. These states are characterized by the spatial coexistence of two dramatically different dynamical behaviors, i.e., synchronized and desynchronized dynamics. Our aim in this contribution is to discuss signatures of chimera states in quantum mechanics.   We study a network with a ring topology consisting of N coupled quantum Van der Pol oscillators. We describe the emergence of chimera-like quantum correlations in the covariance matrix. Further, we establish the connection of chimera states to quantum information theory by describing the quantum mutual information for a bipartite state of the network.
