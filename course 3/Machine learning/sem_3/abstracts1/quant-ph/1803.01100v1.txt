We examine quantum gravity effects by applying the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) to entropic uncertainty relation conditions on quantum entanglement. In particular, we study the GUP corrections to the Shannon entropic uncertainty condition for entanglement. As in an earlier paper [Blado, Herrera, Erwin arxiv:1706.10013 [quant-ph]] which dealt with variance relations, there is an increase in the upper bound for the entanglement condition upon the application of the generalized uncertainty principle. Fundamental concepts of the generalized uncertainty principle, entanglement and the entropic uncertainty relations are also discussed.
