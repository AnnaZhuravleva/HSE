We investigate through both theory and experiment the application of quantum coherence of a single qubit as a measure of non-Markovianity in an open quantum system. As a first result, it is shown that distance-based quantum coherence minimized over local unitary transformations is equivalent to geometric measures of quantum correlations. This result is obtained for arbitrary distance (or pseudo-distance) measures in a multipartite scenario. Then, by taking into account the contractivity of trace-preserving quantum operations, we employ quantum coherence as a quantifier of non-Markovianity for quantum operations that preserve incoherence in a quantum system. This quantifier can be implemented through a single qubit, spending less resources than the usual multi-qubit characterizations of non-Markovianity through correlation measures. As an example, we consider one qubit under non-Markovian amplitude damping, for which we analytically evaluate the optimization over initial states required by the non-Markovian measure. Then, we experimentally realize this system through an optical setup with an intense laser beam simulating a single-photon polarization, with the system-environment interaction encoded in the propagation path. The experiment illustrates the quantification of non-Markovianity through the revivals of the single-qubit coherence, which are suitably controllable in terms of the non-Markovian strength.
