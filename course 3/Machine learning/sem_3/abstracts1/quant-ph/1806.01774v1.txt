An experiment with nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402 (2013)] has been recently implemented with neutrons [Phys. Rev. A 97, 052111 (2018)]. Which-path information has been extracted from faint traces the neutrons left, providing operational meaning to "the particle's path". The authors of the neutron interference experiment criticised the conclusions obtained by the authors of the optical experiment. I refute the criticism and argue that the results of the neutron interference experiment actually support the surprising picture of the past of the particle in the nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer.
