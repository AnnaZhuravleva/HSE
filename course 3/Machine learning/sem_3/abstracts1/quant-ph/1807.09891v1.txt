We present results of practical sending-or-not quantum key distribution. In real-life implementations, we need consider the following three requirements, a few different intensities rather than infinite number of different intensities, a phase slice of appropriate size rather than infinitely small size and the statistical fluctuations. We first show the decoy-state method with only a few different intensities and a phase slice of appropriate size. We then give a statistical fluctuation analysis for the decoy-state method. Numerical simulation shows that, the performance of our method is comparable to the asymptotic case for which the key size is large enough. Our results show that practical implementations of the sending-or-not quantum key distribution can be both secure and efficient.
