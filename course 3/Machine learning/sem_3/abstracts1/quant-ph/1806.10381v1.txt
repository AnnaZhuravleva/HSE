We introduce the probability distributions describing quantum observables in conventional quantum mechanics and clarify their relations to the tomographic probability distributions describing quantum states. We derive the evolution equation for quantum observables (Heisenberg equation) in the probability representation and give examples of the spin-1/2 (qubit) states and the spin observables. We present quantum channels for qubits in the probability representation.
