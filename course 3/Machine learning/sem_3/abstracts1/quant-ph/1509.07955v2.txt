{\bf Abstract.} We show that two hierarchies of spin Hamilton operators admit the same spectrum. Both Hamilton operators play a central role for quantum gates in particular for the case spin-$\frac12$ and the case spin-1. The spin-$\frac12$, spin-1, spin-$\frac32$ and spin-2 cases are studied in detail. Entanglement and mutually unbiased bases of the eigenvectors is discussed. Two triple Hamilton operators are also investigated. Both are also admitting the same spectrum.
