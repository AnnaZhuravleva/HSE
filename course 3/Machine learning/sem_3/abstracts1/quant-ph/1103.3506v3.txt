This interpretation establishes a completely classical ontology -- only the classical trajectory in configuration space -- and interprets the wave function as describing incomplete information (in form of a probability flow) about this trajectory. This combines basic ideas of de Broglie-Bohm theory and Nelsonian stochastics about the trajectory with a Bayesian interpretation of the wave function.   Various objections are considered and discussed. In particular a regularity principle for the zeros of the wave function allows to meet the Wallstrom objection.
