We map the density matrix of the qubit (spin-1/2) state associated with the Bloch sphere and given in the tomographic probability representation onto vertices of a triangle determining Triada of Malevich's squares. The three triangle vertices are located on three sides of another equilateral triangle with the sides equal to $\sqrt 2$. We demonstrate that the triangle vertices are in one-to-one correspondence with the points inside the Bloch sphere and show that the uncertainty relation for the three probabilities of spin projections +1/2 onto three orthogonal directions has the bound determined by the triangle area introduced. This bound is related to the sum of three Malevich's square areas where the squares have sides coinciding with the sides of the triangle. We express any evolution of the qubit state as the motion of the three vertices of the triangle introduced and interpret the gates of qubit states as the semigroup symmetry of the Triada of Malevich's squares. In view of the dynamical semigroup of the qubit-state evolution, we constructed nonlinear representation of the group U(2).
