Dynamically correcting for unwanted interactions between a quantum system and its environment is vital to achieving the high-fidelity quantum control necessary for a broad range of quantum information technologies. In recent work, we uncovered the complete solution space of all possible driving fields that suppress transverse quasistatic noise errors while performing single-qubit operations. This solution space lives within a simple geometrical framework that makes it possible to obtain globally optimal pulses subject to a set of experimental constraints by solving certain geometrical optimization problems. In this work, we solve such a geometrical optimization problem to find the fastest possible pulses that implement single-qubit gates while cancelling transverse quasistatic noise to second order. Because the time-optimized pulses are not smooth, we provide a method based on our geometrical approach to obtain experimentally feasible smooth pulses that approximate the time-optimal ones with minimal loss in gate speed. We show that in the presence of realistic constraints on pulse rise times, our smooth pulses significantly outperform sequences based on ideal pulse shapes, highlighting the benefits of building experimental waveform constraints directly into dynamically corrected gate designs.
