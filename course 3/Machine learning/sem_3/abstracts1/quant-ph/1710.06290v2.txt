We propose a scheme to realize high-precision quantum interferometry with entangled non-Gaussian states by driving the system through quantum phase transitions. The beam splitting, in which an initial non-degenerate groundstate evolves into a highly entangled state, is achieved by adiabatically driving the system from a non-degenerate regime to a degenerate one. Inversely, the beam recombination, in which the output state after interrogation becomes gradually disentangled, is accomplished by adiabatically driving the system from the degenerate regime to the non-degenerate one. The phase shift, which is accumulated in the interrogation process, can then be easily inferred via population measurement. We apply our scheme to Bose condensed atoms and trapped ions, and find that Heisenberg-limited precision scalings can be approached. Our proposed scheme does not require single-particle resolved detection and is within the reach of current experiment techniques.
