It is important for performance studies in quantum technologies to analyze quantum circuits in the presence of noise. We introduce an error probability tensor, a tool to track generalized Pauli error statistics of qudits within quantum circuits composed of qudit Clifford gates. Our framework is compatible with qudit stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes. We show how the error probability tensor can be applied in the most general case, and we demonstrate an error analysis of bipartite qudit repeaters with quantum error correction. We provide an exact analytical solution of the error statistics of the state distributed by such a repeater. For a fixed number of degrees of freedom, we observe that higher-dimensional qudits can outperform qubits in terms of distributed entanglement.
