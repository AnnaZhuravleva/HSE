We study a generalization of the Wigner function to arbitrary tuples of hermitian operators, which is a distribution uniquely characterized by the property that the marginals for all linear combinations of the given operators agree with the quantum mechanical distributions. Its role as a joint quasi-probability distribution is underlined by the property that its support always lies in the set of expectation value tuples of the operators. We characterize the set of singularities and positivity, and provide some basic examples.
