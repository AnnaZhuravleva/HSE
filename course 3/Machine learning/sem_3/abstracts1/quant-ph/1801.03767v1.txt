The formulation of the no-cloning theorem in the framework of phase-space noncommutative (NC) quantum mechanics (QM) is examined, and its implications for the computation of quantum cloning probabilities and teleportation fidelity are investigated through the Weyl-Wigner formulation of QM. The principles of QM re-edited in terms of a deformed Heisenberg-Weyl algebra are shown to provide a covariant formulation for the quantum fidelity, through which the results from the no-cloning theorem for the ordinary QM can be reproduced. Besides exhibiting an explicit correspondence between standard and NC QM for Gaussian Wigner functions, our results suggest a feasible interpretation for the NC continuous variable quantum cloning given in terms of quantum teleportation protocols.
