The evolution of $N$ spin-$1/2$ system with all-range Ising-type interaction is considered. For this system we study the entanglement of one spin with the rest spins. It is shown that the entanglement depends on the amount of spins and the initial state. Also the geometry of manifold which contains entangled states is obtained. Finally we find the dependence of entanglement on the scalar curvature of manifold and examine it for different number of spins in the system.
