Among the many controversial aspects of the quantum / classical boundary, the emergence of chaos remains amongst the least experimentally verified. In particular, the time-resolved observation of quantum chaotic dynamics, and its interplay with quantum measurement, is largely unexplored outside experiments in atomic ensembles. We present here a realistic proposal to construct a chaotic driven top from the nuclear spin of a single donor atom in silicon, in the presence of nuclear quadrupole interaction. This system is exquisitely measurable and controllable, and possesses extremely long intrinsic quantum coherence times, allowing for the observation of subtle dynamical behavior over extended periods. We show that signatures of chaos are expected to arise for experimentally realizable parameters of the system, allowing the study of the relation between quantum decoherence and classical chaos, and the observation of dynamical tunneling.
