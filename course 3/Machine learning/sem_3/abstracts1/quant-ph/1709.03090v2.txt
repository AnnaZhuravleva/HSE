The robust estimation of entanglement is key to the validation of implementations of quantum systems. On the one hand, the evaluation of standard entanglement measures, either using quantum tomography or using quantitative entanglement witnesses requires perfect implementation of measurements. On the other hand, measurement-device-independent entanglement witnesses (MDIEWs) can certify entanglement of all entangled states using untrusted measurement devices. We show that MDIEWs can be used as well to quantify entanglement according to standard entanglement measures, and present a practical method to derive such witnesses using experimental data only.
