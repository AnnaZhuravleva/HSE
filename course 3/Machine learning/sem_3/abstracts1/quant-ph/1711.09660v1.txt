We consider a thermometer modelled by a dynamically-controlled multilevel quantum system in contact with a bath. Periodic modulation of the energy level spacings of our quantum thermometer enables us to dramatically increase the accuracy of temperature estimation. As opposed to the diverging relative error near the absolute zero obtained in conventional thermometers, our control scheme enables high precision temperature estimation arbitrarily close to the absolute zero, by maximizing its quantum Fisher information. Alternatively, dynamical control may allow for high-precision measurement of multiple temperatures.
