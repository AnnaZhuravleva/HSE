We investigate the dynamical phase transition of two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with nonlinear tunneling, which is trapped inside a double-well and dispersively coupled to a single mode of a high-finesse optical cavity with one moving end mirror driven by a single mode standing field. The nonlinear tunneling interaction leads to an increase of stability points and riches the phase diagram of the system. It is shown that the appearance of the moving end mirror speeds up the tunneling of Bose-Einstein condensates, which makes population difference between two wells and regulates the number of the stability points of the system.
