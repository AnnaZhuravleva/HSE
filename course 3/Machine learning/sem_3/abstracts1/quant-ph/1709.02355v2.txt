We present a quantum algorithm for the calculation of scattering amplitudes of massive charged scalar particles in scalar quantum electrodynamics. Our algorithm is based on continuous-variable quantum computing architecture resulting in expo- nential speedup over classical methods. We derive a simple form of the Hamiltonian including interactions, and a straightforward implementation of the constraint due to gauge invariance.
