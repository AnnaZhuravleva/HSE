Deviations from classical physics when distant quantum systems become correlated are interesting both fundamentally and operationally. There exist situations where the correlations enable collaborative tasks that are impossible within the classical formalism. Here, we consider the efficiency of quantum computation protocols compared to classical ones as a benchmark for separating quantum and classical resources and argue that the computational advantage of collaborative quantum protocols in the discrete variable domain implies the nonclassicality of correlations. By analysing a toy model, it turns out that this argument implies the existence of quantum correlations distinct from entanglement and discord. We characterize such quantum correlations in terms of the net global coherence resources inherent within quantum states and show that entanglement and discord can be understood as special cases of our general framework. Finally, we provide an operational interpretation of such correlations as those allowing two distant parties to increase their respective local quantum computational resources only using locally incoherent operations and classical communication.
