The energy eigenstates of a spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ particle in a magnetic field confined to a plane, define a planar spin. If the particle moves adiabatically around a loop in this plane, it picks up a topological Berry phase that can only be an integer multiple of $\pi$. We propose a neutron interferometry test of the Berry phase for a circulating planar spin induced by a magnetic field caused by a very long current-carrying straight wire perpendicular to the plane. This Berry phase causes destructive interference in the direction of the incoming beam of thermal neutrons moving through a triple-Laue interferometer.
