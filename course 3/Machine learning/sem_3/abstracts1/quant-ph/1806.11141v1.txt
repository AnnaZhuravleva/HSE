The well known hypervirial perturbation method (HPM)\ based on hypervirial relations and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem is suitable for the calculation of perturbation corrections of large order for the two-dimensional hydrogen-like atom in a uniform magnetic field. We show analytical results in terms of the quantum numbers and large order corrections for particular states. This approach appears to be simpler and more efficient than the recently proposed one based on Green functions.
