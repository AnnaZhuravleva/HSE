We report the first experimental two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of novel molecular photonic excitations - vibrational-polaritons. The application of advanced 2D IR spectroscopy onto novel vibrational-polariton challenges and advances our understanding in both fields. From spectroscopy aspect, 2D IR spectra of polaritons differ drastically from free uncoupled molecules; from vibrational-polariton aspects, 2D IR uniquely resolves hybrid light-matter polariton excitations and unexpected dark states in a state-selective manner and revealed hidden interactions between them. Moreover, 2D IR signals highlight the role of vibrational anharmonicities in generating non-linear signals. To further advance our knowledge on 2D IR of vibrational polaritons, we develop a new quantum-mechanical model incorporating the effects of both nuclear and electrical anharmonicities on vibrational-polaritons and their 2D IR signals. This work reveals polariton physics that is difficult or impossible to probe with traditional linear spectroscopy and lays the foundation for investigating new non-linear optics and chemistry of molecular vibrational-polaritons.
