We propose efficient schemes for converting three-photon, four-photon and five-photon GHZ state to a $W$ state or Dicke state, respectively with the nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers via single-photon input-output process and cross-Kerr nonlinearities. The total success probability can be improved by iterating the conversion process for the case of three-photon and five-photon while it does not require iteration for converting four-photon GHZ state to a $W$ state. The analysis of feasibility shows that our scheme is feasible for current experimental technology.
