Various frameworks that generalise the notion of contextuality in theories of physics have been proposed; one is the sheaf-theoretic approach by Abramsky and Brandenburger; an other is the equivalence-based approach by Spekkens. We show that these frameworks are equivalent for scenarios with preparations and measurements, whenever factorizability is justified. This connection gives rise to a categorical isomorphism between suitable categories. We combine the advantages of the two approaches to derive a canonical method for detecting contextuality in such settings.
