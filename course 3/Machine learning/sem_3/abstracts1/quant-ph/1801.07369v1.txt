When applying Grover's algorithm to an unordered database, the probability of obtaining correct results usually decreases as the quantity of target increases. To amend the limitation, numbers of improved schemes are proposed. In this paper, we focus on four improved schemes from phases, and find that they are just differed by a global phase. Based on this conclusion, the extensive researches on one scheme can be easily generated to other three schemes, and some examples are presented to indicate the correctness.
