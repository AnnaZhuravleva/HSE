We introduce the `displacemon' electromechanical architecture that comprises a vibrating nanobeam, e.g. a carbon nanotube, flux coupled to a superconducting qubit. This platform can achieve strong and even ultrastrong coupling enabling a variety of quantum protocols. We use this system to describe a protocol for generating and measuring quantum interference between two trajectories of a nanomechanical resonator. The scheme uses a sequence of qubit manipulations and measurements to cool the resonator, apply an effective diffraction grating, and measure the resulting interference pattern. We simulate the protocol for a realistic system consisting of a vibrating carbon nanotube acting as a junction in a superconducting qubit, and we demonstrate the feasibility of generating a spatially distinct quantum superposition state of motion containing more than $10^6$ nucleons.
