The realisation of optically detected magnetic resonance via nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond faces challenges at high magnetic fields which include growing energy consumption of control pulses as well as decreasing sensitivities. Here we address these challenges with the design of shaped pulses in microwave control sequences that achieve orders magnitude reductions in energy consumption and concomitant increases in sensitivity when compared to standard top-hat microwave pulses. The method proposed here is general and can be applied to any quantum sensor subjected to pulsed control sequences.
