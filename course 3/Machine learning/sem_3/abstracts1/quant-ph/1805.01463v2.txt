We present a method to calculate exact dynamics of a wave-packet in a quantum two-state problem with Dirac delta coupling. The advantage of our method is that the calculations are done in the time domain. Hence inverting the solutions from other domains (Laplace or Fourier domain) do not intervene us from presenting the solution in the time domain. The initial wave packet is considered to be a Gaussian function. The wave propagation in the quantum state is governed by time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and the coupling is given by non-diagonal element in the matrix representation. We present the exact analytic forms of the wave function for both the states in the time domain.
