Estimation of multiple parameters in an unknown Hamiltonian is investigated. We present upper and lower bounds on the time required to complete the estimation within a prescribed tolerance $\delta$. The lower bound is given on the basis of the Cram\'er-Rao inequality, where the quantum Fisher information is bounded by the squared evolution time. The upper bound is obtained by an explicit construction of estimation procedures. By comparing the cases with different numbers of Hamiltonian channels, we also find that the few-channel procedure with adaptive feedback and the many-channel procedure with entanglement are equivalent in that they require the same amount of time resource up to a constant factor.
