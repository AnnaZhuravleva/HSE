Following the verification of the conjecture made by Comtet, Bandrauk and Campbell that the supersymmetry-inspired semiclassical method known as SWKB is exact for the conventional additive shape invariant potentials, it was widely believed that SWKB yields exact results for all additive shape invariant potentials. In this paper we present a concrete example of an additive shape invariant potential for which the SWKB method fails to produce exact results.
