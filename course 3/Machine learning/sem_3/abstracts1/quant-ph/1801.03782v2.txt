Entanglement is an important evidence that a quantum device can potentially solve problems intractable for classical computers. In this paper, we report on full entanglement of up to 16 qubits on {\it ibmqx5}, a 16-qubit superconducting quantum processor accessible via IBM cloud. Connected graph states involving 8 to 16 qubits are prepared on {\it ibmqx5} using low-depth circuits. We demonstrate that the prepared state is fully entangled, i.e. the state is inseparable with respect to any fixed partition. Our results set a new record for the number of fully entangled qubits for superconducting quantum processors.
