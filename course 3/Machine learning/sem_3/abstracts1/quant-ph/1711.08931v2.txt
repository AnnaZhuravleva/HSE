Single x-ray photons can be resonantly scattered and stored with the help of suitable transitions in the atomic nucleus. Here, we investigate theoretically means of mechanical-free modulation for the frequency spectra of such x-ray photons via periodic switching of an external magnetic field. We show that periodically switching on and off an external magnetic field generating hyperfine splitting of the nuclear transition leads to the generation of equidistant narrow sidebands of the resonantly scattered response. This frequency-comb-like structure depends on the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field and on the switching period. An analytical approach for the characterization of the comblike frequency spectrum is presented. The feasibility of the external control on the frequency modulation of the x-ray response is discussed in view of possible applications in high-resolution spectroscopy or quantum technology.
