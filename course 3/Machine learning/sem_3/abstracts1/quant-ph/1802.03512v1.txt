A controlled qubit in a rotating frame opens new opportunities to probe fundamental quantum physics, such as geometric phases in physically rotating frames, and can potentially enhance detection of magnetic fields. Realising a single qubit that can be measured and controlled during physical rotation is experimentally challenging. In this work, we demonstrate quantum control of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre within a diamond rotated at 200,000rpm, a rotational period comparable to the NV spin coherence time $T_2$. We stroboscopically image individual NV centres that execute rapid circular motion in addition to rotation, and demonstrate preparation, control and readout of the qubit quantum state with lasers and microwaves. Using spin-echo interferometry of the rotating qubit, we are able to detect modulation of the NV Zeeman shift arising from the rotating NV axis and an external DC magnetic field. Our work establishes single NV qubits in diamond as quantum sensors in the physically rotating frame, and paves the way for the realisation of single-qubit diamond-based rotation sensors.
