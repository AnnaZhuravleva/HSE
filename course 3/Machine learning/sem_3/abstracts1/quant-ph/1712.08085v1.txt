We present a protocol for generating multipartite quantum correlations across a quantum network with a continuous-variable architecture. An arbitrary number of users possess two-mode entangled states, keeping one mode while sending the other to a central relay. Here a suitable multipartite Bell detection is performed which conditionally generates a cluster state on the retained modes. This cluster state can be suitably manipulated by the parties and used for tasks of quantum communication in a fully optical scenario. More interestingly, the protocol can be used to create a purely-mechanical cluster state starting from a supply of optomechanical systems. We show that detecting the optical parts of optomechanical cavities may efficiently swap entanglement into their mechanical modes, creating cluster states up to 5 modes under suitable cryogenic conditions.
