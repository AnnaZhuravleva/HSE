We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large memory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show that an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is achieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic plasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons with weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic weights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity. These states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the neurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower the response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results, the latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of patterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and retrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input stimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the ground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest micro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local minimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered phenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced memory storage capacity in classical brain networks.
