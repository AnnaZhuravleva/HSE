We use a single squeezed state to represent a qubit, which can be coherently processed in a deconvolution picture (DP) in the presence of noise. We avail ourselves of the fact that when evolution is governed by a quadratic dissipative equation, there exists a basis of squeezed states that evolves to another basis of such states in the DP. An operator acts as an impurity filter, restoring the coherence lost from the inexorable interactions of the qubit with its surroundings.
