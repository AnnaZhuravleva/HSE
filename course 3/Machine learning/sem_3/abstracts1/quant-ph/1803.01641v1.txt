Multiphoton entanglement plays a critical role in quantum information processing, and greatly improves our fundamental understanding of the quantum world. Despite tremendous efforts in either bulk media or fiber-based devices, nonlinear interactions in integrated circuits show great promise as an excellent platform for photon pair generation with its high brightness, stability and scalability \cite{Caspani2017}. Here, we demonstrate the generation of bi- and multiphoton polarization entangled qubits in a single silicon nanowire waveguide, and these qubits directly compatible with the dense wavelength division multiplexing in telecommunication system. Multiphoton interference and quantum state tomography were used to characterize the quality of the entangled states. Four-photon entanglement states among two frequency channels were ascertained with a fidelity of $0.78\pm0.02$. Our work realizes the integrated multiphoton source in a relatively simple pattern and paves a way for the revolution of multiphoton quantum science.
