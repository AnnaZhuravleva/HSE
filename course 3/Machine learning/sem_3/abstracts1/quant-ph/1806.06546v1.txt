The effect of the dipole polarization on the quantum dipole dipole interaction near an Ag nanosphere (ANS) is investigated. A theoretical formalism in terms of classical Green function is developed for the transfer rate and the potential energy of the dipole dipole interaction (DDI) between two polarized dipoles. It is found that a linear transition dipole can couple to a left circularly polarized transition dipole much stronger than to a right circularly polarized transition dipole. This polarization selectivity exists over a wide frequency range and is robust against the variation of the dipoles' position or the radius of the ANS. In contrast, a right circularly polarized transition dipole, can change sharply from coupling strongly to another right circularly polarized dipole to coupling strongly to a left circularly polarized dipole with varying frequency. However, if the two dipoles are placed in the same radial direction of the sphere, the right circularly polarized transition dipole can only couple to the dipole with the same polarization while not to the left circularly polarized transition dipole. These findings may be used in solid-state quantum-information processing based on the DDI.
