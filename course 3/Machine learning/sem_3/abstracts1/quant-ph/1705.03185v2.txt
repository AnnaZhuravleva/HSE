In this letter, we mainly investigate how to enhance the damaged quantum entanglement under an open Dirac system with Hawking effect within Schwarzschild space-time. We consider that particle A hold by Alice undergoes generalized amplitude damping noise in a flat space-time and another particle B by Bob entangled with A is under a Schwarzschild space-time. Subsequently, we put forward a physical scheme to recover the damaged quantum entanglement by prior weak measurement on subsystem A before the interaction with the decoherence noise followed by post-measurement filtering operation. The results indicate that our scheme can effectively recover the damaged quantum entanglement affected by the Hawking effect and the noisy channel. Thus, our work might be beneficial to understand the dynamic behavior of quantum state and recover the damaged quantum entanglement with open Dirac systems under Hawking effect in the background of Schwarzschild black hole.
