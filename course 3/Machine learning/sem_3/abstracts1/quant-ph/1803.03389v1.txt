Realizing highly sensitive interferometry is essential to accurate observation of quantum properties. Here we study two kinds of Ramsey interference fringes in a whispering-gallery resonator, where the coherent phonons for free evolution can be achieved by stimulated Brillouin scattering. These two different fringes appear, respectively, in the regimes of rotating wave approximation (RWA) and anti-RWA. Our work shows particularly that the anti-RWA Ramsey interference takes some quantum properties of squeezing, which enhances the strength and visibility of the fringes and shows robustness against the system's decay. In application, our proposal, feasible with current laboratory techniques, provides a practical idea for building better quantum interferometers.
