If shortcuts to adiabaticity have no cost in terms of energy supplied to the system, it would not seem there is no limit to the power a quantum thermal engine may deliver at finite efficiency, nor a limit on the cooling rate for a quantum system, contradicting formal proofs of the Third Law of Thermodynamics. We argue that quantum fluctuations in the control device which implements the shortcut introduce a random multiplicative noise in the dynamics of the system, thereby heating it. This may be the ultimate cost of an adiabatic shortcut.
