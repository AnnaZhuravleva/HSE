Light as a carrier of information and energy plays a fundamental role in both general relativity and quantum physics, linking these areas that are still not fully compliant with each other. Its quantum nature and spatio-temporal structure are exploited in many intriguing applications ranging from novel spectroscopy methods of complex many-body phenomena to quantum information processing and subwavelength lithography. Recent access to subcycle quantum features of electromagnetic radiation promises a new class of time-dependent quantum states of light. Paralleled with the developments in attosecond science, these advances motivate an urgent need for a theoretical framework that treats arbitrary wave packets of quantum light intrinsically in the time domain. Here, we formulate a consistent time domain theory of the generation and sampling of few-cycle and subcycle pulsed squeezed states, allowing for a relativistic interpretation in terms of induced changes in the local flow of time. Our theory enables the use of such states as a resource for novel ultrafast applications in quantum optics and quantum information.
