Based on Rydberg single-photon excitation process, one proposal is proposed to fast construct the noise-resistant two-qubit controlled-phase gate (CPG) in Rydberg atoms with the Lewis-Riesenfeld (LR) invariant method in two-level system. The LR phases during the evolution process of the gate are exactly offset or limited to zero. Consequently and correspondingly, the two-qubit $\pi$ or arbitrary-phase CPGs are constructed. Then the proposal is generalized to multi-qubit $\pi$ CPG with one control and multiple target qubits. Numerical analysis shows that the $\pi$ CPGs can still have high fidelities after considering atomic spontaneous emission and dephasings noises. In contrast to three-level case, the two-level proposal to construct two-qubit $\pi$ CPG is simple and has a higher fidelity while a little less robust against decoherence. And the proposal is also feasible in the intermediate Rydberg interaction regime. For two groups of reasonable parameters, the two-qubit $\pi$ CPG can be constructed within 4$\mu$s with error probability on the order of $10^{-6}$ or 0.4$\mu$s with error probability on the order of $10^{-3}$.
