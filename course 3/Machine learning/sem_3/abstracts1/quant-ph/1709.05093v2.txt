The classical self-oscillations can collapse merely due to their mutual couplings. We investigate this oscillation collapse in quantum van der Pol oscillators. For a pair of quantum oscillators, the steady-state mean phonon number is shown to be lower than in the corresponding classical model with a Gaussian white noise that mimics quantum noise. We further show within the mean-field theory that a number of globally coupled oscillators undergo a transition from the synchronized periodic motion to the collective oscillation collapse. A quantum many-body simulation suggests that the increase in the number of oscillators leads to a lower steady-state mean phonon number, bounded below by the mean-field result.
