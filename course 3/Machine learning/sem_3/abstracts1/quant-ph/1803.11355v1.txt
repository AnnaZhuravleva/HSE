Monogamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems. We investigate monogamy relations related to the concurrence C, the entanglement of formation E, negativity Nc and Tsallis-q entanglement Tq. Monogamy relations for the $\alpha$th power of entanglement have been derived, which are tighter than the existing entanglement monogamy relations for some classes of quantum states. Detailed examples are presented.
