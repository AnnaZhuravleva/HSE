Spatial structure of photons renders them extremely versatile carriers of quantum information, as it can be tailored with simple optical elements such as lenses, phase gratings or holograms. Substantial challenges emerge, however, when such spatially-structured photons carrying quantum information need to be stored in quantum memories or if advanced quantum information processing capability beyond linear optics is required. These quandaries are usually not shared by material systems, for which strong interaction can be engineered, leading to efforts in demonstrating quantum-interferometric properties of atoms, phonons or plasmons. Here we harness the full three-dimensional potential of material quasi-particles - collective atomic excitations known as spin waves. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of single spin waves can be manipulated via the off-resonant ac-Stark shift. Through spin-wave diffraction based beam-splitter transformation, we realize the Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) type measurement at the spin-wave level, demonstrating nonclassical statistics of atomic excitations. Finally, we observe interference of two spin waves - an analogue of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect for photons. Thanks to the reversible photon-spin wave mapping via the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller (DLCZ) protocol, these techniques enable encoding states from a high-dimensional Hilbert space into the spatial structure of spin waves to facilitate not only new quantum communication schemes, but also high data rate classical telecommunication.
