The method of noisy multiqubit quantum circuits modeling is proposed. The analytical formulas for the dependence of quantum algorithms accuracy on qubits count and noise level are obtained for Grover algorithm and quantum Fourier transform. It is shown that the proposed approach is very much in line with results obtained by Monte Carlo statistical modeling method. The developed theory makes it possible to predict the influence of quantum noise on the accuracy of the forward-looking multiqubit quantum systems under development.
