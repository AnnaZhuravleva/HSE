We develop a geometric construction to prove the inevitability of the electronic ground-state (adiabatic) Berry phase for a class of Jahn-Teller models with maximal continuous symmetries and N > 2 intersecting electronic states. Given that vibronic ground-state degeneracy in JT models may be seen as a consequence of the electronic Berry phase, and that any JT problem may be obtained from the subset we investigate in this letter by symmetry-breaking, our arguments reveal the fundamental origin of the vibronic ground-state degeneracy of JT models.
