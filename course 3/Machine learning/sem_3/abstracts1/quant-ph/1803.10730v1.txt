Boson sampling devices are a prime candidate for exhibiting quantum supremacy, yet their application for solving problems of practical interest is less well understood. Here we show that Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) can be used for dense subgraph identification. Focusing on the NP-hard densest k-subgraph problem, we find that stochastic algorithms are enhanced through GBS, which selects dense subgraphs with high probability. These findings rely on a link between graph density and the number of perfect matchings -- enumerated by the Hafnian -- which is the relevant quantity determining sampling probabilities in GBS. We test our findings by constructing GBS-enhanced versions of the random search and simulated annealing algorithms and apply them through numerical simulations of GBS to identify the densest subgraph of a 30 vertex graph.
