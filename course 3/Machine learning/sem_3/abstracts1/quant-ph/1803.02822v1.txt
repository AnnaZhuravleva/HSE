Interplays between quantum physics and gravity has long inspired exciting studies, which also reveals subtle connections between quantum laws and the general notion of curved spacetime. One important example is the uniqueness of free-falling motions in both quantum and gravitational physics. In this work, we study, from a different perspective, the free motions of quantum test wave packets that distributed over weakly curved spacetime backgrounds. Except for the de Broglie relations, no assumption of priori given Hamiltonians or least actions satisfied by the quantum system is made. We find that the mean motions of quantum test wave packets can be deduced naturally from the de Broglie relations with a generalized treatment of gravitational time dilations in the quantum waves. Such mean motions of quantum test systems are independent of their masses and compositions, and restores exactly the free-falling or geodesic motions of classical test masses in curved spacetime. This suggests a novel perspective that weak equivalence principle, which states the universality of free-fall and serves as the foundations of gravitational theories, may be deeply rooted in quantum physics and be a phenomena emergent from the quantum world.
