A revised version of the massively parallel simulator of a universal quantum computer, described in this journal eleven years ago, is used to run various gate-based quantum algorithms on some of the most powerful supercomputers that exist today. The simulator features close-to-linear scaling behavior on the Sunway TaihuLight, on the K computer, on an IBM BlueGene/Q, and on an Intel Xeon based cluster, implying that the combination of software and hardware beats the exponential scaling with the system size. Adaptive encoding of the wave function reduces the memory requirement by a factor of eight, making it possible to simulate universal quantum computers with up to 48 qubits on the Sunway TaihuLight and on the K computer. Results of executing simple quantum circuits and Shor's factorization algorithm on quantum computers containing up to 48 qubits are presented.
