Near term quantum hardware promises to achieve quantum supremacy. From a quantum dynamical point of view, however, it is not unambiguously clear whether fundamental peculiarities of quantum physics permit any arbitrary speed-ups in real time. We show that an only recently unveiled property of the quantum Fisher information has profound implications for the rate of possible quantum information processing. To this end, we analyze an exemplary and pedagogical example for a quantum computer consisting of a computational qubit and a quantum memory. We find that frequent interaction between memory and device exhibit the quantum Zeno effect. In a second part, we show that the Zeno effect can be prevented by carefully designing the correlations and interaction between single elements of the quantum memory.
