Blind quantum computing enables a client, who does not have enough quantum technologies, to delegate her quantum computing to a remote quantum server in such a way that her privacy is protected against the server. Some blind quantum computing protocols can be made verifiable, which means that the client can check the correctness of server's quantum computing. Can any blind protocol always be made verifiable? In this paper, we answer to the open problem affirmatively. We propose a plug-in that makes any universal blind quantum computing protocol automatically verifiable. The idea is that the client blindly generates Feynman-Kitaev history states corresponding to the quantum circuit that solves client's problem and its complement circuit. The client can learn the solution of the problem and verify its correctness at the same time by measuring energies of local Hamiltonians on these states. Measuring energies of local Hamiltonians can be done with only single qubit measurements of Pauli operators.
