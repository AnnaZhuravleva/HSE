The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a central result in statistical physics, both for classical and quantum systems. It establishes a relationship between the linear response of a system under a time-dependent perturbation and time correlations of certain observables in equilibrium. Here we derive a generalization of the theorem which can be applied to any Markov quantum system and makes use of the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD). There are several important benefits from our approach. First, such a formulation clarifies the relation between classical and quantum versions of the equilibrium FDT. Second, and more important, it facilitates the extension of the FDT to arbitrary quantum Markovian evolutions, as given by quantum maps. Third, it brings out the full connection between the FDT and the Quantum Fisher information, the figure of merit in quantum metrology.
