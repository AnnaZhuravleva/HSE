Circuit quantum electrodynamics ('circuit QED') describes the quantum mechanics and quantum field theory of superconducting electrical circuits operating in the microwave regime near absolute zero temperature. It is the analog of cavity QED in quantum optics with the role of the atoms being played by superconducting qubits. The present lecture notes focus primarily on novel quantum states that can be produced and measured using the strong coupling between an artificial atom and one or more cavities. Of particular importance are Schrodinger cat states of photons. Despite long being considered exemplars of frail quantum superpositions that quickly decohere, such states have recently been used as the basis for quantum error correction codes which have reached the long-sought goal of enhancing the lifetime of quantum information through active quantum error correction.
