We investigate an explicitly time-dependent quantum system driven by a secant-pulse external field. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation exactly, we elucidate exotic properties of the system with respect to its dynamical evolution: on the one hand, the system is shown to be innately nonadiabatic which prohibits an adiabatic approximation for its dynamics, on the other hand, the loop evolution of the model can induce a geometric phase which, analogous to the Berry phase in the adiabatic cyclic evolution, associates to a solid angle subtended by the path of the state vector. Moreover, we extend the model and show that the feature coincides in a special family of secant-pulse driven models.
