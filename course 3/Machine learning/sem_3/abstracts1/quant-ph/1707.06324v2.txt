Parallel Lives (PL) is an ontological model of nature in which quantum mechanics and special relativity are unified in a single universe with a single space-time. Point-like objects called lives are the only fundamental objects in this space-time, and they propagate at or below c, and interact with one another only locally at point-like events in space-time. The only causes and effects in the universe occur when lives meet locally, and thus the causal structure of interaction events in space-time is Lorentz invariant. Each life traces a continuous world-line through space-time, and experiences its own relative world, fully defined by the past events along its world-line. A quantum field comprises a continuum of lives throughout space-time, and familiar physical systems like particles each comprise a sub-continuum of the lives of the field. A pure universal quantum wavefunction tracks the collective behavior of these lives, but not their individual dynamics. There is always a preferred separable basis, and for a given physical system, each orthogonal term in this basis is a different relative world - each containing some fraction of the lives of the system. Each life carries a hidden internal memory containing a local relative wavefunction, which is a local piece of the universal wavefunction. These relative wavefunctions govern which lives of different systems can meet during future interactions, and enforce entanglement correlations between all lives of the systems - including Bell inequality violations. The relative wavefunctions carried in the local memories of all lives throughout space-time are physical in PL, and produce the same collective dynamics as the universal wavefunction in configuration space, which is not. These, and many other details, are explored here, but several aspects of this framework are not yet fleshed out, and work is ongoing.
