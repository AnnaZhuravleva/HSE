A perturbative analytic operator solution of a completely quantum mechanical Hamiltonian of multi-photon pump non-degenerate hyper-Raman process is obtained. It is shown that the obtained solution is general in nature as the solutions of non-degenerate hyper-Raman and stimulated Raman processes can be obtained as special cases of the present solution. The analytic solutions obtained here are used to investigate the nonclassical properties of the different modes in the stimulated, spontaneous and partially spontaneous multi-photon pump non-degenerate hyper-Raman processes. The nonclassical nature of these processes is witnessed by means of single mode and intermodal quadrature squeezing, intermodal entanglement of different orders, lower order and higher order photon antibunching. Interestingly, manifesting the multiphoton nature of the pump modes, a bunch of nonclassicality involving them are observed due to self-interaction of various pump modes.
