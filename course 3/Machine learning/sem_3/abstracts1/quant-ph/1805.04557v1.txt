We present a study of the electromagnetic control of nonclassicality of the outgoing light field in a single atom cavity QED system. By exploring the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates, we show that the eigenstates are similar to the Jaynes-Cummings ladder of eigenstates and can be optically controlled by an external control field. Tuning the control field frequency to the one photon resonance, we show the superbunching behavior in the outgoing light field can be observed at the frequency of one photon resonance. We also show that there exists a magic control field intensity at which two photon blockade phenomenon can be significantly improved. In particular, it is possible to adjust the nonclassicality of the outgoing field from quantum to classical by varying the control field intensity. The work presented here provides an optical method to control statistical features of the outgoing field and can be useful for the nonclassical light generation, quantum gate operation and exotic quantum state generation.
