We propose a scheme to generate photonic tensor network states by sequential scattering of photons in waveguide QED systems. We show that sequential scatterings can convert a series of unentangled photons into any type of matrix product states. We also demonstrate the possibility of generating projected entangled pair states with arbitrary network representation by photon re-scattering.
