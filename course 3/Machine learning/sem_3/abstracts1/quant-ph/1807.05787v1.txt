Interactions in a spin-polarized ultracold Fermi gas are governed by $p$-wave collisions and can be characterized by the $p$-wave scattering volume. Control of these collisions by Feshbach resonances is hampered by huge inelastic losses. Here, we suggest non-resonant light control of $p$-wave collisions, exploiting the anisotropic coupling of non-resonant light to the polarizability of the atoms. The $p$-wave scattering volume can be controlled by strong non-resonant light, in close analogy to the $s$-wave scattering length. For collision partners that are tightly trapped, the non-resonant light induces an energy shift directly related to the generalized scattering volume. This effect could be used to climb the ladder of the trap. We also show that controlling the generalized scattering volume implies control, at least roughly, over the orientation of the interparticle axis relative to the polarization direction of the light at short interatomic distances. Our proposal is based on an asymptotic model that explicitly accounts for the anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction which governs the ultracold collision dynamics at long-range.
