We propose and examine several candidates for universal multipartite entanglement measures. The most promising candidate for applications needing entanglement in the full Hilbert space is the ent-concurrence, which detects all entanglement correlations while distinguishing between different types of distinctly multipartite entanglement, and simplifies to the concurrence for two-qubit mixed states. For applications where subsystems need internal entanglement, we develop the absolute ent-concurrence which detects the entanglement in the reduced states as well as the full state.
