The Principle of Unattainability rules out the attainment of absolute zero temperature by any finite physical means, no matter how idealised they could be. Nevertheless, we clarify that the Third Law of Thermodynamics, as defined by Nernst's heat theorem statement, is distinct from the Principle of Unattainability in the sense that the Third Law is mathematically equivalent only to the unattainability of absolute zero temperature by {\em quasi-static adiabatic} processes. This thus leaves open the possibility of attainability of absolute zero, without violating the Third Law, by non-adiabatic means. Such a means may be provided in principle and in particular by projective measurements in quantum mechanics. This connection also establishes some intimate relationship between the postulate of projective measurement and the Principle of Unattainability.
