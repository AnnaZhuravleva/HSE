The violation of the Mermin inequality (MI) for multipartite quantum states guarantees the existence of nonlocality between either few or all parties. The detection of optimal MI violation is fundamentally important, but current methods only involve numerical optimization, thus hard to find even for three qubit states. In this paper, we provide a simple and elegant analytical method to achieve the tighter bound of Mermin operator for arbitrary three qubit states. Also the necessary and sufficient conditions for the tightness of the bound for some class of states has been stated.
