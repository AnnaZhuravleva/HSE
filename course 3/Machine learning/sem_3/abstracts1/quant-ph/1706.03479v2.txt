We investigate the size scaling of the entanglement entropy (EE) in nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs) of a one-dimensional open quantum system with a random potential. It models a mesoscopic conductor, composed of a long quantum wire (QWR) with impurities and two electron reservoirs. The difference of the chemical potentials of the reservoirs induces a steady current, and a NESS is realized in the QWR. Owing to multiple scatterings by the impurities, the translational invariance is broken and the NESS becomes much different from a boost of an equilibrium state. We assume zero temperature for the reservoirs, and the corresponding pure quantum state for the total system. The EE is given by the von Neumann entropy $S_L$ of a subsystem of length $L$ in the QWR. $S_L$ at equilibrium, $S_L^{\rm eq}$, obeys the logarithmic law $S_L^{\rm eq}=O(\ln L)$. In NESSs far from equilibrium, however, $S_L$ grows anomalously fast obeying the `quasi volume law,' $S_L = \eta(L)L |\Delta k_F| + O(\ln L)$. Here, $\Delta k_F$ is the difference of the Fermi wavenumbers of the reservoirs, and $\eta(L)$ satisfies $a \le \eta(L) \lesssim 2a$, where $a$ is a positive constant independent of $L$ or $\Delta k_F$. This anomalous behavior arises from both nonequilibrium and multiple scatterings by impurities.
