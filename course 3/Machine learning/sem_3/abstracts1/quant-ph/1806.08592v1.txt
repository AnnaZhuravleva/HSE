We define the Uhlmann number as an extension of the Chern number, and we use this quantity to describe the topology of 2D translational invariant fermionic systems at finite temperature. We consider two paradigmatic systems, representing classes of systems that can have non-trivial topology characterized by the Chern number, and we study the changes in their topology through the Uhlmann number. At low temperature we find the topological phase transitions predicted by the Chern number. However, at higher temperature, by using the Uhlmann number, we find a cross-over behaviour without any criticalities. Then, we find a relation in a general system between the mean Uhlmann curvature and the dynamical susceptibility, which gives a hint on how to measure the mean Uhlmann curvature. We also link the Uhlmann number to the dynamical conductivity of topological insulators and superconductors, which extends the TKNN formula to finite temperature. Finally, we relate the mean Uhlmann curvature in the electric field parameter space to the Uhlmann number, whose relation can have an important meaning in the multi-parameter estimation problem.
