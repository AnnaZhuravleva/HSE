We propose an efficient scheme for simulating the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensembles in diamond magnetically coupled to superconducting coplanar waveguide cavities. With the assistance of external microwave driving fields, we show that the interaction of the NV spins can be easily controlled, and several types of the LMG model can be realized by tuning the different parameters. Under the thermal dynamical limit, the distinct non-equilibrium second order quantum phase transition of the spin ensemble can be achieved at the critical point. Furthermore, we show that the spin squeezed state can be generated by tailoring the LMG Hamiltonian to possess the two-axis counter-twisting form in this hybrid quantum system.
