We establish the connection between non-Markovianity and negative entropy production rate for various classes of quantum operations. Generalizing the definition of entropy production rate for non-equilibrium case we connect it with the rate of change of free energy of the system and establish complementary relations between non-Markovianity and maximum loss of free energy. We naturally conclude that non-Markovianity, in terms of divisibility breaking is a necessary resource for backflow of other resources like purity or free energy, under corresponding allowed operations. Based on this we propose a resource theory of non-Markovianity by constructing the free operations, free states and a generalized measure of non-Markovianity. The framework satisfies the basic properties of a consistent resource theory. The proposed resource quantifier is lower bounded by the optimization free Rivas-Huelga-Plenio (RHP) measure of non-Markovianity.
