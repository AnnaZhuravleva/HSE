The development of quantum computing technologies builds on the unique features of quantum physics while borrowing familiar principles from the design of conventional devices. We introduce the fundamental concepts required for designing and operating quantum computing devices by reviewing state of the art efforts to fabricate and demonstrate quantum gates and qubits. We summarize the near-term challenges for devices based on semiconducting, superconducting, and trapped ion technologies with an emphasis on design tools as well as methods of verification and validation. We then discuss the generation and synthesis of quantum circuits for higher-order logic that can be carried out using quantum computing devices.
