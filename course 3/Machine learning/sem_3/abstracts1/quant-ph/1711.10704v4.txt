We study the Hawking radiation of black holes by considering the canonical typicality. For the universe consisting of black holes and their outer part, we directly obtain a non-thermal radiation spectrum of an arbitrary black hole from its entropy, which only depends on a few external qualities (known as hairs), such as mass, charge, and angular momentum. Our result shows that the spectrum of the non-thermal radiation is independent of the detailed quantum tunneling dynamics across black hole horizon. We prove that the black hole information paradox is naturally resolved by taking account the correlation between black hole and its radiation in our approach.
