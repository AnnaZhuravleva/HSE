The quantum Cramer-Rao theorem states that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) gives the best achievable precision in the estimation of a quantum parameter. This is true, however, under the assumption that the measurements employed to extract information are regular, i.e. neither its sample space nor its positive-operator valued elements depend on the (true) value of the parameter. Thus, a better performance may be achieved in principle by relaxing this assumption. In the case of a general Hamiltonian parameter, i.e. when the parameter enters the system's Hamiltonian in a non-trivial way (making the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues parameter dependent), a family of non-regular measurements, referred to as controlled energy measurements, is naturally available. Upon optimizing their performance, we discover that controlled energy measurements may indeed achieve a better precision than the optimal Braunstein-Caves measurement based on the symmetric logarithmic derivative. Overall, our results show that the ultimate quantum bounds to precision for general Hamiltonian parameters are different than those for phase (shift) parameters.
