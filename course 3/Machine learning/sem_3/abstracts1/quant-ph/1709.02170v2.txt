In a recent paper \cite{Matz}, Duprey and Matzin investigeated the meaning of vanishing "weak values" (WV), and their role in the retrodiction of the past of a pre- and post-selected quantum system in the presence of interference. Here we argue that any proposition, regarding the WV values, should be understood as a statement about the probability amplitudes, and revisit some of the conclusions reached in \cite{Matz}.
