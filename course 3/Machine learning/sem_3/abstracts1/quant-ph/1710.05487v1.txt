Satellite-based QKD offers the potential to share highly secure encryption keys between optical ground stations all over the planet. SpooQySats is a programme for establishing the space worthiness of highly-miniaturised, polarization entangled, photon pair sources using CubeSat nanosatellites. The sources are being developed iteratively with an early version in orbit already and improved versions soon to be launched. Once fully developed, the photon pair sources can be deployed on more advanced satellites that are equipped with optical links. These can allow for very secure uplinks and downlinks and can be used to establish a global space-based quantum key distribution network. This would enable highly secure symmetric encryption keys to be shared between optical ground stations all over the planet.
