Quantum metrology allows for a tremendous boost in the accuracy of measurement of diverse physical parameters. The estimation of a rotation constitutes a remarkable example of this quantum-enhanced precision. The recently introduced Kings of Quantumness are especially germane for this task when the rotation axis is unknown, as they have a sensitivity independent of that axis and they achieve a Heisenberg-limit scaling. Here, we report the experimental realization of these states by generating up to 21-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and confirm their high metrological abilities.
