Thermodynamics at the nanoscale behaves very differently than in the familiar macroscopic regime: it is known that quantum fluctuations lead to severe restrictions on work extraction and state transformations, and to an infinite sequence of "second laws". In contrast, here we show a surprising positive feature of small-scale thermodynamics which is absent in the thermodynamic limit: thermal machines acting on single microscopic systems can tame fluctuations by building up correlations between the systems on which they act and a catalyst. That is, these machines can increase their efficiency via clever "correlation engineering", sometimes even with catalysts that are themselves microscopic, e.g. single qubits. The catalysts are exactly preserved and can be reused on fresh new systems in a perfectly cyclic fashion. We prove that these machines can ultimately extract or spend the Helmholtz free energy difference as work in every single run (not just on average), and do so basically without any fluctuations. This restores the original form of the second law in the nano regime, and gives the free energy a natural operational interpretation for single particles without going to the thermodynamic limit. Our results also solve some open problems on majorization, which may lead to further applications in entanglement theory.
