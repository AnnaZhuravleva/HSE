A formulation of quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbb{H}$QM) is presented in terms of a real Hilbert space. Using a physically motivated scalar product, we prove the spectral theorem and obtain a novel quaternionic Fourier series. After a brief discussion on unitary operators in this formalism, we conclude that this quantum theory is indeed consistent, and can be a valuable tool in the search for new physics.
