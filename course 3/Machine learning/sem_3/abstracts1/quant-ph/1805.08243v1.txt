The formalism of Operational Dynamical Modeling [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 109}, 190403 (2012)] is employed to analyze dynamics of spin half relativistic particles. We arrive at the Dirac equation from specially constructed relativistic Ehrenfest theorems by assuming that the coordinates and momenta do not commute. Forbidding creation of antiparticles and requiring the commutativity of the coordinates and momenta lead to classical Spohn's equation [Ann. Phys. {\bf 282}, 420 (2000)]. Moreover, Spohn's equation turns out to be the classical Koopman-von Neumann theory underlying the Dirac equation.
