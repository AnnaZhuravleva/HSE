Surface codes are the leading family of quantum error-correcting codes. Here, we explore the properties of the 3D surface code. We develop a new picture for visualising 3D surface codes which can be used to analyse the properties of stacks of three 3D surface codes. We then use our new picture to prove that the $CCZ$ gate is transversal in 3D surface codes. We also generalise the techniques of lattice surgery to 3D surface codes. Finally, we introduce a hybrid 2D/3D surface code architecture which supports universal quantum computation without magic state distillation.
