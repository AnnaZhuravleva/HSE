We further investigate postulates for realist versions of relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory in Minkowski space and other background space-times. According to these postulates, quantum theory is supplemented by local variables that depend on possible outcomes of hypothetical measurements on the late time electromagnetic field in spacelike separated regions. We illustrate the implications in simple examples using photon wave mechanics, and discuss possible extensions to quantum field theory.
