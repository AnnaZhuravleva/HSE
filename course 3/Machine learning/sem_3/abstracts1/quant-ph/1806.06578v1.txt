For complex PT-symmetric scattering potentials (CPTSSPs) $V(x)$, we show that complex $k$-poles of transmission amplitude $t(k)$ or zeros of ${\cal M}_{22}(k)=1/t(k)$ of the type $\pm k_1+ik_2, k_2\ge 0$ are physical which alone are sufficient to yield three types of discrete energy eigenvalues of the potential. These discrete energies are real negative, complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues(CCPE:${\cal E}_n \pm i \gamma_n$) and real positive energy called spectral singularity (SS) at $E=E_*$. Based on four analytically solvable and other numerically solved models, we conjecture that for a CPTSSP, the real positive energy $E_* =k_*^2$ (SS), when $V_2$ (the strength of the imaginary part of $V(x)$) equals $v_*$, is unique (single) and it is the upper bound to the CCPEs such that ${\cal E}_l \approx < E_*$, here ${\cal E}_l$ corresponds to the last of CCPEs. When there are exceptional points ($g_1<g_2<g_3<..<g_l$) in $V(x)$, $v_* >>g_l$. We show that when $V_2 >v_*$ ($V(x)$ is slightly more non-Hermitian), the SS disappears and the last of CCPEs appears as though SS is split in to ${\cal E}_l\pm i \gamma_l$, where ${\cal E}_l \approx E_*$. When $V_2 < v_*$ $(V(x)$ is slightly less non-Hermitian), one pair of CCPE disappears but others do remain with ${\cal E}_l <<E_*$. This is as though SS is not split.
