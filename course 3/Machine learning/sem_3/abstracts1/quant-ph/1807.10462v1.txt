Two long-standing problems in the construction of coherent state path integrals, the unwarranted assumption of path continuity and the ambiguous definition of the Hamiltonian symbol, are rigorously solved. To this end the fully controlled dual representation familiar from lattice quantum field theories is introduced. Dualization allows for both the step-by-step check in the construction of discrete path integrals and for the identification of the Hamiltonian and Berry phase part of the action, thus making both discrete and continuous path integrals consistently defined. Once the correct action is constructed, we are able to follow the transition to the continuum for the polar form of general Bose-Hubbard models and to provide an exact form of the path integral for general spin systems, where previous works showed its failure for all standard choices of operator ordering.
