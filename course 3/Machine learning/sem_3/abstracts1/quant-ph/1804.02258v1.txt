With use of the scheme of fast forward which realizes quasi-static or adiabatic dynamics in shortened time scale, we investigate a thermally-isolated ideal quantum gas confined in a rapidly dilating one-dimensional (1D) cavity with the time-dependent size $L=L(t)$. In the fast-forward variants of equation of states, i.e., Bernoulli's formula and Poisson's adiabatic equation, the force or 1D analog of pressure can be expressed as a function of the velocity ($\dot{L}$) and acceleration ($\ddot{L}$) of $L$ besides rapidly-changing state variables like effective temperature ($T$) and $L$ itself. The force is now a sum of nonadiabatic (NAD) and adiabatic contributions with the former caused by particles moving synchronously with kinetics of $L$ and the latter by ideal bulk particles insensitive to such a kinetics. The ratio of NAD and adiabatic contributions does not depend on the particle number ($N$) in the case of the soft-wall confinement, whereas such a ratio is controllable in the case of hard-wall confinement. We also reveal the condition when the NAD contribution overwhelms the adiabatic one and thoroughly changes the standard form of the equilibrium equation of states.
