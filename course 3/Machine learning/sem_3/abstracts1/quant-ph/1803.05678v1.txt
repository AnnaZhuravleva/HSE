A protocol of quantum dense coding protection of two qubits is proposed in amplitude damping (AD) channel using weak measurement and reversal measurement. It is found that the capacity of quantum dense coding under the weak measurement and reversal measurement is always greater than that without weak measurement and reversal measurement. When the protocol is applied, for the AD channels with different damping coefficient, the result reflects that quantum entanglement can be protected and quantum dense coding becomes successful.
