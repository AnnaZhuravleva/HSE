Realization of strong coupling between two different quantum systems is important for fast transferring quantum information between them, but its implementation is difficult in some hybrid quantum systems. Here we propose a scheme to enhance the coupling strength between a single nitrogen-vacancy center and a superconducting circuit via squeezing. The main recipe of our scheme is to construct a unitary squeezing transformation by directly tuning the specifically-designed superconducting circuit. Using the experimentally accessible parameters of the circuit, we find that the coupling strength can be largely amplified by applying the squeezing transformations to the system. This provides a new path to enhance the coupling strengths in hybrid quantum systems.
