Quantum Darwinism extends the traditional formalism of decoherence to explain the emergence of classicality in a quantum Universe. A classical description emerges when the environment tends to redundantly acquire information about the pointer states of an open system. In light of recent interest, we apply the theoretical tools of the framework to a qubit coupled with many bosonic sub-environments. We examine the degree to which the same classical information is encoded across collections of: (i) complete sub-environments, and (ii) residual "pseudomode" components of each sub-environment, whose conception provides a dynamic representation of the reservoir memory. Overall, significant redundancy of information is found as a typical result of the decoherence process. However by examining its decomposition in terms of classical and quantum correlations, we discover classical information to be non-redundant in both cases (i) and (ii). Moreover, with the full collection of pseudomodes, certain dynamical regimes realize opposite effects, where either the total classical or quantum correlations predominantly decay over time. Finally, when the dynamics are non-Markovian, we find that redundant information is suppressed in line with information back-flow to the qubit. By quantifying redundancy, we concretely show it to act as a witness to non-Markovianity in the same way as the trace distance does for nondivisible dynamical maps.
