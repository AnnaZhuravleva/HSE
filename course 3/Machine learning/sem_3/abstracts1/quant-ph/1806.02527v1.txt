Quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to structured baths can localize multiple photons around them and form qubit-photon bound states. In the Markovian or weak coupling regime, the interaction of QEs through these single-photon bound states is known to lead to effective many-body QE Hamiltonians with tuneable but yet perturbative interactions. In this work we study the emergence of such models in the non-Markovian or strong coupling regime in different excitation subspaces. The effective models for the non-Markovian regime with up to three excitations are characterized using analytical methods, uncovering the existence of doublons or triplon states. Furthermore, we provide numerical results for systems with multiple excitations and demonstrate the emergence of polariton models with optically tuneable interactions, whose many-body ground state exhibits a superfluid-Mott insulator transition.
