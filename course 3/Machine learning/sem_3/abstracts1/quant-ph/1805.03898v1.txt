We study the dynamics of coherence-induced state ordering under incoherent channels, particularly four specific Markovian channels: $-$ amplitude damping channel, phase damping channel, depolarizing channel and bit flit channel for single-qubit states. We show that the amplitude damping channel, phase damping channel, and depolarizing channel do not change the coherence-induced state ordering by $l_1$ norm of coherence, relative entropy of coherence, geometric measure of coherence, and Tsallis relative $\alpha$-entropies, while the bit flit channel does change for some special cases.
