We discuss an example of a subvacuum effect, where a quantum expectation value is below the vacuum level. The example is the mean squared electric field in a non-classical state where one mode is excited. We give some specific examples of such states, and discuss the lower bound on the squared field or its time average. We show when a lower bound can be obtained by diagonalization of the squared electric field operator, and calculate this bound. We also discuss the case when the operator cannot be diagonalized. In this case, a lower bound still exists but is attained only by the limit of a sequence of quantum states. Our results may be useful for attempts to experimentally measure the subvacuum effect.
