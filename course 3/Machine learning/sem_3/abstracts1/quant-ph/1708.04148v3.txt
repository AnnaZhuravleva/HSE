We propose a protocol to simulate the evolution of a non-Markovian open quantum system by considering a collisional process with a many-body system, which plays the role of an environment. As a result of our protocol the environment spatial correlations are mapped into the time correlations of a noise that drives the dynamics of the open system. Considering the weak coupling limit the open system can also be considered as a probe of the environment properties. In this regard, when preparing the environment in its ground state, a measurement of the dynamics of the open system allows to determine the length of the environment spatial correlations and therefore its critical properties. To illustrate our proposal we simulate the full system dynamics with matrix-product-states and compare this with the reduced dynamics obtained with an approximated variational master equation.
