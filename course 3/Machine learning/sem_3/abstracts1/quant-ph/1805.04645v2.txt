We develop circuit implementations for digital-level quantum Hamiltonian dynamics simulation algorithms suitable for implementation on a reconfigurable quantum computer, such as the trapped ions. Our focus is on the co-design of a problem, its solution, and quantum hardware capable of executing the solution at the minimal cost expressed in terms of the quantum computing resources used, while demonstrating the solution of an instance of a scientifically interesting problem that is intractable classically. The choice for Hamiltonian dynamics simulation is due to the combination of its usefulness in the study of equilibrium in closed quantum mechanical systems, a low cost in the implementation by quantum algorithms, and the difficulty of classical simulation. By targeting a specific type of quantum computer and tailoring the problem instance and solution to suit physical constraints imposed by the hardware, we are able to reduce the resource counts by a factor of $10$ in a physical-level implementation and a factor of $30$ to $60$ in a fault-tolerant implementation over state of the art.
