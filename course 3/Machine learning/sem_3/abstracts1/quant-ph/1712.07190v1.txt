By slightly modifying the isotropic XY model (XX model) describing a spin-1/2 chain, we show that we can transmit in an almost perfect fashion a maximally entangled two-qubit state from one end of the chain to the other one. This is accomplished without external fields or modulation of the coupling constants among the qubits. We also show that this strategy works for any size of the chain and is relatively robust to imperfections in the coupling constants among the qubits belonging to the chain. Actually, under certain scenarios of small disorder, we obtain better results than those predicted by the optimal ordered and noiseless case.
