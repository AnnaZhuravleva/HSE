Both classical and wave-mechanical treatments of wave-like features may be faced in terms of exact trajectories, mutually coupled by a "Wave Potential" function (encoded in the structure itself of all Helmholtz-like equations) which is the cause of any diffraction and/or interference process. In the case of matter waves, the Wave Potential establishes a bridge between the waves and the relevant particles by piloting them along their path by means of an energy-preserving "gentle drive", allowing an illuminating insight into the mechanism of wave-particle duality. Thanks to a numerical treatment which is not substantially less manageable than its classical counterpart each particle is seen to "dance", under the action of an energy-dependent Wave Potential, "a wave-mechanical dance around the classical motion".
