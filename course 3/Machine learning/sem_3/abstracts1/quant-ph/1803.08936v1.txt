How the objective everyday world emerges from the underlying quantum behaviour of its microscopic constituents is an open question at the heart of the foundations of quantum mechanics. Quantum Darwinism and spectrum broadcast structure are two different frameworks providing insight into this question. Recent works, however, indicate these two frameworks can lead to conflicting predictions on the objectivity of the state of a system. Here we provide a resolution to this issue by defining strong quantum Darwinism and proving that it is equivalent to spectrum broadcast structure when combined with strong independence of the subenvironments. We further show that strong quantum Darwinism is sufficient and necessary to signal state objectivity without the requirement of strong independence. Our work unveils the deep connection between these two theoretical frameworks which describe the emergence of classical objectivity from the underlying quantum world. Together they provide us a sharper understanding of the transition from the quantum subjective world to the observed classical objective properties of a quantum system in terms of state structure, geometry, and quantum and classical information.
