Cubic silicon carbide is an excellent platform for integration of defect qubits into established wafer scale device architectures for quantum information and sensing applications, where divacancy qubit, that is similar to the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, has favorable coherence properties. We demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that divacancy in 3C SiC has superior spin-stress coupling parameters and stress sensitivity for nanoscale, quantum enhanced photonic, optoelectronic and optomechanical devices.
