The quantum dynamics of a $\hat{\mathbf{J}}^2=(\hat{\mathbf{j}}_1+\hat{\mathbf{j}}_2)^2$-conserving Hamiltonian model describing two coupled spins $\hat{\mathbf{j}}_1$ and $\hat{\mathbf{j}}_2$ under controllable and fluctuating time-dependent magnetic fields is investigated. Each eigenspace of $\hat{\mathbf{J}}^2$ is dynamically invariant and the Hamiltonian of the total system restricted to any one of such $(j_1+j_2)-|j_1-j_2|+1$ eigenspaces, possesses the SU(2) structure of the Hamiltonian of a single fictitious spin acted upon by the total magnetic field. We show that such a reducibility holds regardless of the time dependence of the externally applied field as well as of the statistical properties of the noise, here represented as a classical fluctuating magnetic field. The time evolution of the joint transition probabilities of the two spins $\hat{\mathbf{j}}_1$ and $\hat{\mathbf{j}}_2$ between two prefixed factorized states is examined, bringing to light peculiar dynamical properties of the system under scrutiny. When the noise-induced non-unitary dynamics of the two coupled spins is properly taken into account, analytical expressions for the joint Landau-Zener transition probabilities are reported. The possibility of extending the applicability of our results to other time-dependent spin models is pointed out.
