Electron-electron correlation forms the basis of difficulties encountered in many-body problems. Accurate treatment of the correlation problem is likely to unravel some nice physical properties of matter embedded in this correlation. In an effort to tackle this many-body problem, an "exact" form of a symmetry-dependent pseudopotential for an $n$-electron atom or ion is suggested in this study. The non-relativistic ionization potentials for atoms with up to $12$ electrons generated using this pseudopotential are in good agreement with the existing experimental data. The pseudopotential is also yields reliable results for the excited states of helium and lithium atoms. With the development reported in this work, it is hoped that the uncertainties relating to the electron correlation effects within the non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework are reduced.
