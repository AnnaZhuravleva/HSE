In this study, the security of Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) of quantum images are suggested by using the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) with blind trent. In the protocol, QFT and keys are used to share signature with recipients. So all members know only their signature information which are encrypted output of the QFT. This improves the security of the protocol. In addition, the security of the protocol is provided by using reorder QFT output qubits with permutation of the blind trent. The security analysis expresses security of the transfer of the image with effective secret key usage.
