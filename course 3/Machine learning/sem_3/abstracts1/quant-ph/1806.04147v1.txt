How violently do two quantum operators disagree? Different fields of physics feature different measures of incompatibility: (i) In quantum information theory, entropic uncertainty relations constrain measurement outcomes. (ii) In condensed matter and high-energy physics, the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) signals scrambling, the spread of information through many-body entanglement. We unite these measures, deriving entropic uncertainty relations for scrambling. The entropies are of distributions over weak and strong measurements' possible outcomes. Weakness causes the OTOC quasiprobability (a nonclassical generalization of a probability, in terms of which the OTOC decomposes) to govern terms in the uncertainty bound. Scrambling strengthens the bound, we show, in numerical simulations of a spin chain. Beyond scrambling, we derive entropic uncertainty relations satisfied by commonly performed weak-measurement experiments. We unveil a physical significance of common quasiprobabilities and weak values (conditioned expectation values): as governing terms in entropic uncertainty bounds.
