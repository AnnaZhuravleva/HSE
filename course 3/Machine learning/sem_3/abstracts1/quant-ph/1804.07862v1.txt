We develop a quantum network architecture, for which any two neighboring nodes and the communication channel between them can form a closed subsystem. This architecture is implemented in a phononic network of solid-state spins in diamond, in which nanomechanical resonators couple to color centers through phonon-assisted transitions. A key element of the implementation is the use of alternating phononic crystal waveguides that feature specially-designed band gaps, enabling alternating, frequency-selective coupling between mechanical resonators. The implementation also includes quantum state transfer between single spins or spin ensembles in neighboring resonators. An ensemble-spin based protocol, which requires a special ratio between the spin-mechanical and waveguide-resonator coupling rates, can be independent of the initial states of all the mechanical modes involved and thus be robust against the thermal environment. The proposed phononic network overcomes the inherent obstacles in scaling phononic quantum networks and avoids the technical difficulty of employing chiral spin-phonon interactions, providing a promising route for developing quantum computers using robust solid-state spin qubits.
