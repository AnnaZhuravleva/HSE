The canonical Rayleigh limit valid for direct imaging (DI) can be overcome by so-called superresolution techniques. The celebrated approaches to microscopic superresolution, rely on nonlinear optical processes and require manipulations of the sample to be imaged. Instead of manipulating the light sources themselves, one can alternatively reach superresolution by aiming to optimally extract information already present in the light naturally emitted by a source. Such an approach can be advantageous in astrophysical imaging or whenever sample degradation becomes important, but unresolved issues remain. As an archetypical example, the measurement optimally suited to determine the separation of two nearby point sources requires a very good knowledge of the centroid, and, on a single photon level, is fundamentally incompatible with the measurement needed to estimate the centroid itself. Here we show, theoretically and experimentally, that Hong-Ou-Mandel interference followed by spatially-resolved detection of photons emitted by the sources effectively implements a collective measurement that overcomes the above mentioned deficiencies allowing for simultaneous estimation of the centroid and the source separation below the Rayleigh limit.
