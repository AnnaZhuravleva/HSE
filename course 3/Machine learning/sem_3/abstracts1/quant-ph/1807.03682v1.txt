The condition of phase matching prohibits the transfer of excitation from free-space photons to surface plasmon polaritons (SPP). We propose and analyze a scheme that optically prepares an ensemble of emitters in a collective timed-Dicke state, which is phase matched with the SPP by its position dependent excitation amplitudes. By a collective enhancement the ensemble, hence, emits an SPP in a well defined direction. Our theory, applicable also for other surface polaritons, incorporates the dispersive and dissipative properties of the plasmon modes to evaluate the non-Markovian emission by the ensemble.
