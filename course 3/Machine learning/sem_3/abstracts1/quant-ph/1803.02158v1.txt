The Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) states have been proved to be a useful resource for quantum information processing [Nature 409, 46 (2001)]. For atomic KLM states, several schemes have been put forward based on the time-dependent unitary dynamics, but the dissipative generation of these states has not been reported. This work discusses the possibility for creating different forms of bipartite KLM states in neutral atom system, where the spontaneous emission of excited Rydberg states, combined with the Rydberg antiblockade mechanism, is actively exploited to engineer a steady KLM state from an arbitrary initial state. The numerical simulation of the master equation signifies that a fidelity above 99\% is available with the current experimental parameters.
