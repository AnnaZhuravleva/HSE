We propose a hybrid quantum repeater based on ancillary coherent field states and material qubits coupled to optical cavities. For this purpose, resonant qubit-field interactions and postselective field measurements are determined which are capable of realizing all necessary two-qubit operations for the actuation of the quantum repeater. We explore both theoretical and experimental possibilities of generating near-maximally-entangled qubit pairs ($F>0.999$) over long distances. It is shown that our scheme displays moderately low repeater rates, between $5 \times 10^{-4}$ and $23$ pairs per second, over distances up to $900$ km, and it relies completely on current technology of cavity quantum electrodynamics.
