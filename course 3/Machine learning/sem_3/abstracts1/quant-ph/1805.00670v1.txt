In analogy with the classical complexity class Total Functional NP (TFNP), we introduce the complexity class of Total Functional QMA (TFQMA). In this complexity class one is given a family of quantum circuits $Q_n$ that take as input a classical string $x$ of length $n$ and a quantum state $\vert \psi \rangle$ on poly$(n)$ qubits, for some polynomial poly$(n)$, such that for all $x$ there exists at least one witness, i.e. a state $\vert \psi \rangle$ such that $Q_n(x, \vert \psi \rangle)=1$ with probability $\geq 2/3$. The functional problem is then, given $Q_n$ and $x$, find a $\vert \psi \rangle$ such that $Q_n(x, \vert \psi \rangle)=1$ with probability $\geq 2/3$. The complexity of this class lies between the functional analogs of BQP and QMA, denoted FBQP and FQMA respectively. We show that TFQMA can equivalently be defined as the functional analog of QMA$\cap$coQMA. We provide examples of problems that lie in TFQMA, coming from areas such as the complexity of k-local Hamiltonians and public key quantum money. In the context of black-box groups, we note that Group Non-Membership, which was known to belong to QMA, in fact belongs to TFQMA. We also provide an oracle with respect to which we have a separation between FBQP and TFQMA. In the conclusion we discuss the relation between TFQMA, public key quantum money, and the complexity of quantum states.
