We realise a quantum three-level system with photons distributed among three different spatial and polarization modes. Ambiguous measurement of the state of the qutrit are realised by blocking one out for the three modes at any one time. Using these measurements we construct a test of a Leggett-Garg inequality as well as tests of no-signalling-in-time for the measurements. We observe violations of the Leggett-Garg inequality that can not be accounted for in terms of signalling. Moreover, we tailor the qutrit dynamics such that both ambiguous and unambiguous measurements are simultaneously non-signalling, which is an essential step for the justification of the use of ambiguous measurements in Leggett-Garg tests.
