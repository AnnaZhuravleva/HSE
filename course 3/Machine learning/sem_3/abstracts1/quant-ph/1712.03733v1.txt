We investigated the optimal spectral design of periodic structure of narrow lines (AFC-structure) within the inhomogeneously broadened atomic transition which are created for the implementation of broadband AFC photon echo quantum memory.The influence of the spectral design on the suppression of negative dispersion effects in the AFC-echo retrieval was studied for different spectroscopic parameters of atomic media. The maps of the assigned spectral quantum efficiency have been constructed for the created AFC-structures characterized by different spectral design, finesse and optical depth. Based on the performed analysis, we discuss the possible ways for experimental implementation of highly efficient broadband AFC-protocol.
