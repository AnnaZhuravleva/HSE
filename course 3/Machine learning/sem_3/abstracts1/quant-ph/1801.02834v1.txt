We theoretically investigate the far-field scattering properties of multiphoton super- and subradiant states which can be prepared by multiphoton excitations with orbital angular momentum (OAM).\ Due to multiphoton interference, the far-field patterns of the subradiant modes show directional scattering along the excitation direction or transverse scattering with number of peaks equal to the number of atoms.\ When more atoms are involved, we consider structures of stacked and concentric rings, which respectively show enhanced directional scattering and smoothed emission patterns.\ Our scheme gives insights to prepare many-body subradiant states, and is potentially applicable to quantum storage of multiphoton with OAM.\ By designing atomic spatial distributions, these cooperative states can tailor the far-field emission properties, which is useful for light collections and quantum information manipulations.
