We realize a non-invasive electrometer based on state engineering in a Rydberg hydrogenic manifold. A quantum interference process involving states with very different dipoles measures directly the time correlation of a stochastic electric field, with a 200~ns time resolution and with a $83.2\pm1.4$~mV/m single-atom sensitivity, beyond the Standard Quantum Limit in this context. This quantum-enabled correlation electrometer opens the way to applications in mesoscopic physics, e.g. for the study of individual charge transits in nano-structures.
