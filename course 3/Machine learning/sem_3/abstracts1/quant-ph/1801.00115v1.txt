This paper discusses an attempt to develop a mathematically rigorous theory of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). It deviates from the standard version of QED mainly in two aspects: it is assumed that the Coulomb forces are carried by transversely polarized photons, and a reducible representation of the canonical commutation and anti-commutation relations is used. Both interventions together should suffice to eliminate the mathematical inconsistencies of standard QED.
