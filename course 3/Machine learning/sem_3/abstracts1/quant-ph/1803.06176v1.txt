Quantum processors rely on classical electronic controllers to manipulate and read out the quantum state. As the performance of the quantum processor improves, non-idealities in the classical controller can become the performance bottleneck for the whole quantum computer. To prevent such limitation, this paper presents a systematic study of the impact of the classical electrical signals on the qubit fidelity. All operations, i.e. single-qubit rotations, two-qubit gates and read-out, are considered, in the presence of errors in the control electronics, such as static, dynamic, systematic and random errors. Although the presented study could be extended to any qubit technology, it currently focuses on single-electron spin qubits, because of several advantages, such as purely electrical control and long coherence times, and for their potential for large-scale integration. As a result of this study, detailed electrical specifications for the classical control electronics for a given qubit fidelity can be derived, as demonstrated with specific case studies. We also discuss the effect on qubit fidelity of the performance of the general-purpose room-temperature equipment that is typically employed to control the few qubits available today. Ultimately, we show that tailor-made electronic controllers can achieve significantly lower power, cost and size, as required to support the scaling up of quantum computers.
