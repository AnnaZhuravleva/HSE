The purpose of this paper is to study the structure of quantum linear systems in terms of their Kalman canonical form, which was proposed in a recent paper. Physical realizability conditions for the Kalman canonical form are given, which shed light on various relations among the components of the system matrices for the Kalman canonical form. These relations are used to explore the structure of the spectrum of quantum linear systems. The spectral structure obtained indicates that a quantum linear system is both controllable and observable if it is Hurwitz stable. A new parameterization method for quantum linear systems is proposed. This new parameterization is designed for the Kalman canonical form directly. Consequently, the parameters involved are in a blockwise form in correspondence with the blockwise structure of the Kalman canonical form. This parameter structure can be used to simplify various quantum control design problems. For example, necessary and sufficient conditions for the realization of back-action evading (BAE) measurements are given in terms of these new parameters that specify the Kalman canonical form. Due to their blockwise nature, a small number of parameters are required for realizing BAE measurements. Moreover, it is shown that a refined structure of these physical parameters reveals the noiseless subsystem and invariant subsystems of a given quantum linear system.
