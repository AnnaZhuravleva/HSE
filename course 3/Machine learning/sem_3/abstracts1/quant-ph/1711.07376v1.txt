We propose a noisy quantum analogue of the well known Stuart--Landau equation for weakly nonlinear oscillators. Surprisingly, we find the oscillator's amplitude to be amplified by the very same noise responsible for its stochastic dynamics. This has interesting implications for the theory of linear amplifiers and the so-called quantum van der Pol model used in quantum synchronisation. We then go beyond the weakly nonlinear regime and obtain an exact quantum analogue of the nonlinear oscillator which van der Pol proposed in his 1926 paper.
