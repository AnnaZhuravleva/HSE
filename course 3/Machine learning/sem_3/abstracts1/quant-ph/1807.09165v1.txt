We present a family of correlations constraints that apply to all multipartite quantum systems of finite dimension. The size of this family is exponential in the number of subsystems. We obtain these relations by defining and investigating the generalized state inversion map. This map provides a systematic way to generate local unitary invariants of degree two in the state and is directly linked to the shadow inequalities proved by Rains [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 46, 54 (2000)]. The constraints are stated in terms of linear inequalities for the linear entropies of the subsystems. For pure quantum states they turn into monogamy relations that constrain the distribution of bipartite entanglement among the subsystems of the global state.
