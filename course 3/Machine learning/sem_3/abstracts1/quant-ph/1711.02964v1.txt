The polarizing multi-photon quantum states tomography with non-unit quantum efficiency of detectors is considered. A new quantum tomography protocol is proposed. This protocol considers events of losing photons of multi-photon quantum state in one or more channels among with n-fold coincidence events. The advantage of the proposed protocol compared with the standard n-fold coincidence protocol is demonstrated using the methods of statistical analysis.
