Time crystals in periodically driven systems have initially been studied assuming the ability to quench the Hamiltonian between different many-body regimes and/or the presence of disorder or long-range interactions. Here we propose a scheme to observe discrete time crystal dynamics in a clean driven quantum system of the Ising type with short range interactions. The system is subject only to a periodic kick by a global magnetic field and no extra Hamiltonian quenching is performed. We analyse the emerging time crystal stabilising mechanisms via extensive numerics as well as using an analytic approach based on a off-resonant transition model. Our proposal can be implemented with current experimental platforms including trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits.
