Analyzing weak microwave signals in the GHz regime is a challenging task if the signal level is very low and the photon energy widely undefined. A superconducting qubit can detect signals in the low photon regime, but due to its discrete level structure, it is only sensitive to photons of certain energies. With a multi-level quantum system (qudit) in contrast, the unknown signal frequency and amplitude can be deduced from the higher level AC Stark shift. The measurement accuracy is given by the signal amplitude, its detuning from the discrete qudit energy level structure and the anharmonicity. We demonstrate an energy sensitivity in the order of $10^{-3}$ with a measurement range of more than $1\,\mathrm{GHz}$. Here, using a transmon qubit, we experimentally observe shifts in the transition frequencies involving up to three excited levels. These shifts are in good agreement with an analytic circuit model and master equation simulations. For large detunings, we find the shifts to scale linearly with the power of the applied microwave drive. Exploiting the effect, we demonstrated a power meter which makes it possible to characterize the microwave transmission from source to sample.
