Recent experiments have demonstrated strong coupling between living bacteria and light. Here we propose a scheme to infer quantumness of the light-bacteria correlations, as characterised by the presence of quantum discord, without requiring any knowledge of their mutual interactions, and by measuring only the light's degrees of freedom. This is achieved by monitoring the dynamics of the entanglement between few optical modes (probes) that interact independently with the bacteria. When the (light-sensitive part of) bacterium is modelled as a collection of two-level atoms we find that the steady state entanglement between the probes is independent of the initial conditions, is accompanied by entanglement between probes and bacteria, and provides independent evidence of the strong coupling between them.
