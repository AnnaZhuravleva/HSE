Fisher information (I) is investigated for confined hydrogen atom (CHA)-like systems in conjugate $r$ and $p$ spaces. A comparative study between CHA and free H atom (with respect to $I$) is pursued. In many aspects, inferences in CHA are significantly different from free counterpart; that includes its dependence on $n, l, m$. The role of atomic number and atomic radius is discussed. Further, a detailed systematic result of $I$ with respect to variation of confinement radius $r_c$ is presented, with particular emphasis on \emph{non-zero}-$(l,m)$ states. Several new interesting observations are recorded. Most of these results are of benchmark quality and presented for the first time.
