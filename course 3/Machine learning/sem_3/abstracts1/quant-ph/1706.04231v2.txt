Quantum statistics have a profound impact on the properties of systems composed of identical particles. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the quantum statistics of a pair of identical massive particles can be probed by a direct measurement of the exchange symmetry of their wave function even in conditions where the particles always remain spatially well separated and thus the exchange contribution to their interaction energy is negligible. We present two protocols revealing the bosonic or fermionic nature of a pair of particles and discuss possible implementations with a pair of trapped atoms or ions.
