A stochastic Euler equation is proposed, describing the motion of a particle density, forced by the random action of virtual photons in vacuum. After time averaging, the Euler equation is reduced to the Reynolds equation, well studied in turbulent hydrodynamics. It is shown that the average pressure is nonlocal and the magnitude of the turbulent flow obeys the Fick law. Using the Madelung transformation, the Schrodinger equation is derived without any other assumptions.
