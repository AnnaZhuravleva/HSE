The time evolution of the distribution and shareability of quantum coherence of a tripartite system in a non-Markovian environment is examined. The total coherence can be decomposed into various contributions, ranging from local, global bipartite and global tripartite, which characterize the type of state. We identify coherence revivals for non-Markovian systems for all the contributions of coherence. The local coherence is found to be much more robust under the environmental coupling due to an effective smaller coupling to the reservoir. This allows us to devise a characterization of a quantum state in terms of a coherence tuple on a multipartite state simply by examining various combinations of reservoir couplings. The effect of the environment on the shareability of quantum coherence, as defined using the monogamy of coherence, is investigated and found that the sign of the monogamy is a preserved quantity under the decoherence. We conjecture that the monogamy of coherence is a conserved property under local incoherent processes.
