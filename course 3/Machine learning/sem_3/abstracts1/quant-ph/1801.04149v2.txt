Given a linear open quantum system which is described by a Lindblad master equation, we detail the calculation of the moment evolution equations from this master equation. We stress that the moment evolution equations are well-known, but their explicit derivation from the master equation cannot be found in the literature to the best of our knowledge, and so we provide this derivation for the interested reader.
