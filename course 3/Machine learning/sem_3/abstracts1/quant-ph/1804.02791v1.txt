As a universal quantum character of quantum correlation, the freezing phenomenon is researched by geometry and quantum discord methods, respectively. In this paper, the properties of R`enyi discord is studied for two independent Dimer System coupled to two correlated Fermi-spin environments under the non-Markovian condition. We further demonstrate that the freezing behaviors still exist for R`enyi discord and study the effects of different parameters on this behaviors.
