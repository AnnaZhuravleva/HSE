This paper establishes a framework for the acceleration of quantum gossip algorithms by introducing local clique operations to networks of interconnected qubits. Cliques are local structures in complex networks being complete subgraphs. Based on cyclic permutations, clique gossiping leads to collective multi-party qubit interactions. This type of algorithm can be physically realized by a series of local environments using coherent methods. First of all, we show that at reduced states, these cliques have the same acceleration effects as their roles in accelerating classical gossip algorithms, which can even make possible finite-time convergence for suitable network structures. Next, for randomized selection of cliques where node updates enjoy a more self-organized and scalable sequencing, we show that the rate of convergence is precisely improved by $\mathcal{O}(k/n)$ at the reduced states, where $k$ is the size of the cliques and $n$ is the number of qubits in the network. The rate of convergence at the coherent states of the overall quantum network is proven to be decided by the spectrum of a mean-square error evolution matrix. Explicit calculation of such matrix is rather challenging, nonetheless, the effect of cliques on the coherent states' dynamics is illustrated via numerical examples. Interestingly, the use of larger quantum cliques does not necessarily increase the speed of the network density aggregation, suggesting quantum network dynamics is not entirely decided by its classical topology.
