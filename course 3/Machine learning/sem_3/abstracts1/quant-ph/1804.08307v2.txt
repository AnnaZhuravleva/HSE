We use the formalism of noisy Gaussian channels to derive explicit transformation laws describing how an arbitrary multimode Gaussian state of a scalar quantum field is perceived by a number of accelerating observers, each having access to at least one of the modes. Our work, which generalizes earlier results of Ahmadi, et al., Phys. Rev. D 93, 124031 (2016), is the next step torwards a better understanding of the effect of gravity on the states of quantum fields.
