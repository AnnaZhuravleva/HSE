In the paper, it is argued that the phenomenon known as the quantum pigeonhole principle (namely, three quantum particles are put in two boxes, yet no two particles are in the same box) can be explained not as a violation of Dirichlet's box principle in the case of quantum particles but as a nonvalidness of a bivalent logic for describing not-yet verified propositions relating to quantum mechanical experiments.
