A protocol for non-destructive descrimination of arbitrary set of orthogonal quantum states was proposed by V. S. Manu et al., using an algorithm based on quantum phase estimation. IBM Corporation has released a superconductivity based 5-qubit (5-qubit transmon bowtie chip 3 and IBM 5-qubit real processor) quantum computer named Quantum Experience and placed it on cloud. In this paper we take advantage of the online availability of those real quantum processors(ibmqx2 amd ibmqx4) and carry out the above protocol that has experimentally demonstrated earlier using NMR quantum processor. Here, we set up experiments for arbitrary one-qubit and two-qubit orthogonal quantum states. The experiment confirmed that the arbitrary orthogonal quantum states can be discriminate in a nondestructive manner with a high fidelity. We compare the outcomes of those experiments which are done by ibmqx2 and ibmqx4 processors. Here, we also show the state tomography for the single qubit experiments.
