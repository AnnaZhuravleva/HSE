In this paper a macroscopic quantum oscillator is introduced that consists of a flux qubit in the form of a cantilever. The magnetic flux linked to the flux qubit and the mechanical degrees of freedom of the cantilever are naturally coupled. The coupling is controlled through an external magnetic field. The ground state of the introduced flux-qubit-cantilever corresponds to a quantum entanglement between magnetic flux and the cantilever displacement.
