We show that with finite resources it is impossible to perform a perfect projective measurement of a quantum system. We model the measurement as an interaction of the system with an N-particle pointer and provide tight analytic expressions for the energy cost of performing such a measurement. Under the assumption that the statistics of the system are perfectly reproduced by the pointer, this cost breaks down into two parts. First, the cost of preparing the pointer in a suitable state, and second, the cost of a global interaction between the system and pointer in order to correlate them. Our results show that, even under the assumption that the interaction can be controlled perfectly, achieving perfect correlation is infinitely expensive. We provide measurement protocols for achieving optimal correlation between a system and pointer given finite resources.
