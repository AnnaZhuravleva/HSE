We study the photon blockade effect in a coupled cavity system, which is formed by a linear cavity coupled to a Kerr-type nonlinear cavity via a photon-hopping interaction. We explain the physical phenomenon from the viewpoint of the conventional and unconventional photon blockade effects. The corresponding physical mechanisms of these two photon blockade effects are based on the anharmonicity in eigenenergy spectrum and the destructive quantum interference between two different transition paths, respectively. We find that the quantum interference effect also exists in the conventional photon blockade regime. Our results are confirmed by analytically and numerically solving the quantum master equation and calculating the second-order correlation function of the cavity fields. This model is general and hence it can be implemented in various experimental setups such as coupled optical cavities, coupled photon-magnon systems, and coupled superconducting resonators. We present some discussions on the experimental implementation.
