The distribution of quantum correlations in multipartite systems play a significant role in several aspects of the quantum information theory. While it is well known that these quantum correlations can not be freely distributed, the way that it is shared in multipartite system is an open problem even for small set of qubits. Based on new monogamylike relations between entanglement and discord for $n$-partite systems, we show how these correlations are distributed in general, determining distinct equalities and inequalities to the quantum discord and the entanglement of formation for arbitrary multipartite pure states.
