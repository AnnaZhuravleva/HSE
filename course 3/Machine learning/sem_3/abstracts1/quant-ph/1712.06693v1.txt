We review recent advances towards the realization of quantum networks based on atom-like solid-state quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic devices. Specifically, we focus on experiments involving the negatively charged silicon-vacancy color center in diamond. These emitters combine homogeneous, coherent optical transitions and a long-lived electronic spin quantum memory. We discuss optical and spin properties of this system at cryogenic temperatures and describe experiments where silicon-vacancy centers are coupled to nanophotonic devices. Finally, we discuss experiments demonstrating quantum nonlinearities at the single-photon level and two-emitter entanglement in a single nanophotonic device.
