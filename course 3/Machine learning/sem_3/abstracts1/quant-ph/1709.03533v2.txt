We study continuous-variable entanglement of bright quantum states in a pair of evanescently coupled nonlinear $\chi^{(2)}$ waveguides operating in the regime of degenerate down-conversion. We consider the case where only the energy of the nonlinearly generated fields is exchanged between the waveguides while the pump fields stay independently guided in each original waveguide. We show that this device, when operated in the depletion regime, entangles the two non-interacting bright pump modes due to a nonlinear cascade effect. It is also shown that two-colour quadripartite entanglement can be produced when certain system parameters are appropriately set. This device works in the traveling-wave configuration, such that the generated quantum light shows a broad spectrum. The proposed device can be easily realized with current technology and therefore stands as a good candidate for a source of bipartite or multipartite entangled states for the emerging field of optical continuous-variable quantum information processing.
