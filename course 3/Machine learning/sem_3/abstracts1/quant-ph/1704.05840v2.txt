We look for new steps on the dynamical operations that may squeeze simultaneously some families of quantum states, independently of their initial shape, induced by softly acting external fields which might produce the squeezing of the canonical observables $q,p$ of charged particles. Also, we present some exactly solvable cases of the problem which appear in the symmetric evolution intervals permitting to find explicitly the time dependence of the external fields needed to generate the required evolution operators. Curiously, our results are interrelated with a simple, non--trivial, anti--commuting algebra of Toeplitz which describes the problem more easily than the frequently used Ermakov--Milne invariants.
