The concept of quantum integrability has been introduced recently for quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians. Within the multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) theory, however, there has been a successful alternative approach to identify and solve complex time-dependent models. Here we compare both methods by applying them to a new class of exactly solvable MLZ models. This class contains systems with an arbitrary number $N\ge 4$ of interacting states and shows a quickly growing with $N$ number of exact adiabatic energy crossing points, which appear at different moments of time. At each $N$, transition probabilities in these systems can be found analytically and exactly but complexity and variety of solutions in this class also grow with $N$ quickly. We illustrate how common features of solvable MLZ systems appear from quantum integrability and develop an approach to further classification of solvable MLZ problems.
