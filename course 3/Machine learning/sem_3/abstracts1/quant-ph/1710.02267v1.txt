The geometric measure of entanglement of a pure quantum state is defined to be its distance to the space of product (seperable) states. Given an $n$-partite system composed of subsystems of dimensions $d_1,\ldots, d_n$, an upper bound for maximally allowable entanglement is derived in terms of geometric measure of entanglement. This upper bound is characterized exclusively by the dimensions $d_1,\ldots, d_n$ of composite subsystems. Numerous examples demonstrate that the upper bound appears to be reasonably tight.
