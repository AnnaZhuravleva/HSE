The Hamiltonian of the two-photon Dicke model is diagonalized for the normal phase and super-radiant phase beyond the mean-field method respectively, giving the critical coupling strength. Besides a spectral collapse, the super-radiant phase transition is presented by the vanishing of the excitation energy, which is lower than the mean-field results. Finite-size scaling exponents for the ground-state energy and the atomic angular momentum are analytically derived from scaling hypothesis, belonging to the same scaling universality of the one-photon Dicke model.
