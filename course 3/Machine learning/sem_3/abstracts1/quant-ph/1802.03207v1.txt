Due to finite statistics, experimentally estimated density matrices are either not physical or biased, depending on the chosen reconstruction schemes; linear inversion of measurement results or Maximum-Likelihood estimations. We present in this work an alternative approach inspired by device-independent quantum information protocols. We embed a tomographic complete set of measurement operators within the framework of a Bell scenario such that statistical fluctuations are tamed by regularizing the corresponding input-output probability distributions. Numerical simulations based on entangled bipartite quantum states subjected to random noise show an improvement of the state estimation.
