Quantum thermal rectification and heat amplification are investigated in a nonequilibrium V-type three-level system. By applying the Redfield master equation combined with full counting statistics, we obtain the steady state heat transport. The noise-induced interference is found to be able to rectify full counting statistics, such as the heat current and noise power, which paves a new way to design quantum thermal rectifier. Within the three-reservoir setup, the heat amplification is clearly identified far-from equilibrium, which is in absence of the negative differential thermal conductance.
