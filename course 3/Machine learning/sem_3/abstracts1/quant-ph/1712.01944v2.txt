We present the differences between Input-Output formalism (IOF) and Incoherent Pumping Mechanism (IPM) derived from Lindblad Master Equation approach in terms of the transmission spectrum of Coupled high-Q Cavity with Quantum Dot system in the strong coupling regime. Fullwidth- half-maximum (FWHM) and the peak transmission of Dipole Induced Transparency (DIT) are inquired for detailed comparison in on-resonant and off-resonant conditions. We have found that DIT phenomenon in off-resonant case cannot be explained entirely by IPM although both methods can exhibit the same Vacuum Rabi splitting in on-resonant case. We have concluded that polariton having atomic-like feature in transmission spectrum could not be captured completely by IPM.
