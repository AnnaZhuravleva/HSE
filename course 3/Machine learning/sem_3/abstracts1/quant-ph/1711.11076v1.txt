We consider propagation of a probe pulse in an atomic medium characterized by a combined tripod and Lambda ($\Lambda$) atom-light coupling scheme. The scheme involves three atomic ground states coupled to two excited states by five light fields. It is demonstrated that dark states can be formed for such an atom-light coupling. This is essential for formation of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and slow light. In the limiting cases the scheme reduces to conventional $\Lambda$- or $N$-type atom-light couplings providing the EIT or absorption, respectively. Thus the atomic system can experience a transition from the EIT to the absorption by changing the amplitudes or phases of control lasers. Subsequently the scheme is employed to analyze the nonlinear pulse propagation using the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. It is shown that generation of stable slow light optical solitons is possible in such a five-level combined tripod and $\Lambda$ atomic system.
