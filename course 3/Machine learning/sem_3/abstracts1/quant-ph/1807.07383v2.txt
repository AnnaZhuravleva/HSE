Communication through a sequence of two identical, noisy, depolarising channels is impossible in conventional information theory. Surprisingly, communication becomes possible if the depolarising channels are within a quantum switch, where the order of the channels is in a quantum superposition. Here, we experimentally demonstrate this counterintuitive result in a quantum switch that uses polarisation to coherently control the order of two depolarising channels acting on the transverse spatial mode of a photon. We send $(3.41{\pm}0.15){\times}10^{-2}$ bits of information through two fully depolarising channels that are in an indefinite causal order.
