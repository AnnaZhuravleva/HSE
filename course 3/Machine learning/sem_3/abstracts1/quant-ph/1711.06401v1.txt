A method is proposed to characterize a high-dimensional quantum channel with the aid of classical light. It uses a single nonseparable input optical field that contains correlations between spatial modes and wavelength to determine the effect of the channel on the spatial degrees of freedom. The channel estimation process incorporates spontaneous parametric upconversion (sum frequency generation) to perform the necessary measurements.
