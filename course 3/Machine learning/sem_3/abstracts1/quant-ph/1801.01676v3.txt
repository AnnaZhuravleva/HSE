It is generally believed that Parity-Time (PT)-symmetry breaking occurs when eigenvalues or both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coincide. However, we show that this well-accepted picture of PT-symmetry breaking is incorrect. Instead, we demonstrate that the physical mechanism of PT-symmetry breaking is the resonance between positive- and negative-action modes. It is proved that PT-symmetry breaking occurs when and only when this resonance condition is satisfied, and this mechanism applies to all known PT-symmetry breakings observed in different branches of physics. The result is achieved by proving a remarkable fact that in finite dimensions, a PT-symmetric Hamiltonian is necessarily pseudo-Hermitian, regardless whether it is diagonalizable or not.
