The presented paper describes QSWalk.jl package for Julia programming language, developed for the purpose of simulating the evolution of open quantum systems. The package enables the study of quantum procedures developed using stochastic quantum walks on arbitrary directed graphs. We provide a detailed description of the implemented functions, along with a number of usage examples. The package is compared with the existing software offering a similar functionality.
