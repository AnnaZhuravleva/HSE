We study the quality of service in quantum channels. We regard the quantum channel as a queueing system, and present queueing analysis of both the classical information transmission and quantum information transmission in the quantum channel. For the former, we link the analysis to the classical queueing model, for the latter, we propose a new queueing model and investigate the limit queueing behavior. For both scenarios, we obtain tail distributions of the performance measures, i.e., backlog, delay, and throughput.
