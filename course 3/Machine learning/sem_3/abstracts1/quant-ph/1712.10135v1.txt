Conventional coherent states (CSs) are defined in various ways. For example, CS is defined as an infinite Poissonian expansion in Fock states, as displaced vacuum state, or as an eigenket of annihilation operator. In the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, these definitions are equivalent. However, these definitions are not equivalent for the finite dimensional systems. In this work, we present a comparative description of the lower- and higher-order nonclassical properties of the finite dimensional CSs which are also referred to as qudit CSs (QCSs). For the comparison, nonclassical properties of two types of QCSs are used: (i) nonlinear QCS produced by applying a truncated displacement operator on the vacuum and (ii) linear QCS produced by the Poissonian expansion in Fock states of the CS truncated at (d-1)-photon Fock state. The comparison is performed using a set of nonclassicality witnesses (e.g., higher order antiubunching, higher order sub-Poissonian statistics, higher order squeezing, Agarwal-Tara parameter, Klyshko's criterion) and a set of quantitative measures of nonclassicality (e.g., negativity potential, concurrence potential and anticlassicality). The higher order nonclassicality witness have found to reveal the existence of higher order nonclassical properties of QCS for the first time.
