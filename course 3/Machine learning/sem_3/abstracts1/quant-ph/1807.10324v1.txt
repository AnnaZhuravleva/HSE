We consider an optomechanical cavity with a movable end-mirror as a quantum mechanical oscillator (MO) containing an interacting cigar-shaped Bose-Eisenstein condensate (BEC). It is assumed that both the MO and the BEC interact with the radiation pressure of the cavity field in the red-detuned and weak coupling regimes while the two-body atomic collisions frequency of the BEC and the mechanical spring coefficient of the MO are coherently modulated. By analyzing the scattering matrix we find that a frequency-dependent squeezing is induced to the three subsystems only due to the coherent modulations. In the largely different cooperativities regime together with strong modulations, the mechanical mode of the MO and the Bogoliubov mode of the BEC exhibit quadrature squeezing which can surpass the so-called 3dB limit (up to 75 dB) with high robustness to the thermal noises. Surprisingly, in this regime by controlling the system and modulation parameters, a very high degree of squeezing (up to 16 dB) together with high purity of quantum state for the output cavity field is achievable. Furthermore, one can attain simultaneous strong quantum amplification, added-noise suppression, and controllable gain-bandwidth for the complementary quadratures of squeezed ones in the subsystems.
