Atomic interferometry have been widely used in precision gravity measurement. How multi-particle entanglement can be used to improve measurement precision remains a great challenge in gravimetry. We propose a compact and portable gravimetry scheme via spin-squeezed atoms in gravitationally tilted spin-dependent optical lattices. The input atomic wavepacket is coherently split into two parts by a spin-dependent shift and a subsequent $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulse. Then the two parts are held for accumulating a relative phase related to the gravity. Lastly the two parts are recombined for interference by a $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulse and a subsequent spin-dependent shift. The $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulses not only preclude the spin-dependent energies in the accumulated phase, but also avoid the error sources such as dislocation of optical lattices in the holding process. The measurement precision may beat the standard quantum limit via using spin squeezing and the uncertainty $\Delta g/g$ can be improved to $10^{-9}$ with the state-of-art experimental techniques.
