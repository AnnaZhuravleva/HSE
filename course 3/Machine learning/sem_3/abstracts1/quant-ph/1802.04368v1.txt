Recently, the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) was used to calculate the energy spectrum for a short rang three parameter central potential which was introduced by H. Bahlouli and A. D. Alhaidari. The S-orbital wave solution of the Schr\"odinger equation was obtained for different parameters of the potential. In this work a non-zero angular momentum term were introduced to the problem and the energy eigenvalues were obtained for different potential parameters. Our results show very good agreements compared with other methods such as potential parameter spectrum method (PPSM) and the complex scaling method (CSM).
