Quantum walks on graphs have been shown in certain cases to mix quadratically faster than their classical counterparts. Lifted Markov chains, consisting of a Markov chain on an extended state space which is projected back down to the original state space, also show considerable speedups in mixing time. Here, we construct a lifted Markov chain on a graph with $n^2 D(G)$ vertices that mixes exactly to the average mixing distribution of a quantum walk on the graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, where $D(G)$ is the diameter of $G$. Moreover, the mixing time of this chain is $D(G)$ timesteps, and we prove that computing the transition probabilities for the lifted chain takes time polynomial in $n$. As an immediate consequence, for every quantum walk there is a lifted Markov chain with a faster mixing time that is polynomial-time computable, as the quantum mixing time is trivially lower bounded by the graph diameter. The result is based on a lifting presented by Apers, Ticozzi and Sarlette (arXiv:1705.08253).
