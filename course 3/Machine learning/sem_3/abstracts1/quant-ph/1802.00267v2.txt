A new discrete model for energy relaxation of a quantum particle is described via a projection operator, causing the wave function collapse. Power laws for the evolution of the particle coordinate and momentum dispersions are derived. A new dissipative Schrodinger equation is proposed and solved for particular cases. A new dissipative Liouville equation is heuristically constructed.
