Recently, the quantumness of local correlations arising from separable states in the context of a Bell scenario has been studied and linked with superlocality [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 95}, 032120 (2017)]. Here we investigate the quantumness of unsteerable correlations in the context of a given steering scenario. Generalizing the concept of superlocality, we define as \textit{super-correlation}, the requirement for a larger dimension of the preshared randomness to simulate the correlations than that of the quantum states that generate them. Since unsteerable states form a subset of Bell local states, it is an interesting question whether certain unsteerable states can be super-correlated. Here, we answer this question in the affirmative. In particular, the quantumness of certain unsteerable correlations can be pointed out by the notion of \textit{super-unsteerability}, the requirement for a larger dimension of the classical variable that the steering party has to preshare with the trusted party for simulating the correlations than that of the quantum states which reproduce them. This provides a generalized approach to quantify the quantumness of unsteerable correlations in convex operational theories.
