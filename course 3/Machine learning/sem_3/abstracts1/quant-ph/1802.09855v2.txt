The full set of resonant states in double and triple quantum well/barrier structures is investigated. This includes bound, anti-bound and normal resonant states which are all eigensolutions of Schrodinger's equation with generalized outgoing wave boundary conditions. The transformation of resonant states and their transitions between different subgroups as well as the role of each subgroup in observables, such as the quantum transmission, is analyzed. The quantum well potentials are modeled by Dirac delta functions; therefore, as part of this study, the well-known problem of bound states in delta-like potentials is also revisited.
