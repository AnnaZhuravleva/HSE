We operate a multimode interferometer (MMI) integrated onto a photonic chip using pairs of narrowband photons produced from an a priori non-probabilistic source. A single 87Rb atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity provides the light-matter interface that realises the highly controllable emission of single-photons. Non-classical correlations between photon detection events show no loss of coherence when interfering pairs of these photons through the MMI in comparison to the two-photon visibility directly measured using Hong-Ou-Mandel interference on a beam splitter. This demonstrates the ability of integrated multimode circuits to mediate the entanglement of remote nodes in a quantum network interlinked by photonic qubits.
