We study the cooperation between coherent controls and noises in quantum metrology and show that such cooperation can create multiple paths for parametrization in quantum metrology, which goes beyond the standard scheme and opens new possibilities for achieving higher precision limits. We demonstrate the effect of the cooperative interplays between coherent controls and the noises through canonical examples in quantum metrology, and show that the cooperative scheme can beat the standard scheme, and in certain regimes the precision limit under the cooperative scheme with noises can surpass the ultimate precision limit of the standard scheme under the ideal unitary dynamics.
