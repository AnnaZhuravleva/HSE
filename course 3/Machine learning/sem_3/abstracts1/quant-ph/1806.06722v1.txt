We consider periodically modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with gain and loss. This model, which can be realized with current technology in photonics using waveguides, allows us to study Floquet topological insulating phase. By using Floquet theory, we find the quasi-energy spectrum of this one dimensional PT symmetric topological insulator. We show that stable Floquet topological phase exists in our model provided that oscillation frequency is large and the non-Hermitian degree is below than a critical value.
