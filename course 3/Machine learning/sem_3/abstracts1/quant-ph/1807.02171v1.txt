We compare the continuous and discrete truncated Wigner approximations - TWA and dTWA, respectively - of various spin models' dynamics to exact analytical and numerical solutions. We account for all components of spin-spin correlations on equal footing, facilitated by a recently introduced geometric correlation matrix visualization (CMV) technique. We find that the two approximations capture different aspects of the dynamics of correlations: dTWA captures periodic partial revivals of spin-spin correlations missed in the TWA; but at least for some conditions, TWA better captures the directions in which spins have correlations. We also find that at modestly short times, the dominant error in both approximations is to substantially suppress spin correlations along one direction. In addition to assessing the accuracy of approximations, our comparisons illustrate the utility of CMVs as an intuitive visual tool to understand the full complexity of spin correlations.
