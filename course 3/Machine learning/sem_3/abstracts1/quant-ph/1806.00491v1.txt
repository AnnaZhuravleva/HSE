A \emph{clock} is, from an information-theoretic perspective, a system that emits time information. One may therefore ask whether the theory of information imposes any constraints on the maximum precision of clocks. We find that, indeed, the accuracy of the time information generated by a clock is fundamentally limited by the clock's size or, more precisely, the dimension~$d$ of its quantum-mechanical state space. Furthermore, compared to a classical clock, whose evolution is restricted to stochastic jumps between $d$ perfectly distinguishable classical states, a genuine quantum clock can achieve a quadratically improved accuracy.
