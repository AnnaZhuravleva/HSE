In the paper it is argued that the Kochen-Specker theorem necessitates a conclusion that for a quantum system it is possible to find a set of projection operators which is not truth-value bivalent; that is, a bivalent truth-value assignment function imposed on such a set cannot be total. This means that at least one proposition associated with the said set must be neither true nor false.
