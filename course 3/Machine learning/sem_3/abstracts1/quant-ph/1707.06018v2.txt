Feshbach resonances, which allow for tuning the interactions of ultracold atoms with an external magnetic field, have been widely used to control the properties of quantum gases. We propose a~scheme for using scattering resonances as a probe for external fields, showing that by carefully tuning the parameters it is possible to reach a $10^{-5}$G (or nT) level of precision with a single pair of atoms. We show that for our collisional setup it is possible to saturate the quantum precision bound with a simple measurement protocol.
