Local available quantum correlations (LAQCs), as defined by Mundarain et al. [19], are analytically determined for Bell Diagonal states. Using the Kraus operators formalism [10], we analyze the dissipative dynamics of 2-qubit LAQCs under markovian decoherence. This is done for Werner states under the depolarizing [20] and phase damping channels [21]. Since Werner states are among those that exhibit the so called entanglement sudden death [27], the results are compared with the ones obtained for Quantum Discord [22], as analyzed by Werlang et al. [24], as well as for entanglement, i.e. Concurrence [7]. The LAQCs quantifier only vanishes asymptotically, as was shown to be the case for Quantum Discord, in spite of being lower.
