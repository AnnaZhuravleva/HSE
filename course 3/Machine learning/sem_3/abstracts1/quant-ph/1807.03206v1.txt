Black-box quantum state preparation is an important subroutine in quantum algorithms for simulating physical systems and other prominent quantum computer applications. The problem of black-box quantum state preparation is to prepare a desired superposition of basis states with amplitudes specified by a unitary oracle. The standard approach requires the quantum computer to do arithmetic, which is a key contributor to the complexity of state preparation. Here we present a new state preparation algorithm that avoids arithmetic, reducing the number of gates needed by orders of magnitude.
