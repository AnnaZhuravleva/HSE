We compare recently proposed different quantum simulation methods to simulate the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian for the water molecule on a quantum computer. The methods include the phase estimation algorithm based on Trotter decomposition, phase estimation algorithm based on the direct implementation of Hamiltonian, direct measurement based on the implementation of the Hamiltonian and the variational quantum eigensolver. After deriving the Hamiltonian, we first explain how each method works and then compare the simulation results in terms of the accuracy and the gate complexity for the ground state of the molecule with different O-H bond lengths. Moreover, we present the analytical analyses of the error and the gate-complexity for each method. While the required number of qubits for each method is almost the same, the number of gates and the error depend on the coefficients of the local Hamiltonians forming the Hamiltonian of the system and the desired accuracy. In conclusion, while the standard Trotter decomposition yields more accurate ground state energies for different bond lengths, the direct methods provide more efficient circuit implementations in terms of the gate complexity.
