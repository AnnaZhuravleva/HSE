Using the f-deformed oscillator formalism, we introduce two types of squeezed coherent states for a Morse potential system (Morse-like squeezed coherent states) through the following definitions: i) as approximate eigenstates of a linear combination of f-deformed ladder operators and ii) as deformed photon-subtracted coherent states. For the states thus constructed we analyze their statistical properties, their uncertainty relations, and their temporal evolution on phase space.
