In this paper, based on the notion of pseudomode framework introduced by Garraway in [Phys. Rev. A 55, 2290 (1997)], we propose a mechanism for enhancing the efficiency of excitation energy transport in a spin channel which is in contact with a Lorentzian reservoir, through the inclusion of other similar auxiliary spin chains into the reservoir. To this aim, a Lindblad-type master equation for the dynamics of the transport process is provided on the basis of pseudomode approach. It is figured out that increasing the number of auxiliary chains in the reservoir enhances the efficiency of transport or equivalently, rises the population of the reaction center attached to the end of the channel. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the mechanism has better efficiency for the channels with longer lengths.
