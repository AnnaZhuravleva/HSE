Quantum random number generator (QRNG) can produce true randomness by utilizing the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Recently, the spontaneous-emission quantum phase noise of the laser has been widely deployed for QRNG, due to its high rate, low cost and the feasibility of chip-scale integration. Here, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of phase-noise based QRNG with two independent lasers, each of which operates in either continuous-wave (CW) or pulsed mode. We implement QRNGs by operating the two lasers in three configurations, namely CW+CW, CW+pulsed and pulsed+pulsed, and demonstrate their tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses.
