Dynamical decoupling (DD) can enforce a symmetry on the dynamics of an open quantum system. Here we develop an efficient DD-based strategy to create the decoherence-free subspaces (DFSs) for a set of qubits by optimally transferring the states of these qubits. We design to transfer the state of each qubit to all of the other qubits in an optimal and efficient manner, so as to produce an effective collective-type noise for all qubits. This collective pseudo noise is essentially derived from arbitrarily independent real baths and needs only nearest-neighbor state transfers for its implementation. This scheme paves a new way to achieve the DFSs for encoding the protected logical qubits. In contrast to the previous approaches in which the number of operations needed scales exponentially with the number of qubits, our protocol however needs only operations whose number scales polynomially with the number of qubits, thus giving rise to an exponential speedup.
