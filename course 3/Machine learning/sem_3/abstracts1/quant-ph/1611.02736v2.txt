A systematic approach is given for engineering dissipative environments that steer quantum wavepackets along desired trajectories. The methodology is demonstrated with several illustrative examples: environment-assisted tunneling, trapping, effective mass assignment, and pseudo-relativistic behavior. Non-conservative stochastic forces do not inevitably lead to decoherence - we show that purity can be well-preserved. These findings highlight the flexibility offered by non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.
