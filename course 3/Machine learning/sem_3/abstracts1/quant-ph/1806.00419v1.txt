We identify a new "order parameter" for the disorder driven many-body localization (MBL) transition by leveraging artificial intelligence. This allows us to pin down the transition, as the point at which the physics changes qualitatively, from vastly fewer disorder realizations and in an objective and cleaner way than is possible with the existing zoo of quantities. Contrary to previous studies, our method is almost entirely unsupervised. A game theoretic process between neural networks defines an adversarial setup with conflicting objectives to identify what characteristic features to base efficient predictions on. This reduces the numerical effort for mapping out the phase diagram by a factor of ~100x. This approach of automated discovery is applicable specifically to poorly understood phase transitions and exemplifies the potential of machine learning assisted research in physics.
