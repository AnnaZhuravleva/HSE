Measurement Induced Nonlocality (MIN) captures nonlocal effects of a quantum state due to local von Neumann projective measurements, is a bonafide measure of quantum correlation between constituents of a composite system. In this paper, we study the dynamical behavior of entanglement (measured by concurrence), Hilber-Schmidt MIN and fidelity based MIN (FMIN) under local noisy channels such as hybrid (consists of bit, phase, bit and phase flip), generalized amplitude damping (GAD) and depolarizing channels for the initial Bell diagonal state. We observed that while sudden death of entanglement occur in hybrid and GAD channels, MIN and FMIN are more robust against such noise. Finally, we demonstrate the revival of MIN and FMIN after a dark point of time against depolarizing noise.
