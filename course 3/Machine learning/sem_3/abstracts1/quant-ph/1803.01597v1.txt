The surprising divergence of the expectation value $<\!p^6\!>$ for the square well potential is known. Here, we prove and demonstrate the divergence of $<\!p^6\!>$ in potential wells which have a finite jump discontinuity; apart from the square-well two-piece half-potentials wells are examples. These half-potential wells can be expressed as $V(x)=-U(x) \Theta(x)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. $U(x)$ are continuous and differentiable functions with minimum at $x=0$ and which may or not vanish as $x\sim \infty$.
