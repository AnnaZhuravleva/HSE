Analyzing shareability of correlations arising in any physical theory may be considered as a fruitful technique of studying the theory. Our present topic of discussion involves an analogous approach of studying quantum theory. For our purpose, we have deviated from the usual procedure of assessing monogamous nature of quantum correlations in standard Bell-CHSH scenario. We have considered correlations arising in a quantum network involving independent sources. Precisely speaking, we have analyzed monogamy of nonbilocal correlations by deriving a relation restricting marginals. Interestingly, restrictions constraining distribution of nonbilocal correlations remain same irrespective of whether inputs of the nodal observers are kept fixed(in different bilocal networks) while studying nonbilocal nature of marginal correlations.
