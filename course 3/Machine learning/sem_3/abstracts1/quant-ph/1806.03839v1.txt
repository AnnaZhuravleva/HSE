It is known that the linear n-setting steering inequalities introduced in Ref. [Nature Phys. 6, 845 (2010)] are very efficient inequalities in detecting steerability of the Werner states by using optimal measurement axes. Here, we construct chained steering inequalities that have improved visibility for the Werner states under a finite number of settings. Specifically, the threshold values of quantum violation of our inequalities for the n=4,6,10 settings are lower than those of the linear steering inequalities. Furthermore, for almost all generalized Werner states, the chained steering inequalities always have improved visibility in comparison with the linear steering inequalities.
