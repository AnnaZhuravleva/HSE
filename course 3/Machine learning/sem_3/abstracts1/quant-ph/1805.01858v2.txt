We study the sampling complexity of a probability distribution associated with an ensemble of identical non-interacting bosons undergoing quantum random walk on a one-dimensional lattice. With uniform nearest-neighboring hopping and for times logarithmic in the size of the system, one can efficiently sample the distribution. For longer times, we know of no efficient sampling algorithm. With time-dependent hopping and optimal control, we design the time evolution to approximate an arbitrary Haar-random unitary map analogous to that designed for photons in a linear optical network to yield quantum supremacy. We illustrate an experimental realization in a spinor optical lattice of ultracold atoms.
