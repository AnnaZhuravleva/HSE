Generalised quantum measurements with two outcomes are fully characterised by two real parameters, dubbed as sharpness parameter and biasedness parameter and they can be linked with different aspects of the experimental setup. It is known that precision of measurements, characterised by the sharpness parameter of the measurements, reduces the possibility of probing quantum features like violation of local-realism (LR) or macro-realism (MR). Here we investigate the effect of biasedness together with sharpness of measurement and find a trade-off between those two parameters in the context of probing violation of LR and MR. Interestingly we also find the above mentioned trade-off is more robust in the later case.
