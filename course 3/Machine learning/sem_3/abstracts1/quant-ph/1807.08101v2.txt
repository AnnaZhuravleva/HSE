\indent Recently, Choi and Kim \cite{CK} presented the superposition of the generalized W-class states and the vacuum (GW) state saturating the strong monogamy relations proposed by Regula $et$ $al.$ \cite{RMLA}, which is the first example of multiqudit states that satisfies the strong monogamy relations. This fact shows the meaning on the study of the monogamy relations for that class of states. In this article, we consider the monogamy relations for the GW states. Here we first present an analytical formula for the Tsallis-q entanglement entropy (TqEE) of the reduced density matrix of the GW state when $q\in[\frac{5-\sqrt{13}}{2},2]\cup[3,\frac{5+\sqrt{13}}{2}]$. Then we show a monogamy inequality in terms of the squared TqEE and a polygamy inequality in terms of TqEE for the reduced density matrix of the GW state when $q\in[\frac{5-\sqrt{13}}{2},2]\cup[3,\frac{5+\sqrt{13}}{2}]$. At last, we present a class of mixed states also satisfy the above properties.
