We examine the role of quantum error correction (QEC) in achieving pretty good quantum state transfer over a class of $1$-d spin Hamiltonians. Recasting the problem of state transfer as one of information transmission over an underlying quantum channel, we identify an adaptive QEC protocol that achieves pretty good state transfer. Using an adaptive recovery and approximate QEC code, we obtain explicit analytical and numerical results for the fidelity of transfer over ideal and disordered $1$-d Heisenberg chains. In the case of a disordered chain, we study the distribution of the transition amplitude, which in turn quantifies the stochastic noise in the underlying quantum channel. Our analysis helps us to suitably modify the QEC protocol so as to ensure pretty good state transfer for small disorder strengths and indicates a threshold beyond which QEC does not help in improving the fidelity of state transfer.
