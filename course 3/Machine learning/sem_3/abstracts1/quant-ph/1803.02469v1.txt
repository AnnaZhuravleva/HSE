A Poisson model for entanglement optimization in quantum repeater networks is defined in this paper. The nature-inspired multiobjective optimization framework fuses the fundamental concepts of quantum Shannon theory with the theory of evolutionary algorithms. The optimization model aims to maximize the entanglement fidelity and relative entropy of entanglement for all entangled connections of the quantum network. The cost functions are subject of a minimization defined to cover and integrate the physical attributes of entanglement transmission, purification, and storage of entanglement in quantum memories. The method can be implemented with low complexity that allows a straightforward application in future quantum Internet and quantum networking scenarios.
