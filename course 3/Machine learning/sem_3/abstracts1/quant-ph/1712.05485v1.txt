Measurement-based quantum computation (MQC) is a leading paradigm for building a quantum computer. Cluster states being used in this context act as one-way quantum computers. Here, we consider Z-states as a type of highly entangled states like cluster states, which can be used for one-way or measurement based quantum computation. We define Z-state basis as a set of orthonormal states which are as equally entangled as the cluster states. We design new quantum circuits to non-destructively discriminate these highly entangled Z-states. The proposed quantum circuits can be generalized for N-qubit quantum system. We confirm the preservation of Z-states after the performance of the circuit by quantum state tomography process.
