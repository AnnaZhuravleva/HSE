A generalized quantum Rabi Hamiltonian has emerged in the circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system where both one- and two-photon terms are included. The usual parity symmetry is broken naturally in the simultaneous presence of both couplings, which complicates its analytical treatments, even in the rotating wave approximations. In this paper, we propose an adiabatic approximation to this general model by using Bogoliubov operators, and obtain a very concise solution for both eigenvalues and eigenstates. In the wide parameter regime, the analytical results agree well with the numerical ones. In the rotating-wave approximations, we also derive the eigensolutiuon analytically, which also woks well in a wide parameter regime. Two dominate Rabi frequencies are found in the quantum Rabi oscillations of this generalized model. Our analytical results can be applicable to the recent QED system for one-photon coupling ranging from weak, ultra-strong, to deep-strong coupling regime at moderate two-photon coupling.
