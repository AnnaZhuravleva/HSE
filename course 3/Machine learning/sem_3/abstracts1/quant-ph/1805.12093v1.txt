The circuit model of quantum computation defines its logical depth or "computational time" in terms of temporal gate sequences, but the measurement-based model could allow totally different time ordering and parallelization of logical gates. We introduce a deterministic scheme of universal measurement-based computation, using only Pauli measurements on multi-qubit hypergraph states generated by the Controlled-Controlled-Z (CCZ) gates. In contrast to the cluster-state scheme where the Clifford gates are parallelizable, our scheme enjoys massive parallelization of CCZ and SWAP gates, so that the computational depth grows with the number of global applications of Hadamard gates, or, in other words, with the number of changing computational bases. An exponentially-short depth implementation of an N-times Controlled-Z gate illustrates a novel trade-off between space and time complexity.
