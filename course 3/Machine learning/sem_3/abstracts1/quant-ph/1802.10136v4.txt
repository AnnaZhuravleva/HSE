Beginning with the Everett-DeWitt many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics there have been a series of proposals for how the state vector of a quantum system might be split at any instant into orthogonal branches, each of which exhibits approximately classical behavior. Here we propose a decomposition of a state vector into branches by finding the minimum of a measure of the net quantum complexity of the branch decomposition. The net complexity depends on a parameter with units of length, the branching threshold b, which controls the cross over from quantum behavior into classical. The parameter b should in principle be measurable. We then propose a method for finding an ensemble of possible branch initial state vectors from which a randomly selected member, if evolved by ordinary Hamiltonian time evolution, will follow a single sequence of branches of many-worlds quantum mechanics. For any particular draw, the resulting deterministic system appears to exhibit random behavior as a result of the successive emergence over time of information present in the initial state but not previously observed.
