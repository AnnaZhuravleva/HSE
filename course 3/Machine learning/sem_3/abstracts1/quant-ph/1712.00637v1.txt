We show that, for a Quantum Markov Semigroup (QMS) with a faithful normal invariant state, the atomicity of the decoherence-free subalgebra and environmental decoherence are equivalent. Moreover, we characterize the set of reversible states and explicitly describe the relationship between the decoherence-free subalgebra and the fixed point subalgebra for QMSs with the above equivalent properties.
