The recent launch of the Micius quantum-enabled satellite heralds a major step forward for long-range quantum communication. Using single-photon discrete-variable quantum states, this exciting new development proves beyond any doubt that all of the quantum protocols previously deployed over limited ranges in terrestrial experiments can, in fact, be translated to global distances via the use of low-orbit satellites. In this work, we survey the imminent extension of space-based quantum communication to the continuous-variable regime - the quantum regime perhaps most closely related to classical wireless communications. The CV regime offers the potential for increased communication performance and represents the next major step forward for quantum communications and the development of the global quantum internet.
