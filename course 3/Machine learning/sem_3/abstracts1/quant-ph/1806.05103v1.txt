A new non-perturbative approach is proposed to solve time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger equations in quantum mechanics and chromodynamics (QCD). It is based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM), which was developed by the author for highly nonlinear equations since 1992 and has been widely applied in many fields. Unlike perturbative methods, this HAM-based approach has nothing to do with small/large physical parameters. Besides, convergent series solution can be obtained even if the disturbance is far from the known status. A nonlinear harmonic oscillator is used as an example to illustrate the validity of this approach for disturbances that might be more than hundreds larger than the possible superior limit of the perturbative approach. This HAM-based approach could provide us rigorous theoretical results in quantum mechanics and chromodynamics (QCD), which can be directly compared with experimental data. Obviously, this is of great benefit not only for improving the accuracy of experimental measurements but also for validating physical theories.
