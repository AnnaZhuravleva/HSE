Noncompatibility of observables, or measurements, is one of the key features of quantum mechanics, related, among others, to Heisenberg's uncertainty relations and Bell nonlocality. In this manuscript we show, however, that even though noncompatible measurements are necessary for the violation of any Bell inequality, novel, relevant Bell-like inequalities may be obtained if compatibility relations are assumed between the local measurements of one (or more) of the parties. Hence, compatibility of measurements is not necessarily a drawback and may, on the other hand, be useful for the detection of Bell nonlocality.
