Efficient simulation of quantum mechanical problems can be performed in a quantum computer where the interactions of qubits lead to the realization of various problems possessing quantum nature. Spin-Boson Model (SBM) is one of the striking models in quantum physics that enables to describe the dynamics of most of the two-level quantum systems through the bath of harmonic oscillators. Here we simulate the SBM and illustrate its applications in a biological system by designing appropriate quantum circuits for the Hamiltonian of photosynthetic reaction centers in IBM's 5-qubit quantum computer. We consider both two-level and four-level biomolecular quantum systems to observe the effect of quantum tunnelling in the reaction dynamics. We study the behaviour of tunneling by changing different parameters in the Hamiltonian of the system. The results of SBM can be applied to various two-, four- and multi-level quantum systems explicating electron transfer process.
