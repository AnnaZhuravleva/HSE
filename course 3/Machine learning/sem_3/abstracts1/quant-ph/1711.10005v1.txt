We study entanglement and nonlocality properties of two different critical random XX spin-$1/2$ chains. The first one is the usual random chain, where the coupling constants are uncorrelated random variables, while the second one is a random dimer model in which the coupling constants appear in pairs. Performing an exact numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian, we show the existence of spin pairs which violate the Bell inequality, with the probability of finding such pairs increasing with the degree of randomness. In addition, we determine the minimum degree of randomness required for nonlocality and entanglement between spin pairs, and also find the largest possible separation between them. We show that, for the usual random chain, there are entangled and nonlocal spin pairs which can be arbitrarily far from each other. Whereas, for the random dimer case, the largest separation is $9$ lattice spacings for entanglement and $1$ lattice spacing for the violation of the Bell inequality. Finally, we check the monogamy relation and the number of pairs violating the Bell inequality, verifying a monotonic growth with the degree of randomness for both models. Remarkably, for the the usual random chain model, the monogamy relation gets closer to the upper bound as the degree of randomness increases.
