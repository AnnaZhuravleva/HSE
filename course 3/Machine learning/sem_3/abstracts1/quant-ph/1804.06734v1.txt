We analyze the quantum dynamics of a two-level emitter in a resonant microcavity with optical feedback provided by a distant mirror (i.e., a half-cavity) with a focus on stabilizing the emitter-microcavity subsystem. Our treatment is fully carried out in the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Specifically, we focus on the dynamics of a perturbed dark state of the emitter to ascertain its stability (existence of time oscillatory solutions around the candidate state) or lack thereof. In particular, we find conditions under which multiple feedback modes of the half cavity contribute to the stability, showing certain analogies with the Lang-Kobayashi equations, which describe a laser diode subject to classical optical feedback.
