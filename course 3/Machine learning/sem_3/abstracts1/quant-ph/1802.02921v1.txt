Detecting and controlling nuclear spin nano-ensembles is crucial for the further development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and for the emerging solid state quantum technology. Here we present the fabrication of a $\approx$ 1 nanometre thick diamond layer consisting of $^{13}$C nuclear spins doped with Nitrogen-Vacancy centres (NV) embedded in a spin-free $^{12}$C crystal matrix. A single NV in the vicinity of the layer is used for polarization of the $^{13}$C spins and the readout of their magnetization. We demonstrate a method for coherent control of few tens of nuclear spins by using radio frequency pulses and show the basic coherent control experiments - Rabi oscillations, Ramsey spectroscopy and Hahn echo, though any NMR pulse sequence can be implemented. The results shown present a first steps towards the realization of a nuclear spin based quantum simulator.
