We explore the classical communication over quantum channels with one sender and two receivers, or with two senders and one receiver, First, for the quantum broadcast channel (QBC) and the quantum multi-access channel (QMAC), we study the classical communication assisted by non-signalling and positive-partial-transpose-preserving codes, and obtain efficiently computable one-shot bounds to assess the performance of classical communication. Second, we consider the asymptotic communication capability of communication over the QBC and QMAC. We derive an efficiently computable strong converse bound for the capacity region, which behaves better than the previous semidefinite programming strong converse bound for point-to-point channels. Third, we obtain a converse bound on the one-shot capacity region based on the hypothesis testing divergence between the given channel and a certain class of subchannels. As applications, we analyze the communication performance for some basic network channels, including the classical broadcast channels and a specific class of quantum broadcast channels.
