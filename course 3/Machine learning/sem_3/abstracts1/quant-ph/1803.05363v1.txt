We introduce a new exactly integrable potential for the Schr\"odinger equation for which the solution of the problem may be expressed in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. This is a potential step with variable height and steepness. We present the general solution of the problem, discuss the transmission of a quantum particle above the barrier, and derive explicit expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients.
