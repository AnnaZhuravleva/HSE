We propose how to create and manipulate one-way nonclassical light via photon blockade in rotating nonlinear devices. We refer to this effect as nonreciprocal photon blockade. Specifically, we show that in a spinning Kerr resonator, photon blockade can happen when the resonator is driven in one direction but not the other. This occurs because of the Fizeau-Sagnac drag, leading to a full split of the resonance frequencies of the counter-circulating modes. Different types of purely quantum correlations, such as single- and two-photon blockades, can also emerge in different directions in a well-controlled manner. We also shows how to control the transition from photon blockade to photon-induced tunneling. This proposal opens up a new route to achieve nonreciprocal quantum devices, which are important elements in e.g., chiral quantum technologies or topological photonics.
