We investigate cryptographic quantum parameter estimation with a high-dimensional system that allows only Bob (Receiver) to access the result and achieve optimal parameter precision from Alice (Sender). Eavesdropper (Eve) only can disturb the parameter estimation of Bob, but she can not obtain the information of parameter. We analyze the security and show that the high-dimensional system can help to utilize the resource to obtain better precision than the two-dimensional system. Finally, we generalize it to the case of multi-parameter.
