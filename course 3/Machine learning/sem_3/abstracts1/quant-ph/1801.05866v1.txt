In this work we study an effective three-mode model describing interacting bosons. These bosons can be considered as exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity at the magic angle. This model exhibits quantum phase transition (QPT) when the parameters of the corresponding Hamiltonian are continuously varied. The properties of the Hamiltonian spectrum (e.g., the distance between two adjacent energy levels) and the phase space structure of the thermodynamic limit of the model are used to indicate QPT. The relation between spectral properties of the Hamiltonian and the corresponding classical frame of the thermodynamic limit of the model is established as indicative of QPT . The average number of bosons in a specific mode and the entanglement properties of the ground state as functions of the parameters are used to characterize the order of the transition and also to construct a phase diagram. Finally, we verify our results for experimental data obtained for a setting of exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor microcavity.
