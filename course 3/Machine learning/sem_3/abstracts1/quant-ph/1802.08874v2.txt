We show that it is possible to realize simultaneous Raman lasing at two different frequencies using a double-$\Lambda$ system pumped by a bi-frequency field. The Raman lasers are phase-locked to one another, and the beat-frequency matches the energy difference between the two meta-stable ground states. Akin to a conventional Raman laser, the phase-locked Raman laser pair is expected to be subluminal. As such, it is expected to be highly stable against perturbations in cavity length, and have a quantum noise limited linewidth that is far below that of a conventional laser. Because of these properties, the phase-locked Raman laser pair may find important applications in precision metrology, including atomic interferometry and magnetometry. To elucidate the behavior of this laser pair, we develop an analytical model that describes the stimulated Raman interaction in a double-$\Lambda$ system using an effective 2-level transition. The approximation is valid as long as the excited states adiabatically follow the ground states, as verified by numerical simulations. The effective model is used to identify the optimal operating conditions for the bi-frequency Raman lasing process. This model may also prove useful in other potential applications of the double-$\Lambda$ system, including generation of squeezed light and spatial solitons.
