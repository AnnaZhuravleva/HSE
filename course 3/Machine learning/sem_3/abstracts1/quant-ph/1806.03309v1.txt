We study star products in phase-space quantization that are augmented to describe additional, classical effects. Two known star products are used as guides: the Husimi product of coarse-grained quantization, and a damped star product for the harmonic oscillator. Following these examples, we consider star products related by transition differential operators to the standard Weyl-Wigner-Groenewold-Moyal one. It is shown that such star products do not have an appropriate classical limit. If the transition operator depends on Planck's constant, there is no new physics in the classical limit. If it does not depend on Planck's constant, a multiplicative, rather than additive, modification of the equations of motion results. We then generalize the transition operator so that it depends on the local phase-space coordinates, as well as their derivatives. In this framework, we show that examples of physical interest are possible by constructing a Hermitian phase-space star product for the weak damping of a simple harmonic oscillator.
