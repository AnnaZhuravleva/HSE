Output entanglement is a key element in quantum information processing. Here, we show how output entanglement saturation emerges, and how to obtain optimal output entanglement between two filtered output fields in a three-mode optomechanical system. First, we obtain the expression of optimal time delay between the two filtered output fields, from which we obtain the optimal coupling for output entanglement in the case of without time delay. In this case, we find the optimal output entanglement will saturate if the driving strength is strong enough, and we give the expression of saturation value. Furthermore, we obtain the optimal output entanglement with optimal time delay. These results can be used to realize quantum information processing in cavity optomechanics.
