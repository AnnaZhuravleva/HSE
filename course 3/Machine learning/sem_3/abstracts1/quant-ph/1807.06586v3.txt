We uncover a new quantum paradox, where a simple question about two identical systems reveals surprising answers - when considering weak measurements. The paradox is reproduced using consistent histories. Our resolution of the paradox from within the weak measurement framework, which is confirmed using consistent histories, interestingly, amounts to a proof of counterfactuality of the generalised protocol for communicating an unknown qubit without sending any particles. We go on to propose a feasible implementation of this disembodied transport, based on a scheme that employs a single trapped rubidium atom, estimating resources for beating the classical limit - except that, unlike teleportation, no previously-shared entanglement nor classical communication are required. Moreover, while counterfactual communication can be intuitively explained in terms of interaction-free measurement and the Zeno effect, we show that, surprisingly, neither is necessary.
