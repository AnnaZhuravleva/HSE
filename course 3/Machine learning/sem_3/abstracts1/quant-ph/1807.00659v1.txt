Single-photon creation through parametric downconversion underpins quantum technology for quantum sensing and imaging. Here we numerically study the creation of single photons in the near- and mid-infrared regime from 1.5 - 12 um in a range of novel nonlinear semiconductor and chalcopyrite materials. We identify phase-matching conditions and single out regimes in which group-velocity matching can be achieved with commercially available pump lasers. Finally, we discuss how mid-infrared single photons can be detected. Using our numerical results, we identify materials and pump lasers for up-conversion detection in conventional wavelength bands. Our study provides a complete recipe for mid-IR single-photon generation and detection, opening up quantum enhancements for mid-IR applications such as bio-medical imaging, communication, and remote sensing.
