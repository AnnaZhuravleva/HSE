In quantum theory its action is usually taken to be real, but we can consider another theory whose action is complex. In addition, in the Feynman path integral, the time integration is usually performed over the period between the initial time $T_A$ and some specific time, say, the present time $t$. Besides such a future-not-included theory, we can consider the future-included theory, in which not only the past state $| A(T_A) \rangle$ at the initial time $T_A$ but also the future state $| B(T_B) \rangle$ at the final time $T_B$ is given at first, and the time integration is performed over the whole period from the past to the future. Thus quantum theory can be classified into four types, according to whether its action is real or not, and whether the future is included or not. We argue that, if a theory is described with a complex action, then such a theory is suggested to be the future-included theory, rather than the future-not-included theory. Otherwise persons living at different times would see different histories of the universe.
