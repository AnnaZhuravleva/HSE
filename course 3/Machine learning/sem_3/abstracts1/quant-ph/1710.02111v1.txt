The coupling of a quantum system to an external environment has been known to improve energy transport efficiency to a reaction center in certain light harvesting systems. The corresponding dynamics is often modeled by a continuous time quantum walk on a disordered structure. Thus it is natural to ask whether such environment-assisted effects can be observed for a quantum algorithm based on quantum walks. In this work, we consider the problem of quantum search of a marked node on a complete graph of $n$ nodes in the presence of static disorder, and show that coupling this system to an external environment can significantly improve the success probability of the algorithm. In particular, we demonstrate that for strong disorder, characterized by a standard deviation $\sigma$ for each site energy, the presence of a thermal bath increases the success probability from $1/(n \sigma^2)$ to at least 1/2 as the system relaxes to a steady, thermal state. Remarkably for a fixed $\sigma$, the system relaxation time decreases for higher temperatures, within a large temperature regime, but is lower bounded by the corresponding running time of quantum search in the absence of any bath. Furthermore, we discuss for what regimes of disorder and bath parameters quantum speedup is possible. This work suggests that naturally occurring open quantum system dynamics can be advantageous for analog algorithms affected by static errors.
