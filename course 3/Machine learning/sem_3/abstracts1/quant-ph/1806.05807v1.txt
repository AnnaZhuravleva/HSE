We propose a method to verify quantum steering for two qubit states with an arbitrary amount of null measurement outcomes when both steering and steered parties cannot be trusted. We modify a score function that it may depend on the measurement efficiencies of both parties, the number of symmetrically placed measurement settings, and imperfection of the state preparation. The steering bound proposed in a recent work [Phys. Rev. X $2$,031003 (2012)] plays an important role in our score function; thus, similarly, for null measurement outcomes obtained by the steering party with the ratio $1-\eta$, the steering can be verified using the number of different measurement settings larger than $1/\eta$ and maximally steerable states. Furthermore, we show that, for null measurement outcomes at the steered party, the ratio of null measurement outcomes does not affect steerability unless it is $1$. Our result will be helpful to enable loss-tolerant and device-independent steering tasks.
