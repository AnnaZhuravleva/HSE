We propose and demonstrate a quantum control scheme for hybrid quantum registers that can reduce the operation time, and therefore the effects of relaxation, compared to existing implementations. It combines resonant excitation pulses with periods of free precession under the internal Hamiltonian of the qubit system. We use this scheme to implement quantum gates like controlled-NOT operations on electronic and nuclear spins of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. As a specific application, we transfer population between electronic and nuclear spin qubits and use it to measure the Rabi oscillations of a nuclear spin in a system with multiple coupled spins.
