Vaidman has proposed a controversial criterion for determining the past of a single quantum particle based on the "weak trace" it leaves. We here consider more general examples of entangled systems and analyze the past of single, as well as pairs of entangled pre- and postselected particles. Systems with non-trivial time evolution are also analyzed. We argue that in these cases, examining only the single-particle weak trace provides information which is insufficient for understanding the system as a whole. We therefore suggest to examine, alongside with the past of single particles, also the past of pairs, triplets and eventually the entire system, including higher-order, multipartite traces in the analysis. This resonates with a recently proposed top-down approach by Aharonov, Cohen and Tollaksen for understanding the structure of correlations in pre- and postselected systems.
