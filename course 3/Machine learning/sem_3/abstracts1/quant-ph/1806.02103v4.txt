An exact analytical treatment of the dynamical problem for time-dependent 2x2 pseudo-hermitian su(1,1) Hamiltonians is reported. A class of exactly solvable and physically transparent new scenarios are identified within both classical and quantum contexts. Such a class is spanned by a positive parameter $\nu$ that allows to distinguish two different dynamical regimes. Our results are usefully employed for exactly solving a classical propagation problem in a guided wave optics scenario. The usefulness of our procedure in a quantum context is illustrated by defining and investigating the su(1,1) "Rabi" scenario bringing to light analogies and differences with the standard su(2) Rabi model. Our approach, conjugated with the generalized von Neumann equation describing open quantum systems through non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, succeeds in evidencing that the $\nu$-dependent passage from a real to a complex energy spectrum is generally unrelated to the existence of the two dynamical regimes.
