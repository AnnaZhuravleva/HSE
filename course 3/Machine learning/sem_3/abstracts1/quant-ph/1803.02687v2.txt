Because quantum measurements have probabilistic outcomes they can appear to violate conservation laws in individual experiments. In this note I argue that if wave function collapse is assumed to be induced by measurement interactions then it can be shown to be consistent with the global conservation of quantities such as momentum, energy, and angular momentum, when the computation of these quantities is taken over all relevant interacting systems, and pre-existing entanglement relations of the measured system are properly taken into account. The demonstrations by Gemmer and Mahler[1], and by Durt[2], that entanglement is a generic result of interaction are central to the argument. The implications for various views on the fundamental nature of quantum measurement processes are briefly examined.
