Accurate state preparation, a key requirement for quantum technology, is often carried out with external controls. In order to obtain maximum performance, the pulse shape of the controls can be derived using optimal control theory, by minimizing a suitable performance measure. Care needs to be taken when defining the performance measure for non-pure target states. Visualizing the open system dynamics on the Bloch sphere, we construct an optimization functional that seeks to independently match Bloch vector angle and length of the target state. We employ the ensuing optimization framework to maximize squeezing of an optomechanical oscillator at finite temperature and find that shaping the cavity drives can significantly speed up squeezed state preparation.
