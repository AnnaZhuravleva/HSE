We discuss the Schwinger mechanism in the presence of an additional uniformly oriented, weak super Gaussian of integer order $4N+2$. Using the worldline approach, we determine the relevant critical points to compute the leading order exponential factor analytically. Already for $N=2$, we find a much stronger dynamical enhancement compared to a weak contribution of Sauter type. For higher orders, specifically for $N \rightarrow \infty$, we approach the Lorentzian case. Although such backgrounds significantly differ in Minkowski spacetime, the found coincidence applies due to identical reflection points in the instanton plane. We also treat the background in perturbation theory and show that the order parameter $N$ determines whether the weak contribution behaves perturbatively or nonperturbatively.
