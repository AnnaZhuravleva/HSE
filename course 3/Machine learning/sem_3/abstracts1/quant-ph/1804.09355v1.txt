We establish nonclassicality of light as a resource for quantum metrology that is strictly quantifiable based on a quantum resource theory. We first demonstrate that every multimode pure state with negativity in the Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution provides metrological enhancement over all classical states in parameter estimation with respect to a collective quadrature operator. We then show that this metrological power serves as a measure of nonclassicality based on a quantum resource theory for multimode optical states, where the measure is a monotone under linear optics elements including phase shifters, beam splitters, and displacement operators. Our study further implies that nonclassicality quantified by the metrological power is identical to the degree of macroscopic superpositions, namely, quantum macroscopicity.
