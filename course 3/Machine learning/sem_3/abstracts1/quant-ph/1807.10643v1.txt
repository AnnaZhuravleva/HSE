Quantum autoencoders allow for reducing the amount of resources in a quantum computation by mapping the original Hilbert space onto a reduced space with the relevant information. Recently, it was proposed to employ approximate quantum adders to implement quantum autoencoders in quantum technologies. Here, we carry out the experimental implementation of this proposal in the Rigetti cloud quantum computer employing up to three qubits. The experimental fidelities are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, thus proving the feasibility to realize quantum autoencoders via quantum adders in state-of-the-art superconducting quantum technologies.
