High-fidelity control of qubits requires precisely tuned control parameters. Typically, these parameters are found through a series of bootstrapped calibration experiments which successively acquire more accurate information about a physical qubit. However, optimal parameters are typically different between devices and can also drift in time, which begets the need for an efficient calibration strategy. Here, we introduce a framework to understand the relationship between calibrations as a directed graph. With this approach, calibration is reduced to a graph traversal problem that is automatable and extensible.
