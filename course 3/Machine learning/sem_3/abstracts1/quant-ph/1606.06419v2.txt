We perform a theoretical study on quantum correlations in an optomechanical system where the mechanical mirror is perturbatively coupled to an auxiliary qubit. In our study, we consider logarithmic negativity to quantify the degree of stationary entanglement between the cavity field and mechanical mirror, and, Gaussian quantum discord as an witness of the quantumness of the correlation beyond entanglement. Utilizing experimentally feasible parameters, we show that both entanglement and quantum discord enhance significantly with increase in mirror-qubit coupling. Moreover, we find that in presence of the mirror-qubit coupling entanglement could be generated at a considerably lower optomechanical coupling strength, which is also extremely robust against the environmental temperature. Overall, our proposed scheme offers some considerable advantages for realizing the continuous-variable quantum information and communication.
