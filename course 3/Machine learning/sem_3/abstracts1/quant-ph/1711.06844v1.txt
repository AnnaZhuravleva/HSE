The coupling of atomic arrays and one-dimensional subwavelength waveguides gives rise to in- teresting photon transport properties, such as recent experimental demonstrations of large Bragg reflection and paves the way for a variety of potential applications in the field of quantum non-linear optics. Here, we present a theoretical analysis for the process of single-photon scattering in this configuration using a full microscopic approach. Based on this formalism, we analyze the spectral dependencies for different scattering channels from either ordered or disordered arrays. The de- veloped approach is entirely applicable for a single-photon scattering from a quasi-one-dimensional array of multilevel atoms with degenerate ground state energy structure. Our approach provides an important framework for including not only Rayleigh but also Raman channels in the microscopic description of the cooperative scattering process.
