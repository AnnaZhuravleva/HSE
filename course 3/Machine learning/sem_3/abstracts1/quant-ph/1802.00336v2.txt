We provide a generalization for the polygamy constraint of multiparty entanglement in arbitrary dimensional quantum systems. By using the $\beta$th-power of entanglement of assistance for $0\leq \beta \leq1$ and the Hamming weight of the binary vector related with the distribution of subsystems, we establish a class of weighted polygamy inequalities of multiparty entanglement in arbitrary dimensional quantum systems. We further show that our class of weighted polygamy inequalities can even be improved to be tighter inequalities with some conditions on the assisted entanglement of bipartite subsystems.
