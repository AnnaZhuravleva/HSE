In the paper, the idea of describing not-yet-verified properties of quantum objects with logical many-valuedness is scrutinized. As it is argued, to promote such an idea, the following two foundational problems of many-valued quantum logic must be decided: the problem of choosing a proper system of many-valued logic and the problem of the emergence of bivalence from logical many-valuedness. Difficulties accompanying solutions of these problems are discussed.
