Quantum phases of matter have many relevant applications in quantum computation and quantum information processing. Current experimental feasibilities in diverse platforms allow us to couple two or more subsystems in different phases. In this letter, we investigate the situation where one couples two domains of a periodically-driven spin chain where one of them is ergodic while the other is fully localized. By combining tools of both graph and Floquet theory, we show that the localized domain remains stable for strong disorder, but as this disorder decreases the localized domain becomes ergodic.
