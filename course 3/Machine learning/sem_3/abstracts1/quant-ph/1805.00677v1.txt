We proposed the general concept of quantum antenna in the strong coupling regime. It is based on the theory of open quantum systems. The antenna emission to the space is considered as an interaction with the thermal photonic reservoir. For modeling of the antenna dynamics is formulated a master equation with the correspondent Lindblad super-operators as the radiation terms. It is shown that strong coupling dramatically changes the radiation pattern of antenna. The total power pattern splits to three partial components; each corresponds to the spectral line of Mollow triplet. We analyzed the dependence of splitting from the length of antenna, shift of the phase, and Rabi-frequency. The predicted effect opens a way for implementation of multi-beam electrically tunable antennas, potentially useful in different nano-devices.
