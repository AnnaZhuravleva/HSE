We investigate theoretically the ground-state property of a two-dimensional array of superconducting circuits including the on-site superconducting qubits (SQs) with weak anharmonicity. In particular, we analyse the influence of this anharmonicity on the Mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition. The complete ground-state phase diagrams are presented under the mean field approximation. Interestingly, the anharmonicity of SQs affects the Mott lobes enormously, and the single excitation Mott lobe disappears when the anharmonicity become zero. Our results can be used to guide the implementations of quantum simulations using the superconducting circuits, which have nice integrating and flexibility.
