In this paper, we solve the D-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation with hyperbolic Poschl-Teller potential plus a generalized ring-shaped potential. After the separation of variable in the hyperspherical coordinate. We used Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method to solve the resulting radial equation and obtain explicitly the energy level and the corresponding wave function in closed form. The solutions to the angular part are solved using the NU approach as well.
