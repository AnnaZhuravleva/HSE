In this article, we continue our investigation on the role of non-commutativity in quantum theory. Using the method explained in "On non-commutativity in quantum theory (I): from classical to quantum probability", we analyze two toy models which exhibit non-commutativity between the corresponding position and velocity random variables. In particular, using ordinary probability theory, we study the kinematics of a point-like particle jumping at random over a discrete random space. We show that, after the removal of the random space from the model, the position and velocity of the particle do not commute, when represented as operators on the same Hilbert space.
