Van der Waals forces are ubiquitous across the sciences, being critical to adhesion, friction and the stability of colloids. The interaction has the same origin as Casimir forces, meaning it can be understood in terms of the exchange of virtual photons between atoms or molecules. Such an interaction usually pulls the interacting particles together, and in some special circumstances can push them apart. However, no method for engineering the van der Waals force to be perpendicular to the inter-particle separation vector has been predicted or observed. Here we show that such a force can exist in realistic laboratory conditions, by inducing a circular dipole moment in one of the atoms. The mechanism is similar to the spin-orbit coupling that leads to lateral atom-surface forces, but here the angular momentum in a single excited atom leads to a torque acting on the two-atom system. The forces predicted here provide a new tool for optomechanical manipulation of bound systems which will have far-reaching relevance across micro and nano electromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), as well as in colloidal and atomic physics.
