We study the dynamics of microscopic quantum correlations, viz., bipartite entanglement and quantum discord, in Ising spin chain with periodically varying external magnetic field along the transverse direction. Depending upon system parameters, local quantum correlations in the evolved states of such systems may get saturated to non-zero values after sufficiently large number of driving cycles. Moreover, we investigate convergence of the local density matrices, from which the quantum correlations under study originate, towards the final steady-state density matrices as a function of driving cycles. We find that the geometric distance between the non-equilibrium and the steady-state reduced density matrices obey power-law scaling. The steady-state quantum correlations corresponding to various initial states in thermal equilibrium are studied as a function of drive time period of a square pulsed field. The steady-state quantum correlations are marked by presence of peaks in the frequency domain. The steady-state features can be further understood by probing band structures of Floquet Hamiltonian. Finally, we compare the steady state values of the local quantum correlations under study with that of the canonical Gibbs ensemble and infer about canonical ergodic properties. We find that depending upon the quantum phases of the initial state and the pathway of the driving Hamiltonian, quantum correlations may go through (canonical) ergodic to (canonical) non-ergodic transitions in the frequency domain.
