Since the introduction of quantum mechanics, it has been taught mostly as a theoretical subject. It is also viewed as a theory that provides a best understanding of the nature, but which does not have much practical applications in our day to day life. This notion has been considerably changed in the recent past with the advent of quantum information processing. Further, recently, IBM has introduced a set of quantum computers that are placed in the cloud and can be accessed freely from your class room though your mobile phones, PCs, Laptops having an internet connection. In this article, we will show that the IBM quantum computer can be used to demonstrate many fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum computing and communication.
