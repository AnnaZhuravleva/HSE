Quantum cellular automata are important tools in understanding quantum dynamics, thanks to their simple and effective list of rules. Here we investigate explicitly how coherence is built and lost in the evolution of one-dimensional automata subject to noise. Our analysis illustrates the interplay between unitary and noisy dynamics, and draws considerations on their behaviour in the pseudo-frequency domain.
