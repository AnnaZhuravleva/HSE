Quantum computing allows for the potential of significant advancements in both the speed and the capacity of widely-used machine learning techniques. Here we employ quantum algorithms for the Hopfield network, which can be used for pattern recognition, reconstruction, and optimization as a realization of a content addressable memory system. We show that an exponentially large network can be stored in a polynomial number of quantum bits by encoding the network into the amplitudes of quantum states. By introducing a new classical technique for operating the Hopfield network, we can leverage quantum algorithms to obtain a quantum computational complexity that is logarithmic in the dimension of the data. This potentially yields an exponential speed-up in comparison to classical approaches. We also present an application of our method as a genetic sequence recognizer.
