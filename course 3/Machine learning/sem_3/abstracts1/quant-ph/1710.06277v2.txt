Complex space-time has proven useful in general relativity, and in Bohmian mechanics. Complexified Lienard-Wiechert potentials simplify the mathematics of Kerr-Newman particles. Here we constrain them to move along Bohmian trajectories. A covariant theory is used to generate them. A tractable Gaussian wave is analyzed in detail. The trajectory is multi-valued in the world-time variable. An extension of analytic continuation that adds different Riemann sheets of a function together with complex weighting factors is applied. Whereas there are only two Bohmian trajectories connected by standard analytic continuation, there are an infinite number of trajectories that are connected by this generalized analytic continuation (GAN). Moreover, all of them can be derived from just a single one by applying GAN to it. This is suggestive of wave-particle duality. Maxwell's equations in complex space-time are different in that rather than a single retarded time solution contributing in a field calculation for a timelike trajectory in real space-time, there are multiple null roots. In the Bohmian case there are an infinite number of retarded times associated with a single trajectory through the GAN continuation, and when one adds up their contribution weighted naturally by the Bohmian weighting factors, one finds the total radiated power goes to zero for a free particle. This is a major improvement over traditional Bohm models where free charged particles would radiate if coupled classically. It is also found that the effective charge density of the point particle becomes extended over a volume by this procedure, and thus the electromagnetic self-energy of a point particle can be finite. Some implications of these results are discussed.
