Prompted by the open questions in Gibilisco [Int. J. Software Informatics, 8(3-4): 265, 2014], in which he introduced a family of measurement-induced quantum uncertainty measures via metric adjusted skew informations, we investigate these measures' fundamental properties (including basis independence and spectral representation), and illustrate their applications to detect quantum nonlocality and entanglement.
