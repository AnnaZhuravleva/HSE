Temporal modes (TM) are a new basis for storage and retrieval of quantum information in states of light. The full TM manipulation toolkit requires a practical quantum pulse gate (QPG), which is a device that unitarily maps any given TM component of the optical input field onto a different, easily separable subspace or degree of freedom. An ideal QPG must "separate" the selected TM component with unit efficiency, whilst avoiding crosstalk from orthogonal TMs. All attempts at implementing QPGs in pulsed-pump traveling-wave systems have been unable to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This is due to a known selectivity limit in processes that rely on spatio-temporally local, nonlinear interactions between pulsed modes traveling at independent group velocities. This limit is a consequence of time ordering in the quantum dynamical evolution, which is predicted to be overcome by coherently cascading multiple stages of low-efficiency, but highly TM-discriminatory QPGs. Multi-stage interferometric quantum frequency conversion in nonlinear waveguides was first proposed for precisely this purpose. TM-nonselective cascaded frequency conversion, also called optical Ramsey interferometry, has recently been demonstrated with continuous-wave (CW) fields. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of TM-selective optical Ramsey interferometry and show a significant enhancement in TM selectivity over single-stage schemes.
