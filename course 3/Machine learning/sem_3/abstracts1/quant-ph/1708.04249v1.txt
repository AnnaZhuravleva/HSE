We show that wireless quantum broadcasting through relativistic quantum fields is impacted by geometry in nontrivial ways that can be traced to the no-cloning principle. To study these phenomena, we extend the framework of models usually employed in the field of relativistic quantum information to allow for the non-perturbative description of, e.g., quantum state transfer. We consider, in particular, the case of 1+1 spacetime dimensions, which already allows a number of interesting scenarios, pointing to, for example, new protocols for quantum secret sharing.
