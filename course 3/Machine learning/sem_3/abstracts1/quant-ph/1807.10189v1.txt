We study the transport of energy through a microscopic network of coupled harmonic oscillators, where energy is injected at one end and extracted at the other end with finite rates. We evaluate the resulting energy currents under the influence of both thermal and quantum noise and describe various transport phenomena that arise from the competition between coherent and incoherent processes and the presence of nonlinear saturation effects. Specifically, we show that such networks exhibit a non-equilibrium phase transition between a noise-dominated and a coherent transport regime. This transition is associated with the formation and breaking of spatial symmetries, which is identified as a generic mechanism that affects many transport properties of active networks. Therefore, our findings have important practical consequences for the distribution of energy over coherent microwave, optical or phononic channels, in particular close to or at the quantum limit.
