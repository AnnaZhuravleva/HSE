Heat rectifiers are systems that conduct heat asymmetrically for forward and reversed temperature gradients. Here, we present an analytical study of heat rectification in linear quantum systems. We demonstrate that asymmetric heat currents can be induced in a linear system only if it is dynamically driven. The rectification can be further enhanced, even achieving maximal performance, by detuning the oscillators of the driven network. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of such driven harmonic network to work as a thermal transistor, quantifying its efficiency through the dynamical amplification factor.
