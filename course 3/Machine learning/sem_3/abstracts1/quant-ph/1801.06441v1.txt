In this work, the analytical solutions of the $D$-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation are studied in great detail for the Wood-Saxon potential by taking advantage of the Pekeris approximation. Within a novel improved scheme to surmount centrifugal term, the energy eigenvalues and corresponding radial wave functions are found for any angular momentum case within the context of the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) and Supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSYQM) methods. In this way, based on these methods, the same expressions are obtained for the energy eigenvalues, and the expression of radial wave functions transformed each other is demonstrated. In addition, a finite number energy spectrum depending on the depth of the potential $V_{0}$, the radial $n_{r}$ and orbital $l$ quantum numbers and parameters $D, a, R_{0}$ are defined as well.
