Most electromechanical devices are in two-dimensional metallic drums under high tensile stress, which causes increased mechanical frequency and quality factor. However, high mechanical frequencies lead to small zero-point displacements $x_{\rm zp}$, which limits the single-photon interaction rate $g_0$. For applications which demand large $g_0$, any design with increased $x_{\rm zp}$ is desirable. It is shown that a patterned drum by spiral shape can resolve this difficulty, which is obtained by a reduction of mechanical frequency while the motion mass is kept almost constant. An order of magnitude increase in $g_0$, and agreement between simulations and interferometric measurements is observed.
