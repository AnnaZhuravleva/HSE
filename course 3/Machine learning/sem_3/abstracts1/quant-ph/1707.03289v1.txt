We start from a seven parameters (six continuous and one discrete) family of non-central exactly solvable potential in three dimensions and construct a wide class of ten parameters (six continuous and four discrete) family of rationally extended exactly solvable non-central real as well as PT symmetric complex potentials. The energy eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of these extended non-central potentials are obtained explicitly and it is shown that the wave eigenfunctions of these po- tentials are either associated with the exceptional orthogonal polynomials (EOPs) or some type of new polynomials which can be further re-expressed in terms of the corresponding classical orthogonal polynomials. Similarly, we also construct a wide class of rationally extended exactly solvable non-central real as well as complex PT-invariant potentials in two dimensions.
