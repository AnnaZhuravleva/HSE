Detecting quantumness of correlations (especially entanglement) is a very hard task even in the simplest case i.e. two-partite quantum systems. Here we provide an analysis whether there exists a relation between two most popular types of entanglement identifiers: the first one based on positive maps and not directly applicable in laboratory and the second one --- geometric entanglement identifier which is based on specific Hermiticity-preserving maps. We show a profound relation between those two types of entanglement criteria. Hereunder we have proposed a general framework of nonlinear functional entanglement identifiers which allows us to construct new experimentally friendly entanglement criteria.
