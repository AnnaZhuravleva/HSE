One of the limitation of continuous variable quantum key distribution is relatively short transmission distance of secure keys. In order to overcome the limitation, some solutions have been proposed such as reverse reconciliation, trusted noise concept, and non-Gaussian operation. In this paper, we propose a protocol using photon subtraction at receiver which utilizes synergy of the aforementioned properties. By simulations, we show performance of the proposed protocol outperforms other conventional protocols. We also find the protocol is more efficient in a practical case. Finally, we provide a guide for provisioning a system based on the protocol through an analysis for noise from a channel.
