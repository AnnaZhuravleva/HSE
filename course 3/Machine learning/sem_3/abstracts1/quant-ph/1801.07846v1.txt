We examine the various properties of the three four-qubit monogamy relations, all of which introduce the power factors in the three-way entanglement to reduce the tripartite contributions. On the analytic ground as much as possible we try to find the minimal power factors, which make the monogamy relations hold if the power factors are larger than the minimal powers. Motivated to the three-qubit monogamy inequality we also examine whether those four-qubit monogamy relations provide the SLOCC-invariant four-way entanglement measures or not. Our analysis indicate that this is impossible provided that the monogamy inequalities are derived merely by introducing weighting power factors.
