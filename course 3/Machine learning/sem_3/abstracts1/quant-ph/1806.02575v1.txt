Quantum computers form a technological cluster with huge growth in the last few years. Although this technology is of still very limited size: perhaps the reason it is not seen as a technology which may be mass produced or of public use in the near future: it is one of the most promising developments with a potential to change the world. The IBM Quantum Experience Platform makes it possible for every person around the world, without limitation as to geographical location, to get acquainted with the technology of quantum computing. It is a resource for both researchers and enthusiasts entering the quantum world. With the development of the platform, IBM has proven that the programming and writing code executable on a quantum computer can be easy and accessible (it is a cloud platform) even to people lacking any deep knowledge of quantum mechanics. The construction of the Controlled Square Root of Z gate is achieved using only existing predefined gates in the Composer tool. This newly created gate could be used for further work on quantum algorithms and opens a new feasible way to write quantum code.
