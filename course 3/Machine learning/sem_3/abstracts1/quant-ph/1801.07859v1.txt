An explicit algorithm for the travelling salesman problem is constructed in the framework of adiabatic quantum computation, AQC. The initial Hamiltonian for the AQC process admits canonical coherent states as the ground state, and the target Hamiltonian has the shortest tour as the desirable ground state. Some estimates/bounds are also given for the computational complexity of the algorithm with particular emphasis on the required energy resources, besides the space and time complexity, for the physical process of (quantum) computation in general.
