We demonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, the generation of hexapartite modal entanglement by the optical parametric oscillator (OPO) operating above the oscillation threshold. We show that the OPO generates a rich structure of entanglement among sets of six optical sideband modes interacting through the non-linear crystal. The class of quantum states thus produced can be controlled by a single parameter, the power of the external laser that pumps the system. Our platform allows for the generation of massive entanglement among many optical modes with well defined but vastly different frequencies, potentially bridging nodes of a multicolor quantum network.
