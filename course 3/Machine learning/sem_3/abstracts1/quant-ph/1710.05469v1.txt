We consider crystal chirp effects on SPDC when pumping at 800 nm. The typical distribution produced in frequency-momentum space is a pop tab-like structure which turns out to be suitable for the implementation of versatile light sources. Our analyzes consider the effect of internal and external parameters in the process; in the former we include the crystal chirp and length, while in the latter temperature, as well as pump chirp and beam properties. We report evidence of the appropriateness of SPDC from chirped crystals to manipulate the frequency and transverse momentum properties of the light produced. We briefly comment on potential usefulness of the types of light produced, in particular for quantum information applications.
