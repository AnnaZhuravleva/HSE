We propose an efficient free-space scheme to create single photons in a well-defined spatio-temporal mode. To that end, we first prepare a single source atom in an excited Rydberg state. The source atom interacts via dipole-dipole exchange with an optically dense atomic ensemble. Using adiabatic passage mediated by a chirped laser pulse, we produce a spatially-extended spin-wave of a single Rydberg excitation in the ensemble, accompanied by the transition of the source atom to another Rydberg state. The collective atomic excitation can then be converted to a propagating optical photon via a coherent coupling field. In contrast to previous approaches, our single-photon source does not rely on strong coupling of a single emitter to a resonant cavity, nor does it require heralding of collective excitation or complete Rydberg blockade of multiple excitations in the atomic ensemble.
