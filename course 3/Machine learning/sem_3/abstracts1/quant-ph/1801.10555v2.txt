We present the experimental observation of light with ideal thermal statistics generated in a warm atomic vapor. Statistical properties of the generated light field are tested both by the direct measurement of second-order correlation function and by the detailed analysis of photon number distribution, which certifies the quality of the Bose-Einstein statistics generated by natural physical mechanism. We further demonstrate the extension of spectral bandwidth of the generated light to hundreds of MHz domain while keeping the ideal thermal statistics, which suggests a direct applicability of the presented source in a broad range of applications including optical metrology, quantum imaging, tests of robustness of quantum communication protocols, or quantum thermodynamics.
