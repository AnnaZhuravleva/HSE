In this article we study the thermal quantum correlations in tripartite atomic system under the existence of Herring-Flicker coupling among the atoms. Topologically different arrangements of three atom system is considered differing in their coupling pattern. These configurations are well known in classical networking theory. Quantum analogue of these configurations are found to play an important role in the design of quantum data buses that can transfer the quantum states to establish quantum communication. We specifically study the thermal pairwise quantum correlations in these topologies with Herring-Flicker coupling and found that atoms can be maximally entangled or quantum mechanically correlated in a controlled manner depending on the arrangement of atoms. It is observed that asymmetrically arranged atomic systems are more strongly entangled as compared to the symmetrically arranged one, with the quantum correlations are being unity for a particular set of parameters. Thus, these systems will be propitious for various quantum protocols such as secure communication, quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution etc.
