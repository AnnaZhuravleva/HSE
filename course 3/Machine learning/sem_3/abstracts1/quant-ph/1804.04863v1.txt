In this article we make a comparison between the behavior of entanglement and quantum degree of polarization for a special class of states of the radiation field, namely the Bell-type diagonal mixed states. For the three-photon mixed states we have plotted the concurrence and the Chernoff quantum degree of polarization in terms of the parameter, which defines the state. We find the the entanglement and the quantum degree of polarization are incomparable measures.
