The complex interactions between orbital angular momentum (OAM) light and atoms are particularly intriguing in the areas of quantum optics and quantum information science, allowing us to construct OAM based applications, including quantum memory, quantum cryptography, quantum sensing and etc. In the previous works, it is difficult to achieve asymmetric OAM quantum interface between photon and memory, thus restricting the breakthrough of extending OAM applications in the quantum information field. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum wrench, a method of freely generating asymmetric quantum interface between a photon and a memory in OAM space. With twisted fields of pumping, the correlated OAM distribution between emitted photon and the spin wave can be encoded versatilely, and stretched in radial direction. By this method, the quantum interface can be multiplexed and can work in high-quanta scenario with capability of l=30, and we demonstrate the entanglement within 2-D subspace with a fidelity of 80.5+/-4.8%. Such state of the art technology to wrench OAM memory in quantum regime is very helpful to construct high-dimensional quantum networks and provides a benchmark in the field of actively developing methods to engineer OAM single photon from matters.
