The modular valued operator $\widehat{V}_m$ of the von Neumann interaction operator for a projector is defined. The properties of $\widehat{V}_m$ are discussed and contrasted with those of the standard modular value of a projector. The associated notion of a faux qubit is introduced and its possible utility in quantum computation is noted. An experimental implementation of $\widehat{V}_m$ is also highlighted.
