An infinite sequence of potential well functions is considered. A numerical method is used for the Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation to obtain the energy eigenvalue spectra for a number of these potential well functions. The results for the ground state energy are compared to a trial function method. The energy eigenvalue spectra are as one would expect although most of them have not been previously reported.
