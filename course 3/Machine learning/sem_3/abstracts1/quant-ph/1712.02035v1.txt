Gaussian noise induced by loss on Gaussian states may be corrected by distributing EPR entanglement through the loss channel, purifying the entanglement using a noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) and then using it for continuous-variable teleportation of the input state. Linear optical implementations of the NLA unavoidably introduce small amounts of excess noise and detection and source efficiency will be limited in current implementations. In this paper, we analyze the error-correction protocol with non-unit efficiency sources and detectors and show the excess noise may be partially compensated by adjusting the classical gain of the teleportation protocol. We present a strong case for the potential of demonstrable error-correction with current technology.
