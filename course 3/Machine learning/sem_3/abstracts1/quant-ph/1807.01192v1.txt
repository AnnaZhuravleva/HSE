Axiomatic definitions of Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) are foundational in discrete space-time models of physics. Templates of axiomatic QCA serve as primary points of investigations concerning properties, structural results, and classes of QCA that are potentially significant for quantum algorithms and simulations. We examine, from a representation theory standpoint, the relation between the templates corresponding to the Schr\"{o}dinger and the Heisenberg pictures of evolution for QCA over finite, unbounded configurations.
