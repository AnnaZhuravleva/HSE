In order to model realistic quantum devices it is necessary to simulate quantum systems strongly coupled to their environment. To date, most understanding of open quantum systems is restricted either to weak system-bath couplings, or to special cases where specific numerical techniques become effective. Here we present a novel general numerical approach to efficiently describe the time evolution of a quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our method by numerically identifying the localisation transition of the Ohmic spin-boson model, and considering a model with widely separated environmental timescales arising for a pair of spins embedded in a common environment.
