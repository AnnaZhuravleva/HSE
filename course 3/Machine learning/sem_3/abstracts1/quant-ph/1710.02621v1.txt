We study the entanglement generated in the steady state of two interacting qubits coupled to thermal reservoirs. We show that the amount of steady-state entanglement can be enhanced by the presence of a third thermal reservoir which is common to both qubits. Specifically, we find that entanglement can be enhanced as long as the temperature of the common reservoir is below the thermalisation temperature of the qubits, whenever a single temperature can be assigned to the steady state of the qubits in the absence of the common reservoir. Moreover, the amount of entanglement generated with the common reservoir present can be significantly larger than that which can be obtained without it for any temperature of the individual reservoirs. From the perspective of thermodynamics, we find that enhancement of entanglement is associated with heat absorption by the common reservoir. We propose a possible implementation of our scheme in superconducting circuits and find that a significant enhancement of steady-state entanglement should be observable under experimentally realistic conditions.
