According to Feynman, we should make nature to be quantum mechanical to simulate it better. Simulating quantum systems in a computer had been remained a challenging problem to tackle mainly in case of a large quantum system. However, Feynman's 1982 conjecture that 'physics can be simulated using a quantum computer other than using a Turing machine or a classical computer' has been proved to be correct. It is widely known that quantum computers have superior power as compared to classical computers in efficiently simulating quantum systems. Here we report the experimental realization of quantum tunneling through different types of potential barriers for a single particle by simulating it in the IBM quantum computer, which here acts as a universal quantum simulator. We take two-qubit and three-qubit systems for visualizing the tunneling process illustrating the true quantum nature. We clearly observe the tunneling phenomena in step potential, double-well potential and multi-well potential by our experimental results. The quantum simulation techniques used here can be extended to observe tunneling phenomena for multi-particle systems.
