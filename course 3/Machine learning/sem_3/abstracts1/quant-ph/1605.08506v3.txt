A fundamental question in linear optical quantum computing is to understand the origin of the quantum supremacy in the physical system. It is found that the multimode linear optical transition amplitudes are calculated through the permanents of transition operator matrices, which is a hard problem for classical simulations (boson sampling problem). We can understand this problem by considering a quantum measure that directly determines the runtime for computing the transition amplitudes. In this paper, we suggest a quantum measure named "Fock state concurrence sum" $C_S$, which is the summation over all the members of "the generalized Fock state concurrence" (a measure analogous to the generalized concurrences of entanglement and coherence). By introducing generalized algorithms for computing the transition amplitudes of the Fock state boson sampling with an arbitrary number of photons per mode, we show that the minimal classical runtime for all the known algorithms directly depends on $C_S$. Therefore, we can state that \emph{the Fock state concurrence sum $C_S$ behaves as a collective measure that controls the computational complexity of Fock state BS}. We expect that our observation on the role of the Fock state concurrence in the generalized algorithm for permanents would provide a unified viewpoint to interpret the quantum computing power of linear optics.
