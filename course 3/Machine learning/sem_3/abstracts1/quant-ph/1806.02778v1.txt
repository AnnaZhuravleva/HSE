Quantum registers that combine the attractive properties of different types of qubits are useful for many different applications. They also pose a number of challenges, often associated with the large differences in coupling strengths between the different types of qubits. One example is the non-resonant effect that alternating electromagnetic fields have on the transitions of qubits that are not targeted by the specific gate operation. The example being studied here is known as Bloch-Siegert shift. Unless these shifts are accounted for and, if possible, compensated, they can completely destroy the information contained in the quantum register. Here we study this effect quantitatively in the important example of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond and demonstrate how it can be eliminated.
