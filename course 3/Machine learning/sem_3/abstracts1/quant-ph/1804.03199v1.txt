We introduce perfect tangles for modular tensor categories. These are intended to generalise the perfect tensors first introduced in the context of a toy model for the AdS/CFT correspondence. We construct perfect tangles for several categories of relevance for topological quantum computation, including the Temperley-Lieb, Fibonacci, Kuperberg spider, and Haagerup planar algebras. A general inductive construction proposed by Vaughan Jones for perfect tangles is also described.
