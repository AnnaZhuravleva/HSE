The question of whether given density operators for subsystems of a multipartite quantum system are compatible to one common total density operator is known as the quantum marginal problem. In this paper, we focus on its tripartite version that of determining whether there exists tripartite quantum state with bipartite reduced density matrices equal to the given bipartite states. We first study the bipartite marginal problem and find out there is a "duality" relation: The distance between the marginal states is at most the fidelity between the probability distributions generated by measuring the bipartite state with measurements onto the symmetric (anti-symmetric) space and antisymmetric (symmetric) space; the fidelity between the marginal states is at least the distance between the probability distributions by measuring the bipartite state with measurements onto the symmetric (anti-symmetric) space and antisymmetric (symmetric) space. Then we generalize it into the tripartite version, and build a new class of necessary criteria for the tripartite marginal problem.
