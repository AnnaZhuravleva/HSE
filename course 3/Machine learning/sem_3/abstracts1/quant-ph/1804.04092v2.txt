In 1975, using quantum field theory in curved space-time, S. Hawking predicted black holes to emit thermal radiation. Since the experimental observation from an actual black hole is challenging, analogue systems have gained more and more attention in the verification of this concept. We propose an experimental set-up consisting of two adjacent piezoelectric semiconducting layers, one of them carrying dynamic quantum dots (DQDs), and the other being p-doped with an attached gate on top, which introduces a space-dependent layer conductivity. The propagation of surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on the latter layer is governed by a wave equation with an effective metric. In the frame of the DQDs, this metric is equivalent to that of a two dimensional non-rotating and uncharged black hole with an apparent horizon for SAWs. Analogue Hawking radiation appears in form of phonons. We show that for a GaAs piezoelectric the Hawking temperature is in the mK-regime.
