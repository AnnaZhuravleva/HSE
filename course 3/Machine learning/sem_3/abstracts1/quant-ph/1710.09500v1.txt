This paper describes a quantum programming environment, named $Q|SI\rangle$. It is a platform embedded in the .Net language that supports quantum programming using a quantum extension of the $\mathbf{while}$-language. The framework of the platform includes a compiler of the quantum $\mathbf{while}$-language and a suite of tools for simulating quantum computation, optimizing quantum circuits, and analyzing and verifying quantum programs. Throughout the paper, using $Q|SI\rangle$ to simulate quantum behaviors on classical platforms with a combination of components is demonstrated. The scalable framework allows the user to program customized functions on the platform. The compiler works as the core of $Q|SI\rangle$ bridging the gap from quantum hardware to quantum software. The built-in decomposition algorithms enable the universal quantum computation on the present quantum hardware.
