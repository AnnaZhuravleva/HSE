In coventional imaging experiments, objects are localized in a position space and such optically responsive objects can be imaged with a convex lens and can be seen by a human eye. In this paper, we introduce an experiment on a three-dimensional imaging of a pattern which is localized in a three-dimesional phase space. The phase space pattern can not be imaged with a lens in a conventional way and it can not be seen by a human eye. In this experiment, a phase space pattern is produced from object transparancies and imprinted onto the phase space of an atomic gaseous medium, of doppler broadened absorption profile at room temperature, by utilizing velocity selective hole burning in the absorption profile. The pattern is localized in an unique three dimensional phase space which is a subspace of the six dimensional phase space. Imaging of the localized phase space pattern is performed at different momentum locations. In addition, imaging of the imprinted pattern of an object of nonuniform transmittance is presented.
