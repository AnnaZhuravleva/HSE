This paper is a continuation of our previous works about coordinate, momentum, dispersion operators and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. It concerns a study on the properties of wavefunctions in the phase space representation and the momentum dispersion operator, its representations and eigenvalue equation. After the recall of some results from our previous papers, we give most of the main properties of the phase space wavefunctions and consider some examples of them. Then we establish the eigenvalue equation for the differential operator corresponding to the momentum dispersion operator in the phase space representation. It is shown in particular that any phase space wavefunction is solution of this equation.
