The possible connection between EPR correlations and superluminal interactions is discussed using simple and palpable arguments. It is shown how an experiment based on time-like events can allow us to answer the question "Can a measurement performed on one of the photons of an entangled pair change the state of the other?" The theorem on superluminal finite-speed causal influences and superluminal signaling is reexamined. It is shown how faster-than-light interactions and Lorentz transformations might peacefully coexist.
