In this paper, we propose a method for implementing the interaction-free measurement (IFM) with mesoscopic devices fabricated on a high mobility GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, where a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system is buried, at low temperature. The IFM is amazing evidence of nonlocality of the quantum mechanics because the IFM offers us the capability to detect the existence of an object without interaction with it. A scheme of Kwiat et al. for realizing the IFM lets a probability that we fail to recognize the presence of the object be as small as we like, using the quantum Zeno effect. Constructing an interferometer of Kwiat et al. for the IFM, we make use of techniques of electron quantum optics and tunnelling microscopes for the 2DEG. We examine a shot noise of an electric current flowing through the interferometer. Our method for performing the IFM aims at achieving a milestone of quantum information processing in mesoscopic systems.
