A legitimate and easily computable measure of nonclassicality for the pure state of the single-mode electromagnetic field based on the standard deviation in the measurement of the homodyne rotated quadrature operator is proposed. The proposed quantity is an effective nonclassical area projected by the optical tomogram of the quantum state of light on to the optical tomographic plane. It is found that if the nonclassical area projected by the optical tomogram of a pure single-mode quantum state is greater than zero the state is strictly a nonclassical state and it is zero for the classical state. Nonclassical area spanned by the optical tomogram of nonclassical states of light such as Fock states, squeezed states, photon-added coherent states, and even and odd coherent states, have been evaluated theoretically. Nonclassical area projected by the optical tomogram of a quantum state of light may be experimentally tractable using the balanced homodyne detection of the quadrature operator of the field avoiding the reconstruction of density matrix or the quasiprobability distribution of the state.
