Phase estimation is the most investigated protocol in quantum metrology, but its performance is affected by the presence of noise, also in the form of imperfect state preparation. Here we discuss how to address this scenario by using a multiparameter approach, in which noise is associated to a parameter to be measured at the same time as the phase. We present an experiment using two-photon states, and apply our setup to investigating optical activity of fructose solutions. Finally, we illustrate the scaling laws of the attainable precisions with the number of photons in the probe state.
