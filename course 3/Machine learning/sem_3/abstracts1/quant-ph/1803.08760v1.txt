Linear steering inequalities are useful to check whether a bipartite state is steerable when both the parties are allowed to perform $n$ dichotomic measurements on his or her part. In the present study we propose the necessary and sufficient condition under which $2$-settings linear steering inequality will be violated for any given set of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ observables at trusted and untrusted party's side. The most important result revealed by the present paper is that maximally entangled state gives maximum quantum violation of $n$-settings linear steering inequality ($n$ is arbitrary) among all possible quantum states for any given set of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ observables at trusted and untrusted party's side.
