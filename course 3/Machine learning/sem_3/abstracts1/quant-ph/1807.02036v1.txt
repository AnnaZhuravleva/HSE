We generalize Kato's adiabatic theorem to nonunitary dynamics. This enables us to unify two strong coupling limits: one driven by fast oscillations under a Hamiltonian, and the other driven by strong damping under a Lindbladian. We discuss the case where both mechanisms are present and provide nonperturbative error bounds. We also analyze the links with the quantum Zeno effect and dynamics.
