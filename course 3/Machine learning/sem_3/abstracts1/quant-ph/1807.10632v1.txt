Product Jahn-Teller (pJT) effect may occur for such coupled electron-phonon systems in solids where single electrons occupy double degenerate orbitals. We propose that the excited state of the neutral $X$V split-vacancy complex in diamond, where $X$ and V labels a group-IV impurity atom and the vacancy, respectively, is such a system. We develop and apply \emph{ab initio} theory to quantify the strength of electron-phonon coupling for neutral $X$V complexes in diamond for $X$=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, and find an $(e_g \otimes e_u) \otimes E_g$ pJT solution. Our results show good agreement with recent experimental data on the prospective SiV($0$) quantum bit, and reveals the complex nature of the excited states and the corresponding optical properties.
