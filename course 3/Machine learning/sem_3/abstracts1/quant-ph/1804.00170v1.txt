In this work, we provide another application of HHL algorithm in cubic spline interpolation problem. In this problem, the condition number is small, the Hamiltonian simulation is efficient and quantum state preparation is efficient. So the quantum algorithm obtained by HHL algorithm toward this problem actually achieves an exponential speedup with no restrictions. This will be another application of HHL algorithm besides the work of Clader et al. \cite{clader} to the electromagnetic scattering cross-section problem with no caveats.
