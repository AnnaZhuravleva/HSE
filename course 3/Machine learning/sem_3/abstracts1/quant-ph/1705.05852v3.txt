We unveil a novel source of non-Markovianity for the dynamics of quantum systems, which appears when the system does not explore the full set of dynamical trajectories in the interaction with its environment. We term this effect non-Markovianity by undersampling and demonstrate its appearance in the operation of an all-optical quantum simulator involving a polarization qubit interacting with a dephasing fluctuating environment.
