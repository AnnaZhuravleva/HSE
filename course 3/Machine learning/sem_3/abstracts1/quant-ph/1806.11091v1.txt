Quantum annealers are special-purpose quantum computers that primarily target solving Ising optimization problems. Theoretical work has predicted that the probability of a quantum annealer ending in a ground state can be dramatically improved if the spin driving terms, which play a crucial role in the functioning of a quantum annealer, have different strengths for different spins; that is, they are inhomogeneous. In this paper we describe a time-shift-based protocol for inhomogeneous driving and demonstrate, using an experimental quantum annealer, the performance of our protocol on a range of hard Ising problems that have been well-studied in the literature. Compared to the homogeneous-driving case, we find that we are able to improve the probability of finding a ground state by up to $10^7 \times$ for Weak-Strong-Cluster problem instances, and by up to $10^3 \times$ for more general spin-glass problem instances. In addition to being of practical interest as a heuristic speedup method, inhomogeneous driving may also serve as a useful tool for investigations into the physics of experimental quantum annealers.
