We propose a simple construction of shortcuts to adiabaticity tracking instantaneous stationary states in classical spin systems without knowing tracked stationary states. In our construction, control fields of the counter-diabatic driving are constituted by state-dependent magnetic fields, which can be easily determined with an aid of numerical calculations. Easiness of our construction is a remarkable feature since it is usually a hard task to determine the explicit form of the required counter-diabatic terms in many-body systems. We also argue that our method can be applied to solve combinatorial optimization problems by considering classical spin dynamics under a time-dependent Hamiltonian, which mimics the procedure of quantum annealing.
