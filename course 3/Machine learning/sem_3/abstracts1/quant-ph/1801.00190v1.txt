The quantum geometric potential is a gauge invariant carrying novel geometric features between any two energy levels or bands in quantum systems. In generic time-dependent systems it gives a vital physical modification for the instantaneous energy gaps, laying down more appropriate quantum adiabatic conditions for both non-degenerate and degenerate systems. Remarkably, for generic parameterized quantum systems, the integration of the quantum geometric potential on a closed loop leads to a novel type of quantized winding number, which is a quantum counterpart of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The effects of the quantum geometric potential had been indirectly supported by the experiments on the quantum adiabatic evolution, however, a direct experimental observation so far is lacking. In this paper we propose an interference measurement to directly probe the quantum geometric potential, where the relevant parameters are easily accessible by current experimental apparatus. A direct confirmation of this new physical quantity could motive further theoretical and experimental investigations as well as its potential real applications.
