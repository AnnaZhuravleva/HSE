We report that the true intrinsic degree of freedom of the photon is neither the polarization nor the spin. It describes a local property in momentum space and is represented in the local representation by the Pauli matrices. This result is achieved by treating the transversality condition on the vector wavefunction as a nonholonomic quantum constraint. We find that the quantum constraint makes it possible to generalize the Stokes parameters to characterize the polarization of a general state. Unexpectedly, the generalized Stokes parameters are specified in a momentum-space local reference system that is fixed by another degree of freedom, called Stratton vector. Only constant Stokes parameters in one particular local reference system can convey the intrinsic degree of freedom of the photon. We show that the optical rotation is one of such processes that change the Stratton vector with the intrinsic quantum number remaining fixed. Changing the Stratton vector of the eigenstate of the helicity will give rise to a Berry's phase.
