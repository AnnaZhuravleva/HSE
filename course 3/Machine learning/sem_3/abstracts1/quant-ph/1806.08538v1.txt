We develop a hierarchical functional derivative method to investigate the reduced dynamics of a quantum dissipative system within the framework of a stochastic decoupling description. Keeping only the lowest order truncation of the hierarchical functional derivatives, one can recover the second order Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation. Taking into account the higher-order corrections, our method can be implemented as a highly efficient numerical scheme for a general quantum dissipative system beyond the usual Markovian, rotating-wave, and weak-coupling approximations.
