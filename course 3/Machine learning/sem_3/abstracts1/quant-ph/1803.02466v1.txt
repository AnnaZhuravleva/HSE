Quantum algorithms for diverse problems, including search and optimization problems, require the implementation of a reflection operator over a target state. Commonly, such reflections are approximately implemented using phase estimation. Here we use a linear combination of unitaries and a version of amplitude amplification to approximate reflection operators over eigenvectors of unitary operators using exponentially less ancillary qubits in terms of a precision parameter. The gate complexity of our method is also comparable to that of the phase estimation approach in a certain limit of interest. Like phase estimation, our method requires the implementation of controlled unitary operations. We then extend our results to the Hamiltonian case where the target state is an eigenvector of a Hamiltonian whose matrix elements can be queried. Our results are useful in that they reduce the resources required by various quantum algorithms in the literature. Our improvements also rely on an efficient quantum algorithm to prepare a quantum state with Gaussian-like amplitudes that may be of independent interest. We also provide a lower bound on the query complexity of implementing approximate reflection operators on a quantum computer.
