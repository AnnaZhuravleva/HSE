A new method to find a lower energy solution to a QUBO/Ising objective function will be presented in this paper. It is applied to samples returned from the D-Wave for various example cases. This method, multi-qubit correction (MQC), creates a sample with an equal-to or less-than energy than any of the D-wave samples used to create it. The method will be detailed and the results of 3 uses cases will be given to demonstrate its merit.
