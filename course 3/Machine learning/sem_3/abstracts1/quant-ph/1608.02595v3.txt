Tensor network models reproduce important structural features of holography, including the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the entanglement entropy and quantum error correction in the entanglement wedge. Yet only little is known about their multipartite entanglement structure, which has been of considerable recent interest. In this work, we study tensor networks formed from random stabilizer states and show that here the tripartite entanglement question has a sharp answer: The average number of GHZ triples that can be extracted from a stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that the entanglement is predominantly bipartite. Previously, such a result was only known for single tensors. As a consequence, we obtain a new operational interpretation of the monogamy of the Ryu-Takayanagi mutual information and an entropic diagnostic for higher-partite entanglement. To establish our results, we derive a ferromagnetic spin model for the average tripartite entanglement of stabilizer tensor networks and develop novel techniques for evaluating higher moments of random stabilizer states.
