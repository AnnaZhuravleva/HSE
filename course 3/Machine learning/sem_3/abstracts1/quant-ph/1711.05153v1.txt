We present an approach to achieve efficient single-photon frequency conversion in the microwave domain based on coherent control in superconducting quantum circuits, which consist of a driven artificial atom coupled to a semi-infinite transmission line. Using the full quantum-mechanical method, we analyze the single-photon scattering process in this system and find that single-photon frequency up- or down-conversion with efficiency close to unity can be achieved by adjusting the parameters of the control field applied to the artificial atom. We further show that our approach is experimentally feasible in currently available superconducting flux qubit circuits.
