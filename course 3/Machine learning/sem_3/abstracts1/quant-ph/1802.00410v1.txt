Quantum resources can enhance the sensitivity of a device beyond the classical shot noise limit and, as a result, revolutionize the field of metrology through the development of quantum-enhanced sensors. In particular, plasmonic sensors, which are widely used in biological and chemical sensing applications, offer a unique opportunity to bring such an enhancement to real-life devices. Here, we use bright entangled twin beams to enhance the sensitivity of a plasmonic sensor used to measure local changes in refractive index. We demonstrate a 56% quantum enhancement in the sensitivity of state-of-the-art plasmonic sensor with measured sensitivities on the order of $10^{-10}$RIU$/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$, nearly 5 orders of magnitude better than previous proof-of-principle implementations of quantum-enhanced plasmonic sensors. These results promise significant enhancements in ultratrace label free plasmonic sensing and will find their way into areas ranging from biomedical applications to chemical detection.
