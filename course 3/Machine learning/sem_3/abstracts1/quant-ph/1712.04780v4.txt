The scintillation index is obtained for the practically important range of weak and moderate atmospheric turbulence. To study this challenging range, the Boltzman-Langevin kinetic equation, describing light propagation, is derived from first principles of quantum optics based on the technique of the photon distribution function (PDF) [G. P. Berman et al., Phys. Rev. A 74, 013805 (2006)]. The paraxial approximation for laser beams reduces the collision integral for the PDF to a two-dimensional operator in the momentum space. Analytical solutions for the average value of PDF as well as for its fluctuating constituent are obtained using an iterative procedure. The calculated scintillation index is considerably greater than that obtained within the Rytov approximation even at moderate turbulence strength. The relevant explanation is proposed.
