Since star network of spins was proposed, generating entanglement directly through spin interactions between distant parties became much possible. We propose an architecture which involves coupled spin chains based on nitrogen-vacancy centers and nitrogen defect spins to expand star network, the numerical analysis shows that the length of spin chains $M$ and spin noise can determine the maximally achievable entanglement $E_m$. The entanglement capability of this configuration under effect of disorder and spin loss is also studied. Moreover, it is shown that with this kind of architecture, star network of spins is feasible in measurement of magnetic-field gradient.
