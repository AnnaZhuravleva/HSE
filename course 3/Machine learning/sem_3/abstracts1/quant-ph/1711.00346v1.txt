We propose a low noise, triply-resonant, electro-optic (EO) scheme for quantum microwave-to-optical conversion based on coupled nanophotonics resonators integrated with a superconducting qubit. Our optical system features a split resonance - a doublet - with a tunable frequency splitting that matches the microwave resonance frequency of the superconducting qubit. This is in contrast to conventional approaches where large optical resonators with free-spectral range comparable to the qubit microwave frequency are used. In our system, EO mixing between the optical pump coupled into the low frequency doublet mode and a resonance microwave photon results in an up-converted optical photon on resonance with high frequency doublet mode. Importantly, the down-conversion process, which is the source of noise, is suppressed in our scheme as the coupled-resonator system does not support modes at that frequency. Our device has at least an order of magnitude smaller footprint than the conventional devices, resulting in large overlap between optical and microwave fields and large photon conversion rate ($g/2\pi$) in the range of $\sim$5-15 kHz. Owing to large $g$ factor and doubly-resonant nature of our device, microwave-to-optical frequency conversion can be achieved with optical pump powers in the range of tens of microwatts, even with moderate values for optical $\it{Q}$ ($\sim 10^6$) and microwave $Q$ ($ \sim10^4$). The performance metrics of our device, with substantial improvement over the previous EO-based approaches, promise a scalable quantum microwave-to-optical conversion and networking of superconducting processors via optical fiber communication.
