Full state revivals in a quantum walk can be viewed as returning of the walker to the initial quantum state in a periodic fashion during the propagation of the walk. In this paper we show that for any given number of spatial dimensions, a coin operator can be constructed to generate a quantum walk having full revivals with any desired period. From the point of view of quantum computation and simulations, these coin operators can be useful in implementing quantum walks which oscillate between any two states with a finite periodicity.
