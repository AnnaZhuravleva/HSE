We consider two identical bosons propagating on a one-dimensional lattice and address the prob- lem of discriminating whether their mutual on-site interaction is attractive or repulsive. We suggest a probing scheme based on the properties of the corresponding two-particle quantum walks, and show that the sign of the interaction introduces specific and detectable features in the dynamics of quantum correlations, thus permitting to discriminate between the two cases. We also discuss how these features are connected to the band-structure of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, and prove that discrimination may be obtained only when the two walkers are initially prepared in a superposition of localized states.
