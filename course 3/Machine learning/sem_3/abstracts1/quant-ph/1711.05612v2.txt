We show that the central finite difference formula for the first and the second derivative of a function can be derived, in the context of quantum mechanics, as matrix elements of the momentum and kinetic energy operators using, as a basis set, the discrete coordinate eigenkets $\vert x_n\rangle$ defined on the uniform grid $x_n=na$. Simple closed form expressions of the matrix elements are obtained starting from integrals involving the canonical commutation rule. A detailed analysis of the convergence toward the continuum limit with respect to both the grid spacing and the approximation order is presented. It is shown that the convergence from below of the eigenvalues in electronic structure calculations is an intrinsic feature of the finite difference method.
