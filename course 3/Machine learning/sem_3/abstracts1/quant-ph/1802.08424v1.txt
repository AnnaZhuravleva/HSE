Contextuality describes the nontrivial dependence of measurement outcomes on particular choices of jointly measurable observables. In this work we review and generalize the bundle diagram representation introduced in [S. Abramsky et al., 24th EACSL Annual Conference on Computer Science Logic, 41, 211-228, (2015)] in order to graphically demonstrate the contextuality of diverse empirical models.
