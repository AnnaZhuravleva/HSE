Fuzzy geometry considered as the possible mathematical framework for reformulation of quantum-mechanical formalism in geometric terms. In this approach the states of massive particle m correspond to elements of fuzzy manifold called fuzzy points. In 1-dimensional case, due to manifold ultraweak (fuzzy) topology, m space coordinate x acquires principal uncertainty dx and described by positive, normalized density w(x,t). Analogous uncertainties appear for fuzzy point on 3-dimensional manifold. It's shown that m states on such manifold are equivalent to vectors (rays) on complex Hilbert space, their evolution correspond to Shroedinger dynamics of nonrelativistic quantum particle.
