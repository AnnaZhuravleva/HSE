We show that the maximum success probability of players sharing quantum entanglement in a two-player game with classical questions of logarithmic length and classical answers of constant length is NP-hard to approximate to within constant factors. As a corollary, the inclusion $\mathrm{NEXP}\subseteq\mathrm{MIP}^*$, first shown in [IV12] with three provers, holds with two provers only. The proof is based on a simpler, improved analysis of the low-degree test Raz and Safra (STOC'97) against two entangled provers.
