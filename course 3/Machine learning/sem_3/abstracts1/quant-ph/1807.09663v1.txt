Causal quantum theory assumes that measurements or collapses are well-defined physical processes, localised in space-time, and never give perfectly reliable outcomes and that the outcome of one measurement only influences the outcomes of others within its future light cone. Although the theory has unusual properties, it is not immediately evident that it is inconsistent with experiment to date. I discuss its implications and experimental tests.
