In reply to the paper Sci. Rep. 7:11115 (2017) by Rousseau and Felbacq, it is here shown at the level of the action that the Power-Zineau-Woolley picture of the electrodynamics of nonrelativistic neutral particles (atoms) is equivalent with the Poincar\'e gauge. Based only on very first principles, this claim does not depend on choices of canonical field momenta or quantization strategies. Furthermore, we point out a freedom of choice of canonical coordinates and momenta in the respective gauges, the conventional choices being good ones in the sense that they drastically reduce the set of system constraints.
