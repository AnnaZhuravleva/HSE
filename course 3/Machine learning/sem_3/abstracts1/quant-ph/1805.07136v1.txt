Entanglement between optical mode and microwave mode is a critical issue in illumination systems. Traditionally, optomechanical systems are applied to couple the optical mode to microcavity modes. However, due to some restrictions of this system such as sensitivity to the thermal noise at room temperature, a novel optoelectronic system is designed in this study to fix the recent system problems. Unlike recent optomechanical systems, the optical modes are directly coupled to the microwave cavity through the optoelectronic elements with no need mechanical system. The main objective of this work is to generate the entangled modes at room temperature. For this purpose, we theoretically analyze the dynamics of motion of the optoelectronic system with the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, from which one can calculate the coupling between optical and microcavity modes. The most important feature of this system is the coupling between optical mode and microwave cavity mode, which is done using a photodetector and a Varactor diode. Hence, by controlling the photodetector current (photocurrent), which is dependent on the optical cavity incidence wave and the Varactor diode biased, which is the function of the photocurrent, the coupling between the optical and microcavity mode is fully done. The modeling results show that the coupled modes are entangled at the room temperature with no need to any mechanical parts.
