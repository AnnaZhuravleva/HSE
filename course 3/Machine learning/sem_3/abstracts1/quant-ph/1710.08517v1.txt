The distribution of coherence in multipartite systems is one of the fundamental problems in the resource theory of coherence. To quantify the coherence in multipartite systems more precisely, we introduce new coherence measures, incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures, on bipartite systems by the max- and min- relative entropies and provide the operational interpretation in certain subchannel discrimination problem. By introducing the smooth max- and min- relative entropies of incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence on bipartite systems, we exhibit the distribution of coherence in multipartite systems: the total coherence is lower bounded by the sum of local coherence and genuine multipartite entanglement. Besides, we find the monogamy relationship for coherence on multipartite systems by incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced here truly capture the non-sharability of quantumness of coherence in multipartite context.
