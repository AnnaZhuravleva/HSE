We propose an experimental approach to {\it macro}scopically test the Kochen-Specker theorem (KST) with superconducting qubits. This theorem, which has been experimentally tested with single photons or neutrons, concerns the conflict between the contextuality of quantum mechnaics (QM) and the noncontextuality of hidden-variable theories (HVTs). We first show that two Josephson charge qubits can be controllably coupled by using a two-level data bus produced by a Josephson phase qubit. Next, by introducing an approach to perform the expected joint quantum measurements of two separated Josephson qubits, we show that the proposed quantum circuits could demonstrate quantum contextuality by testing the KST at a macroscopic level.
