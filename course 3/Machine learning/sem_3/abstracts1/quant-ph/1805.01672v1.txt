Time domain interferometry is a promising method to characterizes spatial and temporal correlations at x-ray energies, via the so-called intermediate scattering function and the related dynamical couple correlations. However, so far, it has only been analyzed for classical target systems. Here, we provide a quantum analysis, and suggest a scheme which allows to access quantum dynamical correlations. We further show how TDI can be used to exclude classical models for the target dynamics, and illustrate our results with the archetype system of a single particle in a double well potential.
