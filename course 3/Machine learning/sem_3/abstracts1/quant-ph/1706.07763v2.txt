We study heat radiation and heat transfer for pointlike particles in a system of other objects. Starting from exact many-body expressions found from scattering theory and fluctuational electrodynamics, we find that transfer and radiation for point particles are given in terms of the Green's function of the system in the absence of the point particles. These general expressions contain no approximation for the surrounding objects. As an application, we compute the heat transfer between two point particles in the presence of a sphere of arbitrary size and show that the transfer is enhanced by several orders of magnitude through the presence of the sphere, depending on the materials. Furthermore, we compute the heat emission of a point particle in front of a planar mirror. Finally, we show that a particle placed inside a spherical mirror cavity does not radiate energy.
