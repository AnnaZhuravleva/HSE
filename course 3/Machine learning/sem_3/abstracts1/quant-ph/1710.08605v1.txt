The manuscript investigates the entropy squeezing of a qubit (two-level atom) interacting with the cavity field in the Schr\"odinger cat states. The effects of the Schr\"odinger cat states of the field on the squeezing are examined. Our results suggest that entropy squeezing is not sensitive to the superposition features of two coherent states of the Schr\"odinger cat states. Furthermore, it is found that entropy squeezing occurs as the qubit initially close to its maximally coherent state, and the qubit initially in the maximally coherent state can generate optimal squeezing. This also demonstrates that the atomic coherence has a remarkable effect on the atomic squeezing. On the other hand, we also show how the entropy squeezing is related to the intensity of the initial field.
