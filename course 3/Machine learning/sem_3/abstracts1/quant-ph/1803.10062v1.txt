A novel algorithm for maximum-likelihood quantum process tomography is presented, which relies on a subroutine that projects candidate superoperators onto the space of completely positive, trace-preserving maps. When interspersed with gradient descent, the procedure results in an algorithm which finds the most likely quantum process given a sufficient set of observations. We compare the performance of the algorithm to the diluted iterative algorithm as well as second-order solvers interfaced with the popular CVX package for MATLAB, and find it to be significantly faster and up to $10\times$ more accurate.
