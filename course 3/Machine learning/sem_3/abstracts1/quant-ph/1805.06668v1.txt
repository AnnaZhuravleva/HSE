Quantum cryptography is information-theoretically secure owing to its solid basis in quantum mechanics. However, generally, initial implementations with practical imperfections might open loopholes, allowing an eavesdropper to compromise the security of a quantum cryptographic system. This has been shown to happen for quantum key distribution (QKD). Here we apply experience from implementation security of QKD to other quantum cryptographic primitives: quantum digital signatures, quantum secret sharing, source-independent quantum random number generation, quantum secure direct communication, and blind quantum computing. For each implementation, potential loopholes are pointed out. We explain how the eavesdropper could in principle exploit the loopholes to violate assumptions in the protocols, breaking their security properties. Countermeasures are also discussed. It is important to consider potential implementation security issues early in protocol design, to shorten the path to future applications.
