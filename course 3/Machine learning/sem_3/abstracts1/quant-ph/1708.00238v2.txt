Composite pulses are essential for universal manipulation of singlet-triplet spin qubits. In the absence of noise, they are required to perform arbitrary single-qubit operations due to the special control constraint of a singlet-triplet qubits; while in a noisy environment, more complicated sequences have been developed to dynamically correct the error. Tailoring these sequences typically requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear equations. Here we demonstrate that these pulse sequences can be generated by a well-trained, double-layer neural network. For sequences designed for the noise-free case, the trained neural network is capable of producing almost exactly the same pulses known in the literature. For more complicated noise-correcting sequences, the neural network produces pulses with slightly different line-shapes, but the robustness against noises remains comparable. These results indicate that the neural network can be a judicious and powerful alternative to existing techniques, in developing pulse sequences for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.
