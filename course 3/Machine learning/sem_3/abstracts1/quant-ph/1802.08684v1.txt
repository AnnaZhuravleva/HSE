In this work we present a semi-classical approach to solve the inverse spectrum problem for one-dimensional wave equations for a specific class of potentials that admits quasi-stationary states. We show how inverse methods for potential wells and potential barriers can be generalized to reconstruct significant parts for the combined potentials. For the reconstruction one assumes the knowledge of the complex valued spectrum and uses the exponential smallness of its imaginary part. Analytic spectra are studied and a recent application of the method in the literature for gravitational wave physics is discussed. The method allows for a simple reconstruction of quasi-stationary state potentials from a given spectrum. Thus it might be interesting for different branches of physics and related fields.
