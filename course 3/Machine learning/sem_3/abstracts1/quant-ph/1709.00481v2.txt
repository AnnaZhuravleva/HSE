We show that atoms falling from outside through a cavity into a black hole (BH) emit acceleration radiation which to a distant observer looks much like Hawking BH radiation. In particular, we find the entropy of the acceleration radiation via a simple laser-like analysis. We call this entropy Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) entropy to distinguish it from the BH entropy of Bekenstein and Hawking.
