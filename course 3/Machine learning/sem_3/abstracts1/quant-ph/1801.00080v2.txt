After quantum computers come out, governments and rich companies will have the abilities to buy these useful quantum computers, meanwhile they are familiar with these technologies proficiently. If a client wants to perform quantum computing but she does not have quantum computers with relevant quantum technologies. She can seek help from the server and pay his salary, but she does not want to leak anything to the server. Blind quantum computing (BQC) give a good method for the client to realized her quantum computing. In this article, we propose a new BQC protocol of quantum fourier transform (QFT) performed on multi-qubit states with a trusted, a client and a server, where the trusted center can generate resource states, the client can delegate her quantum computing to a server who can perform universal quantum computing without knowing anything about the client's inputs, algorithms and outputs. We first give the BQC protocols of three-qubit QFT with the equivalently quantum circuits, Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) entangled states and W entangled states as examples. Further, we extend them to multi-qubit QFT on multi-qubit with the equivalently quantum circuits. At last, we give the analyses and proofs of the blindness and correctness.
