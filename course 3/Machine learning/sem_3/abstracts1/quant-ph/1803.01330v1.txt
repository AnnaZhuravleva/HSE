Based on Lyapunov control, a scheme is proposed to accelerate the dissipation dynamics for the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between two Rydberg atoms in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). We first use the quantum Zeno dynamics and Rydberg antiblockade to find a unique steady state (two-atom singlet state) for the system. Then, applying additional coherent control (ACC) fields to improve the evolution speed of the dissipative system. The ACC fields are designed based on the target state and they vanish gradually along with increasing of the fidelity thus the system is guaranteed to be finally stable. Besides, the current accelerated scheme is checked to be robust against systematic and amplitude-noise errors.
