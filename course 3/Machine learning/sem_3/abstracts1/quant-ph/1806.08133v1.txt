Uncertainty principle is one of the central concepts in quantum theory. Different forms of this particular principle have been discoursed in various foundational and information theoretic topics. In the discrete input-output scenario the limited nonlocal behavior of quantum theory has been explained by fine-grained uncertainty relation. On the other hand, in continuous variable paradigm Robertson-Schrodinger (RS) uncertainty relation has been used to detect multi-mode entanglement. Here we show that RS uncertainty relation plays an important role to discriminate between quantum and post-quantum nonlocal correlations in multi-mode continuous outcome scenario. We provide a class of m-mode post-quantum nonlocal correlations with continuous outcome spectrum. While nonlocality of the introduced class of correlations is established through Calvalcanti-Foster-Reid-Drummond (CFRD) class of Bell inequalities, RS uncertainty relation detects their post-quantum nature. Our result is a hint towards a wider role of uncertainty principle in the study of nonlocality in continuous variable multi-mode systems.
