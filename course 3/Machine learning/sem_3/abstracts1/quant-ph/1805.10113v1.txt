We propose and analyze, focusing on non-adiabatic effects, a technique of manipulating quantum spin systems based on local "cutting" and "stitching" of the Heisenberg exchange coupling between the spins. This first operation is cutting of a single bond in a pair of neighboring spins for a linear chain, or of two neighboring bonds for a ring-shaped array of spins. We show that the disconnected spin can be in the ground state with a high fidelity even after a non-adiabatic process. Next, we consider inverse operation of stitching these bonds to increase the system size. We show that the optimal control algorithm can be found by using common numerical procedures with a simple two-parametric control function able to produce a high-fidelity cutting and stitching. These results can be applied for manipulating quantum dot ensembles considered as prospective elements for quantum information technologies.
