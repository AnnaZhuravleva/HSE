We develop theory of realization of hybrid entanglement between discrete-variable (single photon) and continuous-variable states (coherent states). A highly transmissive beam splitter (HTBS) is used for interaction of the ingredients. Mechanism for generating the hybrid entangled states is based on the simultaneous displacement of the discrete-variable state on equal in absolute value but opposite in sign displacement amplitudes by coherent components, in such a way that all the information about the displacement amplitudes is lost with subsequent registration of photons in the auxiliary mode. Conditions for the balanced hybrid entangled states generation are found. Our approach follows along lines experimentally demonstrated in Nat. Photonics 8, 570-574 (2014).
