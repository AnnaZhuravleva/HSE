We theoretically and experimentally consider the coupling of an atom to a cavity with non-degenerate polarisation modes. A model for such systems is presented and then experimentally verified by considering the modified polarisations of temporally long single photons emitted from 87Rb atoms strongly coupled to a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity. Time-dependent polarisation states that change within the coherence time of a single photon are observed as a result of the non-negligible polarisation-mode splitting. A theoretical investigation then shows how starkly different behaviours can arise from such an atom-cavity system by modifying only the cavity birefringence. This illustrates that the consideration of these effects is vital to the faithful realisation of efficient and coherent emitter-photon interfaces for distributed quantum networking and communications.
