We demonstrate a two-photon interference experiment for phase coherent biphoton frequency combs (BFCs), created through spectral amplitude filtering of biphotons with a continuous broadband spectrum. By using an electro-optic phase modulator, we project the BFC lines into sidebands that overlap in frequency. The resulting high-visibility interference patterns provide an approach to verify frequency-bin entanglement even with slow single-photon detectors; we show interference patterns with visibilities that surpass the classical threshold for qubit and qutrit states. Additionally, we show that with entangled qutrits, two-photon interference occurs even with projections onto different final frequency states. Finally, we show the versatility of this scheme for weak-light measurements by performing a series of two-dimensional experiments at different signal-idler frequency offsets to measure the dispersion of a single-mode fiber.
