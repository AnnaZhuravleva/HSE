We study the two-dimensional massless Dirac equation for a potential that is allowed to depend on the energy and on one of the spatial variables. After determining a modified orthogonality relation and norm for such systems, we present an application involving an energy-dependent version of the hyperbolic Scarf potential. We construct closed-form bound state solutions of the associated Dirac equation.
