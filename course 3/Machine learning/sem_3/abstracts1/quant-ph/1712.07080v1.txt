We report on the coherence of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states comprised of up to 8 qubits in the IBM ibmqx5 16-qubit quantum processor. In particular, we evaluate the coherence of GHZ states with $N=1,\ldots,8$ qubits, as a function of a delay time between state creation and measurement. We find that the decay in coherence occurs at a rate that is linear in the number of qubits. This is consistent with a model in which the dominant noise affecting the system is uncorrelated across qubits.
