We consider two qubits prepared in a product state and evolved under the magnetic dipolar interaction (MDI). We describe the dependence of the entanglement generated by the MDI with time, with the interaction parameters, and with the system's initial state, identifying the symmetry and coherence aspects of those initial configurations that yield the maximal entanglement. We also show how one can obtain maximum entanglement from the MDI applied to some families of partially entangled initial states.
