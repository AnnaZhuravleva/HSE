Light displays particle and wave properties within the bounds of the inequality, K^2+V^2<=1, where K represents particle information and V represents corresponding wave information. Using two laser beams that cross and then diverge from each other we explore the inequality. Results, based on semiclassical analysis, are in conflict with the inequality. However, analysis based on quantum electrodynamics resolves the conflict and uncovers a region where particle and wave aspects of light develop independently. Independent development of wave and particle aspects implies that they represent separate realities.
