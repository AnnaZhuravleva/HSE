I present an exact solution to stimulated emission from a quantum two-level system based on quantum stochastic calculus, including for very large photon number. I use this expression to explore the intuitive limits of high driving photon number and short driving pulses. For a Fock state drive, this limit reduces to imagining the two-level system coherently exchanging energy with a cavity mode for a length of time equivalent to the pulse width. Notably, the limiting case for drive by a coherent state does not reduce to a two-level system briefly interacting with a cavity mode because the two-level system's state factorizes with the waveguide's coherent state.
