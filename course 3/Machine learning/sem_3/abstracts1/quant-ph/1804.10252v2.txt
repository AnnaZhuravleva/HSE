An interferometric experiment is proposed in order to measure the radiation force exerted by a single photon on a nano mechanical oscillator placed in the middle of a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. The force is measured by observing the shift given to the probability density function of the position of the oscillator, using weak measurements and post-selection of photons. We show that this shift is proportional to the weak value of the operator that accounts for the difference of photons between both sides of the cavity. For single-photon states, this operator has eigenvalues 1 or -1, depending on the side of the cavity in which is the photon, but the weak value can exceed by far this range. Thus, by preparing and post-selecting the photon in two nearly orthogonal states the weak value is increased and the radiation effect of a single photon turns out to be much larger than the pressure exerted by a photon without post-selection. This opens the possibility to study weak values of number operators in optomechanics and the radiation effect in pre- and post-selected ensembles.
