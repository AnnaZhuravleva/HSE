In an exact quantum-mechanical framework, we show that expectation values of the second-quantized electro-magnetic fields in the Coulomb gauge, and in the presence of classical sources, automatically lead to causal and retarded electro-magnetic field strengths. The classical $\hbar$-independent Maxwell's equations naturally emerge from this fundamental quantum-mechanical approach in terms of expectation values of quantum fields, and are therefore also consistent with the special theory of relativity. The fundamental difference between interference phenomena due to the linear nature of the classical Maxwell theory as, e.g., in classical optics, and interference effects of quantum states is clarified. The framework outlined also provides for a simple approach to, e.g., spontaneous photon emission and/or absorption processes as well as to the classical Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation. The inherent and necessary quantum fluctuations, limiting a precise space-time knowledge of expectation values of the quantum fields considered, are, finally, recalled.
