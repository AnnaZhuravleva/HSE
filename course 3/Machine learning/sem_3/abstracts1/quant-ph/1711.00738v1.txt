We developed a multi-mode ground state cooling technique based on electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). By involving an additional ground and excited state, two individually adjustable bright states together with a dark state are created. While the dark state suppresses carrier scattering, the two bright states are brought into resonance with spectrally separated motional red sidebands. With this double-bright EIT (D-EIT) cooling scheme, we experimentally demonstrate ground state cooling of all three motional modes of a trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ with a single cooling pulse. The approach is scalable to more than two bright states by introducing laser couplings to additional states.
