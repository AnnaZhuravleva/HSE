Ultracold atoms, benefiting from long-lived coherence and controllable interactions, offer an ideal system to shed light on the organizing principles of out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. Here, we investigate a dynamical phase transition from a state with ferromagnetic order to a demagnetized state in a quantum simulator of the collective Heisenberg model with an inhomogeneous axial field. Two hyperfine states of fermionic potassium atoms encode the spin degrees of freedom, while single-particle oscillator modes serve as lattice sites. We benchmark the simulator using detailed comparisons to theory and by testing the reversibility of the collective dynamics. Our observations open a route for applications of large controllable fermionic ensembles to enhanced metrology and quantum technologies.
