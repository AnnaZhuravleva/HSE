In this paper, we give a general method to treat one-dimensional quantum systems whose potential are of ultra-short width. We have considered a quantum system with ultrashort potential. The exact analytic forms of the wave function, tunnelling probability and Ramsauer effect (scattering probability) are calculated. The presented results are general and the method is applicable to any symmetric potential. The results have applications in understanding nanodevices.
