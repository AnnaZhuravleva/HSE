When a quantum system is placed in thermal environments, we often assume that the system relaxes to the Gibbs state in which decoherence takes place in the system energy eigenbasis. However, when the coupling between the system and the environments is strong, the final steady state is not necessarily the Gibbs state. Since the system is continuously measured by the environments, its state does not have to be diagonal in the energy eigenbasis. Based on the measurement theory proposed by Zurek, we postulate that the Gibbs state is projected onto the pointer basis due to the continuous measurement. We justify the proposition by numerically evaluating the exact time- evolution of a coupled qbits interacting with boson gases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that heat conduction in non-equilibrium steady states can be suppressed in the strong coupling limit also by the environment-induced decoherence.
