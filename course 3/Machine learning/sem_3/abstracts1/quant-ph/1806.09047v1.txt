In this work we report on a new mechanism to generate dissipative steady state entanglement in two coupled qubits driven by strong periodic ac fields. We show that steady entanglement can be generated at one side of a multiphoton resonance between a non-entangled ground state and an entangled excited state. The degree of entanglement can be tuned as a function of the amplitude of the periodic drive. A rich dynamic behavior with creation, death and revival of entanglement can be observed for certain parameter regimes, accessible in current experimental devices.
