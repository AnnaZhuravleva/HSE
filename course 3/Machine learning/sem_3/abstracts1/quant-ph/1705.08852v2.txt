Holonomic quantum computation is a quantum computation strategy that promises some built-in noise-resilience features. Here, we propose a scheme for nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation with nitrogen-vacancy center electron spins, which are characterized by fast quantum gates and long qubit coherence times. By varying the detuning, amplitudes, and phase difference of lasers applied to a nitrogen-vacancy center, one can directly realize an arbitrary single-qubit holonomic gate on the spin. Meanwhile, with the help of cavity-assisted interactions, a nontrivial two-qubit holonomic quantum gate can also be induced. The distinct merit of this scheme is that all the quantum gates are obtained via an all-optical geometric manipulation of the solid-state spins. Therefore, our scheme opens the possibility for robust quantum computation using solid-state spins in an all-optical way.
