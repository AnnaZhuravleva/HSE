The Heisenberg model of quantum magnetism accurately models many physical systems. The Heisenberg model also has a Hamiltonian that involves only two-body interactions, and allows quantum information to be stored in its ground space with the possibility of quantum error correction. In this context, the spectral gap of a Heisenberg model quantifies the robustness of the quantum data stored therein. Most prior work on Heisenberg models focus on systems with low dimensions. Here, we study the spectrum of Heisenberg models with varying geometries. To this end, we use the connection between Heisenberg models and graph Laplacians. We exactly solve Heisenberg models where every pair of spins interact equally. We also bound the spectral gaps of Heisenberg ferromagnets either with long-range interactions or with infinite dimensions. Moreover, we bound the largest and some of the smallest energy eigenvalues for Heisenberg ferromagnets with varying geometries. Our findings suggest that a wide range of magnetic phenomena can be understood using graph theory.
