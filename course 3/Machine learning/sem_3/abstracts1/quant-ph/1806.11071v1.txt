We use the generalized concurrence approach to investigate the general multipartite separability problem. By extending the preconcurrence matrix formalism to arbitrary multipartite systems, we show that the separability problem can be formulated equivalently as a pure matrix analysis problem that consists in determining whether a given set of symmetric matrices is simultaneously unitarily congruent to hollow matrices, i.e., to matrices whose main diagonal is only composed of zeroes.
