We introduce analog quantum simulations of 1+1 dimensional sections of exotic 3+1 dimensional spacetimes, such as Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, G\"{o}del rotating universe and Kerr highly-rotating black hole metric. Suitable magnetic flux profiles along a SQUID array embedded in a superconducting transmission line allow to generate an effective spatiotemporal dependence in the speed of light, which is able to mimic the corresponding light propagation in a dimensionally-reduced exotic spacetime. In each case, we discuss the technical constraints and find the optimal region of parameters for the experimental implementation.
