Quantum algorithms use the principles of quantum mechanics, as for example quantum superposition, in order to solve particular problems outperforming standard computation. They are developed for cryptography, searching, optimisation, simulation and solving large systems of linear equations. Here, we implement Grover's quantum algorithm, proposed to find an element in an unsorted list, using a single nuclear 3/2-spin carried by a Single Molecular Magnet (SMM) transistor. The coherent manipulation of this multi-level qudit is achieved by means of electric fields only. Grover's search algorithm was implemented by constructing a quantum database via a multi-level Hadamard gate. The Grover sequence then allows us to select each state. The presented method is of universal character and can be implemented in any multi-level quantum system with non-equal spaced energy levels, opening the way to novel quantum search algorithms.
