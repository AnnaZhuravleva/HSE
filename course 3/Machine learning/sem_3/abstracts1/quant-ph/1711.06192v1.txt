The time-dependent correlation functions of q-deformed Bose gas are studied. We find relation of zeros of the correlation functions with the Fisher zeros of partition function of the system. Complex temperature appears as a result of q-deformation and evolution of correlation function. A particular case of q-deformed Bose particles on two levels is examined and zeros of correlation functions and Fisher zeros of partition function are analyzed.
