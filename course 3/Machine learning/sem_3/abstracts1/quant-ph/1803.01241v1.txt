The measure of quantum entanglement is determined for any dimer, either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic, spin-1/2 Heisenberg systems in the presence of external magnetic field. The physical quantity proposed as a measure of thermal quantum entanglement is the distance between states defined through the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. It has been shown that for ferromagnetic systems there is no entanglement at all. However, although under applied magnetic field, antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 dimers exhibit entanglement for temperatures below the decoherence temperature -- the one above which the entanglement vanishes. In addition to that, the decoherence temperature shows to be proportional to the exchange coupling constant and independent on the applied magnetic field, consequently, the entanglement may not be destroyed by external magnetic fields -- the phenomenon of magnetic shielding of quantum entanglement states.
