We prove an extended continuity property for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) for arbitrary density matrices, which are general and irrespective of dynamics. These properties imply that in general cases the QFI and the SLD are not continuous functions of density matrices.They, however, become continuous for two close density matrices with close first derivatives (with respect to unknown parameter); in this case both the QFIs and the SLDs would be respectively close too. In some special cases, e.g., when dependence of the states on an unknown parameter comes from a given dynamics, these properties reduce to continuity. In the making of our main results, we also introduce a regularized SLD which works for general density matrices, whether full- or incomplete-rank.
