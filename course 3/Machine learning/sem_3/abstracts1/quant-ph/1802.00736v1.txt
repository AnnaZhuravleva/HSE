Quantum non-locality has been an extremely fruitful subject of research, leading the scientific revolution towards quantum information science, in particular to device-independent quantum information processing. We argue that time is ripe to work on another basic problem in the foundations of quantum physics, the quantum measurement problem, that should produce good physics both in theoretical, mathematical, experimental and applied physics. We briefly review how quantum non-locality contributed to physics (including some outstanding open problems) and suggest ways in which questions around Macroscopic Quantumness could equally contribute to all aspects of physics.
