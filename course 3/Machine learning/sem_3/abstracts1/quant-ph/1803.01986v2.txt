We propose an effective approach for generating highly pure and strong cavity-mechanical entanglement (or optical-microwave entanglement) in a hybrid modulated three-mode optomechanical system. By applying two-tone driving to the cavity and modulating the coupling strength between two mechanical oscillators (or between a mechanical oscillator and a transmission line resonator), we obtain an effective Hamiltonian where an intermediate mechanical mode acting as an engineered reservoir cools the Bogoliubov modes of two target system modes via beam-splitter-like interactions. In this way, the two target modes are driven to two-mode squeezed states in the stationary limit. In particular, we discuss the effects of cavity-driving detuning on the entanglement and the purity. It is found that the cavity-driving detuning plays a critical role in the goal of acquiring highly pure and strongly entangled steady states.
