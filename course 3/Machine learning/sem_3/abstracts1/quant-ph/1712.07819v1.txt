In $(\kappa,\eta)$ threshold secret sharing schemes, a secret is divided into $\eta$ shares, and any group of fewer than $\kappa$ players have no information about the secret. We here present an $(N-1,N-1)$ threshold quantum secret sharing protocol on a given $N$-qubit state close to the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. In our protocol, $N$ players use an inequality derived from the Mermin inequality to check secure correlation of classical key bits for secret sharing. We show that if our inequality holds then every legitimate player can have key bits with positive key rate. Therefore, for sufficiently many copies of the state, the players can securely share a classical secret with high probability by means of our protocol.
