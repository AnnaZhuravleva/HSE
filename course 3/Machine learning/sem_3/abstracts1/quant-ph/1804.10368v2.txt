We consider the problem of strong (amplitude-wise) simulation of $n$-qubit quantum circuits, and identify a subclass of simulators we call monotone. This subclass encompasses almost all prominent simulation techniques. We prove an unconditional (i.e. without relying on any complexity theoretic assumptions) and explicit $(n-2)(2^{n-3}-1)$ lower bound on the running time of simulators within this subclass. Assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), we further remark that a universal simulator computing any amplitude to precision $2^{-n}/2$ must take at least $2^{n - o(n)}$ time. Finally, we compare strong simulators to existing SAT solvers, and identify the time-complexity below which a strong simulator would improve on state-of-the-art SAT solving.
