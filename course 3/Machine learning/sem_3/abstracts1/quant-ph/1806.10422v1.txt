We investigate the time evolution of an open quantum system described by a Lindblad master equation with dissipation acting only on a part of the degrees of freedom ${\cal H}_0$ of the system, and targeting a unique dark state in ${\cal H}_0$. We show that, in the Zeno limit of large dissipation, the density matrix of the system traced over the dissipative subspace ${\cal H}_0$, evolves according to another Lindblad dynamics, with renormalized effective Hamiltonian and weak effective dissipation. Moreover, the spectrum of this renormalized effective Hamiltonian evolves in time according to a classical Markov dynamics. At least in the case of one-dimensional systems with local interactions and dissipation acting near the edges, an effective Zeno dynamics is obtained for arbitrarily small dissipation strengths provided the size of the system is sufficiently large.
