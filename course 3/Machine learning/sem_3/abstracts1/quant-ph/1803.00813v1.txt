Flatbands are distinguished in that they allow the distortion-free storage of compact localized states of tailorable shape. The reliable storage sojourn of these states is, however, limited in the presence of a disorder potential, which generically gives rise to an uncontrolled coupling into dispersive bands. Analyzing the cross-stitch lattice, we find that, while detuning flatband states from band intersections allows to suppress the direct decay into dispersive bands, disorder-induced state distortion gives rise to a delayed, dephasing-mediated decay, setting a finite lifetime for the reliable storage sojourn. Our analysis relies on the time-resolved treatment of disorder-averaged quantum systems in terms of quantum master equations.
