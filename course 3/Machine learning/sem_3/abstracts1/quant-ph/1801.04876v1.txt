Using the Wigner distribution function, we analyze the behavior on phase space of generalized coherent states associated with the Morse potential (Morse-like coherent states). Within the f-deformed oscillator formalism, such states are constructed by means of the two following definitions: {\it i)} as deformed displacement operator coherent states (DOCSs) and {\it ii)} as deformed photon-added coherent states (DPACSs).
