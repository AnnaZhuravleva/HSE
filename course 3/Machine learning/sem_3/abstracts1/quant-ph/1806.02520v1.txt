The dynamics of a periodically driven system whose time evolution is governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can be perfectly stable. This finding was only obtained very recently and will be enhanced by many exact solutions discovered in this work. The main concern of this study is to investigate the adiabatic following dynamics in such non-Hermitian systems stabilized by periodic driving. We focus on the peculiar behaviour of stable cyclic (Floquet) states in the slow-driving limit. It is found that the stable cyclic states can either behave as intuitively expected by following instantaneous eigenstates, or exhibit piecewise adiabatic following by sudden-switching between instantaneous eigenstates. We aim to cover broad categories of non-Hermitian systems under a variety of different driving scenarios. We systematically analyse the sudden-switch behaviour by a universal route. That is, the sign change of the critical exponent in our asymptotic analysis of the solutions is always found to be the underlying mechanism to determine if the adiabatic following dynamics is trivial or piecewise. This work thus considerably extends our early study on the same topic [Gong and Wang, Phys. Rev. A 97, 052126 (2018)] and shall motivate more interests in non-Hermitian systems.
