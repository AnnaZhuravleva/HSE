We face the problem of pattern classification by proposing a quantum-inspired version of the widely used minimum distance classifier (i.e. the Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC)) already introduced in [31,33,28,27] and by applying this quantum-inspired classifier in a biomedical context. In particular, we show and compare the NMC and our quantum model performance to solve a problem related to classify the probability of survival for patients affected by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
