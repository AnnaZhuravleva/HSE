The logarithmic derivative (or, quantum score) of a density matrix in the quantum Cramer-Rao inequality is discussed. Then, the problem of estimating the parameters in a class of the Werner-type N-qudit states is studied. The largest value of the lower bound to the error of estimate by the quantum Fisher information is found to coincide with the separability point only in the case of two qubits. It is shown that, on the other hand, such largest values give rise to the universal fidelity that is independent of the system size.
