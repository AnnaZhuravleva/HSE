We extend the matrix decomposition method(MDM) in classifying the $2\times N\times N$ truly entangled states to $2\times M\times N$ system under the condition of stochastic local operations and classical communication. It is found that the MDM is quite practical and convenient in operation for the asymmetrical tripartite states, and an explicit example of the classification of $2\times 6\times 7$ quantum system is presented.
