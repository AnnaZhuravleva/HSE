The unavoidable effect of the environmental noise due to nuclear spins and charge traps is included in the study of the hybrid qubit dynamics. Hybrid qubit dues its name to the advantageous combination of manipulation speed of a charge qubit with the longevity of a spin qubit. It consists of three electrons confined through external gate voltages in a double quantum dot and deserves special interest in quantum computation applications due to its advantages in terms of fabrication, control and only electrical manipulation. Hybrid qubit is protected against global magnetic fluctuations since it is a decoherence-free subspace qubit. It is only affected by local fluctuations, such as the Overhauser field, in addition to charge fluctuations on the electrostatic gates. In the configuration studied, the control parameters, that are the gate voltages, are always turned on. Coherence time of the hybrid qubit is extracted when model parameters take values achievable experimentally in the nuclear free isotope $^{28}$Si, natural Si and GaAs hosts.
