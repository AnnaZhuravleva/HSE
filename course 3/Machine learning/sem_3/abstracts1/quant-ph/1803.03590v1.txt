We investigate the optimal measurement strategy for state discrimination of the trine ensemble of qubit states prepared with arbitrary prior probabilities. Our approach generates the minimum achievable probability of error and also the maximum confidence strategy. Although various cases with symmetry have been considered and solution techniques put forward in the literature, to our knowledge this is only the second such closed form, analytical, arbitrary prior, example available for the minimum-error figure of merit, after the simplest and well-known two-state example.
