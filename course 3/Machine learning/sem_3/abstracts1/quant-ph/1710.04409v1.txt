We study the behavior of monogamy deficit and monogamy asymmetry for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering of Gaussian states under the influence of the Hawking effect. We demonstrate that the monogamy of quantum steering shows an extreme scenario in the curved spacetime: the first part of a tripartite system cannot individually steer two other parties, but it can steer the collectivity of the remaining two parties. We also find that the monogamy deficit of Gaussian steering, a quantifier of genuine tripartite steering, are generated due to the influence of the Hawking thermal bath. Our results elucidate the structure of quantum steering in tripartite quantum systems in curved spacetime.
