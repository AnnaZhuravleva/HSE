The coupling between defects in diamond and a superconducting microwave resonator is studied in the nonlinear regime. Both negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy and P1 defects are explored. The measured cavity mode response exhibits strong nonlinearity near a spin resonance. Data is compared with theoretical predictions and a good agreement is obtained in a wide range of externally controlled parameters. The nonlinear effect under study in the current paper is expected to play a role in any cavity-based magnetic resonance imaging technique and to impose a fundamental limit upon its sensitivity.
