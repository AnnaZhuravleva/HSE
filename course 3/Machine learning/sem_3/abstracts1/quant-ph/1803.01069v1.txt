We demonstrate under which conditions a violation of the charge-parity (CP) symmetry in molecules will manifest itself in the Casimir-Polder interaction of these with a magnetodielectric surface. Charge-parity violation induces a specific electric-magnetic cross-polarisability in a molecule that is not chiral, but time-reversal (T) symmetry violating. As we show, a detection of such an effect via the Casimir-Polder potential requires a material medium that is also sensitive to time-reversal, i.e., it must exhibit a non-reciprocal electromagnetic response. As simple examples of such media we consider a perfectly reflecting non-reciprocal mirror that is a special case of a perfect electromagnetic conductor as well as a Chern-Simons medium. In addition, we show that Chern-Simons and related media can induce unusual atom-surface interactions for anisotropic molecules with and without a chiral response.
