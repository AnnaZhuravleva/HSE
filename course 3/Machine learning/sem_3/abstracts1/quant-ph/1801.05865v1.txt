Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are considered sensors for detecting magnetic fields. Pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is typically used to detect AC magnetic fields; however, this technique can only be implemented after careful calibration that involves aligning an external static magnetic field, measuring continuous-wave (CW) ODMR, determining the Rabi frequency, and setting the microwave phase. In contrast, CW-ODMR can be simply implemented by continuous application of green CW laser and a microwave filed. In this letter, we report a method that uses NV centers and CW-ODMR to detect AC magnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that use NV centers to detect AC magnetic fields, the proposed method requires neither a pulse sequence nor an externally applied DC magnetic field; this greatly simplifies the procedure and apparatus needed to implement this method. This method provides a sensitivity of 2.5 {\mu}T/Hz$^{1/2}$ at room temperature. Thus, this simple alternative to existing AC magnetic field sensors paves the way for a practical and feasible quantum sensor.
