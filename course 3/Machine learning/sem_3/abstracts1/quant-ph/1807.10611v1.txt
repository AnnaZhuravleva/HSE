We introduce a simple criterion for lattice models to predict quantitatively the crossover between the classical and the quantum scaling of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, as the one observed in a lattice $\phi^4$-model in 1+1 dimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 225701 (2016)]. We show that the crossover is a general feature of critical models on a lattice, by testing our paradigm on the quantum Ising model in transverse field for arbitrary spin-$s$ ($s \geq 1/2$) in 1+1 dimensions. By means of tensor network methods, we fully characterize the equilibrium properties of this model, and locate the quantum critical regions via our dynamical Ginzburg criterion. We numerically simulate the Kibble-Zurek quench dynamics and show the validity of our picture, also according to finite-time scaling analysis.
