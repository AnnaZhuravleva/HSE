We introduce the concept of fermionic matrix product operators, and show that they provide a natural representation of fermionic fusion tensor categories. This allows for the classification of two dimensional fermionic topological phases in terms of matrix product operator algebras. Using this approach we give a classification of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases with respect to a group $G$ in terms of three cohomology groups: $H^1(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$, describing which matrix product operators are of Majorana type, $H^2(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$, describing the fermionic nature of the fusion tensors that arise when two matrix product operators are multiplied, and the supercohomolgy group $\bar{H}^3(G,U(1))$ which corresponds to the associator that changes the order of fusion. We also generalize the tensor network description of the string-net ground states to the fermionic setting, yielding simple representations of a class that includes the fermionic toric code.
