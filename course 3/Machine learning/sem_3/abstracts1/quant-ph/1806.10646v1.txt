When a quantum phase transition is crossed in a finite time, critical slowing down leads to the breakdown of adiabatic dynamics and the formation of topological defects. The average density of defects scales with the quench rate following a universal power-law predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We analyze the full counting statistics of kinks and report the exact kink number distribution in the transverse-field quantum Ising model. Kink statistics is found to be sub-Poissonian with all cumulants of the distribution exhibiting a universal power-law scaling with the quench rate.
