Here we address the question of how bipartite steering violation takes place among multipartite systems (where each sub-system having Hilbert space dimension restricted to two) based on the maximal violations of the bipartite steering inequality of the reduced pairwise qubit systems. We have derived a trade-off relation which is satisfied by those pair wise bipartite maximal steering violations, which physically can be understood as providing restrictions on the distribution of steering among sub systems. For a three-qubit system, it is impossible that all pairs of qubits violate the steering inequality, and once a pair of qubits violates the steering inequality maximally, the other two pairs of qubits must both obey the steering inequality. We also present a complementarity relation between genuine entanglement present in a tripartite state and maximum bipartite steering violation by reduced states.
