In this study, we investigate the phonon antibunching effect in a coupled nonlinear micro/nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS/NEMS) resonator at a finite temperature. In the weak driving limit, the optimal condition for phonon antibunching is given by solving the stationary Liouville-von Neumann master equation. We show that at low temperature, the phonon antibunching effect occurs in the regime of weak nonlinearity and mechanical coupling, which is confirmed by analytical and numerical solutions. We also find that thermal noise can degrade or even destroy the antibunching effect for different mechanical coupling strengths. Furthermore, a transition from strong antibunching to bunching for phonon correlation has been observed in the temperature domain. Finally, we find that a suitably strong driving in the finite-temperature case would help to preserve an optimal phonon correlation against thermal noise.
