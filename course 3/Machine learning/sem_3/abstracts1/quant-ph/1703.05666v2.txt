We propose a scheme to generate macroscopic superposition states in spin ensembles, where a coherent driving field is applied to accelerate the generation of macroscopic superposition states. The numerical calculation demonstrates that this approach allows us to generate a superposition of two classically distinct states of the spin ensemble with a high fidelity above 0.96 for 300 spins. For the larger spin ensemble, though the fidelity slightly decline, it maintains above 0.85 for an ensemble of 500 spins. The time to generate a macroscopic superposition state is also numerically calculated, which shows that the significantly shortened generation time allows us to achieve such macroscopic superposition states within a typical coherence time of the system.
