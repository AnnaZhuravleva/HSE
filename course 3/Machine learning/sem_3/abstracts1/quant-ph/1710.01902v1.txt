The correspondence between classical spin models and quantum states has attracted much attention in recent years. However, it remains an open problem as to which specific spin model a given (well-known) quantum state maps to. In this Letter, we provide such an explicit correspondence for an important class of quantum states where a duality relation is proved between classical spin models and quantum Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) states. In particular, we employ graph-theoretic methods to prove that the partition function of a classical spin model on a hypergraph $H$ is equal to the inner product of a product state with a quantum CSS state on a dual hypergraph $\tilde{H}$. We next use this dual correspondence to prove that the critical behavior of the classical system corresponds to a relative robustness of the corresponding CSS state to bit-flip (and phase-flip) noise, thus called critical robustness. We finally conjecture that such critical robustness is related to the topological order in quantum CSS states, thus providing a possible practical characterization of such states.
