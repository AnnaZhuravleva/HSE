As first proposed for the adiabatic quantum information processing by Wu, Byrd and Lidar [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 057904 (2002)], the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which avoids the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that number of required steps grows much more slowly than system size if the number of the non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that the fluctuation of the parameters of optical elements does not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against errors.
