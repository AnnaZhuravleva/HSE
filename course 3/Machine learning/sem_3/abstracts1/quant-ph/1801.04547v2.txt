We study an one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice with complex hopping rates, which can be realized by a quasi-one-dimensional sawtooth-type Hermitian lattice after adiabatic elimination with proper conditions. By means of synthetic magnetic fluxes, the imaginary parts of the complex hopping rates can be modulated by additional phase, thus a non-reciprocal structure arises. With this lattice, one can realize robust unidirectional transport for both single-site and Gaussian excitations, which is immune to defects and backscattering. Furthermore, we proposed a sandwich structure based on the non-Hermitian lattice, which can be used for realizing controllable photon storage and reversal. The storage time and range can be artificially controlled within limits, and the storage efficiency can be increased via a finite gain compensation. The proposal of controllable photon transport in this paper opens up a new path for unidirectional photon transport and provides a promising platform for optical control and manipulation.
