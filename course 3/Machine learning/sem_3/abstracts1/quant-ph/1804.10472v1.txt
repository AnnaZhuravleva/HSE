More than 80 years passed since the first publication on entangled quantum states. In this period of time the concept of spookily interacting quantum states became an emerging field of science. After various experiments proving the existence of such non-classical states, visionary ideas were put forward to exploit entanglement in quantum information science and technology. These novel concepts have not yet come out of the experimental stage, mostly because of the lack of suitable, deterministic sources of entangled quantum states. Among many systems under investigation, semiconductor quantum dots are particularly appealing emitters of on-demand, single polarization-entangled photon-pairs. Although, it was originally believed that quantum dots must exhibit a limited degree of entanglement related to numerous decoherence effects present in the solid-state. Recent studies invalidated the premise of unavoidable entanglement degrading effects. We review the relevant experiments which have led to these important discoveries and discuss the remaining challenges for the anticipated quantum technologies.
