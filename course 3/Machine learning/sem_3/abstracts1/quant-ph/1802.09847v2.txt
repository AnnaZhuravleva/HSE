An on-chip photonic quantum source, especially an on-chip entangled photon source, is an essential resource for quantum information applications. Here, we report an on-chip transverse-mode entangled photon source, which is realized using spontaneous four-wave mixing processes in a multimode silicon waveguide. Transverse-mode entangled photon pairs are generated and experimentally verified with a bandwidth of $\sim 2\ THz$; a maximally transverse-mode entangled Bell state can also be produced with a fidelity of $0.92\pm0.01$. The demonstrated on-chip entangled photon source provides one of the most important key elements for developing quantum photonics using transverse-mode freedom, which can be used to encode quantum information within a high-dimensional Hilbert space. And the transverse-mode entanglement can be converted coherently to path and polarization entanglement on-chip. This paves the way to realize highly complex quantum photonic circuits with multiple degrees of freedom and plays an important role in the high-dimensional quantum information processing.
