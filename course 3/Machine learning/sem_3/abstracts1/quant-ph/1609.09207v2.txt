Separability conditions for a bipartite quantum system of finite-dimensional subsystems are formulated in terms of R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies. Entropic uncertainty relations often lead to entanglement criteria. We propose new approach based on the convolution of discrete probability distributions. Measurements on a total system are constructed of local ones according to the convolution scheme. Separability conditions are derived on the base of uncertainty relations of the Maassen-Uffink type as well as majorization relations. On each of subsystems, we use a pair of sets of subnormalized vectors that form rank-one POVMs. We also obtain entropic separability conditions for local measurements with a special structure, such as mutually unbiased bases and symmetric informationally complete measurements. The relevance of the derived separability conditions is demonstrated with several examples.
