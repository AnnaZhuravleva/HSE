We investigate a quantum spatial search problem on a fractal lattice. A recent study for the Sierpinski gasket and tetrahedron made a conjecture that the dynamics of the search on a fractal lattice is determined by spectral dimension. We tackle this problem for the Sierpinski carpet, and our simulation result supports the conjecture. We also propose a scaling hypothesis of oracle calls for the quantum amplitude amplification.
