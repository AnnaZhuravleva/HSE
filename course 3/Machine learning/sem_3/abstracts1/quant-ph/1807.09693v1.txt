In this paper, we propose three new quantum algorithms to achieve real linear combination of real quantum states. Different from other algorithms given in the past, the complexity now only depends on the number of the given quantum states, so they will play important roles in the design of quantum iteration algorithms, since this number often relates to the iteration step, which is not large in many iteration algorithms. Moreover, as an application, three new quantum algorithms to the searching problem will be discussed, which will provide us new insights into Grover's searching algorithm. We also show that the problem of linearly combing quantum states is closely related to the problem that can we efficiently implement $U^t$ for $0<t<1$ if $U$ is an efficiently implemented unitary operator? Unfortunately, this problem contains a negative answer when it has a strict requirement on the precision, which is determined by the optimality of Grover's algorithm.
