We show that the temperature of a cavity field can be drastically varied by its interaction with suitably-entangled atom pairs (dimers) traversing the cavity. Their entangled state can be simply controlled by molecular dissociation or collisions forming the dimer. Depending on the chosen state of the dimer, the cavity field can be driven to a steady-state temperature that is either much lower or higher than the ambient temperature. Hence, entangled atom dimers can serve as an advantageous quantum fuel for highly efficient photonic thermal engines.
