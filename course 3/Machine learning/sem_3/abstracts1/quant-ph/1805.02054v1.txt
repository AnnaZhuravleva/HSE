We investigate the excitation of a quantum particle shuttled in a harmonic trap with weak springconstant colored noise. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for the noise correlation function describes a wide range of possible noises, in particular for short correlation times the white-noise limit examined in Lu et al, Phys. Rev. A 89, 063414 (2014) and, by averaging over correlation times, "1/f ficker noise". We find expressions for the excitation energy in terms of static (independent of trap motion) and dynamical sensitivities, with opposite behavior with respect to shuttling time, and demonstrate that the excitation can be reduced by proper process timing and design of the trap trajectory.
