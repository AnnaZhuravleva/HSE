Understanding decoherence processes is crucial in the study of open quantum systems. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of pure-dephasing process with a newly proposed boson-boson model, namely, a bosonic field coupled to another bosonic bath in thermal equilibrium. Our model is fully solvable and can reproduce the pure-dephasing process which is usually described by the well-known spin-boson model, therefore offering a new perspective to understanding decoherence processes in open quantum systems of high dimension. We also show that this model admits a generically non-Markovian dynamics with respect to various different non-Markovian measures.
