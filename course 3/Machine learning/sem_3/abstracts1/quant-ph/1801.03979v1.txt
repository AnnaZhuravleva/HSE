We propose quantum engines powered entirely by the quantum measurement process. Our theoretical construction of the engine requires no work from the system Hamiltonian, and takes energy only from the process of observation to move a particle against a force. We present results for the work done and the efficiency for different values of the engine parameters. Feedback is required for optimal performance. We find that unit efficiency can be approached when one measurement outcome prepares the initial state of the next engine cycle, while the other outcomes leave the original state nearly unchanged.
