We demonstrate a new four-wave mixing (4WM) geometry based on structured light. By utilizing near-field diffraction through a narrow slit, the pump beam is asymmetrically structured to modify the phase matching condition, generating multi-mode output in both the spatial and frequency domains. We show that the frequency parameter enables selection of various spatial-mode outputs, including a twin-beam geometry which preserves relative intensity squeezing shared between the two beams. The results suggest that the engineering of atomic states via structured light may provide a pathway to a diverse set of quantum resources based on multi-mode squeezed light.
