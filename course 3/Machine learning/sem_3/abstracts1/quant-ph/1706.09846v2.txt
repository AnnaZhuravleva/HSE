We investigate the two lowest-lying weakly bound states of $N \leq 8$ bosons as functions of the strength of two-body Gaussian interactions. We observe the limit for validity of Efimov physics. We calculate energies and second radial moments as functions of scattering length. For identical bosons we find that two $(N-1)$-body states appear before the $N$-body ground states become bound. This pattern ceases to exist for $N \geq 7$ where the size of the ground state becomes smaller than the range of the two-body potential. All mean-square-radii for $N \geq 4$ remain finite at the threshold of zero binding, where they vary as $(N-1)^{p}$ with $p=-3/2,-3$ for ground and excited states, respectively. Decreasing the mass of one particle we find stronger binding and smaller radii. The identical particles form a symmetric system, while the lighter particle is further away in the ground states. In the excited states we find the identical bosons either surrounded or surrounding the light particle for few or many bosons, respectively. We demonstrate that the first excited states for all strengths resemble two-body halos of one particle weakly bound to a dense $N$-body system for $N=3,4$. This structure ceases to exist for $N \geq 5$.
