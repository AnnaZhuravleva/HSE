In the paper, a value assignment for projection operators relating to a quantum system is equated with assignment of truth-values to the propositions associated with these operators. In consequence, the Kochen-Specker theorem (its localized variant, to be exact) can be treated as the statement that a logic of those projection operators does not obey the principle of bivalence. This implies that such a logic has a gappy (partial) semantics or many-valued semantics.
