The class of quantum states known as Werner states have several interesting properties, which often serve to illuminate unusual properties of quantum information. Closely related to these states are the Holevo-Werner channels whose Choi matrices are Werner states. Exploiting the fact that these channels are teleportation covariant, and therefore simulable by teleportation, we compute the ultimate precision in the adaptive estimation of their channel-defining parameter. Similarly, we bound the minimum error probability affecting the adaptive discrimination of any two of these channels. In this case, we prove an analytical formula for the quantum Chernoff bound which also has a direct counterpart for the class of depolarizing channels. Our work exploits previous methods established in [Pirandola and Lupo, PRL 118, 100502 (2017)] to set the metrological limits associated with this interesting class of quantum channels at any finite dimension.
