We address the long-standing controversy regarding the correct description of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor in media and its consequences for the Casimir force. The latter being due to the zero-point momentum of the electromagnetic field, competing approaches based on the Abraham or Maxwell stress tensor lead to different predictions. We consider the test scenario of two colloidal spherical particles submerged in a dielectric medium and use three criteria to distinguish the two approaches: we show that the Abraham stress tensor, and not the Maxwell stress tensor, leads to a Casimir force that is form-equivalent to Casimir-Polder and van der Waals forces, obeys duality as a fundamental symmetry and is consistent with microscopic many-body calculations.
