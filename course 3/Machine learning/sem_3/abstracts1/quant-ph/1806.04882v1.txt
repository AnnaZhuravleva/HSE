To study the trade-off between information and disturbance, we obtain the first and second derivatives of the disturbance with respect to information for a fundamental class of quantum measurements. We focus on measurements lying on the boundaries of the physically allowed regions in four information--disturbance planes, using the derivatives to investigate the slopes and curvatures of these boundaries and hence clarify the shapes of the allowed regions.
