Clifford circuits play an important role in quantum computation. Gottesman and Chuang proposed a gate teleportation protocol so that a quantum circuit can be implemented by the teleportation circuit with specific ancillary qubits. In particular, an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit $U$ can be implemented by preparing an ancillary stabilizer state $(I\otimes U)|\Phi^+\rangle^{\otimes n}$ for teleportation and doing a Pauli correction conditioned on the measurement. In this paper, we provide an alternative procedure to implement a Clifford circuit through Pauli measurements, by preparing $O(1)$ ancillas that are Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) stabilizer states. That is to say, $O(1)$ CSS states are sufficient to implement any Clifford circuit. As an application to fault-tolerant quantum computation, any Clifford circuit can be implemented by $O(1)$ steps of Steane syndrome extraction if clean CSS stabilizer states are available.
