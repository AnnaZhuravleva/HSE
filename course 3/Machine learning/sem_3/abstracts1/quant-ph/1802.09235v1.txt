Clocks play a special role at the interface of general relativity and quantum mechanics. We analyze a clock-interferometry thought experiment and go on to theoretically derive and experimentally test a complementarity relation for quantum clocks in the context of the gravitational time lag. We study this relation in detail and discuss its application to various types of quantum clocks.
