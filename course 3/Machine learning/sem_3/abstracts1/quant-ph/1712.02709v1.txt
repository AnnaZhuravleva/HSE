The two-time correlation function for probe spin interacting with spin system (bath) is studied. We show that zeros of this function correspond to zeros of partition function of spin system in complex magnetic field. The obtained relation gives new possibility to observe the Lee-Yang zeros experimentally. Namely, we show that measuring of the time dependence of correlation function allows direct experimental observation of the Lee-Yang zeros.
