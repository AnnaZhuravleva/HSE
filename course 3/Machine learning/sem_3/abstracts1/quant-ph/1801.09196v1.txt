In this paper, we construct the $m$-photon-added and $m$-photon-subtracted coherent states on a sphere. These states are shown to satisfy the usual conditions of continuity in the label, normalizability and the resolution of identity. The preparation of the constructed states, as the states of radiation field is considered. We examine and analyze the nonclassical properties of these states, including the photon mean number, Mandel parameter and quadrature squeezing. We find that these states are sub-Poissonian in nature, whereas the degree of squeezing is reduced (enhanced) by increasing $m$ for the photon-added (photon-subtracted) coherent states on a sphere.
