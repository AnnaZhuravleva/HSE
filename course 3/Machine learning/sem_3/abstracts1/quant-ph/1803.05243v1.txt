We examine a simple scheme to generate genuine multipartite entangled states across disjoint qubit registers. We employ a shuttle qubit that is sequentially coupled, in an energy preserving manner, to the constituents within each register through a cascade of interactions. We establish that stable $W$-type entanglement can be generated among all qubits within the registers. Furthermore, we find that the entanglement is sensitive to how the shuttle is discarded, showing that a significantly larger degree is achieved by performing projective measurements on it. Finally, we assess the resilience of this entanglement generation protocol to several types of noise and imperfections, showing that it is remarkably robust.
