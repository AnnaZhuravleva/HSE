The size of quantum information -- or entanglement -- transfer rates between subsystems is a generic question in problems ranging from decoherence in quantum computation and sensing, to quantum underpinnings of thermodynamics, to the behavior of quantum black holes. We investigate such rates for given couplings between subsystems, for sufficiently random subsystem evolution, and find evidence for a conjectured relation of these rates to the size of the couplings. This provides a direct connection between entanglement transfer and the microphysical couplings responsible for it.
