Cavity-enhanced single photon sources exhibit mode-locked biphoton states with comb-like correlation functions. Our ultrabright source additionally emits either single photon pairs or two-photon NOON states, dividing the output into an even and an odd comb respectively. With even-comb photons we demonstrate revivals of the typical non-classical Hong-Ou-Mandel interference up to the 84th dip, corresponding to a path length difference exceeding 100 m. With odd-comb photons we observe single photon interference fringes modulated over twice the displacement range of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference.
