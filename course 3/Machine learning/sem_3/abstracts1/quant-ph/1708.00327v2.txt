We investigate a model of a supposedly ideal clock based on the decay rate of a charged particle in circular motion in a constant magnetic field. We show that the time measured by an ideal clock depends on the acceleration. However, the effect becomes visible at an order of magnitude of 10^{28} g, therefore confirming the validity of the ideal clock hyphotesis for realistic accelerations.
