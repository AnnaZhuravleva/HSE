Different non-classicality criteria expressed in the form of inequalities among intensity moments and elements of photon-number distributions are applied to noisy twin beams and other two-mode states obtained from a twin beam by using a beam splitter. Their performance in revealing the non-classicality is judged in comparison with the exact results provided by suitable entanglement and local non-classicality quantifiers. Whereas the non-classicality of noisy twin beams is always revealed by these criteria, not all the nonclassical states obtained at the output of the beam splitter can be identified by these experimentally easily reachable criteria.
