While the ability to measure low temperatures accurately in quantum systems is important in a wide range of experiments, the possibilities and the fundamental limits of quantum thermometry are not yet fully understood theoretically. Here we develop a general approach to low-temperature quantum thermometry, taking into account restrictions arising not only from the sample but also from the measurement process. This leads to a simple condition under which the uncertainty in the temperature measurement must diverge exponentially with decreasing temperature, as seen in previous works. When this condition is not satisfied, a better scaling becomes possible, even with restricted measurement access. Our approach allows us to identify the mechanism that enables this advantage, which is ultimately limited by the third law of thermodynamics. We illustrate this effect in the case of thermometry on a fermionic tight-binding chain with access to only two lattice sites, where we find a quadratic divergence of the uncertainty. We also give illustrative examples of ideal quantum gases and a square-lattice Ising model, highlighting the role of phase transitions.
