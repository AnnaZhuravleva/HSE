The quantum regime in acoustic systems is a focus of recent fundamental research in the new field of Quantum Acoustodynamics (QAD). Systems based on surface acoustic waves having an advantage of easy integration in two-dimensions are particularly promising for the demonstration of novel effects in QAD and development of novel devices of quantum acousto-electronics. We demonstrate the vacuum mode of the surface acoustic wave resonator by coupling it to a superconducting artificial atom. The artificial atom is implemented into the resonator formed by two Brag mirrors. The results are consistent with expectations supported by the system model and our calculations. This work opens the way to map analogues of quantum optical effects into acoustic systems.
