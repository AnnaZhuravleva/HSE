Nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators are necessary to protect sensitive apparatus from unwanted noise. Recently, a variety of alternatives were proposed to replace ferrite-based commercial technologies, with the motivation to be integrated with microwave superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we review isolators realized with microwave optomechanical circuits and present a gyrator-based picture to develop an intuition on the origin of nonreciprocity in these systems. Such nonreciprocal optomechanical schemes show promise as they can be extended to circulators and directional amplifiers, with perspectives to reach the quantum limit in terms of added noise.
