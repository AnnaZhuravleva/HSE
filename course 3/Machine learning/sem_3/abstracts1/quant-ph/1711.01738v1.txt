We propose an on-chip source of entangled photon pairs that uses an arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) with multiple nonlinear input waveguides as correlated photon pair sources. The AWG wavelength-demultiplexes photon pairs created in input waveguides and simultaneously produces a high-dimensional entangled state encoded in the optical path. We implemented the device with a monolithic silicon-silica waveguide integration platform and demonstrated the entanglement of two dimensions in a proof-of-principle experiment.
