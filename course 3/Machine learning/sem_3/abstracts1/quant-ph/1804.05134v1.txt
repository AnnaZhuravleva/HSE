Periodically-driven topological phases have attracted considerable attentions in condensed matters, but experimental demonstration of such driven quantum systems with anomalous topological phases remains a great challenge. Here, a photonic Floquet simulator (PFS) was designed and systematically investigated to study engineered topological phases in a periodically-driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The PFS was composed of an ultra-thin coupled microwave waveguide array with periodically-bending profiles, and was thoroughly tested the quantum transition from the adiabatic limit (slow-driving) to the high-frequency limit (fast-driving). Surprisingly, between the two opposite limits, a robust periodically-driven end state, propagating along the boundary but periodically emerging into/from the bulk of the array, was experimentally observed for the first time. Theoretically, we demonstrated that this driven end state is the topological protected anomalous {\pi}-mode, and appears only at certain driving frequencies and Floquet gauges (i.e., input positions). Our experimental realization of 'topological Floquet engineering' will prompt great interest in periodically-driven topological phases in the fields of photonics, condensed matters and ultra-cold atoms.
