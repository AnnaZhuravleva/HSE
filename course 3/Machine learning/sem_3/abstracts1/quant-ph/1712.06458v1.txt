The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has become increasingly of great interest in studying exotic non-fermi liquid states without quasiparticle excitations, holography duality to Einstein gravity, and quantum chaos. However, the unnatural form of its Hamiltonian, including its strong randomness and fully nonlocal fermion interaction, makes its experimental investigation an intractable challenge. A promising solution to overcome this challenge is quantum simulation, whose role will be more pronounced particularly in the future when more qubits can be handled. We have enough control to demonstrate a first step towards quantum simulation of this system. We observed the fermion paring instability of the non-Fermi liquid state and the chaotic-nonchaotic transition at simulated temperatures, as was predicted by previous theory. These results demonstrate the feasibility of experimentally simulating the SYK model. It opens a new experimental avenue towards investigating the key features of non-Fermi liquid states, as well as the quantum chaotic systems and the AdS/CFT duality, thanks to the rich physics of the SYK model.
