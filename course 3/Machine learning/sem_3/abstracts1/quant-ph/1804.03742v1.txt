We consider open quantum systems with factorized, non-Gaussian initial states, and we provide the conditions such that the reduced dynamics is completely positive (CP) and trace preserving (TP), in terms of environment cumulants. We then consider the class of linear stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations characterized by sets of colored stochastic processes (with n-th order cumulants), and we obtain the conditions such that they provide CPTP dynamics. We further provide a novel description of Gaussian non-Markovian unravellings that does not make use of the functional derivative and that displays a recursive structure. Moreover, for the family of quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians, we are able to provide an explicit operatorial dependence for the unravelling.
