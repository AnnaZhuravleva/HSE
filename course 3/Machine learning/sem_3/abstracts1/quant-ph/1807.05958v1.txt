Hypothesis testing is an important task in mathematics, physics, computer science, etc. Hypothesis testing of two random variables is related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the two corresponding distributions. Similarly, quantum hypothesis testing of two quantum states is characterised by the quantum relative entropy. While a quantum state can be abstracted as a device that only has outputs but no inputs, the most general quantum device is a quantum channel that also has inputs. In this work, we extend hypothesis testing to general quantum channels. In both the one-shot and asymptotic scenario, we propose several quantifiers for hypothesis testing under different assumptions of how the channels are used. As the quantifiers are analog to the quantum relative entropy of states, we also call them the quantum relative entropy of channels. We investigate the properties that the quantum relative entropy of channels should satisfy and study its interplay with entanglement. We also consider several special examples for unitary channels and demolition measurements. With the broad applications of the quantum relative entropy of states, our results may be useful for understanding general properties of quantum channels.
