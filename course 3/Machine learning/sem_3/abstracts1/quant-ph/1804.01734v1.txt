Hardy's axiomatic approach to the quantum theory of discrete Hilbert Spaces reveals that just one principle distinguishes it from classical probability theory: there should be continuous (and hence infinitesimal) reversible transformations between any pair of pure states - the single word `continuous' giving rise to quantum theory. This raises the question: Can one formulate a finite theory of qubit physics (FTQP) - necessary different from quantum theory - which can replicate the tested predictions of quantum theory of qubits to experimental accuracy? Here we show that an FTQP based on complex Hilbert vectors with rational squared amplitudes and rational phase angles is possible, provided the metric of state space, $g_p$, is based on $p$-adic rather than Euclidean distance. A key number theorem describing an incompatibility between rational angles and rational cosines accounts for quantum complementarity in this FTQP. Dynamical evolution is described by a deterministic mapping on the set of $p$-adic integers and the measurement problem is trivially solved in terms of a nonlinear clustering of states in state space. Based on $g_p$, causal deterministic analyses of quantum interferometry, GHZ, the sequential Stern-Gerlach experiment, Leggett-Garg and the Bell Theorem are described. The close relationship between fractals and $p$-adic integers suggest the existence of a primal fractal-like 'invariant set' geometry $I_U$ in cosmological state space, from which space-time and the laws of physics in space-time are emergent.
