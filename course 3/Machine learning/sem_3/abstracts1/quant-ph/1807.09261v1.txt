The dynamical generation of complex correlations in quantum many-body systems is of renewed interest in the context of quantum chaos, where the out-of-time-ordered (OTO) correlation function appears as a convenient measure of scrambling. To detect the the transition from scrambling to many-body localization, the latter of which has limited dynamical complexity and is often classically simulatable, we develop both exact and approximate methods to compute OTO correlators for arbitrary universal quantum circuits. We take advantage of the mapping of quantum circuits to the dynamics of interacting fermions in one dimension, as Gaussian time evolution supplemented by quartic interaction gates. In this framework, the OTO correlator can be calculated exactly as a superposition of exponentially many Gaussian-fermionic trajectories in the number of interaction gates. We develop a variationally-optimized, Gaussian approximation to the spatial propagation of an initially-local operator by restriction to the fastest-traveling fermionic modes, in a similar spirit as light-front computational methods in quantum field theory. We demonstrate that our method can detect the many-body localization transitions of generally time-dependent dynamics without the need for perturbatively weak interactions.
