Resonant spontaneous bremsstrahlung of an electron scattered by a nucleus in the field of two moderately strong pulsed laser waves is studied theoretically. The process is studied in detail within the interference kinematic region. This region is determined by scattering of particles in the same plane at predetermined angles, at that stimulated absorption and emission of photons of external pulsed waves by an electron occurs in correlated manner. The correspondence between the emission angle and the final-electron energy is established in the kinematic region where the resonant parametric interference effect is manifested. The resonant differential cross section of ENSB process with simultaneous registration of both emission angles of the spontaneous photon and the scattered electron, can exceed by 4-5 orders of magnitude the corresponding cross section in the absence of an external field. It was shown for nonrelativistic electrons that the resonant cross section of ENSB in the field of two pulsed laser waves within the interference region in two order of magnitude may exceed corresponding cross section in the Bunkin-Fedorov kinematic region. The obtained results may be experimentally verified, for example, by scientific facilities at sources of pulsed laser radiation (SLAC, FAIR, XFEL, ELI).
