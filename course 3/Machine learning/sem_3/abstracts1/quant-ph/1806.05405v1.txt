We examine the problem of determining if a 2-local Hamiltonian is stoquastic by local basis changes. We analyze this problem for two-qubit Hamiltonians, presenting some basic tools and giving a concrete example where using unitaries beyond Clifford rotations is required in order to decide stoquasticity. We report on simple results for $n$-qubit Hamiltonians with identical 2-local terms on bipartite graphs. We give an efficient algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary $n$-qubit XYZ Heisenberg Hamiltonian is stoquastic by local basis changes, which is our most significant result. We also present some evidence that the problem of deciding stoquasticity by local basis changes for a 2-local Hamiltonian $H$ is hard by proving that deciding whether $H$ can be made real by local Clifford rotations is NP-complete.
