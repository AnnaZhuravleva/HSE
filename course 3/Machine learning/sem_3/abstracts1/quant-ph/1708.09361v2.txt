The Heisenberg scaling is typically associated with nonclassicality and entanglement. In this work, however, we discuss how classical long-range correlations between lattice sites in many-body systems may lead to a 1/N scaling in precision with the number of probes. In particular, we show that networks of coupled single qubit lasers can be mapped onto a classical XY model, and a Heisenberg scaling with the number of sites appears when estimating the amplitude and phase of a weak periodic driving field.
