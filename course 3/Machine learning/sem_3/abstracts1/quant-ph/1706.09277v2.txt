We propose a scheme that is able to generate the microwave controlled optical double optome-chanical induced transparency (OMIT) in a hybrid piezo-optomechanical cavity system, which a piezoelectric optomechanical crystal AlN-nanobeam resonator is placed in a superconducting microwave cavity, and the AlN-nanobeam resonator can be simultaneously driven by both the optical field via the radiation pressure and the microwave field via the piezoelectric interaction. We show that in the presence of a strong pumped optical field applied to the optomechanical crystal cavity through the optical waveguide and an intensely stimulated microwave field applied to the superconducting microwave cavity, a double-OMIT window can be observed in the weak output probe field. The mechanism is that a N-type four-level system can be formed by the system, when two driving fields and a probe field are applied to the corresponding levels, under the effect of quantum interference between different energy level pathways, the third-order nonlinear absorption is enhanced by the constructive quantum interference while the linear absorption is inhibited by the destruc- tive quantum interference, as a result, the double-OMIT window is generated. Our scheme can be applied to realize high-speed optical switches, high-resolution spectroscopy, coherent population trapping or quantum information processing in the solid state quantum systems.
