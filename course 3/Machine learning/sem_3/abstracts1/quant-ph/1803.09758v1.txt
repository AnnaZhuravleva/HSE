Flag qubits have recently been proposed in syndrome extraction circuits to detect high-weight errors arising from fewer faults. The use of flag qubits allows the construction of fault-tolerant protocols with the fewest number of ancillas known to-date. In this work, we prove some critical properties of CSS codes constructed from classical cyclic codes that enable the construction of a flag fault-tolerant error correction scheme. We then develop a fault-tolerant protocol as well as a family of circuits for flag fault-tolerant error correction requiring only four ancilla qubits and applicable to distance-three CSS codes constructed from classical cyclic codes.
