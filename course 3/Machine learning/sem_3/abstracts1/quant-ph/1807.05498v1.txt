Schr\"odinger-cat states are remarkable in that the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Such states usually refer to systems in a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states regardless of the number of particles or modes involved. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the preparation of a photonic Schr\"odinger-cat state in the Hilbert space formed by the orbital angular momentum(OAM) of the photon. In our scheme, the cat state is naturally divided into two distinct spatially Gaussian packets and easily evolved from 'kitten' to 'cat' by the OAM superposition states. Such performances are flexible and hardly to achieve by other schemes. Moreover, we examine its coherence property by varying the equivalent propagation loss of the channel. Even with a loss of 12 dB, the coherence of cat states is preserved because it lies in the OAM space. Our demonstration shows a means to manipulate such cat states.
