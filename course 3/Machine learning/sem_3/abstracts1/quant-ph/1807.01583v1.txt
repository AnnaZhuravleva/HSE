The work presented here is a continuation of the relational formulation of quantum mechanics. Relational formulation of quantum mechanics is based on the idea that relational properties among quantum systems, instead of the independent properties of a quantum system, are the most fundamental elements to construct quantum mechanics. In the earlier works, basic framework is formulated to derive quantum probability, Born's Rule, Schr\"{o}dinger Equations, and measurement theory. This paper gives a concrete calculation of the relational probability amplitude by extending the path integral formulation. The implementation not only clarifies the physical meaning of the relational probability amplitude, but also gives a coordination representation of the reduced density matrix of the observed system. Such coordination representation is shown valuable to describe the interaction history of the measured system and a series of measuring systems. More interestingly, it allows us to develop a method to calculate entanglement entropy based on path integral and influence functional. Criteria of entanglement is proposed based on the properties of influence functional, which may be used to determine entanglement due to interaction between a quantum system and a classical field.
