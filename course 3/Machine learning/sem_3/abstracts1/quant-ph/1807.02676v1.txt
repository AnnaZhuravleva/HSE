The analytically exact solutions to the mixed quantum Rabi model including both one- and two-photon terms are found by using Bogoliubov operators. Transcendental functions in terms of $4 \times 4$ determinants responsible for the exact solutions are derived. These so-called $G$-functions with pole structure can be reduced to the previous ones in the unmixed models. The zeros of $G$-functions reproduce completely the regular spectra. The exceptional eigenvalues can be also obtained by another transcendental function. From the pole structure, we can derive two energy limits when the two-photon coupling strength tends to the collapse point $1/2$. Surprisingly, all energy levels only collapse to the lower one, which diverges negatively. All the level crossings in the unmixed models are relaxed to avoided crossings in the present mixed model due to absence of parity symmetry. Very interestingly, the effective one-photon coupling is enhanced in the presence of the two-photon coupling, which paves a highly efficient and economic way to access the deep-strong coupling regime even though the original one-photon coupling is weak.
