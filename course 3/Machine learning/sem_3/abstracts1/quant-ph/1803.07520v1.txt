Detection and control of single rare-earth dopants in solids is an important step towards quantum devices that take full advantage of the outstanding coherence properties of rare-earth ions in both optical and spin degrees of freedom. Coupling the 4f-4f transitions of ions to photonic resonators with highly confined optical modes provides an effective approach to overcome their weak photoluminescence emission and poor photon collection efficiency, which have so far hindered the experimental progress on optical isolation and control of single rare-earth emitters. Here we demonstrate a nanophotonic platform based on a yttrium orthovanadate (YVO) photonic crystal nanobeam resonator coupled to spectrally resolved individual neodymium (Nd$^{3+}$) ions. The strong emission enhancement in the nanocavity enables optical addressing of single Nd$^{3+}$ ions. The ions show near-radiatively-limited single photon emissions. The measured high coupling strength between a single photon and the ion allows for optical Rabi oscillations and a high coupling cooperativity, which could enable optically controlled spin qubits, quantum logic gates, and spin-photon interfaces in future quantum networks.
