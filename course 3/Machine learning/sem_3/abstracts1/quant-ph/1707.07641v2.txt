We propose a new type of a Heisenberg-limited quantum interferometer, whose input is indistinguishably photon-subtracted twin beams. Such an interferometer can yield Heisenberg-limited performance while at the same time giving a direct fringe reading, unlike for the twin-beam input of the Holland-Burnett interferometer. We propose a feasible experimental realization, using a nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator above threshold.
