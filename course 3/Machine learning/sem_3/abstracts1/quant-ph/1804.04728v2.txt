We theoretically investigate the implementation of the two-mode squeezing operator in circuit quantum electrodynamics. Inspired by a previous scheme for optical cavities [Phys. Rev. A $\textbf{73}$, 043803(2006)], we employ a superconducting qubit coupled to two nondegenerate quantum modes and use a driving field on the qubit to adequately control the resonator-qubit interaction. Based on the generation of two-mode squeezed vacuum states, firstly we analyze the validity of our model in the ideal situation and then we investigate the influence of the dissipation mechanisms on the generation of the two-mode squeezing operation, namely the qubit and resonator mode decays and qubit dephasing. We show that our scheme allows the generation of highly squeezed states even with the state-of-the-art parameters, leading to a theoretical prediction of more than 10 dB of two-mode squeezing. Furthermore, our protocol is able to squeeze an arbitrary initial state of the resonators, which makes our scheme attractive for future applications in continuous-variable quantum information processing and quantum metrology in the realm of circuit quantum electrodynamics.
