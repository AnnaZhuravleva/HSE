We provide an alternative proof of Wallman's \cite{Wallman2018} bounds on the effect of gate-dependent noise on randomized benchmarking (RB). Our primary insight is that a RB sequence is a convolution amenable to Fourier space analysis, and we adopt the mathematical framework of Fourier transforms of matrix-valued functions on groups established in recent work from Gowers and Hatami \cite{GH15}. We show explicitly that as long as our faulty gate-set is close to some representation of the Clifford group, an RB sequence is described by the exponential decay of a process that has exactly two eigenvalues close to one and the rest close to zero, even though the bounds with respect to any particular representation of the Clifford group may not tightly describe the rate of decay. This framework reveals some very provocative properties of maximally entangled states, and likely has applications in other areas of quantum information theory.
