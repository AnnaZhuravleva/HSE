We afford an experimentally feasible platform to study Boltzmann negative temperatures. Our proposal takes advantage of well-known techniques of engineering Hamiltonian to achieve steady states with highly controllable population inversion. Our model is completely general and can be applied in a number of contexts, such as trapped ions, cavity-QED, quantum dot coupled to optical cavities, circuit-QED, and so on. To exemplify, we use Hamiltonian models currently used in optical cavities and trapped ion domain, where the level of precision achieved the control of the freedom degrees of a single atom inside a cavity/trapped ion. We show several interesting effects such as absence of thermalization between systems with inverted population and cooling by heating in these unconventional systems.
