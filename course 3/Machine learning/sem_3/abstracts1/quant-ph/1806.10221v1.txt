Quantum computers can potentially solve problems that are computationally intractable on a classical computer in polynomial time using quantum-mechanical effects such as superposition and entanglement. The N-Queens Problem is a notable example that falls under the class of NP-complete problems. It involves the arrangement of N chess queens on an N x N chessboard such that no queen attacks any other queen, i.e. no two queens are placed along the same row, column or diagonal. The best time complexity that a classical computer has achieved so far in generating all solutions of the N-Queens Problem is of the order O(N!). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to generate all solutions to the N-Queens Problem for a given N in polynomial time of order O(N^3) and polynomial memory of order O(N^2) on a quantum computer. We simulate the 4-queens problem and demonstrate its application to satellite communication using IBM Quantum Experience platform.
