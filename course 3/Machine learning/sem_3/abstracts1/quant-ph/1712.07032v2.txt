We combine the formalisms of Floquet theory and full counting statistics with a Markovian embedding strategy to access the dynamics and thermodynamics of a periodically driven thermal machine beyond the conventional Born-Markov approximation. The working medium is a two-level system and we drive the tunneling as well as the coupling to one bath with the same period. We identify four different operating regimes of our machine which include a heat engine and a refrigerator. As the coupling strength with one bath is increased, the refrigerator regime disappears, the heat engine regime narrows and their efficiency and coefficient of performance decrease. Furthermore, our model can reproduce the setup of laser cooling of trapped ions in a specific parameter limit.
