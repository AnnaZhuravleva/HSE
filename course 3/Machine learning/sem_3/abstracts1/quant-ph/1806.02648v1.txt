It has recently been shown [Rossi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 123603 (2017); ibid. 120, 073601 (2018)] that feedback--controlled in--loop light can be used to enhance the efficiency of optomechanical systems. We analyse the theoretical ground at the basis of this approach and explore its potentialities and limitations. We discuss the validity of the model, analyse the properties of in-loop cavities and we show how they can be used to observe coherent optomechanical oscillations also with weakly coupled system, improve the sideband cooling performance, and increase ponderomotive squeezing.
