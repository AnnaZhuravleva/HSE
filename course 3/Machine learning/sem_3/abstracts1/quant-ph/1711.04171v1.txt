In the recent paper, Ref. 1, the l-waves Schr\"odinger equation for the Cornell's potential is solved in quantum mechanics with a generalized uncertainty principle by following Ref. 2. It is showed here that the approach of Ref. 2 can only be used for the s-waves, and then the solution given in Ref. 1 would be true only in the special case l=0. Furthermore, it is highlighted that the abstract and the conclusion of Ref. 1 do not accurately reflect the results of the paper.
