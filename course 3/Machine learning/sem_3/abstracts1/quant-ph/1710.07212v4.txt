One of the reasons for the heated debates around the interpretations of quantum theory is a simple confusion between the notions of formalism versus interpretation. In this note, we make a clear distinction between them and show that there are actually two inequivalent quantum formalisms, namely the relative-state formalism and the standard formalism with the Born and measurement-update rules. We further give a pseudo-probabilistic reading of the relative-state formalism and discuss how Wigner's-friend-type experiments could possibly decide that formalism em versus the standard one. The feasibility in principle of such experiments, however, remains an open question.
