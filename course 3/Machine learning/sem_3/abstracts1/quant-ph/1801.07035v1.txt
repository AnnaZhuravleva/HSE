Active quantum error correction has been identified as a crucial ingredient of future quantum computers, motivating the recent experimental efforts to encode logical quantum bits using small topological codes. In addition to the demonstration of the beneficial role of the encoding, a break-even point in the progress towards large-scale quantum computers will be the implementation of a universal set of gates. This mid-term challenge will soon be faced by various quantum technologies, which urges the need of realistic assessments of their prospects. In this work, we pursue this goal by assessing the capability of current trapped-ion architectures in facing one of the most demanding parts of this quest: the implementation of an entangling CNOT gate between encoded logical qubits. We present a detailed comparative study of two alternative strategies for trapped-ion topological color codes, either a transversal or a lattice-surgery approach, characterized by a detailed microscopic modeling of both current technological capabilities and experimental sources of noise afflicting the different operations. Our careful fault-tolerant design, together with a low-resource optimization, allows us to determine via exhaustive numerical simulations the experimental regimes where each of the approaches becomes favorable. We hope that our study thereby contributes to guiding the future development of trapped-ion quantum computers.
