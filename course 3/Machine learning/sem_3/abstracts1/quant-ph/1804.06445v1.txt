A measure of quantum non-Markovianity for an open system dynamics, based on revivals of the distinguishability between system states, has been introduced in the literature using the trace distance as quantifier for distinguishability. Recently it has been suggested to use as measure for the distinguishability of quantum states the trace norm of Helstrom matrices, given by weighted differences of statistical operators. Here we show that this new approach, which generalizes the original one, is consistent with the interpretation of information flow between the system and its environment associated to the original definition. To this aim we prove a bound on the growth of the external information, that is information which cannot be accessed by performing measurements on the system only, as quantified by means of the Helstrom matrix. We further demonstrate by means of example that it is of relevance in generalizing schemes for the local detection of initial correlations based on the increase of internal information. Finally we exploit this viewpoint to show the optimality of a previously introduced strategy for the local detection of quantum correlations.
