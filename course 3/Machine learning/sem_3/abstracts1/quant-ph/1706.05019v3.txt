Entanglement polytopes have been recently proposed as the way of witnessing the SLOCC multipartite entanglement classes using single particle information. We present first asymptotic results concerning feasibility of this approach for large number of qubits. In particular we show that entanglement polytopes of $L$-qubit system accumulate in the distance $\frac{1}{2\sqrt{L}}$ from the point corresponding to the maximally mixed reduced one-qubit density matrices. This implies existence of a possibly large region where many entanglement polytopes overlap, i.e where the witnessing power of entanglement polytopes is weak. Moreover, the witnessing power cannot be strengthened by any entanglement distillation protocol as for large $L$ the required purity is above current capability.
