In this work we demonstrate numerically that the nonlinearity provided by a continuously driven two-level system (TLS) allows for the generation of Wigner negative states of the electromagnetic field confined in one spatial dimension. Here we focus on the steady-state emission from the TLS. Wigner negative states, a.k.a. Wigner nonclassical states, are desirable for quantum information protocols beyond the scope of classical computers. Assuming a coherent drive, we study under which conditions the field scattered by the TLS is characterized by a negative Wigner function.
