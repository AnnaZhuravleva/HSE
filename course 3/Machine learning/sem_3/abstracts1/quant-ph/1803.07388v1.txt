The thermodynamical entropy of a system which consists of different kinds of ideal gases is known to be defined successfully in the case when the differences are described by classical or quantum theory. Since these theories are special examples in the framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), it is natural to generalize the definition of the thermodynamical entropy to systems where the internal degrees of particles are described by other possible theories. In this paper, we consider in GPTs a family of the regular polygon theories, which can be regarded as intermediate theories between classical and quantum theory, and prove that the operationally natural thermodynamical entropy of mixing does not exist in those theories.
