We derive the theory of open quantum system dynamics intervened by a series of nonselective measurements. We analyze the cases of time independent and time dependent Hamiltonian dynamics in between the measurements and find the approximate master equation in the stroboscopic limit. We also consider a situation, in which the measurement basis changes in time, and illustrate it by nonselective measurements in the basis of diabatic states of the Landau-Zener model.
