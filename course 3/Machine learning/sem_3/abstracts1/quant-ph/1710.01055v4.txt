In this paper, we address the issue of enhancing coherence of a state under stochastic strictly incoherent operations. Based on the $l_1$ norm of coherence, we obtain the maximal value of coherence that can be achieved for a state undergoing a stochastic strictly incoherent operation and the maximal probability of obtaining the maximal coherence. Our findings indicate that a pure state can be transformed into a maximally coherent state under a stochastic strictly incoherent operation if and only if all the components of the pure state are nonzero while a mixed state can never be transformed into a maximally coherent state under a stochastic strictly incoherent operation.
