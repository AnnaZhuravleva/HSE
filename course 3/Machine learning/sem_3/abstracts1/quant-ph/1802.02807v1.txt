For studying quantum phenomena in time, it is vital to have a profound understanding of the classical dynamics. For this reason, we derive equations of motions describing the classical propagation of a quantum system. A comparison of this classical evolution with the actual temporal behavior enables us to identify quantum effects of the evolution itself and distinguish them from static quantum features and quantum phenomena for a single point in time. As applications of our universal technique, we analyze nonlinear processes in quantum optics, semi-classical models, and the multipartite entanglement dynamics of macroscopic ensembles.
