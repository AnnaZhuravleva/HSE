We propose and experimentally demonstrate that a Mach-Zehnder interferometer composed of polarized beam splitters and a pentaprism in the place of one of the mirrors works as a linear optical quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. To perform the information processing, the polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the photons act as the control and target qubits, respectively. The readout process is simple, requiring only a linear polarizer and a triangular diffractive aperture before detection. The viability and stability of the experiment makes the present proposal a valuable candidate for future implementations in optical quantum computation protocols.
