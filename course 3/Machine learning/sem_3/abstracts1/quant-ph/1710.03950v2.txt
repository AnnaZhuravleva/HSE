We propose a disturbance-free measurement using a `weak-value' scheme, in which a weakly measured quantum system is post-seleceted (to the initial state) to confirm that there is no disturbance. The probability of obtaining the non-disturbed state is asymptotically close to unity. We theoretically show that outcomes of the disturbance-free measurement for a two-qubit state exhibit classical behavior in the sense that they satisfy the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality. We experimentally demonstrate the test for a typical (maximally entangled) two-qubit state based on linear optical system. In experiments, polarization-entangled photon-pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion process are measured by instruments such as strength-variable polarization-measurement apparatuses and a fiber-based Bell state analyzer.
