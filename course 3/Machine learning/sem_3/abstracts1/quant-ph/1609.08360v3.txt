The theory of quantum games permits players to choose strategies that prepare and measure quantum states. Whereas conventional game theory provides guarantees for fixed-point stability in non-cooperative games, so-called Nash equilibria, we find this guarantee is not provided for quantum games. In particular, we show the conditions for Glickberg's fixed-point theorem do not apply to pure quantum games when the payoff is a physical observable. We further show that Nash equilibrium can be guaranteed when the payoff is defined with respect to state preparation.
