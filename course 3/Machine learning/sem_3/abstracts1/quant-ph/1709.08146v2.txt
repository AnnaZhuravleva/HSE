The Abbe's diffraction limit restricts the resolution of an optical imaging and lithography system. Coherent Rabi oscillation is shown to be able to overcome the diffraction limit in both optical and atom lithography. In previous studies, semiclassical theory is applied where the driving field is treated as a classical light and quantum fluctuation is neglected. Here, we show that the quantum fluctuation may reduce the visibility of the superresolution pattern. However, by squeezing the photon number fluctuation we are able to significantly increase its visibility.
