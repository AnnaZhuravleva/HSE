Entanglement is a crucial resource for quantum communication networks. Of particular relevance is the ability to distribute entanglement between remote systems that can also serve as quantum memories. Previous realizations have utilized atomic systems including warm and cold vapors, atoms embedded in cavities, trapped ions and rare earth doped ions, amongst others. Here we introduce a purely micromachined solid-state platform in the form of chip-based nano-optomechanical resonators. We create and demonstrate entanglement between two nanomechanical devices across two chips that are separated by 20cm. By transferring the mechanical quantum state to a laser field at telecom wavelength we also demonstrate the feasibility of directly incorporating our system into a real quantum network.
