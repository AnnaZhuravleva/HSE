We study the dynamics of nonlinear photonic lattices driven by two-photon parametric processes. By means of matrix-product-state based calculations, we show that a quantum many-body state with long-range hidden order can be generated from the vacuum. This order resembles that characterizing the Haldane insulator. A possible explanation highlighting the role of the symmetry of the drive, and the effect of photon loss are discussed. An implementation based in superconducting circuits is proposed and analyzed
