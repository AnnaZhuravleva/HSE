The atom-light interaction in a three-level system has shown significant physical phenomena, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and Autler{Townes splitting (ATS), for broad applications in classical and quantum information techniques. Here, we optimally demonstrated the ATS with a quantum state manipulation method. The ATS in the dephasing-dominated diamond NV center system was successfully recovered by coherent microwave control, which cannot be observed with traditional method. The dynamical process of ATS was investigated in detail, revealing a nontrivial quantum interference with geometric phase modulations. Based on the quantum interference, the signal of the optimal ATS is twice as intense as those with traditional observation method.
