Here we present a scheme for the treatment of non-Hermitian non-commuative Hamiltonians. This is done by conveniently putting together the formalisms for the treatments of non-Hermitian or non-commutative Hamiltonians. We present an illustrative example, a harmonic oscillator under linear amplification, which enable us to analyse the physical implications arising when nonHermiticity and non-commutativity come together.
