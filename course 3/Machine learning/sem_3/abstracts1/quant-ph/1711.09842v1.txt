Here we propose a method for determining if two graphs are isomorphic in polynomial time on a quantum computer. We show that any two isomorphic graphs can be represented as states which share the same equal-angle slice of the Wigner function - a process that on a quantum computer is at most quartic, and possibly linear, in the number of nodes. We conjecture that only isomorphic graphs have this property. The method is then, for each graph: (i) create a quantum graph state using existing protocols, representing the classical graphs to be compared (ii) measure the state in a restricted phase space using a spin-Wigner function (iii) compare measurement results numbering between one and the square of the number of nodes. As soon as there is a difference (outside of experimental error) the graphs are not isomorphic and the procedure can terminate. We discuss extending this work to the subgraph isomorphism problem that is known to be NP-complete and conjecture that this could be reducible to pseudo-polynomial-time using dynamic programming methods.
