The Bohm-de Broglie quantum mechanics has made possible to calculate the trajectories of electrons in a typical double-slit experiment[C. Philippidis et al., Il Nuovo Cimento, 52 B, 15-28 (1979)]. The trajectories do not correspond to an uniform movement but to an accelerated one. The acceleration is caused by the quantum potential. From the quantum theoretical point of view, there is a probability for the electron to emit photons during its movement from the slits to the screen. According to the Copenhagen interpretation we found that the emission power is strictly zero because the electron moves as a free particle along its path after it leaves the slit and before reach the screen. Then, there is no emission of photons. On the other hand, by using the Bohm-de Broglie (BdB) approach we calculate the emission power, giving a general formula and which results, for a concrete real experiment, in a very tiny but not a vanishing value. We give an idea of the type of spectrum that could be found. This result, if measured, would constitute an indirect test in favor of the existence of Bohmian trajectories, although it would not rule out the interpretation of Copenhagen as a powerful algorithm for predicting expectations values in the laboratory, but it would show its limitations in revealing the sub-quantum world.
