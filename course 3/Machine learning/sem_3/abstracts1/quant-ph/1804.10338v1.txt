Arrays of covalently bound organic molecules possess potential for light-harvesting and energy transfer applications due to the strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling between the transition dipole moments of the molecules involved. Here, we show that such molecular systems, based on perylene-molecules, can be considered as arrays of qubits that are amenable for laser-driven quantum coherent control. The perylene monomers exhibit dephasing times longer than four orders of magnitude a typical gating time, thus allowing for the execution of a large number of gate operations on the sub-picosecond timescale. Specifically, we demonstrate quantum logic gates and entanglement in bipartite (dimer) and tripartite (trimer) systems of perylene-based arrays. In dimers, naturally entangled states with a tailored degree of entanglement can be produced. The nonlocality of the molecular trimer entanglement is demonstrated by testing Mermin's (Bell-like) inequality violation.
