Quantum dynamical simulations of statistical ensembles pose a significant computational challenge due to the fact that mixed states need to be represented by a density matrix instead of a wave function. If the underlying dynamics is fully unitary, for example in coherent control at finite temperatures, one approach to approximate time-dependent observables in this context is to sample the density matrix by solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a set of wave functions with randomized phases. We show that, on average, random-phase wave functions perform well for ensembles with high mixedness, whereas at higher purities a deterministic sampling of the energetically lowest-lying eigenstates becomes superior. We find that the performance crossing point between these two approaches does not significantly depend on system dimension or desired error tolerance and is determined primarily through the ensemble purity. Moreover, we prove that minimization of the worst-case error for computing arbitrary observables is uniquely attained by eigenstate-based sampling. Finally, we point out how the structure of low-rank observables can be exploited to further improve eigenstate-based sampling schemes.
