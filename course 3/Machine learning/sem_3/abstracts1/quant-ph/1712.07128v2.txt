Optimal (reversible) processes in thermodynamics can be modelled as step-by-step processes, where the system is successively thermalized with respect to different Hamiltonians due to interactions with different parts of a thermal bath (see e.g. Skrzypczyk et al, Nat. Commun. 5, 4185 (2014)). However, in practice precise control of the interaction between system and thermal bath is usually out of reach. Motivated by this observation, we consider noisy and uncontrolled operations between system and bath, which result in thermalizations that are only partial in each step. Our main result is that optimal processes can still be achieved for any non-trivial partial thermalizations, at the price of increasing the number of operations. Focusing on work extraction protocols, we quantify the errors for qubit systems and a finite number of operations, providing corrections to Landauer's principle in the presence of partial thermalizations. Our results show that optimal processes are robust to noise and imperfections in small quantum systems, and can be achieved by a large set of interactions between system and bath.
