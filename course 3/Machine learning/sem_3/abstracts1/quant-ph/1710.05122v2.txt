We propose a scheme for preparation of large-scale entangled $GHZ$ states and $W$ states with neutral Rydberg atoms. The scheme mainly depends on Rydberg antiblockade effect, i.e., as the Rydberg-Rydberg-interaction (RRI) strength and the detuning between the atom transition frequency and the classical laser frequency satisfies some certain conditions, the effective Rabi oscillation between the two ground states and the two excitation Rydberg states would be generated. The prominent advantage is that both two-multiparticle $GHZ$ states and two-multiparticle $W$ states can be fused in this model, especially the success probability for fusion of $GHZ$ states can reach unit. In addition, the imperfections induced by the spontaneous emission is also discussed through numerical simulation.
