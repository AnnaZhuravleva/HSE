Non-Hermitian singularities are ubiquitous in non-conservative open systems. These singularities are often points of measure zero in the eigenspectrum of the system which make them difficult to access without careful engineering. Despite that, they can remotely induce observable effects when some of the system's parameters are varied along closed trajectories in the parameter space. To date, a general formalism for describing this process beyond simple cases is still lacking. Here, we bridge this gap and develop a general approach for treating this problem by utilizing the power of permutation operators and representation theory. This in turn allows us to reveal the following surprising result which contradicts the common belief in the field: loops that enclose the same singularities starting from the same initial point and traveling in the same direction, do not necessarily share the same end outcome. Interestingly, we find that this equivalence can be formally established only by invoking the topological notion of homotopy. Our findings are general with far reaching implications in various fields ranging from photonics and atomic physics to microwaves and acoustics.
