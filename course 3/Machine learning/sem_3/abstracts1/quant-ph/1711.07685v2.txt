We study quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, in which the Bogoliubov excitation spectrum displays, at sufficiently large gas density, a deep roton minimum due to the spatially anisotropic behavior of the dipolar two-body potential. A rapid quench, performed on the speed of sound of excitations propagating on the condensate background, leads to the dynamical Casimir effect, which can be characterized by measuring the density-density correlation function. It is shown, for both zero and finite initial temperatures, that the continuous-variable bipartite quantum state of the created quasiparticle pairs with opposite momenta, resulting from the quench, displays an enhanced potential for the presence of entanglement (represented by nonseparable and steerable quasiparticle states), when compared to a gas with solely repulsive contact interactions. Steerable quasiparticle pairs contain momenta from close to the roton, and hence quantum correlations significantly increase in the presence of a deep roton minimum.
