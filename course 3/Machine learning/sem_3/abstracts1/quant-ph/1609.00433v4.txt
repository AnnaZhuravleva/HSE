The breakdown of Ehrenfest's theorem imposes serious limitations on quaternionic quantum mechanics (QQM). In order to determine the conditions in which the theorem is valid, we examined the conservation of the probability density, the expectation value and the classical limit for a non-anti-hermitian formulation of QQM. The results also indicated that the non-anti-hermitian quaternionic theory is related to non-hermitian quantum mechanics, and thus the physical problems described with both of the theories should be related.
