Precise control of the resonant frequency of a spin qubit is of fundamental importance to quantum sensing protocols. We demonstrate a control technique on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond where the applied magnetic field is modified by fine-tuning a permanent magnet's magnetisation via temperature control. Through this control mechanism, nanoscale cross-relaxation spectroscopy of both electron and nuclear spins in the vicinity of the NV centre are performed. We then show that through maintaining the magnet at a constant temperature an order of magnitude improvement in the stability of the NV qubit frequency can be achieved. This improved stability is tested in the polarisation of a small ensemble of nearby $^{13}$C spins via resonant cross-relaxation and the lifetime of this polarisation explored. The effectiveness and relative simplicity of this technique may find use in the realisation of portable spectroscopy and/or hyperpolarisation systems.
