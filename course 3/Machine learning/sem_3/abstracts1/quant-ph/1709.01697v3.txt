Motivated by the readout scheme in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, we consider the device which measures the expectation value of the photon annihilation and creation operators for output optical field from the main interferometer. As the result, the eight-port homodyne detection is rediscovered as such a device. We evaluate the noise spectral density in this measurement. We also briefly discuss on the application of our results to the readout scheme of gravitational-wave detectors. We call this measurement scheme to measure these expectation values as "double balanced homodyne detection."
