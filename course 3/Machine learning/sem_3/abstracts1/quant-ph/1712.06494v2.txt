We employ a trapped ion to study quantum contextual correlations in a single qutrit using the 5-observable KCBS inequality, which is arguably the most fundamental non-contextuality inequality for testing Quantum Mechanics (QM). We quantify the effect of systematics in our experiment by purposely scanning the degree of signaling between measurements, which allows us to place realistic bounds on the non-classicality of the observed correlations. Our results violate the classical bound for this experiment by up to 25 standard deviations, while being in agreement with the QM limit. In order to test the prediction of QM that the contextual fraction increases with the number of observables, we gradually increase the complexity of our measurements from 5 up to 121 observables. We find stronger-than-classical correlations in all prepared scenarios up to 101 observables, beyond which experimental imperfections blur the quantum-classical divide.
