We construct ($d\times d$)-dimensional bound entangled states, which violate, for any $d>2$, a bipartite Bell inequality introduced in this paper. We conjecture that the proposed class of Bell inequalities acts as a dimension witness for bound entangled states: For any $d>2$ there exists a Bell inequality from this class that can be violated with bound entangled states only if their Hilbert space dimension is at least $d\times d$. Numerics supports this conjecture up to $d=8$.
