Quantum scrambling measured by out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) has an important role in understanding the physics of black holes and evaluating quantum chaos. It is known that Rydberg atom has been a general interest due to its extremely favourable properties for building a quantum simulator. Fast and efficient quantum simulators can be developed by studying quantum scrambling in related systems. Here we present a general quantum circuit to theoretically implement an interferometric protocol which is a technique proposed to measure OTOC functions. We apply this circuit to measure OTOC and hence the quantum scrambling in a simulation of two spin Ising spin model for Rydberg atom. We apply this method to both initial product and entangled states to compare the scrambling of quantum information in both cases. Finally we discuss other constructions where this technique can be applied.
