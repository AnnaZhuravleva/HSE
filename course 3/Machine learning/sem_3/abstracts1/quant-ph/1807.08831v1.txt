Macroscopic cat states can be used as proof of the indefiniteness of macroscopic properties via. a Leggett Garg experiment. These experiments are notoriously difficult in that they require non- invasive measurements. In this article we propose an experiment, which given the assumptions of quantum mechanics, will identify if a state has macroscopic properties without the non-invasive requirement. We describe this experiment in the context of an ultra-cold atomic interferometer, where bosons interfere between two modes, and cat states can be dynamically created. The first sign of these cat states is two well separated peaks in the statics of the mode occupation, but this does not imply the indefiniteness of macroscopic properties. As we show in this paper, the same dynamical procedure can create distinct double-peak statistics for initial pure states and thermal mixed states. The second sign of the cat state is a strong response, quantified by the quantum fisher information, of the state to a specific interferometric process. We show why this sign is a direct signature of indefinite macroscopic properties, given the assumptions of quantum mechanics.
