We propose a mechanism for time reparametrization symmetry breaking in canonical gravity. We consider a model of spinor gravity, originating in Sen's reformulation of canonical gravity as a spin system, with one additional long-range self-interacting massive spinor particle that is coupled to spinor gravity. The symmetry breaking is identified with the origin of the quantum energy measurement processes. Our theory uses a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics with respect to quantum mechanical position uncertainties.
