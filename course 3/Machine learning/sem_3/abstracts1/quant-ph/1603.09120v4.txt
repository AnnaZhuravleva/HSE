We introduce a new feature of no-signaling (Bell) non-local theories, namely, when a system of multiple parties manifests genuine non-local correlation, then there cannot be arbitrarily high non-local correlation among any subset of the parties. We call this feature, \textit{complementarity of genuine multipartite non-locality}. We use Svetlichny's criterion for genuine multipartite non-locality and non-local games to derive the complementarity relations under no-signaling constraints. We find that the complementarity relations are tightened for the much stricter quantum constraints. We compare this notion with the well-known notion of \textit{monogamy of non-locality}. As a consequence, we obtain tighter non-trivial monogamy relations that take into account genuine multipartite non-locality. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence showcasing this feature using a bipartite measure and several other well-known tripartite measures of non-locality.
