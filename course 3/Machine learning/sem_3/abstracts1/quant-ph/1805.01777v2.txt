In this study, we investigate the advantages of non-classical pointer states in the generalized modular value scheme. We consider a typical von Neumann measurement with a discrete quantum pointer, where the pointer is a projection operator onto one of the states of the basis of the pointer Hilbert space. We separately calculate the conditional probabilities, Q_{M} factors, and signal-to-noise ratios of quadrature operators of coherent, coherent squeezed, and Schr\"odinger cat pointer states and find that the non-classical pointer states can increase the negativity of the field and precision of measurement compared with semi-classical states in generalized measurement problems characterized by the modular value.
