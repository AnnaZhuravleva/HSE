"All-Possible-Worlds" is a novel interpretation of quantum physics, which results from a unified reformulation of Many-Worlds and Copenhagen ("collapse") in the light of quantum contextuality, and proposes "nonlocality at detection" as a principle ruling the whole quantum realm, including single qubit and qutrit experiments.
