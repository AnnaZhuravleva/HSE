A tenet of time-resolved spectroscopy is -faster laser pulses for shorter timescales- . Here we suggest turning this paradigm around, and slow down the system dynamics via repeated measurements, to do spectroscopy on longer timescales. This is the principle of the quantum Zeno effect. We exemplify our approach with the Auger process, and find that repeated measurements increase the core-hole lifetime, redistribute the kinetic energy of Auger electrons, and alter entanglement formation. We further provide an explicit experimental protocol for atomic Li, to make our proposal concrete.
