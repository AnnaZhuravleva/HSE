Although quantum metrology allows us to make precision measurement beyond the standard quantum limit, it mostly works on the measurement of only one observable due to Heisenberg uncertainty relation on the measurement precision of non-commuting observables for one system. In this paper, we study the schemes of joint measurement of multiple observables which do not commute with each other by using the quantum entanglement between two systems. We focus on analyzing the performance of newly developed SU(1,1) interferometer on fulfilling the task of joint measurement. The results show that the information encoded in multiple non-commuting observables on an optical field can be simultaneously measured with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than the standard quantum limit, and the ultimate limit of each observable is still the Heisenberg limit. Moreover, we find a resource conservation rule for the joint measurement.
