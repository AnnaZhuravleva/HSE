Coherent superposition states of a mesoscopic quantum object play a major role in our understanding of the quantum to classical boundary, as well as in quantum-enhanced metrology and computing. However, their practical realization and manipulation remains challenging, requiring a high degree of control of the system and its coupling to the environment. Here, we use dysprosium atoms - the most magnetic element in its ground state - to realize coherent superpositions between electronic spin states of opposite orientation, with a mesoscopic spin size J=8. We drive coherent spin states to quantum superpositions using non-linear light-spin interactions, observing a series of collapses and revivals of quantum coherence. These states feature highly non-classical behavior, with a sensitivity to magnetic fields enhanced by a factor 13.9(1.1) compared to coherent spin states - close to the Heisenberg limit 2J=16 - and an intrinsic fragility to environmental noise.
