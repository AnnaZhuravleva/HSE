Quantum communication and clock synchronization protocols can be significantly enhanced by the careful preparation of the wavepackets of the produced photons. Following the theoretical proposal published in [Optica, 4, 84 (2017)], we experimentally demonstrate the effect of a remote temporal wavepacket narrowing of a heralded single photon. It is performed by utilizing the time-resolved measurement on the heralding photon which is frequency entangled with the heralded one. We also investigate optimal photon pair source characteristics that minimize the heralded wavepacket width.
