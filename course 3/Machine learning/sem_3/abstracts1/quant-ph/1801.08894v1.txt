We study the finite time entanglement dynamics between two dark soliton qubits due to quantum fluctuations in a quasi one dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates. Recently, dark solitons are proved to be an appealing platform for qubits due to their appreciably long life time. We explore the entanglement decay for an entangled state of two phonon coherences and the qubits to be in the diagonal basis of so called Dicke states. We observe the collapse and revival of the entanglement, depending critically on the collective damping term but independent of the qubit-qubit interaction for both the initial states. The collective behavior of the dark soliton qubits demonstrate the dependence of entanglement evolution on the interatomic distance.
