Spin collective phenomena including superradiance are even today being intensively investigated with experimental tests performed based on state-of-the-art quantum technologies. Such attempts are not only for the simple experimental verification of predictions from the last century but also as a motivation to explore new applications of spin collective phenomena and the coherent control of the coupling between spin ensembles and reservoirs. In this paper, we investigate the open quantum dynamics of two spin ensembles (double spin domains) coupled to a common bosonic reservoir. We analyze in detail the dynamics of our collective state and its structure by focusing on both the symmetry and asymmetry of this coupled spin system. We find that when the spin size of one of the double domains is larger than that of the other domain, at the steady state this system exhibits two novel collective behaviors: the negative-temperature state relaxation in the smaller spin domain and the reservoir-assisted quantum entanglement between the two domains. These results are the consequence of the asymmetry of this system and the decoherence driven by the common reservoir.
