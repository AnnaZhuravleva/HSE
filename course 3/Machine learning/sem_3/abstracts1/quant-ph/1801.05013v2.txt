Typical eigenstates of quantum systems, whose classical limit is chaotic, are well approximated as random states. Corresponding eigenvalue spectra is modeled through appropriate ensemble of random matrix theory. However, a small subset of states violate this principle and display eigenstate localization, a counter-intuitive feature known to arise due to purely quantum or semiclassical effects. In the spectrum of chaotic systems, the localized and random states interact with one another and modifies the spectral statistics. In this work, a $3 \times 3$ random matrix model is used to obtain exact result for the ratio of spacing between a generic and localized state. We consider time-reversal-invariant as well as non-invariant scenarios. These results agree with the spectra computed from realistic physical systems that display localized eigenmodes.
