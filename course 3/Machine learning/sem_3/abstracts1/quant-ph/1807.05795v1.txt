Different types of interactions in quantum systems are currently being investigated regarding their suitability for future quantum technologies. One promising candidate is the strong and long-range interaction between Rydberg states of neutral atoms, for which first applications in the fields of quantum computation and quantum simulations have been reported in recent years. Using electromagnetically induced transparency, these Rydberg interactions can be mapped to light, thus creating an effective interaction between photons. Here we extend the range of applicability of these interactions to the field of quantum communication and quantum networking by realising a photon-photon quantum gate. To achieve this, a photonic control qubit is stored in a Rydberg quantum memory in an ultracold atomic gas. This qubit interacts with a propagating photonic target qubit coupled to a Rydberg state to generate a conditional pi phase shift. Finally, the control photon is retrieved. We measure controlled-NOT truth tables with fidelities 0.66(9) and 0.70(8) and an entangling-gate fidelity of 0.637(45). The demonstration of a photon-photon quantum gate is the hallmark for having achieved full quantum control of one photon over another. The level of control achieved here is an important step on one hand for exploring novel many-body states of photons and on the other hand for applications in quantum communication and quantum networking. A prominent example is deterministic photonic Bell-state detection which is crucial for quantum repeaters.
