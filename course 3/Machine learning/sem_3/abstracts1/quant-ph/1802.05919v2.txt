We investigate manipulations of pure quantum states under incoherent or strictly incoherent operations assisted by a coherence battery, that is, a storage device whose degree of coherence is allowed to fluctuate in the process. This leads to the derivation of fluctuation relations for quantum coherence, analogous to Jarzynski's and Crooks' relations for work in thermodynamics. Coherence is thus revealed as another instance of a physical resource, in addition to athermality and entanglement, for which a connection is established between the majorisation framework (regulating pure state transformations under suitable free operations) and the emergence of fluctuation theorems. Our study is hoped to provide further insight into the general structure of battery assisted quantum resource theories, and more specifically into the interplay between quantum coherence and quantum thermodynamics.
