The advanced-wave picture is "... an intuitive treatment of two-photon correlation with the help of the concept of an effective field acting upon one of the two detectors and formed by parametric conversion of the advanced wave emitted by the second detector ..." [A. V. Belinskii and D. N. Klyshko, JETP 78, 259 (1994)]. This quote from Belinskii and Klyshko nicely describes the concept of the advanced-wave picture; an intuitive tool for designing and predicting results from coincidence-based two-photon experiments. Up to now, the advanced-wave picture has been considered primarily for the case of an ideal plane-wave pump beam and only for design purposes. Here we study the advanced-wave picture for a paraxial pump beam. This suggests stimulated parametric down-conversion as a useful experimental tool for testing the experimental sets designed with the advanced-wave picture. We present experimental results demonstrating the strategy of designing the experiment with advanced-wave picture and testing with stimulated emission.
