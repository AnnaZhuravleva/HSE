The Young double-slit interference pattern produced by quantum objects, like photons, that move through a double-slit is regarded, by the conventional Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as the evidence of the wave-like behaviour potentially contained in the wave function. On the contrary, a more realistic view of this phenomenon considers the quantum object a particle accompanied by a pilot wave which would be the cause of the interference fringes. This paper proposes a feasible experiment, based on an easy variation of the nowadays common double-slit experimental set-ups, aimed at detecting the effects of the pilot wave once 'detached' from the particles that it steers. Besides, a further realistic idea, based on the geometrical violation of Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI), is put forward as to the intrinsic nature of the photon. This new idea along with the possibly positive results of the experiment would allow us to shed new light on the real nature of quantum objects in term of the geometrical violation of LLI.
