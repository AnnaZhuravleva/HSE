Speeding-up quantum dynamics is of paramount importance for quantum technology. However, in finite dimensions and without full knowledge of the dynamics, it is easily shown to be impossible. In sharp contrast we show that many continuous variable systems can be sped-up without such knowledge. We call the resultant procedure Hamiltonian amplification. Since Hamiltonian amplification can be achieved through local squeezing, even unknown or noisy couplings and frequencies can be amplified by acting on individual modes. We discuss the performance, physical realisations and robustness of Hamiltonian amplification. Furthermore, we combine amplification with dynamical decoupling to achieve amplifiers that are free from environmental noise. Finally, a significant reduction in gate times of cavity resonator qubits illustrates the viability of Hamiltonian amplification.
