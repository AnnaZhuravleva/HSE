In this article, we mainly study the locally distinguishability of bipartite orthogonal quantum states (OQS) in $d \otimes n$ ($2<d\leq n$) by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We first show the sufficient and necessary condition (SNC) for some bipartite distinguishable pure OQS in $3\otimes n$ by LOCC. Then the local indistinguishability of OQS in $d\otimes d$ can be proved using the SNC. Furthermore, we generalize this result into $d\otimes n$. Similarly, we show the SNC for some bipartite distinguishable mixed OQS in $d\otimes n$ by LOCC. Our study further reveals quantum nonlocality in $d\otimes n$ quantum system.
