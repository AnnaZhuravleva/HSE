Recently, dimensionality testing of a quantum state has received extensive attention (Ac{\'i}n et al. Phys. Rev. Letts. 2006, Scarani et al. Phys. Rev. Letts. 2006). Security proofs of existing quantum information processing protocols rely on the assumption about the dimension of quantum states in which logical bits will be encoded. However, removing such assumption may cause security loophole. In the present report, we show that this is indeed the case. We choose two player's quantum private query protocol by Yang et al. (Quant. Inf. Process. 2014) as an example and show how one player can gain considerable information than desired by changing the dimension of subsystem of a shared quantum system. To resist such attack we propose dimensionality testing in a different way. Our proposal is based on CHSH like game which certifies the degrees of freedom of the subsystems. As we exploit CHSH like game, it can be used to test if the states are separable for which the protocol becomes completely vulnerable.
