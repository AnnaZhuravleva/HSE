Spin states of maximal projection along some direction in space are called (spin) coherent, and are, in many aspects, the "most classical" available. For any spin $s$, the spin coherent states form a 2-sphere in the projective Hilbert space $\mathbb{P}$ of the system. We address several questions regarding that sphere, in particular its possible intersections with complex lines. We also find that, like Dali's iconic clocks, it extends in all possible directions in $\mathbb{P}$. We give a simple expression for the Majorana constellation of the linear combination of two coherent states, and use Mason's theorem to give a lower bound on the number of distinct stars of a linear combination of two arbitrary spin-$s$ states. Finally, we plot the image of the spin coherent sphere, assuming light in $\mathbb{P}$ propagates along Fubini-Study geodesics. We argue that, apart from their intrinsic geometric interest, such questions translate into statements experimentalists might find useful.
