Hybrid quantum systems combine the advantages of dissimilar quantum degrees of freedom to solve challenges of communicating between disparate quantum states. Silicon carbide (SiC) is an exemplary platform for hybrid spin-mechanical systems, providing long-lived spin registers within optically-active defects, wafer-scale availability, and low acoustic losses. Past demonstrations of spin-mechanical coupling have used uniaxial strain to drive magnetically forbidden spin transitions. With a Gaussian surface acoustic wave resonator, here we show universal control of divacancy spin qubits using all mechanical degrees of freedom, especially shear. We demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting, coherent mechanically driven Rabi oscillations, and direct optical observation of acoustic paramagnetic resonance. This work expands the versatility of mechanically driven spins and shows promise towards integrating spins with quantum nanomechanical systems.
