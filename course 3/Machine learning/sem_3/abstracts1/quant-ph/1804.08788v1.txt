In this paper, we show an interesting connection between a quantum sampling technique and quantum uncertainty. Namely, we use the quantum sampling technique, introduced by Bouman and Fehr, to derive a simple proof of a version of the Maassen and Uffink uncertainty relation. We also use quantum sampling to prove a finite, non-i.i.d., entropic uncertainty relation based on smooth min entropy.
