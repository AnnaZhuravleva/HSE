A quantum process encodes the causal structure that relates quantum operations performed in local laboratories. The process matrix formalism includes as special cases quantum mechanics on a fixed background space-time, but also allows for more general causal structures. Motivated by the interpretation of processes as a resource for quantum information processing shared by two (or more) parties, with advantages recently demonstrated both for computation and communication tasks, we investigate the notion of composition of processes. We show that under very basic assumptions such a composition rule does not exist. While the availability of multiple independent copies of a resource, e.g. quantum states or channels, is the starting point for defining information-theoretic notions such as entropy (both in classical and quantum Shannon theory), our no-go result means that a Shannon theory of general quantum processes is likely to necessitate "single-shot" concepts.
