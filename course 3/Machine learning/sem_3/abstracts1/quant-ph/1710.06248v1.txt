We consider the estimation of two-qubit interactions when initial states of both qubit can be locally controlled, while the final state of only one qubit can be measured. This amounts to realize a model of quantum channel communication with environment assistance. In such a framework the unitaries' parameters space results a tetrahedron in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On its edges the problem, becoming of single parameter estimation, can be exactly solved and we derive optimal probe states and estimators. Our results show that the possibility of environment assistance is always beneficial, while the usage of entanglement at channels' input is not.
