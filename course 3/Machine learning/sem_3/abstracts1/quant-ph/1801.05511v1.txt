Closed-system quantum annealing is expected to sometimes fail spectacularly in solving simple problems for which the gap becomes exponentially small in the problem size. Much less is known about whether this gap scaling also impedes open-system quantum annealing. Here we study the performance of a quantum annealing processor in solving the problem of a ferromagnetic chain with sectors of alternating coupling strength. Despite being trivial classically, this is a problem for which the transverse field Ising model is known to exhibit an exponentially decreasing gap in the sector size, suggesting an exponentially decreasing success probability in the sector size if the annealing time is kept fixed. We find that the behavior of the quantum annealing processor departs significantly from this expectation, with the success probability rising and recovering for sufficiently large sector sizes. Rather than correlating with the size of the minimum energy gap, the success probability exhibits a strong correlation with the number of thermally accessible excited states at the critical point. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent with a quantum open-system description of the process and is unrelated to thermal relaxation. Our results indicate that even when the minimum gap is several orders of magnitude smaller than the processor temperature, the system properties at the critical point still determine the performance of the quantum annealer.
