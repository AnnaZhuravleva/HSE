Projected entangled pair states aim at describing lattice systems in two spatial dimensions that obey an area law. They are specified by associating a tensor with each site, and they are generated by patching these tensors. We consider the problem of determining whether the state resulting from this patching is null, and prove it to be NP-hard; the PEPS used to prove this claim have a boundary and are homogeneous in their bulk. A variation of this problem is next shown to be undecidable. These results have various implications: they question the possibility of a 'fundamental theorem' for PEPS; there are PEPS for which the presence of a symmetry is undecidable; there exist parent hamiltonians of PEPS for which the existence of a gap above the ground state is undecidable. En passant, we identify a family of classical Hamiltonians, with nearest neighbour interactions, and translationally invariant in their bulk, for which the commuting 2-local Hamiltonian problem is NP-complete.
