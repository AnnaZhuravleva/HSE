We introduce a new non-relativistic quantum operator for the distance traveled by a particle in a given interval of time. The purpose of this operator is to investigate the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) in the quantum regime. In particular, our operator measures the integrated expected trajectory of the particle. If its expectation value depends on the particle's mass we can infer that the particle's motion is also dependent on its mass and thus violates the WEP. In this article the new operator is derived and some of its elementary properties are explored. As a proof of concept we use it to analyze the expected distance traveled by a free Gaussian wavepacket with some initial momentum. It is shown in this case that the distance such a particle travels becomes close to light-like as its mass vanishes and agrees with the classical result for macroscopic masses. This calculation begs a number of questions which are presented as topics for future research.
