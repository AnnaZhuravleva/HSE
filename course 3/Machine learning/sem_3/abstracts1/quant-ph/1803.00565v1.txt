We introduce an exactly integrable singular potential for which the solution of the one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation is written through irreducible linear combinations of the Gauss hypergeometric functions. The potential, which belongs to a general Heun family, is a short-range one that behaves as the inverse square root in the vicinity of the origin and vanishes exponentially at the infinity. We derive the exact spectrum equation for the energy and discuss the bound states supported by the potential.
