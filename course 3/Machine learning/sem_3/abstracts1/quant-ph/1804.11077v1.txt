We report results of two-photon quantum holography where spatial information stored in phase holograms is retrieved by measuring quantum spatial correlations between two images formed by spatially entangled twin photons with a dimensionality of 1790 in the two-dimensional transverse space. In our experiments, the entire flux of spontaneous down converted photons illuminates the phase holograms and the photons of pairs signal-idler transmitted by the holograms are detected separately in far field on two electron-multiplying charge coupled device cameras.
