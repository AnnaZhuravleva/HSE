Quantum algorithms could efficiently solve certain classically intractable problems by exploiting quantum parallelism. To date, whether the quantum entanglement is useful or not for quantum computing is still a question of debate. Here, we present a new quantum algorithm to show that entanglement could help to gain advantage over classical algorithm and even the quantum algorithm without entanglement. Furthermore, we implement experiments to demonstrate our proposed algorithm using superconducting qubits. Our results show the viability of the algorithm and suggest that entanglement is essential in getting quantum speedup for certain problems in quantum computing, which provide a reliable and clear guidance for developing useful quantum algorithms in future.
