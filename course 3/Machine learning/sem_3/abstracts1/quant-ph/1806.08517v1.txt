The success probability to find the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian in the quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing is reduced by unwanted nonadiabatic processes such as the Landau-Zener transition. In this paper, we propose a protocol to modulate the success probability by applying a diabatic pulse during quantum annealing. By optimizing the parameters of a diabatic pulse, the success probability can be enhanced, compared to the conventional quantum annealing in the presence of the Landau-Zener transitions due to fixed annealing times. Our results shows that non-adiabatic processes can be used to improve the efficiency of quantum annealing machines, breaking away from the usual adiabaticity requirement.
