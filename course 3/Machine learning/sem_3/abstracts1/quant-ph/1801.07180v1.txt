Quantum communication aims to provide absolutely secure transmission of secret information. Existing methods encode symbols into single photons or coherent light with much less than one photon on average. Here we propose and demonstrate an original method that is fundamentally secure with weak coherent light even when several photons per symbol are used. Our method does not require a change of measurement basis and works with a high-dimensional alphabet in a simple practical setup. Moreover, it sends information in a deterministic way, allowing direct decoding at the receiver end. This feature makes the method suitable for both quantum key distribution (QKD) as well as quantum secure direct communication (QSDC). The key element of our method is the combination of wavefront shaping with a multimode fiber channel. Since it is based on an optical fiber, our method allows to naturally extend secure communication to larger distances.
