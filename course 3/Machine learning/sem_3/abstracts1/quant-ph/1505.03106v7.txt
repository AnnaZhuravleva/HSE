This document is meant as a pedagogical introduction to the modern language used to talk about quantum theory, especially in the field of quantum information. It assumes that the reader has taken a first traditional course on quantum mechanics, and is familiar with the concept of Hilbert space and elementary linear algebra. As in the popular textbook on quantum information by Nielsen and Chuang, we introduce the generalised concept of states (density matrices), observables (POVMs) and transformations (channels), but we also characterise these structures from an algebraic standpoint, which provides many useful technical tools, and clarity as to their generality. This approach also makes it manifest that quantum theory is a direct generalisation of probability theory, and provides a unifying formalism for both fields. The focus on finite-dimensional systems allows for a self-contained presentation which avoids many of the technicalities inherent to the more general $C^*$-algebraic approach, while being appropriate for the quantum information literature.
