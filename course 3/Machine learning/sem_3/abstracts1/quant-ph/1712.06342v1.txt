We review in a unified way a recently proposed method to detect properties of unknown quantum channels and lower bounds to quantum capacities, without resorting to full quantum process tomography. The method is based on the preparation of a fixed bipartite entangled state at the channel input or, equivalently, an ensemble of an overcomplete set of single-system states, along with few local measurements at the channel output.
