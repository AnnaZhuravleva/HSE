Entanglement of quantum states is absolutely essential for modern quantum sciences and technologies. It is natural to extend the notion of entanglement to quantum observables dual to quantum states. For quantum states, various separability criteria have been proposed to determine whether a given state is entangled. In this Letter, we propose a separability criterion for specific quantum effects (binary observables) that can be regarded as a dual version of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequality for quantum states. The violation of the dual version of the Bell-CHSH inequality is confirmed by using IBM's cloud quantum computer. As a consequence, the violation of our inequality rules out the maximal tensor product state space, that satisfies information causality and local tomography. As an application, we show that an entangled observable which violates our inequality is useful for quantum teleportation.
