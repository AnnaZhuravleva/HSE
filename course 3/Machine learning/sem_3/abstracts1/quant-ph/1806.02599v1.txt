We study the dynamical behavior of a non-Hermitian moire superlattice system, which consists of two-coupled SSH chains with staggered imaginary on-site potentials. There are two main spatial regions, in which systems are in unbroken symmetric phases with fully real spectrum, appearing periodically along the ladder. We show that the two quantum phases are dimerized and tetramerized, which determine the distinct dynamical behaviors. Dirac probability can oscillate periodically, increase quadratically and increase exponentially, which correspond to the unbroken phase, exceptional point and the broken phase of the tetramerized region. In comparison, the Dirac probability can exhibit high-frequency oscillation in the dimerized region. These phenomena demonstrate the dynamical signature and provide insightful information of the moire pattern in the non-Hermitian regime.
