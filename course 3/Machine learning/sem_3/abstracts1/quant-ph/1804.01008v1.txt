We theoretically study the longitudinal relaxation of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center surrounded by a 13C nuclear spin bath in diamond. By incorporating electron spin in the cluster, we generalize the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) to theoretically simulate the population dynamics of electron spin of NV center. By means of the generalized CCE, we numerically demonstrate the decay process of electronic state induced by cross relaxation at the ambient temperature. It is shown that the CCE method is not only capable of describing pure-dephasing effect at large-detuning regime, but it can also simulate the quantum dynamics of populations in the nearly-resonant regime.
