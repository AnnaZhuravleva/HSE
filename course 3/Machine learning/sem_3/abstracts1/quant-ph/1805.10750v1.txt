We show that the symmetric portion of correlated coherence is always a valid quantifier of entanglement, and that this property is independent of the particular choice of coherence measure. This leads to an infinitely large class of coherence based entanglement monotones, which is always computable for pure states if the coherence measure is also computable. It is already known that every entanglement measure can be constructed as a coherence measure. The results presented here show that the converse is also true. The constructions that are presented can also be extended to also include more general notions of nonclassical correlations, leading to quantifiers that are related to quantum discord.
