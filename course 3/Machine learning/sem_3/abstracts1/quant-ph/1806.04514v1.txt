I provide additional arguments for refuting Vaidmans weak value analysis of the path of a particle in a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The argument uses sequential weak values to supplement my previous analysis according to which even weak measurements disturb the system to such an extent that projector weak values cannot be considered representative for the undisturbed system.
