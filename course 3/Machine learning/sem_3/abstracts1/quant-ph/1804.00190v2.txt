Non-Gaussian entangled states of light have been found to improve the success of quantum telepor- tation. Earlier works in the literature focussed mainly on two-mode non-Gaussian states generated by de-Gaussification of two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In the current work, we study quan- tum teleportation with a class of non-Gaussian entangled resource states that are generated at the output of a passive beam splitter (BS) with different input single mode non-Gaussian states. In particular, we consider input states that are generated under successive application of squeezing and photon addition/subtraction operations in various orders. We focus on identifying what attributes of the resource states are necessary or sufficient for quantum teleportation (QT). To this end we first evaluate two attributes considered in the literature, viz. squeezed vacuum affinity (SVA) and EPR correlation. While SVA is not non-zero for all two-mode resource states, EPR correlation is neither necessary nor sufficient of QT. We consider yet another attribute, viz. two-mode quadrature squeezing as defined by Simon et. al. [Phys. Rev. A 49, 1567 (1994)]. Our numerical results on the de-Gaussified two-mode squeezed vacuum state as well as the BS generated non-Gaussian states lead us to the conclusion that two-mode quadrature squeezing is a necessary condition for QT, in general. We further demonstrate the plausibility of this conclusion by giving an analytical proof that two-mode quadrature squeezing is a necessary condition for QT in the case of symmetric two-mode Gaussian resource states.
