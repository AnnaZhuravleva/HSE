In this study, we propose quantum representation of multi wavelength images (QRMW) which gives preparation and retrieving procedures of quantum images. Proposed QRMW model represents multi-channel and 2^n x 2^m images. Also, we present image comparison and some image operations based on QRMW model. Comparing our model with the models in literature, QRMW model has less time complexity. Also QRMW model uses fewer qubits than existing models in the literature.
