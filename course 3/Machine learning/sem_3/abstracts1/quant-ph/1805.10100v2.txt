Models of spontaneous wave function collapse describe the quantum-to-classical transition by assuming a progressive breakdown of the superposition principle when the mass of the system increases, providing a well-defined phenomenology in terms of a non-linearly and stochastically modified Schrodinger equation, which can be tested experimentally. The most popular of such models is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model: in its original version, the collapse is driven by a white noise, and more recently, generalizations in terms of colored noises, which are more realistic, have been formulated. We will analyze how current non-interferometric tests bound the model, depending on the spectrum of the noise. We will find that low frequency purely mechanical experiments provide the most stable and strongest bounds.
