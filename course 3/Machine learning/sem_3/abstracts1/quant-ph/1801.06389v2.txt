We find that the quantum-classical correspondence in integrable systems is characterized by two time scales. One is the Ehrenfest time below which the system is classical; the other is the quantum revival time beyond which the system is fully quantum. In between, the quantum system can be well approximated by classical ensemble distribution in phase space. These results can be summarized in a diagram which we call Ehrenfest diagram. We derive an analytical expression for Ehrenfest time, which is proportional to $\hbar^{-1/2}$. According to our formula, the Ehrenfest time for the solar-earth system is about $10^{26}$ times of the age of the solar system.We also find an analytical expression for the quantum revival time, which is proportional to $\hbar^{-1}$. Both time scales involve $\omega(I)$, the classical frequency as a function of classical action. Our results are numerically illustrated with two simple integrable models. In addition, we show that similar results exist for Bose gases, where $1/N$ serves as an effective Planck constant.
