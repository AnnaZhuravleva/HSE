The realization of indefinite causal order, a theoretical possibility that even the causal order of events in spacetime can be subjected to quantum superposition, apart from its general significance for the fundamental physics research, would also enable quantum information processing that outperforms protocols in which the underlying causal structure is definite. In this paper, we propose a realization of a simple case of indefinite causal order - the "quantum switch" - by entangling two communicating Rindler laboratories. Additionally, we obtain a quantum superposition of "direct-cause" and "common-cause" causal structures. For this we exploit the fact that two Rindler observers cannot communicate with each other if their worldlines belong to space-like separated wedges of a given light cone in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, we show that by using the "double Rindler quantum switch" one can realize entangled causal structures.
