The quantum behaviour of the electromagnetic field in mesoscopic elements is intimately linked to the quantization of the charge. In order to probe nonclassical aspects of the field in those elements, it is essential that thermal noise be reduced to the quantum level, i.e. to scales where kT < h{\nu}. This is easily achieved in dilution refrigerators for frequencies of a few GHz, i.e. in the microwave domain. Several recent experiments have highlighted the link between discrete charge transport and discrete photon emission in simple mesoscopic elements such as a tunnel junction. Photocount statistics are inferred from the measurement of continuous variables such as the quadratures of the field.
