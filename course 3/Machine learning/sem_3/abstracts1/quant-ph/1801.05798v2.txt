There is an ongoing search for intuitive postulates of quantum theory from which its Hilbert space structure can be derived. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of two postulates inspired by categorical logical notions from effectus theory, a framework in some ways similar to generalised probabilistic theories, but eschewing the familiar notions of real numbers and probabilities, which allows the description of more general theories. The postulates state the existence of certain physical filters that associate to each effect the subspace where it holds true. We show that when considering an operational probabilistic setting these relatively weak postulates lead to a spectral theorem and a duality between pure states and effects: each effect can be written as a probabilistic combination of perfectly distinguishable sharp effects in a unique way. In such a weak theory it is therefore already possible to define thermodynamic quantities like entropy. For these results we don't need any assumptions on the existence of pure states, or of sufficiently many reversible dynamics or even the existence of an invariant state. We finish the reconstruction of quantum theory by requiring three additional postulates: continuous symmetry, preservation of purity, and observability of energy.
