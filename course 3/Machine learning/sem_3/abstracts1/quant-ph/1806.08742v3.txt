Starting from a geometric perspective, we derive a quantum speed limit for arbitrary open quantum evolution, which could be Markovian or non-Markovian. Our methods rely on measuring angles and distances between(mixed) states in the generalized Bloch sphere. We show that our bound is easier to compute and measure than other quantum speed limits for open evolution. Moreover, our bound is tighter than the previous bounds for almost all open processes. Finally, we discuss the physical interpretation of quantum speed limits.
