The non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation with the advantages of fast and robustness attracts widespread attention in recent years. Here, we propose the first scheme for realizing universal single-qubit gates based on an optomechanical system working with the non-adiabatic geometric phases. Our quantum gates are robust to the control errors and the parameter fluctuations, and have unique functions to achieve the quantum state transfer and entanglement generation between cavities. We discuss the corresponding experimental parameters and give some simulations. Our scheme may have the practical applications in quantum computation and quantum information processing.
