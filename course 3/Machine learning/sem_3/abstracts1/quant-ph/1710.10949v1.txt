The recent article "Entropic Updating of Probability and Density Matrices" [1] derives and demonstrates the inferential origins of both the standard and quantum relative entropies in unison. Operationally, the standard and quantum relative entropies are shown to be designed for the purpose of inferentially updating probability distributions and density matrices, respectively, when faced with incomplete information. We call the inferential updating procedure for density matrices the "quantum maximum entropy method". Standard inference techniques in probability theory can be criticized for lacking concrete physical consequences in physics; but here, because we are updating quantum mechanical density matrices, the quantum maximum entropy method has direct physical and experimental consequences. The present article gives a new derivation of the Quantum Bayes Rule, and some generalizations, using the quantum maximum entropy method while discuss some of the limitations the quantum maximum entropy method puts on the measurement process in Quantum Mechanics.
