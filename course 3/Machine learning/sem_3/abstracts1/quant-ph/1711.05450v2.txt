We outline a global approach to scattering theory in one dimension that allows for the description of a large class of scattering systems and their $\mathcal{P}$-, $\mathcal{T}$-, and $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetries. In particular, we review various relevant concepts such as Jost solutions, transfer and scattering matrices, reciprocity principle, unidirectional reflection and invisibility, and spectral singularities. We discuss in some detail the mathematical conditions that imply or forbid reciprocal transmission, reciprocal reflection, and the presence of spectral singularities and their time-reversal. We also derive generalized unitarity relations for time-reversal-invariant and $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scattering systems, and explore the consequences of breaking them. The results reported here apply to the scattering systems defined by a real or complex local potential as well as those determined by energy-dependent potentials, nonlocal potentials, and general point interactions.
