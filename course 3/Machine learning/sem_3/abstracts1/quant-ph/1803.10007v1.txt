An arbitrary qubit can be transmitted through a spin chain by perturbatively coupling both communicating parties to it. Those so-called weak-coupling models rely on effective Rabi oscillations between them, yielding nearly maximum fidelity while offering great resilience against disorder with the cost of having long transfer times. Considering this framework, here we address a 1D non-symmetric channel connecting two spins, one placed at each end of it. Given any pattern of nearest-neighbor coupling strengths, we obtain an analytical expression that accounts for the effective long-range interaction between them and study the interplay between transfer time and fidelity. Furthermore, we show that homogeneous channels provide the best speed-fidelity tradeoff.
