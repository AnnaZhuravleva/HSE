We demonstrate how dispersive atom number measurements during evaporative cooling can be used for enhanced determination of the parameter dependence of the transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). In this way shot-to-shot fluctuations in initial conditions are detected and the information extracted per experimental realization is increased. We furthermore calibrate in-situ images from dispersive probing of a BEC with corresponding absorption images in time-of-flight. This allows for the determination of the transition point in a single experimental realization by applying multiple dispersive measurements. Finally, we explore the continuous probing of several consecutive phase transition crossings using the periodic addition of a focused "dimple" potential.
