The implementation of quantum networks involving quantum memories and photonic channels without the need for cryogenics would be a major technological breakthrough. Nitrogen-vacancy centers have excellent spin properties even at room temperature, but phonon-induced broadening makes it challenging to interface these spins with photons at non-cryogenic temperatures. Inspired by recent progress in achieving ultra-high mechanical quality factors, we propose that this challenge can be overcome by spin-opto-mechanical transduction. We quantify the coherence of the interface by calculating the indistinguishability of the emitted photons and describe promising paths towards experimental implementation.
