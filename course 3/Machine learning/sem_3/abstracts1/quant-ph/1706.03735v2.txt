We studied one-dimensional systems formed by $N$ identical particles confined in a harmonic trap and subject to an inverse power law interaction potential $\sim|x|^{-d}$. The correlation properties of a Wigner molecule with the lowest energy are investigated in terms of their dependence on the number $N$ and the power $d$, including the limit as $d\rightarrow 0$. There are $N$-particle Wigner molecules with properties such that their correlations are mainly manifested in the $N$ lowest natural orbitals. The values of the control parameters of the system at which such states appear are identified. The properties of Wigner molecules formed in the limit as $d$ approaches infinity are also revealed.
