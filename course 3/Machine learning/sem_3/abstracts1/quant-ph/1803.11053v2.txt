We study the tomography of propagators for spin systems in the context of finite-dimensional Wigner representations, which completely characterize and visualize operators using shapes assembled from linear combinations of spherical harmonics. The Wigner representation of a propagator can be experimentally recovered by measuring expectation values of rotated axial spherical tensor operators in an augmented system with an additional ancilla qubit. The methodology is experimentally demonstrated for standard one-qubit quantum gates using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, this approach provides a direct and compelling visualization of the spinor property of the propagators corresponding to the rotation of a spin 1/2 particle.
