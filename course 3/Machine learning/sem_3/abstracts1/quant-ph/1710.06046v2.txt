The light propagating in a waveguide array or photonic lattice has become an ideal platform to control light and to mimic quantum behaviors in a classical system. We here investigate the propagation of light in a coupled waveguide array with one of the waveguides periodically modulated in its geometric structure or refractive index. Within the framework of Floquet theory, it is interesting to find that the light shows the localized propagation in the modulated waveguide as long as bound quasistationary modes are formed in the band-gap area of the Floquet eigenvalue spectrum. This mechanism gives a useful instruction to confine light via engineering the periodic structure to form the bound modes. It also serves as a classical simulation of decoherence control via temporally periodic driving in open quantum systems.
