We investigate time-dependent spectra of the intermittent resonance fluorescence of a single, laser-driven, three-level atom due to electron shelving. After a quasi-stationary state of the strong transition, a slow decay due to shelving leads to the steady state of the three-level system. The long-term stationary spectrum consists of a coherent peak, an incoherent Mollow-like structure, and a very narrow incoherent peak at the laser frequency. We find that in the ensemble average dynamics the narrow peak emerges during the slow decay regime, after the Mollow spectrum has stabilized, but well before an average dark time has passed. The coherent peak, being a steady state feature, is absent during the time evolution of the spectrum
