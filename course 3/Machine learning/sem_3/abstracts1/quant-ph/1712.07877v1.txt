This paper presents a method for determination of the size distribution for diamond nanocrystals containing luminescent nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers using the luminescence intensity only. We also revise the basic photo physical properties of NV centers and conclude that the luminescence quantum yield of such centers is significantly smaller than the frequently stated 100\%. The yield can be as low as 5\% for centers embedded in nanocrystals and depends on their shape and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. The paper also addresses the value of the absorption cross-section of NV centers.
