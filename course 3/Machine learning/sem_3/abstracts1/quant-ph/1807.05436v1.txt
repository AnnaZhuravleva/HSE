In this paper, we construct corrections to the raising and lowering (i.e. ladder) operators for a quantum harmonic oscillator subjected to a polynomial type perturbation of any degree and to any order in perturbation theory. We apply our formalism to a couple of examples, namely q and p 4 perturbations, and obtain the explicit form of those operators. We also compute the expectation values of position and momentum for the above perturbations. This construction is essential for defining coherent and squeezed states for the perturbed oscillator. Furthermore, this is the first time that corrections to ladder operators for a harmonic oscillator with a generic perturbation and to an arbitrary order of perturbation theory have been constructed.
