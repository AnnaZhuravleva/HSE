We examine the effects of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction on the nonequilibrium thermodynamics in an anisotropic $XY$ spin chain, which is driven out of equilibrium by a sudden quench of the control parameter of the Hamiltonian. By analytically evaluating the statistical properties of the work distribution and the irreversible entropy production, we investigate the influences of the DM interaction on the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the system with different parameters at various temperatures. We find that depending on the anisotropy of the system and the temperature, the DM interaction may have different impacts on the nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Interestingly, the critical line induced by the DM interaction can be revealed via the properties of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In addition, our results suggest that the strength of the DM interaction can be detected experimentally by studying the nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
