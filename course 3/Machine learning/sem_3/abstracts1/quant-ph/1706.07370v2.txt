We use a single trapped-ion qutrit to demonstrate the violation of an input-state-independent non-contextuality inequality using a sequence of randomly chosen quantum non-demolition projective measurements. We concatenate 54 million sequential measurements of 13 observables, and violate an optimal non-contextual bound by 214 standard deviations. We use the same dataset to characterize imperfections including signaling and repeatability of the measurements. The experimental sequence was generated in real time with a quantum random number generator integrated into our control system to select the subsequent observable with a latency below 50 {\mu}s, which can be used to constrain hidden-variable models that might describe our results. The state-recycling experimental procedure is resilient to noise, self-correcting and independent of the qutrit state, substantiating the fact that quantumness is connected to measurements as opposed to designated states.
