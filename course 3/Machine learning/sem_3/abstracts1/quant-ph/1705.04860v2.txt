We propose and analyze a solid-state platform based on surface acoustic waves (SAWs) for trapping, cooling and controlling (charged) particles, as well as the simulation of quantum many-body systems. We develop a general theoretical framework demonstrating the emergence of effective time-independent acoustic trapping potentials for particles in two- or one-dimensional structures. As our main example we discuss in detail the generation and applications of a stationary, but movable acoustic pseudo-lattice (AL) with lattice parameters that are reconfigurable in situ. We identify the relevant figures of merit, discuss potential experimental platforms for a faithful implementation of such an acoustic lattice, and provide estimates for typical system parameters. With a projected lattice spacing on the scale of 100nm, this approach allows for relatively large energy scales in the realization of fermionic Hubbard models, with the ultimate prospect of entering the low temperature, strong interaction regime. Experimental imperfections as well as read-out schemes are discussed.
