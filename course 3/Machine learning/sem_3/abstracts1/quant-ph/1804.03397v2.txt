Under the assumption of two fluid kinematics of a nonrelativistic Bose liquid in the presence of a local velocity field $v(x)$, local Galilei transformations are used to derive formulas for the spatial distribution of superfluidity. The local formulation is shown to subsume several descriptions of superfluidity, from Landau's free quasiparticle picture of the normal fluid to the fully microscopic winding number formula for superfluid density. We derive the superfluid distribution of generic pure states of 1-d bosonic systems by using the continuum analog of matrix product states. With a view toward spatially structured superfluid-based quantum devices, we consider the limits to local distillation of superfluidity within the framework of localized resource theories of quantum coherence.
