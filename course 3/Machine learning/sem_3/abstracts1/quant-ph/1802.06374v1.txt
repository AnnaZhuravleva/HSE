Metamaterials have been a major research area for more than two decades now, involving artificial structures with predesigned electromagnetic properties constructed from deep subwavelength building blocks. They have been used to demonstrate a wealth of fascinating phenomena ranging from negative refractive index and epsilon-near-zero to cloaking, emulations of general relativity effects, and super-resolution imaging, to name a few. In the past few years, metamaterials have been suggested as a new platform for quantum optics, and several pioneering experiments have already been carried out with single photons. Here, we employ a dielectric metasurface to generate entanglement between spin and orbital angular momentum of single photons. We demonstrate experimentally the generation of the four Bell states by utilizing the geometric phase arising from the photonic spin-orbit interaction. These are the first experiments with entangled states with metasurfaces, and as such they are paving the way to the new area of quantum metamaterials.
