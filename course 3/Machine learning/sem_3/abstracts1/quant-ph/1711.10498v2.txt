It is commonly expected that quantum theory is universal, in the sense that its rules govern nature at all scales, from micro to macro. Our inability to observe quantum effects on a macro-scale so far, however, is an unresolved challenge that acts against this expectation, a problem known as macroscopicity. This fact is commonly attributed to decoherence processes leading to the assumption that there are scales for physical systems beyond which a quantum description of systems becomes redundant. Here, we show that the existence of such scales are unjustifiable from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a variant of the Wigner's friend gedankenexperiment in which a multiparticle quantum system is observed by the friend, where they both undergo decoherence and apparently lose their quantum properties. We prove that, nevertheless, there exist partitions of the subsystems in which the friend is entangled with one of the particles in assistance with the other particle, as observed by Wigner. Importantly, accessing the friend's information is crucial for Wigner to obtaining any entanglement. By analysing our scenario within the context of a quantum key distribution protocol, we show that a semi-classical description of the experiment is suboptimal for security analysis, highlighting the significance of the quantum description of the friend.
