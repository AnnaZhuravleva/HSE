Based on kinematic approach in defining geometric phase for a density matrix, we define the generalized Loschmidt overlap amplitude (GLOA) for an open system in arbitrary quantum evolution. GLOA reduces to Loschmidt overlap amplitude (LOA) with modified dynamic phase for unitary evolution of a pure state, and the argument of GLOA is the well-defined geometric phase. The rate function of GLOA exhibits non-analyticity at critical time, which corresponds to dynamical quantum phase transition. We observe that dynamical quantum phase transition related with GLOA will not be destroyed under finite temperature and weak enough dissipation. In particular, we find that a new type of dynamical quantum phase transition emerges in a dissipation system. The proposed GLOA provides a powerful tool in investigating quantum dynamical quantum phase transition in arbitrary quantum system.
