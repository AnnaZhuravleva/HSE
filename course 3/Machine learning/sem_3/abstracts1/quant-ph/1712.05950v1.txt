Monogamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems. We investigate monogamy relations for multiqubit generalized W-class states. We present new analytical monogamy inequalities for the concurrence of assistance, which are shown to be tighter than the existing ones. Furthermore, analytical monogamy inequalities are obtained for the negativity of assistance.
