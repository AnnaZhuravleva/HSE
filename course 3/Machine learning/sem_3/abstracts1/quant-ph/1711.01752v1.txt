In this paper, we proposed an experimental implementation of quantum random number generator(QRNG) with inherent randomness of quantum tunneling effect of electrons. We exploited InGaAs/InP diodes, whose valance band and conduction band shared a quasi-constant energy barrier. We applied a bias voltage on the InGaAs/InP avalanche diode, which made the diode works under Geiger mode, and triggered the tunneling events with a periodic pulse. Finally, after data collection and post-processing, our quantum random number generation rate reached 8Mb/s, and final data was verified by NIST test and Diehard test. Our experiment is characterized as an innovative low-cost, photonic source free, integratable or even chip-achievable method in quantum random number generation.
