It is known that no quantum process can produce a predetermined superposition of unknown arbitrary states. It has already been shown that with some partial information about the states, one can produce with some probability such superpositions. Here we show that there are universal machines which can produce superpositions of unknown orthogonal states with unit probability. Our construction unravels the relation between the no-cloning theorem and the no-superposition theorem, that is we show that if a perfect cloning machine exists, then a universal superposition machine can also exist.
