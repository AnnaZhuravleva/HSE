We consider novel implementation of quantum teleportation protocol of unknown qubit with entangled hybrid state. Coherent components of the entangled hybrid state displace the teleported qubit at the same absolute but opposite in sign values, so that any information about amount by which the qubit is displaced is lost despite the fact that one of these events has definitely occurred. Alice unambiguously distinguishes her measurement outcomes and Bob obtains at his disposal states of a single photon in superposition of two modes with controllable amplitude distortions. We consider the implementation of this protocol with a third participant who off-line prepares amplitude modulated unknown qubits and hand them to Alice for teleportation. In this interpretation, the success probability of the teleportation depends on the absolute value of the amplitude of the unknown qubit. In particular, highly unbalanced unknown qubits can be teleported with success probability close to one. We also consider some ways of demodulating amplitude modulated states by the receiver in order to increase the success probability of the teleportation of unknown qubits.
