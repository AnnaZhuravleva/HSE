The modelling of stochastic processes is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social sciences. An ideal model produces the correct statistical output without any unnecessary complexity. This minimal-complexity criterion is important conceptually, entailing the least number of causes of effects (Occam's razor), and practically, entailing the least stored information in the simulation. Here, we experimentally compare classical and quantum information encodings in simulating an Ising spin chain, showing that quantum encodings perform better and redefine our understanding of what is complex. We experimentally observe a recently conjectured effect, the ambiguity of simplicity. Specifically, we simulate Ising chains at different temperatures, A and B, such that classical encodings require fewer resources to model A than B, while quantum encodings are simpler for B than A. This challenges the perspective that relative complexity is contained solely in the configuration of the system being modelled. Our error-tolerant techniques account for inevitable imperfections in realising quantum simulators, thus providing the technological milestone needed to simulate increasingly complex stochastic processes.
