We consider the notion of equilibration for an isolated quantum system exhibiting Anderson localization. The system is assumed to be in a pure state, i.e., described by a wave-function undergoing unitary dynamics. We focus on the simplest model of a 1D disordered chain and we analyse both the dynamics of an initially localized state and the dynamics of quantum states drawn at random from the ensemble corresponding to the minimum knowledge about the initial state. While in the former case the site distribution remains confined in a limited portion of the chain, the site distribution of random pure state fluctuates around an equilibrium average that is delocalized over the entire chain. A clear connection between the equilibration observed when the system is initialized in a fully localized state and the amplitude of dynamical fluctuations of a typical random pure state is established.
