In this paper, we study the quantum self-contained refrigerator [N. Linden, S. Popescu and P. Skrzypczyk, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{105}, 130401 (2010)] in the strong internal coupling regime with engineered reservoirs. We find that if some modes of the three thermal reservoirs can be properly filtered out, the efficiency and the working domain of the refrigerator can be improved in contrast to the those in the weak internal coupling regime, which indicates one advantage of the strong internal coupling. In addition, we find that the background natural vacuum reservoir could cause the filtered refrigerator to stop working and the background natural thermal reservoir could greatly reduce the cooling efficiency.
