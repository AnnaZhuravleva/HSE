Quantum memory capable of storage and retrieval of flying photons on demand is crucial in developing quantum information technologies. In particular, to build efficient quantum computers and long-distance quantum communications, a broadband and room-temperature quantum memory associated with enabled quantum networks is of practical significance. Here, we present the first hybrid quantum memory enabled network by demonstrating two types of quantum memory building blocks and their interconnecting: an atomic-ensemble-based memory capable of generating and storing single atomic excitations which can then be converted to single photons, and an all-optical loop memory for mapping incoming photons in and out on demand, at room-temperature and with a broad acceptance bandwidth. Cascading these two types of quantum memories, we observe a well-preserved herald-single quantum cross-correlation, reaching a value of 22, and a violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality up to 549 standard deviations. Such a network allows atomic excitations to be generated, stored, and converted to broadband photons, which are then transferred to the next node, stored, and faithfully retrieved, all at high speed and in a programmable fashion. The simultaneously demonstrated two type of quantum memories constitute a complete set for constructing a hybrid quantum network, representing a substantial step towards scalable quantum information processing.
