This study concerns with the dynamics of a quantum neural network unit in order to examine the suitability of simple neural computing tasks. More specifically, we examine the dynamics of an interacting spin model chosen as a candidate of a quantum perceptron for closed and open quantum systems. We adopt a collisional model enables examining both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics of the proposed quantum system. We show that our quantum neural network (QNN) unit has a stable output quantum state in contact with an environment carrying information content. By the performed numerical simulations one can compare the dynamics in the presence and absence of quantum memory effects. We find that our QNN unit is suitable for implementing general neural computing tasks in contact with a Markovian information environment and quantum memory effects cause complications on the stability of the output state.
