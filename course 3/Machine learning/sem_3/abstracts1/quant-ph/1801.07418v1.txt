We present novel and simple estimation of a minimal dimension required for an effective reservoir in open quantum systems. Using a tensor network formalism we introduce a new object called a reservoir network (RN). The reservoir network is the tensor network in the form of a Matrix Product State, which contains all effects of open dynamics. This object is especially useful for understanding memory effects. We discuss possible applications of the reservoir network and the estimation of dimension to develop new numerical and machine learning based methods for open quantum systems.
