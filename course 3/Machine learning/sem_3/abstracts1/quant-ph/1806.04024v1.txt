We consider a quantum particle (walker) on a line who coherently chooses to jump to the left or right depending on the result of toss of a quantum coin. The lengths of the jumps are considered to be independent and identically distributed quenched Poisson random variables. We find that the walker is significantly localized to the near-origin region with respect to the case when there is no disorder. The scaling exponent of the quenched-averaged dispersion of the walker is sub-ballistic but super-diffusive. We also show that the features are universal to a class of sub- and super-Poissonian distributed quenched randomized jumps.
