Despite 'quantum contextuality' being one of the most fundamental non-classical features, its generic role in information processing and computation is an open quest. This article shows that quantum contextuality is a potential resource for communication. We introduce a general framework of one-way oblivious communication (OC) tasks in which certain information about the sender's input should be secure. A methodology for obtaining an upper bound on the success of the tasks in classical communication is provided. Particularly, we study a family of OC tasks based on Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of vectors and show that quantum strategy corresponding to every KS set outperforms classical communication of arbitrarily large dimensional system. The quantum advantage is extended to the state independent contextuality (SIC) proofs that go beyond KS argument. The optimal classical protocols for the simplest SIC sets in dimension three and four are explicitly derived. Our results provide an operational significance to single system SIC and open up the possibility of quantum information processing based on that.
