We propose a Bell measurement free scheme to implement a quantum repeater in GaAs/AlGa double qunatum dot systems.we prove the four pairs of double quantum dots compose an entanglement unit, given the the initial state is singlet states. Our shceme differs from the famous Duan-Lukin-Cirac-zoller(DLCZ) protocol in that Bell measurements are unneccessary for the entanglement swapping,which provides great advantages and conveniences in experimental implementaion. Our scheme significantly improve the success probability of quantum repeaters based on solid state quantum devices.
