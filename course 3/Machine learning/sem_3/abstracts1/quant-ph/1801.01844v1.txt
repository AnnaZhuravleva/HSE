We present a simple model which allows us to explain the physical nature of the oscillating entropy. We consider an ensemble of qubits interacting with thermal two-level systems. The entropy of the qubits oscillates between zero and the value of entropy of the thermal systems. We show that the oscillations of the entropy can be clearly explained by the precession of the real or effective spins of the qubits.
