We characterize a close connection between the continuous-time quantum-walk model and a discrete-time quantum-walk version, based on the staggered model with Hamiltonians in a class of Cayley graphs, which can be considered as a discretization of continuous-time quantum walks. This connection provides examples of perfect state transfer and instantaneous uniform mixing in the staggered model. On the other hand, we provide some more examples of perfect state transfer and instantaneous uniform mixing in the staggered model that cannot be reproduced by the continuous-time model.
