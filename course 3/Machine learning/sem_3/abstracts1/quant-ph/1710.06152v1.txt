With rotating-wave approximation (RWA), we show in this paper that exciton transmission in a one-dimensional two-level molecule chain embedded in a cavity can be enhanced or suppressed by strong cavity-chain couplings. This exciton transmission is closely related to the number of molecules and the distribution of molecular exciton energy. In addition, we propose a proposal to enhance the exciton transmission by quantum-jump-based feedback. These results may find applications in experiments of exciton transmission in organic materials.
