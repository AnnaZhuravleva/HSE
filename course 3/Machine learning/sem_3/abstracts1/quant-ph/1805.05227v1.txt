We extensively test a recent protocol to demonstrate quantum fault tolerance on three systems: (1) five spin qubits coupled to an environment with two-level defects, (2) a real-time simulation model of transmon quantum computers, and (3) the 16-qubit processor of the IBM Q experience. In the simulations, the dynamics of the full system is obtained by numerically solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the fault-tolerant scheme provides a systematic way to improve the results when the errors are dominated by the inherent control and measurement errors present in transmon systems. However, the scheme fails to satisfy the criterion for fault tolerance when decoherence effects become important.
