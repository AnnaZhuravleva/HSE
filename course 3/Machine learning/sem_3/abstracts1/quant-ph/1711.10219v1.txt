It is well known that in a two-slit interference experiment, acquiring which-path information about the particle, leads to a degrading of the interference. It is argued that path-information has a meaning only when one can umabiguously tell which slit the particle went through. Using this idea, two duality relations are derived for the general case where the two paths may not be equally probable. These duality relations, which are inequalities in general, saturate for all pure states. Earlier known results are recovered in suitable limit.
