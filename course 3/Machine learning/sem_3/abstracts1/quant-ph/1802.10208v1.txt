Integrated optics Green Machines enable better communication in photon-starved environments, but fabrication inconsistencies induce unpredictable internal phase errors, making them difficult to construct. We describe and experimentally demonstrate a new method to compensate for arbitrary phase errors by deriving a convex error space and implementing an algorithm to learn a unique codebook of codewords corresponding to each matrix.
