We propose a quantum optical device to experimentally realize quantum processes, which perform the regularization of the--in general highly singular--Glauber-Sudarshan $P$~functions of arbitrary quantum states before their application and/or measurement. This allows us to produce a broad class of nonclassical states with regular $P$~functions, also called nonclassicality quasiprobabilities. For this purpose, the input states are combined on highly transmissive beam splitters with specific Gaussian or non-Gaussian classical states. We study both balanced and unbalanced homodyne detections for the direct sampling of the output states of the implemented processes, which requires no further regularization or state-reconstruction. By numerical simulations we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and we outline the generalization to multimode light.
