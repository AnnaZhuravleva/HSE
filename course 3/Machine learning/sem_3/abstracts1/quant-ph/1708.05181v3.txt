We provide a class of entanglement witnesses constructed in terms of Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs). This construction reproduces many well-known examples like the celebrated reduction map and Choi map together with its generalizations. We illustrated our construction by the detailed analysis of the 3-dimensional case: in this case, one obtains a family of entanglement witnesses parameterized by an L-dimensional torus (L = 2,3,4 being a number of MUBs used in the construction).
