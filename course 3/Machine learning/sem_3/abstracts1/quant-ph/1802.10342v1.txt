We discuss a method based on a segmentary approximation of solutions of the Schr\"odinger by quadratic splines, for which the coefficients are determined by a variational method that does not require the resolution of complicated algebraic equations. The idea is the application of the method to one dimensional periodic potentials. We include the determination of the eigenvalues up to a given level, and therefore an approximation to the lowest energy bands. We apply the method to concrete examples with interest in physics and discussed the numerical errors.
