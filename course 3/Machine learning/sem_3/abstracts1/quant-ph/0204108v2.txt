We show a device with which, apparently, information (in the form of a "slash-dot" code) is instantly transmitted via Bell state collapse, over arbitrary distance. We show then why the device does not actually work, and discuss about the "no Bell telephone" statement. We discuss also about the troublesome relationship between the Copenhagen interpretation and special relativity. In particular, we advocate the interpretation that the "state space" cannot be a description of the state of the object studied alone, but that the observer is inextricably involved even if no measurement is taking place.
