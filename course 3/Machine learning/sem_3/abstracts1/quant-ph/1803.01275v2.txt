In quantum mechanics, continuously measuring an observable steers the system into one eigenstate of that observable. This property has interesting and useful consequences when the observable is a joint property of two remotely separated qubits. In particular, if the measurement of the two-qubit joint observable is performed in a way that is blind to single-qubit information, quantum back-action generates correlation of the discord type even if the measurement is weak and inefficient. We demonstrate the ability to generate these quantum correlations in a circuit-QED setup by performing a weak joint readout of two remote, non-interacting, superconducting transmon qubits using the two non-degenerate modes of a Josephson Parametric Converter (JPC). Single-qubit information is erased from the output in the limit of large gain and with properly tailored cavity drive pulses. Our results of the measurement of discord are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions, and demonstrate the utility of the JPC as a which-qubit information eraser.
