Quantum simulations consist in the intentional reproduction of physical or unphysical models into another more controllable quantum system. Beyond establishing communication vessels between unconnected fields, they promise to solve complex problems which may be considered as intractable for classical computers. From a historic perspective, two independent approaches have been pursued, namely, digital and analog quantum simulations. The former usually provide universality and flexibility, while the latter allows for better scalability. Here, we review recent literature merging both paradigms in the context of superconducting circuits, yielding: digital-analog quantum simulations. In this manner, we aim at getting the best of both approaches in the most advanced quantum platform involving superconducting qubits and microwave transmission lines. The discussed merge of quantum simulation concepts, digital and analog, may open the possibility in the near future for outperforming classical computers in relevant problems, enabling the reach of a quantum advantage.
