In this paper, we propose a protocol for angular displacement estimation based upon orbital angular momentum coherent state and a SU(1,1)-SU(2) hybrid interferometer. This interferometer consists of an optical parametric amplifier, a beam splitter and reflection mirrors, hereon we use a quantum detection strategy $\---$ balanced homodyne detection. The results indicate that super-resolution and super-sensitivity can be realized with ideal condition. Additionally, we study the impact of photon loss on the resolution and the sensitivity, and the robustness of our protocol is also discussed. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of our protocol over SU(1,1) and summarize the merits of orbital angular momentum-enhanced protocol.
