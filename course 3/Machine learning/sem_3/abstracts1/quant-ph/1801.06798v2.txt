We examine entanglement between number and polarization, or between number and relative phase, for pairs of coherent states and two-mode squeezed vacuum via linear entropy and covariance criteria. We consider the embedding of the two-mode Hilbert space in a larger space to get a well-defined factorization of the number-phase variables. This can be regarded as a kind of proto-entanglement that can be extracted and converted into real particle entanglement via feasible experimental procedures. In particular this reveals interesting entanglement properties of pairs of coherent states.
