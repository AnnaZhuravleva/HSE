We present a quantum algorithm for simulating quantum chemistry with complexity $\tilde{O}(\eta^{8/3} N^{1/3})$, where $\eta$ is the number of electrons and $N$ is the number of plane wave orbitals. In comparison, the most efficient prior algorithms for simulating electronic structure using plane waves (or any other basis) have complexity $\tilde{O}(N^2)$. We achieve our scaling in first quantization by performing simulation in the rotating frame of the kinetic operator using recent interaction picture techniques. Our algorithm is far more efficient when $N \gg \eta$ (i.e. when scaling towards the continuum limit), as is needed to suppress discretization error when representing molecules in the plane wave basis.
