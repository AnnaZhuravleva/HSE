We investigate the thermal Casimir effect of a massless scalar field for two parallel plates moving in the equatorial orbit in Kerr space-time. Under the assumption that the typical cavity size is much smaller than the orbital radius, proposed by Sorge, we deduce the analytical expression of the renormalized free energy in this curved space-time. We also get the analytical representation for the renormalized internal energy, and find that there is a thermal correction to the Casimir energy, which depends on the proper temperature and the proper geometrical parameters of the plates. The asymptotic behavior of the Casimir free energy, entropy and internal energy at low temperature is also investigated.
