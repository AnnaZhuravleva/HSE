Continuous-variable measurement-independent-device quantum key distribution (CV-MDI-QKD) can offer high secure key rate at metropolitan distance and remove all side channel loopholes of detection as well. However, there is no complete experimental demonstration of CV-MDI-QKD due to the remote distance phase-locking techniques challenge. Here, we present a new optical scheme to overcome this difficulty and also removes the requirement of two identical independent lasers. We anticipate that our new scheme can be used to demonstrate the complete CV-MDI-QKD experiment and build the CV-MDI-QKD network with untrusted source.
