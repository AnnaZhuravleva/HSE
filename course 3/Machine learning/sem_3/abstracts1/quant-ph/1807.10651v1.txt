We propose a hybrid quantum algorithm based on the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving a system of linear equations. In our hybrid scheme, a classical information feed-forward is required from the quantum phase estimation algorithm to reduce a circuit depth from the original HHL algorithm. In this paper, we show that this hybrid algorithm is functionally identical to the HHL algorithm under the assumption that the number of qubits used in algorithms is large enough. In addition, it is experimentally examined with four qubits in the IBM Quantum Experience setups, and the experimental results of our algorithm show higher accurate performance on specific systems of linear equations than that of the HHL algorithm.
