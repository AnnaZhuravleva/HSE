If for a given system we are able to identify an annihilation operator, then it is plausible to build its multiphoton coherent states as eigenstates of the $m$-th power of such an operator, and to analyze then their properties. Following this idea, in this paper we are going to build the multiphoton supercoherent states for the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator, as eigenstates of the $m$-th power of a special form of the supersymmetric annihilation operator. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation as well as some statistical properties for these states will be studied, and the geometric phase will be also evaluated.
