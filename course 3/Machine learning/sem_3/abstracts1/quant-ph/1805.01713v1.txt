Plasmonics and metamaterials have recently been shown to allow the control and interaction with non-classical states of light, a rather counterintuitive finding given the high losses typically encountered in these systems. Here, we demonstrate a range of functionalities that are allowed with correlated and entangled photons that are used to illuminate multiple, overlaid patterns on plasmonic metasurfaces. Correlated photons allow to nonlocally determine the pattern that is imaged or, alternatively to un-scramble an image that is otherwise blurred. Entangled photons allow a more important functionality whereby the images imprinted on the metasurface are individually visible only when illuminated with one of the entangled photons. Correlated single photon imaging of functional metasurfaces could therefore promise advances towards the use of nanostructured subwavelength thin devices in quantum information protocols.
