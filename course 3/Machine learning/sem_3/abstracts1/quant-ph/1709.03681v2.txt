The local approach to construct master equation for a composite open system with a weak internal coupling is simple and seems reasonable. However, it is thermodynamic consistent only when the subsystems are resonantly coupled. Efforts are being made to understand the inconsistency and test the validity of the local master equation. We present a perturbative method to solve the steady-state solutions of linear local master equations, which are demonstrated by two simple models. The solving process shows the stationary state as the result of competition between incoherent operations and the unitary creating quantum coherence, and consequently relate quantum coherence with thermodynamic consistency.
