We will study the splitting in the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom subjected to a uniform electric field (Stark effect) with the Heisenberg algebra deformed leading to the minimum length. We will use the perturbation theory for cases not degenerate ($n=1$) and degenerate ($n=2$), along with known results of corrections in these levels caused by the minimum length applied purely to the hydrogen atom, so that we may find and estimate the corrections of minimum length applied to the Stark effect.
