We study the stationary photon output and statistics of small lasers. Our closed-form expressions clarify the contribution of collective effects due to the interaction between quantum emitters. We generalize laser rate equations and explain photon trapping: a decrease of the photon number output below the lasing threshold, derive an expression for the stationary cavity mode autocorrelation function $g_2$, which implies that collective effects may strongly influence the photon statistics. We identify conditions for coherent, thermal and superthermal radiation, the latter being a unique fingerprint for collective emission in lasers. These generic analytical results agree with recent experiments, complement numerical results, and provide insight into and design rules for nanolasers.
