We study the problem to infer the original ground state of a spin-glass Hamiltonian out of the information from the Hamiltonian with interactions deviated from the original ones. Our motivation comes from quantum annealing on a real device in which the values of interactions are degraded by noise. We show numerically for quasi-one-dimensional systems that the Hamming distance between the original ground state and the inferred spin state is minimized when we stop the process of quantum annealing before the amplitude of the transverse field reaches zero in contrast to the conventional prescription. This result means that finite quantum fluctuations compensate for the effects of noise, at least to some extent. Analytical calculations using the infinite-range mean-field model support our conclusion qualitatively.
