To improve the performance of the traditional tripartite opto-mechanical system, we design a developed opto-mechanical tripartite system in which all subsystems such as an optical cavity, microresonator, and microcavity modes are coupled directly to each other. This system is analyzed quantum mechanically, and its dynamics of motion is studied by the Heisenberg-Langevin equations. Notably, the originality of this work contributes to embedding the spherical capacitor in the optical cavity where the plasmon-plasmon interaction between capacitor plates manipulates the internal electric field. Therefore, using plasmon-plasmon interaction inside the spherical capacitor, which leads to nonlinearity, causes the contributed polarization function of the plasmonic property. Actually, this plasmonic property manages the spherical capacitance. Although the spherical capacitor is fundamentally dependent on the plasmonic properties caused by the capacitor gap, the spherical capacitor for a design is required to be parallel to the microwave capacitor. The system developed in the present work proved that the stability of the entanglement between optical cavity and microcavity modes toward the temperature changing is dramatically increased; which is the original goal of this study. It is worth mentioning that the environment noise severely restricted the traditional tripartite system operated with a wide bandwidth, hence the present design can efficiently fix this issue.
