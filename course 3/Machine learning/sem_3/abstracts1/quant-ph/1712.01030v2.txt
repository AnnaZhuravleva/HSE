The characterization of non-local correlations with respect to the causal order of events in spacetime is still an open question. We systematically investigate the polytope of relativistic causal boxes in the three-party Bell scenario and compute the complete set of extremal boxes in the (3,2,2) scenario with three parties each performing two binary measurements. We highlight the difference with the usual no-signaling polytope by computing the dimension of the RC polytope and contrasting the RC bounds for some well-known multi-player games. We show that no two-party Bell inequality obeys a monogamy relation when constrained only by causality as opposed to the no-signaling conditions. We identify multi-party Bell inequalities and measurement configurations where trade-off relations do exist, showing that device-independent cryptography against adversaries constrained only by relativistic causality is still not excluded.
