Scattering discussion due to Double Dirac Equation in Quaternionic version of relativistic quantum mechanics has been studied in this paper in details. In such a quantum mechanics Dirac equation in presence vector and scalar potential has been considered. Then a Quaternionic double Dirac delta potential comes to our considered system which causes to scatter the particles. Scattering states of the particles have been derived as well as reflected and transmission coefficients are calculated.
