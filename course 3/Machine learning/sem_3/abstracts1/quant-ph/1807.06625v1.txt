Quantum walks are versatile and powerful kernels in analog quantum computing protocols. They often achieve their full potential when the underlying structures are complex graphs, showing strong capabilities in speeding-up various simulation and optimization tasks. One striking example is given by quantum walkers evolving on glued trees, with exponentially faster `hitting' performances with respect to their classical counterparts. However, its experimental implementation is challenging due to the exponentially increasing number of nodes in its network and geometrically limited interactions. Here we propose an alternative structure with a polynomially increasing number of nodes and successfully map such graphs on photonic chips using femtosecond laser direct writing techniques in a geometrically scalable fashion. We experimentally demonstrate quantum fast hitting by implementing two-dimensional quantum walks on these graphs with up to 160 nodes and a depth of 8 layers, and achieve a linear relationship between the optimal hitting time and the network layer depth. Our results may open up a prompt way towards quantum speed-up in complex problems classically intractable.
