A comparative analysis of the method of histograms and the sequence of the ranged am-plitudes (SRA) for statistical parametrization of the operation regime of a single-photon avalanche photodetector is carried out. It is shown that the SRA method contains all the information, which can be obtained using the method of histograms, and also allows to give a quick robust description of the dark counts of the device for a short noise sample of $\sim10^3$ points, what open the way for the introduction of SRA approach into software of a high-sensitivity photodetectors.
