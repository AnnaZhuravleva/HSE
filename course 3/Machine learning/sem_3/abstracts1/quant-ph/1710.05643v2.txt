Non-classical quantum technologies that rely on manipulation of quantum states and exploitation of quantum superposition and entanglement are approaching a level of maturity sufficient to contemplate commercialization as the basis of practical devices for sensing, communications, navigation and other applications in the relatively near-term. However, realization of such technologies is dependent upon the development of appropriate Quantum Systems Engineering (QSE) approaches. It is clear that whilst traditional systems engineering will support much of the integration need, there are aspects associated with system of interest definition, system modelling, and system verification where substantial advances in the systems engineering approach are required. This paper lays out in detail the challenges associated with Quantum Enabled Systems and Technologies (QEST) and analyses the adequacy of systems engineering processes and tools, as defined by the Systems and Software Engineering lifecycle standard (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288), to meet these challenges. The conclusions of this paper provide an outline agenda for systems research in order to engineer QEST.
