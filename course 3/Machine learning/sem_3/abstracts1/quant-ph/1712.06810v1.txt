Based on weak measurement technology, we propose the first three-observer dimension witness protocol in a prepare-and-measure setup. By applying the dimension witness inequality based on the quantum random access code and the nonlinear determinant value, we demonstrate that double classical dimension witness violation is achievable if we choose appropriate weak measurement parameters. Analysis of the results will shed new light on the interplay between the multi-observer quantum dimension witness and the weak measurement technology, which can also be applied in the generation of semi-device-independent quantum random numbers and quantum key distribution protocols.
