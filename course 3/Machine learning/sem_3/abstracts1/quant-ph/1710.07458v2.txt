Mutually unbiased bases which is also maximally entangled bases is called mutually unbiased maximally entangled bases (MUMEBs). We study the construction of MUMEBs in bipartite system. In detail, we construct 2(p^a-1) MUMEBs in C^d\otimes C^d by properties of Guss sums for arbitrary odd d. It improves the known lower bound p^a-1 for odd d. Certainly, it also generalizes the lower bound 2(p^a-1) for d being a single prime power. Furthermore, we construct MUMEBs in C^d\otimes C^{kd} for general k>= 2 and odd d. We get the similar lower bounds as $k,b$ are both single prime powers. Particularly, when k is a square number, by using mutually orthogonal Latin squares, we can construct more MUMEBs in C^d\otimes C^{kd}, and obtain greater lower bounds than reducing the problem into prime power dimension in some cases.
