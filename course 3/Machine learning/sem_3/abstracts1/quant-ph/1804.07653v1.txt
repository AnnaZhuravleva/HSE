We introduce a new graphical framework for designing quantum error correction codes based on classical principles. A key feature of this graphical language, over previous approaches, is that it is closely related to that of factor graphs or graphical models in classical information theory and machine learning. It enables us to formulate the description of recently-introduced `coherent parity check' quantum error correction codes entirely within the language of classical information theory. This makes our construction accessible without requiring background in quantum error correction or even quantum mechanics in general. More importantly, this allows for a collaborative interplay where one can design new quantum error correction codes derived from classical codes.
