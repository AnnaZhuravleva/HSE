Characteristic length of mass density resolution in dynamical reduction models is calculated utilizing energy conservation law and viable cosmological model with decreasing energy density of vacuum (dark energy density). The value found, $ \sim 10^{-5}$ cm, numerically coincides with phenomenological spatial short-length cutoff parameter introduced in the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber model. It seems that our results support the gravity induced mechanism of dynamical reduction.
