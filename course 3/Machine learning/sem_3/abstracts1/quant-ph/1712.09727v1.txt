The spectral singularity (SS) and coherent perfect absorption (CPA) have been extensively studied over the last one and half decade for different non-Hermitian potentials in non-Hermitian standard quantum mechanics (SQM) governed by Schrodinger equation. In the present work we explore these scattering features in the domain of non-Hermitian space fractional quantum mechanics (SFQM) governed by fractional Schrodinger equation which is characterized by Levy index $\alpha$ ($ 1< \alpha \leq 2$). We observe that non-Hermitian SFQM systems have more flexibility for SS and CPA and display some new features of scattering. For the delta potential $V(x)=-i\rho \delta (x-x_{0})$, $\rho > 0$, the SS energy, $E_{ss}$, is blue or red shifted with decreasing $\alpha$ depending the strength of the potential. For complex rectangular barrier in non-Hermitian SQM, it is known that the reflection and transmission amplitudes are oscillatory near the spectral singular point. It is found that these oscillations eventually develop SS in non-Hermitian SFQM. The similar features is also reported for the case of CPA phenomena from complex rectangular barrier in non-Hermitian SFQM. These observations suggest a deeper relation between scattering features of non-Hermitian SQM and non-Hermitian SFQM.
