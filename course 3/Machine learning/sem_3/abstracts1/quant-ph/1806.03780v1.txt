Defining and measuring the error of a measurement is one of the most fundamental activities in experimental science. However, quantum theory shows a peculiar difficulty in extending the classical notion of root-mean-square (rms) error to quantum measurements. A straightforward generalization based on the noise-operator was used to reformulate Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the accuracy of simultaneous measurements to be universally valid and made the conventional formulation testable to observe its violation. Recently, its reliability was examined based on an anomaly that the error vanishes for some imprecise measurements, in which the meter does not commute with the measured observable. Here, we propose an improved definition for a quantum generalization of the classical rms error, which is state-dependent, operationally definable, and perfectly characterizes precise measurements. Moreover, it is shown that the new notion maintains the previously obtained universally valid uncertainty relations and their experimental confirmations without changing their forms and interpretations, in contrast to a prevailing view that a state-dependent formulation for measurement uncertainty relation is not tenable.
