The difficulties encountered up till now in the theory of identifying the spin and orbital angular momentum of the photon stem from the approach of separating the angular momentum of the photon into spin and orbital parts. Here we derive the spin of the photon from a set of two relativistic quantum equations that is equivalent to free-space Maxwell equations, with particular attention paid to the effects of relativistic constraint on the properties of the photon spin. On one hand, we find that the relativistic constraint makes the spin, which appears to be an independent degree of freedom if the relativistic constraint is absent, dependent on the momentum so that no operator for the photon spin exists in position representation. As a result, the notion of local density of the photon spin in position space is physically misleading. On the other hand, we show that the relativistic constraint allows to express the expectation value of the spin as integrals of different integrands over the position space.
