We employ the mean-field approach in the fermionic picture of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to investigate the dynamics of bipartite quantum discord and concurrence under sudden quenching. In the case, when quenching is performed in the anisotropy from an initial value to the critical point, the quantum correlations show periodic cusps in time. Moreover, the first suppression (cusp) in quantum correlations can be explained in terms of the semi-classical picture of quasiparticle propagation. On the other hand, quenching to, as well as away from the criticality point shows that the longtime pairwise quantum discord gets enhanced from its initial state. Finally, we show that in the gapped region a quench in the transverse field displays survival of the next-nearest-neighbor quantum discord. Our results provide a further insight into the dynamical behavior of quantum correlations and their connections to quantum criticality.
