We characterize the Europium (Eu$^{3+}$) hyperfine interaction of the excited state ($^5$D$_0$) and determine its effective spin Hamiltonian parameters for the Zeeman and quadrupole tensors. An optical free induction decay method is used to measure all hyperfine splittings under weak external magnetic field (up to 10 mT) for various field orientations. On the basis of the determined Hamiltonian we discuss the possibility to predict optical transition probabilities between hyperfine levels for the $^7$F$_{0} \longleftrightarrow ^5$D$_{0}$ transition. The obtained results provide necessary information to realize an optical quantum memory scheme which utilizes long spin coherence properties of $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ material under external magnetic fields
