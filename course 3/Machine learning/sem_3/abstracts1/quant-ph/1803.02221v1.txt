We propose a quantum uncertainty relation for arbitrary quantum states in terms of Lipschitz constants of the corresponding position and momentum probability distributions. The Lipschitz constant of a function may be considered to quantify the extent of fluctuations of that function, and is in general independent of its spread. We find that the product of the Lipschitz constants of position and momentum probability distributions is bounded below by a number that is of the order of the inverse square of the Planck's constant.
