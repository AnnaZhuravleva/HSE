Calculating the degree of non-Markovianity of a dissipative process is a difficult task, even for the dynamics of a single qubit, given the complex maximization problem. In this work, focusing on the entanglement-based quantifier of non-Markovianity, we present an analytical solution for such an optimization problem. We then propose a computable non-Markovianity measure based on generalized robustness of entanglement, an entanglement measure that can be readily calculated by a semidefinite programming method. We show that the non-Markovianity, in a given interval of time, can be witnessed by calculating the expectation value of an observable, making it attractive for experimental investigations.
