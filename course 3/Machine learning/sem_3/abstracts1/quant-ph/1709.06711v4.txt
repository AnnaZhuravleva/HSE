The Hilbert spaces of the quantized electromagnetic field and of the quantized Dirac spinor field are constructed using classical random fields acting on a vacuum state, in an algebraic Koopman--von Neumann approach, so that the quantized and random fields act as different subalgebras acting on the same Hilbert space, allowing a classical interpretation of the states of the respective quantum theories. For the quantized electromagnetic field, there is a commutative subalgebra $\mathcal{R}$ that corresponds to a random field on Minkowski space, not just, as one might naively expect, on a space-like hyperplane. For the quantized Dirac spinor field, the Lie algebra $\mathcal{D}$ of global-U(1) invariant observables can be constructed as a subalgebra of a bosonic raising and lowering algebra, $\mathcal{D}\subset\mathcal{B}$, and the usual vacuum state over $\mathcal{D}$ can be extended (here, trivially) to act over $\mathcal{B}$, which contains a commutative subalgebra that corresponds to a random field on Minkowski space.
