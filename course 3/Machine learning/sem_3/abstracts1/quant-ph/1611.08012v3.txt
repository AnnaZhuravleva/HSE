We introduce a high-level graphical framework for the design, analysis, and verification of quantum error correcting codes. The coherent parity check construction for stabilizer codes allows us to construct a broad range of quantum codes based on classical codes, and gives a framework in which large classes of such codes can be both analytically and numerically discovered. Using graphical tools based on the \zx calculus, we explicitly construct small distance 3 and 5 codes with high code rates using this framework. We also show how this framework can be used to represent CSS codes and conversely how to compute stabilisers for a CPC code. We give a construction turns (almost) any pair of classical [n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code, and give a straightforward technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally we use the graphical tools we introduce to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within CPC codes.
