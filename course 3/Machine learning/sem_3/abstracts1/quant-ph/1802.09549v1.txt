After close to two decades of research and development, superconducting circuits have emerged as a rich platform for both quantum computation and quantum simulation. Lattices of superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators have been shown to produce artificial materials for microwave photons, where weak interactions can be introduced either via non-linear resonator materials or strong interactions via qubit-resonator coupling. Here, we introduce a technique using networks of CPW resonators to create a new class of materials which constitute regular lattices in an effective hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. We show numerical simulations of a class of hyperbolic analogs of the kagome lattice which show unusual densities of states with a spectrally-isolated degenerate flat band. We also present an experimental realization of one of these lattices, exhibiting the aforementioned band structure. This paper represents the first step towards on-chip quantum simulation of materials science and interacting particles in curved space.
