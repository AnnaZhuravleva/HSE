We present a first study on the quantum sensitivity in decision making. The theory of decision making indicates what choices are optimal in a given situation. For example, when a decision is made, the available information, say "hint", is interpreted and translated into the optimal choices; however, the analyses and calculations of such processes are radically intractable. We thus propose a decision maker that adopts an algorithm which produces the outcomes in a probabilistic way. As a main result, we show both theoretically and experimentally that such a quantum decision maker potentially exhibits higher hint-sensitivity to the hints categorized between "good" and "poor." This quantum feature originates from the quantum superposition property involved in the decision making process. It is also shown that a higher hint-sensitivity still remains unless the quantum superposition is completely decohered.
