The R\'enyi entropies of Coulomb systems $R_{p}[\rho], 0 < p < \infty$ are logarithms of power functionals of the electron density $\rho(\vec{r})$ which quantify most appropriately the electron uncertainty and describe numerous physical observables. However, its analytical determination is a hard issue not yet solved except for the first lowest-lying energetic states of some specific systems. This is so even for the $D$-dimensional hydrogenic system, which is the main prototype of the multidimensional Coulomb many-body systems. Recently, the R\'enyi entropies of this system have been found in the two extreme high-energy (Rydberg) and high-dimensional (pseudo-classical) cases. In this work we determine the position and momentum R\'enyi entropies (with integer $p$ greater than 1) for all the discrete stationary states of the multidimensional hydrogenic system directly in terms of the hyperquantum numbers which characterize the states, the nuclear charge and the space dimensionality. We have used a methodology based on linearization formulas for powers of the orthogonal Laguerre and Gegenbauer polynomials which control the hydrogenic states.
