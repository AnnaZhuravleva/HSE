A thought-provoking proposal by Tsakmakidis et al. [Science 356, 1260 (2017)] suggests that nonreciprocal optics can break a time-bandwidth limit to passive resonators. Here I quantize their resonator model and show that quantum mechanics does impose a limit, or requires extra noise to be added in the same fashion as amplified spontaneous emission in an active resonator. I also use thermodynamics to argue that extra dissipation or noise must be present in their proposed device.
