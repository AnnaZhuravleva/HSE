The power of quantum computers is still somewhat speculative. While they are certainly faster than classical ones, the class of problems they can efficiently solve has not been mapped definitively onto known classical complexity theory, and there is a paucity of truly quantum algorithms. This is partly because finding algorithms that take advantage of the quantum nature of reality is very difficult. In previous work over the past three decades we have proposed, and developed, the idea of using techniques of machine learning to address this problem. Here we compare the performance of standard real- and complex-valued classical neural networks with that of one of our models for a quantum neural network, on both classical problems and on an archetypal quantum problem: the computation of an entanglement witness. The quantum network is shown to be considerably more powerful.
