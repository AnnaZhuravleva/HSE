Topological phase transition plays a significant role in modern condensed matter physics, since it is beyond Landau symmetry-breaking theory. Quantum walks have been demonstrated to be a powerful method in exploring topological quantum matter. Here, we investigate a special quantum walk in a line in terms of coherent state representation. By detecting average number of photons of the system, quantum phase transition can be observed, and the properties of coherent space are utilized. In addition, we propose an experimental protocol in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, where a superconducting qubit is a coin while the cavity mode is used for quantum walk.
