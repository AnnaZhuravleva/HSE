In multipartite entanglement theory, the partial separability properties have an elegant, yet complicated structure, which boils down in the case when multipartite correlations are considered. In this work, we elaborate this, by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the class of a given class-label, by the use of which we work out the structure of the classification for some important particular cases, namely, for the finest classification, for the classification based on k-partitionability and k-producibility, and for the classification based on the atoms of the correlation properties.
