Efforts on enhancing the ghost imaging speed and quality are intensified when the debate around the nature of ghost imaging (quantum vs. classical) is suspended for a while. Accordingly, most of the studies these years in the field fall into the improvement regarding these two targets by utilizing the different imaging mediums. Nevertheless, back to the raging debate occurred but with different focus, to overcome the inherent difficulties in the classical imaging domain, if we are able to utilize the superiority that quantum information science offers us, the ghost imaging experiment may be implemented more practically. In this study, a quantum circuit implementation of ghost imaging experiment is proposed, where the speckle patterns and phase mask are encoded by utilizing the quantum representation of images. To do this, we formulated several quantum models, i.e. quantum accumulator, quantum multiplier, and quantum divider. We believe this study will provide a new impetus to explore the implementation of ghost imaging using quantum computing resources.
