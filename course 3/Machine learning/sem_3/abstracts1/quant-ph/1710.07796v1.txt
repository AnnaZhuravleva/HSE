Exceptional point in non-Hermitian system possesses fascinating properties. We present an exactly solvable attractor dynamics for the first time from a two-level time dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It allows a way to evolve to the coalescence state from a pure or mixed initial state through varying the imaginary parameter along a specific diabatic passage. Contrast to a chaotic attractor that is ultrasensitive to the initial condition, the designed attractor is insensitive to the initial conditions. The attractor-like behavior still exists for several adiabatic processes.
