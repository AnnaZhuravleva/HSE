Monogamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in multipartite systems. We investigate the monogamy relations satisfied by the concurrence of assistance and the negativity of assistance for multiqubit generalized $W$-class states. Analytical monogamy inequalities are presented for both concurrence of assistance and negativity of assistance, which are shown to be tighter than the existing ones. Detailed examples have been presented.
