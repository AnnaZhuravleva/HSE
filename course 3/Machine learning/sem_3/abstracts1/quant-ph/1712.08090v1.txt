We discuss the notion of hidden correlations in classical and quantum indivisible systems along with such characteristics of the correlations as the mutual information and conditional information corresponding to the entropic subadditivity condition and the entropic strong subadditivity condition. We present an analog of the Bayes formula for systems without subsystems, study entropic inequality for von Neumann entropy and Tsallis entropy of the single-qudit state, and discuss the inequalities for qubit and qutrit states as an example.
