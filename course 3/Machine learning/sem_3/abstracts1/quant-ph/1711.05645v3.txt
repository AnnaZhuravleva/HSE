One attractive interpretation of quantum mechanics is the ensemble interpretation, where Quantum Mechanics merely describes a statistical ensemble of objects and not individual objects.   But this interpretation does not address why the wave-function plays a central role in the calculations of probabilities, unlike most other interpretations of quantum mechanics.   We first show that for a quantum system defined in a 2-dimensional real Hilbert space, the role of the wave-function is identical to the role of the Euler's formula in engineering, while the collapse of the wave-function is identical to selecting the real part of a complex number.   We will then show that the wave-function is merely one possible parametrization of any probability distribution describing an ensemble: a surjective map from an hypersphere to the set of all possible probability distributions. The fact that the hypersphere is a surface of constant radius reflects the fact that the integral of the probability distribution is always $1$. Two wave-functions are always related by a rotation of the hypersphere, which is a linear transformation and it preserves the hypersphere.   It is thus a good parametrization which allows us to represent a group of transformations using linear transformations of the hypersphere. The collapse of the wave-function is required to compensate the fact that the action of the group on the probability distribution is not linear.
