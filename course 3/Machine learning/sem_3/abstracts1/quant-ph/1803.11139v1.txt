We study general physical systems with a notion of sequential measurement that satisfies a few simple and intuitive conditions. We show that, apart from two exceptional cases, the systems satisfying these conditions are exactly the real, complex or quaternionic quantum systems. Moreover, only the complex quantum systems remain if systems must be allowed to be composed together in a locally tomographic manner. In other words, quantum theory is the unique locally tomographic theory allowing sequential measurement.
