In a recent article [Chin. Phys. Lett. 34, 020301 (2017)], Ben-Israel et al. have claimed that the experiment proposed in [Chin. Phys. Lett. 32, 050303 (2015)] to determine the past of a quantum particle in a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer does not work, and they have proposed a modification to the experiment. We show that their claim is false, and the modification is not required.
