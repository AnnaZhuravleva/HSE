Machine learning is a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence. This paper details an approach for quantum Hebbian learning through a batched version of quantum state exponentiation. Here, batches of quantum data are interacted with learning and processing quantum bits (qubits) by a series of elementary controlled partial swap operations, resulting in a Hamiltonian simulation of the statistical ensemble of the data. We decompose this elementary operation into one and two qubit quantum gates from the Clifford+$T$ set and use the decomposition to perform an efficiency analysis. Our construction of quantum Hebbian learning is motivated by extension from the established classical approach, and it can be used to find details about the data such as eigenvalues through phase estimation. This work contributes to the near-term development and implementation of quantum machine learning techniques.
