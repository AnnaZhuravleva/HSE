We present a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to solve optimization problems in current quantum computers, whose basic idea is to assist variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) with adiabatic change of the Hamiltonian. The rational for this new algorithm is to circumvent the problem of facing very small gradients in the classical optimization piece of a VQE, while being able to run in current hardware efficient devices. A discrete concatenation of VQEs adapted to interpolating Hamiltonians provides a method to keep the quantum state always close to a path faithfully directed to find the final solution. We benchmark this Adiabatically Assisted Variational Quantum Eigensolver (AAVQE) on quantum Hamiltonians and hard classical problems, for which our approach shows fast convergence.
