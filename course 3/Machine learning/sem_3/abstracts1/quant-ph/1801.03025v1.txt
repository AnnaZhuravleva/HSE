We introduce a formalism to solve the problem of photon scattering from a system of multi-level quantum emitters. Our approach provides a direct solution of the scattering dynamics. As such the formalism gives the scattered fields amplitudes in the limit of a weak incident intensity. Our formalism is equipped to treat both multi-emitter and multi-level emitter systems, and is applicable to a plethora of photon scattering problems including conditional state preparation by photo-detection. In this paper, we develop the general formalism for an arbitrary geometry. In the following paper (part II), we reduce the general photon scattering formalism to a form that is applicable to $1$-dimensional waveguides, and show its applicability by considering explicit examples with various emitter configurations.
