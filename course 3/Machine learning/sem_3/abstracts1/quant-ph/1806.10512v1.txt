We investigate heat engines whose working substance is made of two coupled qubits performing an Otto cycle by varying their applied magnetic field or their interaction strength during the compression and expansion strokes. During the heating and cooling strokes, the two qubits are coupled to local and collective environments that are not necessarily in equilibrium.We find that the performance of quantum engines coupled to non equilibrium local and collective environments exhibit non-trivial connections to quantum correlations as measured by quantum discord and entanglement.
