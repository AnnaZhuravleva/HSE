We propose an all-optical scheme to control the photon statistics using hybrid quantum plasmonic system. With the aid of dressed states assisted quantum interference effects, it is shown that the photon correlations of a signal field can be continuously modulated from bunching to antibunching under the control of a pump field. Apart from the exact multimode model, a single-mode model and an analytical treatment are also provided to help us identify the roles of multimode coupling and quantum interference between probability amplitudes. The proposed scheme, in contrast to the cavity quantum electrodynamics methods, works well even in the bad cavity limit. These findings suggest that this composite system provides a feasible nanophotonic platform for active modulation of photon statistics and for future quantum devices.
