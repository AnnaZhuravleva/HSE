Decoy state method closes source security loophole in quantum key distribution (QKD) using laser source. In this method, accurate estimates of the detection rates of vacuum and single photon events plus the error rate of single photon events are needed to give a good enough lower bound of the secret key rate. Nonetheless, the current estimation method for these detection and error rates, which uses three types of photon intensities, is accurate up to about 1% relative error. Here I report an experimentally feasible way that greatly improves these estimates and hence increases the one-way key rate of the BB84 QKD protocol with unbiased bases selection by at least 20% on average in realistic settings. The major tricks are the use of more than three types of photon intensities plus the fact that estimating bounds of the above detection and error rates is numerically stable although these bounds are related to the inversion of a high condition number matrix.
