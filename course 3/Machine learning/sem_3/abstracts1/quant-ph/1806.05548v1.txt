We theoretically study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the SU(1,1) interferometer with phase shifts in two arms taking account of realistic noise effects. A generalized phase transform including the phase diffusion effect is presented by the purification process. Based on this transform, the analytical QFI and the bound to the quantum precision are derived when considering the effects of phase diffusion and photon losses simultaneously. To beat the standard quantum limit with the reduced precision of phase estimation due to noisy, the upper bounds of decoherence coefficients as a function of total mean photon number are given.
