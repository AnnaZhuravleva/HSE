The quantum Liouville equation, which describes the phase space dynamics of a quantum system of fermions, is analyzed from statistical point of view as a particular example of the Kramers-Moyal expansion. Quantum mechanics is extended to the relativistic domain by generalizing the Wigner-Moyal equation. Thus, an expression is derived for the relativistic mass in the Wigner quantum phase space presentation. The diffusion with an imaginary diffusion coefficient is also discussed. An imaginary stochastic process is proposed as the origin of quantum mechanics.
