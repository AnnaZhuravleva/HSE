Typically the use of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction formula as a photon propagator is widely accepted due to the abundant experimental evidence that suggests that it works. However, a direct link between the propagation of the electromagnetic field in classical optics and the propagation of photons where the square of the probability amplitude describes the transverse probability of the photon detection is still an issue to be clarified. We develop a mathematical formulation for the photon propagation using the formalism of electromagnetic field quantization and the path-integral method, whose main feature is its similarity with a fractional Fourier transform (FrFT). Here we show that, because of the close relation existing between the FrFT and the Fresnel diffraction integral, this propagator can be written as a Fresnel diffraction, which brings forward a discussion of the fundamental character of it at the photon level compared to the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Finally, we carry out an experiment of photon counting by a rectangular slit supporting the result that the diffraction phenomenon in the Fresnel approximation behaves as the actual classical limit.
