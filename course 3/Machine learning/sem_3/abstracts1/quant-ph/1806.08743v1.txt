We show that thermal interactions can be harnessed within resonance fluorescence to generate steady-states that emit single photons with a higher degree of quadrature squeezing than in isolated atomic systems. Thermal environments arise naturally, for instance, in solid-state and molecular emitters, and we consider the illustrative example of a driven quantum dot coupled to phonons. We demonstrate that it is feasible to surpass the maximum level of squeezing theoretically obtainable in an atomic system that lacks such thermal transitions, and indeed come close to saturating the fundamental upper bound on squeezing from a two-level emitter.
