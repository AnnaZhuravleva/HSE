We investigate sharing of bipartite entanglement in a scenario where half of an entangled pair is possessed and projectively measured by one observer, called Alice, while the other half is subjected to measurements performed sequentially, independently, and unsharply, by multiple observers, called Bobs. We find that there is a limit on the number of observers in this entanglement distribution scenario. In particular, for a two-qubit maximally entangled initial shared state, no more than twelve Bobs can detect entanglement with a single Alice for arbitrary -- possibly unequal -- sharpness parameters of the measurements by the Bobs. Moreover, the number of Bobs remains unaltered for a finite range of near-maximal pure initial entanglement, a feature that also occurs in the case of equal sharpness parameters at the Bobs. Furthermore, we show that for non-maximally entangled shared pure states, the number of Bobs reduces with the amount of initial entanglement, providing a coarse-grained but operational measure of entanglement.
