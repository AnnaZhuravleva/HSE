For quantum systems, we expect to see classical behavior at the limit of large quantum numbers. Hence, we apply Bohmian approach to describe the Earth evolution around the Sun. We obtain possible trajectories of the Earth system with different initial conditions which converge to a definite stable orbit after a given time, known as the Kepler orbit. The trajectories have resulted from the guiding $p=\nabla S$ equation in Bohmian mechanics which relates the momentum of the system to the phase part of the wave function. Except for some special situations, Bohmian trajectories are not Newtonian in character. We show that the classical behavior of the Earth can be described as the consequence of the guiding equation at the limit of large quantum numbers.
