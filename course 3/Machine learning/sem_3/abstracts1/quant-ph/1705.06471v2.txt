A new mechanism is proposed for dissipatively preparing maximal Bell entangled state of two atoms in an optical cavity. This scheme integrates the spontaneous emission, the light shift of atoms in the presence of dispersive microwave field, and the quantum Zeno dynamics induced by continuous coupling, to obtain a unique steady state irrespective of initial state. Even for a large cavity decay, a high-fidelity entangled state is achievable at a short convergence time, since the occupation of cavity mode is inhibited by the Zeno requirement. Therefore, a low single-atom cooperativity $C=g^2/(\kappa\gamma)$ is good enough for realizing a high fidelity of entanglement in a wide range of decoherence parameters. As a straightforward extension, the feasibility for preparation of two-atom Knill-Laflamme-Milburn state with the same mechanism is also discussed.
