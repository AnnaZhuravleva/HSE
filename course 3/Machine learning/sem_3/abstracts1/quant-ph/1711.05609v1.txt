Beginning with the quaternionic generalization of the quantum wave equation, we construct a simple model of relativistic quantum electrodynamics for massive dyons. A new quaternionic form of unified relativistic wave equation consisting of vector and scalar functions is obtained, and also satisfy the quaternionic momentum eigenvalue equation. Keeping in mind the importance of quantum field theory, we investigate the relativistic quantum structure of electromagnetic wave propagation of dyons. The present quantum theory of electromagnetism leads to generalized Lorentz gauge conditions for the electric and magnetic charge of dyons. We also demonstrate the universal quantum wave equations for two four-potentials as well as two four-currents of dyons. The generalized continuity equations for massive dyons in case of quantum fields are expressed. Furthermore, we concluded that the quantum generalization of electromagnetic field equations of dyons can be related to analogous London field equations (i.e., current to electromagnetic fields in and around a superconductor).
