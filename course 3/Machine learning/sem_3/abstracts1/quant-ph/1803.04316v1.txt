The time-frequency degree of freedom is a powerful resource for implementing high-dimensional quantum information processing. In particular, field-orthogonal pulsed temporal modes offer a flexible framework compatible with both long-distance fibre networks and integrated waveguide devices. In order for this architecture to be fully utilised, techniques to reliably generate diverse quantum states of light and accurately measure complex temporal waveforms must be developed. To this end, nonlinear processes mediated by spectrally shaped pump pulses in group-velocity engineered waveguides and crystals provide a capable toolbox. In this review, we examine how tailoring the phasematching conditions of parametric downconversion and sum-frequency generation allows for highly pure single-photon generation, flexible temporal-mode entanglement, and accurate measurement of time-frequency photon states. We provide an overview of experimental progress towards these goals, and summarise challenges that remain in the field.
