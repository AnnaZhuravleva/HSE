Boson sampling (BS) is a multimode linear optical problem that is expected to be intractable on classical computers. It was recently suggested that molecular vibronic spectroscopy (MVS) is computationally as complex as BS. In this review, we discuss the correspondence relation between BS and MVS and briefly introduce the experimental demonstrations of the molecular spectroscopic process using quantum devices. The similarity of the two theories results in another BS setup, which is called "vibronic BS". The hierarchical structure of vibronic BS, which includes the original BS and other Gaussian BS, is also explained.
