We devise a method based on tensor-network formalism to calculate the genuine multisite entanglement in the ground states of infinite quantum spin-1/2 chains. The ground state is obtained from an initial matrix product state for the infinite spin system by employing the infinite time-evolving block decimation method. We explicitly show how infinite matrix product states with translational invariance provide a natural framework to derive the generalized geometric measure, a computable measure of genuine multisite entanglement, in quantum many-body systems.
