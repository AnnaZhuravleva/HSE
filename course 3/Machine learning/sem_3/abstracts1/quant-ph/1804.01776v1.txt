Recently, Zhao et al., (Int. J. Theor. Phys. 57, 516-522 (2018)) have proposed a scheme for quantum teleportation of an eight-qubit quantum state using a six qubit cluster state. In this comment, it's shown that the quantum resource (multi-partite entangled state used as the quantum channel) used by Zhao et al., is excessively high and the task can be performed using any two Bell states as the task can be reduced to the teleportation of an arbitrary two qubit state. Further, a trivial conceptual mistake made by Zhao et al., in the description of the quantum channel has been pointed out. It's also mentioned that recently a trend of proposing teleportation schemes with excessively high quantum resources has been observed and the essence of this comment is applicable to all such proposals.
