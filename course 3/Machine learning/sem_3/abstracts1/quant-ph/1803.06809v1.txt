We propose a scheme in which an arbitrary incidence can be made perfectly reflected/transmitted if a phase setup is adjusted under a specific condition. We analyze the intracavity field variation as well as the output field with changing closed-loop phase of atomic system and relative phase of input probe beams. And we obtain the condition for perfect transmitter or reflector. By adjusting two phase setups, the medium absorption and light interference can be controlled so that photon escape from cavity can be modulated, thus the intensity switching based on phase control can be realized. Then based on the transmission/reflection analysis, total absorption of this system can be investigated. Therefore our scheme can be used as an absorption interferometer to explore the optical absorption in some complicated system. The phase delay dependent on phi_1 or phi_2 in output light intensity can be applied in the realization of quantum phase gate and subtle wave filter. And based on this scheme, we implement the state transfer between perfect transmitter/reflector and non-perfect coherent photon absorber via relative-phase modulation.
