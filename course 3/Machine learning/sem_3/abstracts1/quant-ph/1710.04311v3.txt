In our work we consider the following problem in the context of teleportation: an unknown pure state have to be teleported and there are two laboratories which can perform the task. One laboratory uses a pure non maximally entangled channel but has a capability of performing the joint measurement on bases with a constrained degree of entanglement; the other lab makes use of a mixed X-state channel but can perform a joint measurement on bases with higher entanglement degrees. We compare the average teleportation fidelity achieved in both cases, finding that the fidelity achieved with the X-state can surpass the obtained with a pure channel, even though the X-state is less entangled than the latter. We find the conditions under which this effect occurs. Our results evidence that the entanglement of the joint measurement plays a role as important as the entanglement of the channel in order to optimize the teleportation process. We include an example showing that the average fidelity of teleportation obtained with a Werner state channel can be grater than that obtained with a Bell state channel.
