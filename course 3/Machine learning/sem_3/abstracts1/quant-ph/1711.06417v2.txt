A time-resolved spectroscopic protocol exploiting terahertz-assisted photoionization is proposed to reconstruct transient density matrix. Population and coherence elements are effectively mapped onto spectrally separated peaks in photoionization spectra. The beatings of coherence dynamics can be temporally resolved beyond the pulse duration, and the relative phase between involved states is directly readable from the oscillatory spectral distribution. As demonstrated by a photo-excited multilevel open quantum system, the method shows potential applications for sub-femtosecond time-resolved measurements of coherent dynamics with free electron lasers and tabletop laser fields.
