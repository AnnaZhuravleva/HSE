The repetition code is an important primitive for the techniques of quantum error correction. Here we implement repetition codes of at most $15$ qubits on the $16$ qubit \emph{ibmqx3} device. Each experiment is run for a single round of syndrome measurements, achieved using the standard quantum technique of using ancilla qubits and controlled operations. The size of the final syndrome is small enough to allow for lookup table decoding using experimentally obtained data. The results show strong evidence that the logical error rate decays exponentially with code distance, as is expected and required for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. The results also give insight into the nature of noise in the device.
