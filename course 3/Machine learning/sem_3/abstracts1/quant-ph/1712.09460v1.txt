We present serial-parallel conversion for a heralded single photon source (heralded SPS). We theoretically show that with the heralding signal, the serial-parallel converter can route a stream of n photons to n different spatial modes more efficiently than is the case without using a heralding signal. We also experimentally demonstrate serial-parallel conversion for two photons generated from a heralded SPS. We achieve a conversion efficiency of 0.533 \pm 0.003, which exceeds the maximum achievable efficiency of 0.5 for serial-parallel conversion using unheralded photons, and is double the efficiency (0.25) for that using beamsplitters. When the losses in the optical converter are corrected for, the efficiency of the current setup can be increased up to 0.996 \pm 0.006.
