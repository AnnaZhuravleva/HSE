Collective scattering of spatially coherent radiation by separated point emitters induces inter-particle forces. For particles close to nano-photonic structures as, for example, nano-fibers, hollow core fibers or photonic waveguides, this pair-interaction induced by monochromatic light is periodic and virtually of infinite range. Here we show that the shape and range of the optical interaction potential can be precisely controlled by spectral design of the incoming illumination. If each particle is only weakly coupled to the confined guided modes the forces acting within a particle ensemble can be decomposed to pairwise interactions. These forces can be tailored to almost arbitrary spatial dependence as they are related to Fourier transforms with coefficients controlled by the intensities and frequencies of the illuminating lasers. We demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by highlighting some examples of unconventional pair potentials. Implementing these interactions in a chain of trapped quantum particles could be the basis of a versatile quantum simulator with almost arbitrary all-to-all interaction control.
