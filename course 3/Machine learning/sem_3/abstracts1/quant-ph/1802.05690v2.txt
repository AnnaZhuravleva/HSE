We show that DNF formulae can be quantum PAC-learned in polynomial time under product distributions using a quantum example oracle. The best classical algorithm (without access to membership queries) runs in superpolynomial time. Our result extends the work by Bshouty and Jackson (1998) that proved that DNF formulae are efficiently learnable under the uniform distribution using a quantum example oracle. Our proof is based on a new quantum algorithm that efficiently samples the coefficients of a {\mu}-biased Fourier transform.
