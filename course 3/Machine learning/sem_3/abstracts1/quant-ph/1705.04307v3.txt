In 1929 Szilard pointed out that the physics of the observer may play a role in the analysis of experiments. The same year, Bohr pointed out that complementarity appears to arise naturally in psychology where both the objects of perception and the percieving subject belong to `our mental content'. Here we derive the formalism of quantum theory from two related intuitive principles: (i) inference is a physical process performed by physical systems, observers, which are part of the experimental setup---this implies non-commutativity and imaginary-time quantum mechanics; (ii) experiments must be described from a first-person perspective---this leads to self-reference, complementarity, and a quantum dynamics that is the iterative construction of the observer's subjective state. Using available experimental data, we argue that the quantum of action is the result of the additional energy required to transition from unconscious to conscious perception. We discuss the potential implications of these ideas for the modern research program on consciousness championed by Nobel laureate Francis Crick and the emerging field of contemplative science. As side results, we show that message-passing algorithms and stochastic processes can be written in a quantum-like manner, and provide a different Hamiltonian function for a quantum particle in a classical electromagnetic field.
