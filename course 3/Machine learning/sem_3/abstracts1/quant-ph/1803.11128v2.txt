In a general setting of quantum control, it is unrealistic to control all of the degrees of freedom of a quantum system. We consider a scenario where our direct access is restricted to a small subsystem $S$ that is constantly interacting with the rest of the system $E$. What we investigate here is the fundamental structure of the Hilbert space that is caused solely by the restrictedness of the direct control. We clarify the intrinsic space structure of the entire system and that of the operations which could be activated through $S$. One significant finding is that there is a sharp distinction between the cases of dim$\mathcal{H}_S\ge 3$ and dim$\mathcal{H}_S=2$ in terms of the nature of possible operations in $E$. Also, although the controllability may be expanded by appending an extra dimension(s) to two-dimensional $S$, once dim$\mathcal{H}_S$ exceeds 3 no further algebraic expansion occurs by further enlargement of $S$. These can be deduced by considering the algebraic structure, which is the \textit{Jordan algebra} formed with hermitian operators, naturally induced by the setting of limited access. Since our analysis is totally free from specific properties of any physical systems, it would form a solid basis for obtaining deeper insights into quantum control related issues, such as controllability and observability.
