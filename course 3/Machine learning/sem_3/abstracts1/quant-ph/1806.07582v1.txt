Many-body forces are sometimes a relevant ingredient in various fields, such as atomic, nuclear or hadronic physics. Their precise structure is generally difficult to uncover. So, phenomenological effective forces are often used in practice. Nevertheless, they are always very heavy to treat numerically. The envelope theory, also known as the auxiliary field method, is a very efficient technique to obtain approximate, but reliable, solutions of many-body systems interacting via one- or two-body forces. It is adapted here to allow the treatment of a special form of many-body forces. In the most favourable cases, the approximate eigenvalues are analytical lower or upper bounds. Otherwise, numerical approximation can always be computed. Two examples of many-body forces are presented, and the critical coupling constants for generic attractive many-body potentials are computed. Finally, a semiclassical interpretation is given for the generic formula of the eigenvalues.
