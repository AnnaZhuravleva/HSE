It is well established that quantum criticality is one of the most intriguing phenomena which signals the presence of new states of matter. Without prior knowledge of the local order parameter, the quantum information metric (or fidelity susceptibility) can indicate the presence of a phase transition as well as it measures distance between quantum states. In this work, we calculate distance between quantum states which is equal to the fidelity susceptibility in quantum model for a time-dependent system describing a two-level atom coupled to a time-driven external field. As inspired by the Landau-Lifshitz quantum model, we find in the present work information metric induced by fidelity susceptibility. We for the first time derive a higher-order rank-3 tensor as third-order fidelity susceptibility. Having computed quantum noise function in this simple time-dependent model we show that the noise function eternally lasts long in our model.
