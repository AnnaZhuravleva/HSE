We propose definitions and implementations of "supermoney" - virtual tokens designed for high value fast transactions on networks with relativistic or other trusted signalling constraints. Supermoney is more flexible than standard quantum or classical money in the sense that it can solve deterministic summoning tasks that they cannot. It requires networks of agents with classical data storage and communication, but no long term quantum state storage, and is feasible with current technology. User privacy can be incorporated by secure bit commitment and zero knowledge proof protocols. The level of privacy feasible in given scenarios depends on efficiency and composable security questions that remain to be systematically addressed.
