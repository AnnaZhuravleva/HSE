We study the concurrence of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum systems. An explicit analytical lower bound of concurrence for four-partite mixed states is obtained in terms of the concurrences of tripartite mixed states. Detailed examples are given to show that our lower bounds improve the existing lower bounds of concurrence. The approach is generalized to five-partite quantum systems.
