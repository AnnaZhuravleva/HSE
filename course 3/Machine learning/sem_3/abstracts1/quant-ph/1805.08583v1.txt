It is shown that the quantum theoretical description of statistical data resulting from experiments with a finite number of different outcomes emerges by organizing the data such that the descriptions of the preparation and measurement stage are separated as much as possible. The quantum theoretical description that derives from this elementary principle of separation is void of the usual postulates/interpretations regarding "wave functions", "observables", "quantization rules", "Born's rule", and the like. The separation principle is illustrated by application to the Stern-Gerlach and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment and generalizes in a trivial manner. The von Neunman equation and therefore also the Schr\"odinger equation are shown to follow directly from the mathematical structure that renders possible separated descriptions.
