In the resource theory of thermodynamics, the decrease of the free energy based on von Neumann entropy is not a sufficient condition to determine free evolution. Rather, a whole family of generalised free energies $F_{\alpha}$ must be monotonically decreasing. We study the resilience of this result to relaxations of the framework. We use a toy collisional model, in which the deviations from the ideal situation can be described as arising from inhomogeneities of local fields or temperatures. For any small amount of perturbation, we find that there exist initial states such that both single-shot and averaged values of $F_{\alpha}$ do not decrease monotonically for all $\alpha>0$. A geometric representation accounts for the observed behavior in a graphic way.
