The work presented here is a continuation of the relational formulation of quantum mechanics. Relational formulation of quantum mechanics is based on the idea that relational properties among quantum systems, instead of the independent properties of a quantum system, are the most fundamental elements to construct quantum mechanics. In the earlier work, basic framework is formulated to derive quantum probability, Born's Rule, and Schr\"odinger Equations. This paper further develops the formulations for ideal quantum measurement and general quantum operation. The formulation is compatible with the traditional quantum mechanics mathematically but gives new insights on several important concepts. First, the formulation shows how mutual information is exchanged during measurement. Second, it asserts that Schr\"odinger Equations alone cannot explain the measurement process. The "collapse" of wave function is simply an update of relational matrix based on measurement outcome. Third, the relational nature of a quantum state is key to the resolution of the EPR paradox. Completeness of quantum mechanics and locality can coexist by recognizing that a quantum state is observer-dependent. Lastly, objectivity of a quantum state can be preserved via synchronization of information among observers.
