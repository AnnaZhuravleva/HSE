We propose to use the continuous version of the quantum Zeno effect to eliminate leakage to higher energy states in superconducting quantum computing architectures based on Josephson phase and flux qubits. We are particularly interested in the application of this approach to the single-step Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state protocol described in [A. Galiautdinov and J. M. Martinis, Phys. Rev. A 78, 010305(R) (2008)]. While being conceptually appealing, the protocol was found to be plagued with a number of spectral crowding and leakage problems. Here we argue that by coupling the qubits to a measuring device which continuously monitors leakage to higher energy states (say, to a very lossy resonator of frequency omega = E3(qubit)-E1(qubit), with 1 labeling the ground state of the qubit), we could potentially restrict the multi-qubit system's evolution to its computational subspace, thus circumventing the above mentioned problems.
