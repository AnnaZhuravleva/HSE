Dark matter and dark energy constitute more than 95 % of our universe. However nothing is known about their properties except the gravitational potential that they generate. Among many different possible candidates, axion like particle (ALP) satisfies the pre-requisites to be a light mass cold dark matter candidate. There are different possibilities by which dark matter can couple to ordinary matter like atoms. This has opened up the possibility to search for ALPs by looking at their interaction to ordinary matter in laboratory based experiments. One such possibility is to look into the interaction of dark matter field with axial electron moment. In an isolated single ion experiment, we probe the existence of such a dark matter field coupling. In doing so, we achieve an uncertainty in a quantum feedback frequency measurement scheme, for a time dependent Hamiltonian that scales as $1/T^2$ unlike $1/T$ as given by the Heisenberg limit. This proof-of-principle experiment sets a limit on the coupling strength of axion like dark matter particle wind to interact with an electron axial moment. Eventhough the limit is a weak limit, we propose feasible experiment by which the limit can be strengthened beyond currently known limit by indirect observations. Since our experiment probes the electron axial moment coupling it compliments other searches on nuclear axial moment couplings. The experimental scheme is based on the proposal by Pang et al. \cite{Pang2017} implemented on a laser cooled single ion probe which has been coupled to an external time dependent field.
