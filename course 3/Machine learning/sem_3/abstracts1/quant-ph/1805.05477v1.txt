Quantum information is a useful resource to set up information processing. Despite physical components are normally two-level systems, their combination with entangling interactions becomes in a complex dynamics. Studied for piecewise field pulses, this work analyzes the modeling for quantum information operations with fields affordable technologically towards a universal quantum computation model.
