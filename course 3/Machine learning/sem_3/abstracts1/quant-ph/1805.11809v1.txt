We present recent findings towards developing brighter entangled photon sources in critically phase matched (CPM) nonlinear crystals. Specifically, we use type-I collinear phase matching at non-degenerate wavelengths in parallel \b{eta}-Barium Borate (BBO) crystals to generate pairs of polarization entangled photons for free-space quantum key distribution (QKD). We first review the entangled source configuration and then discuss ways to further improve the source brightness by means of tailoring the pump and collection modes. We present preliminary results that may lead to brighter entangled photon sources that are intrinsically robust to changes in their environment.
