This paper is an in depth implementation of the proposal that the quantum measurement issue can be resolved by carefully looking at top-down contextual effects within realistic measurement contexts. The specific setup of the measurement apparatus determines the possible events that can take place. The interaction of local heat baths with a quantum system plays a key role in the process. In contrast to the usual attempts to explain quantum measurement by decoherence, we argue that the heat bath follows unitary time evolution only over limited length and time scales and thus leads to localization and stochastic dynamics of quantum particles that interact with it. We show furthermore that a theory that describes all the steps from the initial arrival of the quantum particle to the final pointer deflection must use elements from classical physics. This proposal also provides a contextual answer to the puzzle of the origin of the arrow of time when quantum measurements take place: it derives from the cosmological Direction of Time. Overall, our proposal is for Contextual Wavefunction Collapse (CWC).
