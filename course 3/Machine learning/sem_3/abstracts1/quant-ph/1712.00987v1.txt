We adopt a diffusive-Gutzwiller approach to investigate a phase transition in a quadratically driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard lattice. Diffusive trajectories may lead to lower average entanglement as compared to jump-like trajectories and have a natural tendency to approach coherent states, therefore the method can be less prone to the bias induced by the fully uncorrelated Gutzwiller ansatz. Averaging over trajectories does lead to classical correlations and this allows us to address the correlation length of such 2D lattices of open quantum systems which is the main goal of this work. Under this approximations, we find negligible correlation length in the low density phase and apparently unbounded length grow in the high density phase. Additionally, we show that the effective relaxation times associated to the times scales for synchronisation in the high density phase may also diverge suggesting the vanishing of the Lindbladian gap.
