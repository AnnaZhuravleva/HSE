The Hong-Ou-Mandel interference and other quantum interference have played important role to test fundamental concepts in quantum physics. We experimentally show that multiple quantum interference effect enables to generate high-performance polarization entangled photons, in which the generated polarization entangled photons simultaneously satisfy the property of high-emission rate, degenerate condition, broadband distribution, and postselection free. Due to the gimmick based on the round trip configuration with a double-pass polarization Sagnac interferometer, the quantum interferometric scheme makes it possible to use the largest generation efficiency of polarization entangled photons in the process of parametric down-conversion, and also to separate degenerate photon pairs into different optical modes with no requirement of postselective detections. Through the experimental demonstration, we show that multiple quantum interference effect is interesting phenomenon not only in fundamental quantum optics but also for noble photonic quantum information technologies.
