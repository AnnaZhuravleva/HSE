We study the violations of Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality in a qubit subjected to non-Markovian noisy channels such as Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN). Quite generally, the state-independence of the violation in the noiseless case is preserved under the application of noise. Within a given family of noisy channels (in specific, RTN or OUN), we find an enhancement in the violation in the non-Markovian case as compared to the Markovian case. We thus find that non-Markovianity provides a stronger demonstration of quantumness of the system.
