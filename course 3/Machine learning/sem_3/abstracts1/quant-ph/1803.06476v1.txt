We explicate the merging of levels and spectral bifurcation near an exceptional point as also the appearance of resonances and bound states in the PT-broken phase for the PT-symmetric complex Scarf II potential. The bound states in the PT-broken phase are manifested as spectral singularities and are found to be bound states in continuum and thus seen as zero width resonances, starting to first appear at the exceptional points. The intimate connection of PT-symmetry breaking and breaking of supersymmetry is pointed out as also the phenomenon of hysteresis near exceptional point. Intriguingly, the PT-symmetric Hamiltonians related by SUSY are also found to be isospectrally deformed counterparts for a specific parametric condition with the deformation satisfying the Korteweg-deVries equation.
