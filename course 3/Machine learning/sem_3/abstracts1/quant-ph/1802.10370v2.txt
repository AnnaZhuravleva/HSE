We discuss how, due to an interference effect, the superposition of a positive force with a null force on a quantum particle may result in a negative momentum transfer to the particle when the appropriate post-selection is made. This quantum interference of force represents a novel manifestation of the wave-particle duality, since forces act on particles and interference is a property of waves in classical physics. We discuss some experimental schemes that could verify the effect with current technology, with electrons or neutrons in Mach-Zehnder interferometers in free space and with atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate.
