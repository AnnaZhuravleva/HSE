Real non-symmetric matrices may have either all or some of the eigenvalues as real. These matrices can be seen to be pseudo-symmetric (PS) as $\eta H \eta^{-1} =H^{t}$. PS random matrices with some of the eigenvalues as real, are known to display sub-Wigner and semi-Poisson statistics (Intermediate statistics). Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$ even and large) PS matrices using $ {\cal N}=n(n+1)/2$ independent and identically distributed random numbers as their elements. When $\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the PS matrix is also similar to a real symmetric matrix, consequently all the eigenvalues are real and so the spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$ the eigenvalues of are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these real eigenvalues display intermediate statistics. We also show that the diagonalizing matrices ${\cal D}$ of these PS matrices are pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as ${\cal D}^t \zeta {\cal D}= \zeta$. These PS matrices can represent the parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.
