We give two quantum algorithms for computing Kloosterman sums attached to a finite field $\mathbf{F}$ of $q$ elements. The first algorithm computes a quantum state containing, as its coefficients with respect to the standard basis, all Kloosterman sums for $\mathbf{F}$, and runs in time polynomial in $\log q$; it also handles Kloosterman sums twisted by a given multiplicative character of $\mathbf{F}$. The second algorithm computes a single Kloosterman sum to a prescribed precision, and runs in time quasi-linear in $\sqrt{q}$.
