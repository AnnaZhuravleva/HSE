We solve a model that has basic features of realistic quantum annealing (QA) computations: entangled initial ground state, controllable speed of the annealing protocol, ground state energy separated by a gap during the whole evolution, and programmable computational problem that is encoded by parameters of the Ising part of the spin Hamiltonian. Our solution describes the final probability distribution of all microstates, and enables exact nonperturbative characterization of nonadiabatic excitations, including scaling of their number with the annealing rate and the system size.
