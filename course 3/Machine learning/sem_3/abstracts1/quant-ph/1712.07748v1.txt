In this paper we compute uncertainty relations for non-commutative space and obtain a better lower bound than the standard one obtained from Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. We also derive the reverse uncertainty relation for product and sum of uncertainty of two incompatible variables for one linear and another non-linear model of the linear harmonic oscillator. The non-linear model in non-commutating space yields two different expressions for Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg uncertainty relations. This distinction does not arise in commutative space, and even in the linear model of non-commutative space.
