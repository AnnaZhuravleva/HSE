Quantum metrology promises high-precision measurements of classical parameters with far reaching implications for science and technology. So far, research has concentrated almost exclusively on quantum-enhancements in integrable systems, such as precessing spins or harmonic oscillators prepared in non-classical states. Here we show that large benefits can be drawn from rendering integrable quantum sensors chaotic, both in terms of achievable sensitivity as well as robustness to noise, while avoiding the challenge of preparing and protecting large-scale entanglement. We apply the method to spin-precession magnetometry and show in particular that the sensitivity of state-of-the-art magnetometers can be further enhanced by subjecting the spin-precession to non-linear kicks that renders the dynamics chaotic.
