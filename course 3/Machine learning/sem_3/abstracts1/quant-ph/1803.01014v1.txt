Fast, high-fidelity measurement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the measurement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a microwave probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. Here we introduce an alternative approach to measurement based on a microwave photon counter. We demonstrate raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, we exploit the intrinsic damping of the counter to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum non-demolition measurements. Crucially, our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage. In a future system, counter-based measurement could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.
