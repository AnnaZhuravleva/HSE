Quantum information-theoretic approach has been identified as a way to understand the foundations of quantum mechanics as early as 1950 due to Shannon. However there hasn't been enough advancement or rigorous development of the subject. In the following paper we try to find relationship between a general quantum mechanical observable and it von Neumann entropy. We find that the expectation values and the uncertainties of the observables have bounds which depend on the entropy. The results also show that von Neumann entropy is not just the uncertainty of the state but also encompasses the information about expectation values and uncertainties of any observable which depends on the observers choice for a particular measurement. Also a reverse uncertainty relation is derived for n quantum mechanical observables.
