We propose a multipartite extension of Matsumoto and Hayashi's distortion-free entanglement concentration protocol, which takes $n$ copies of a general multipartite state and, via local measurements, produces a maximally-entangled multipartite state between local spaces of dimensions $\sim 2^{n E_i}$, where $E_i$ are the local entropies of the input state. However, the extended protocol is generally not universal in the sense that for the same measurement outcomes, the output state will still depend on the input state. Our main result is that when specialized to any state in the multiqubit W class, the protocol is also universal, so that as in the biparatite version, the output is a unique, maximally-entangled state for each given set of measurement outcomes. Our analysis brings to the forefront a new and interesting family of maximally-entangled multipartite states, which we term Kronecker states. A recurrence relation to obtain the coefficients of the W-class Kronecker states is also given.
