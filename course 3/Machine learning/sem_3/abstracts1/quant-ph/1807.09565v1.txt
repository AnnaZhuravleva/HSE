Both coherence and entanglement stem from the superposition principle, capture quantumness of a physical system, and play a central role in quantum physics. In a multipartite quantum system, coherence and quantum correlations are closely connected. In particular, it has been established that quantum coherence of a bipartite state is an important resource for its conversion to entanglement [A. Streltsov {\it et al}., \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.020403}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 115}, 020403 (2015)}] and to quantum discord [J. Ma {\it et al}., \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.160407}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 116}, 160407 (2016)}]. We show here that there is a very close association between partial coherence introduced by Luo and Sun [S. Luo and Y. Sun, \href{https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.96.022136}{Phys. Rev. A {\bf 96}, 022136 (2017)}] and quantum correlations (quantified by quantum discord) in both directions. Furthermore, we propose families of coherence measures in terms of quantum correlations and quantum Fisher information.
