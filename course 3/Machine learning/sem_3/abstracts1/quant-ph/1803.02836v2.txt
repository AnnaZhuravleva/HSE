We propose a resource theory of the quantum invasiveness of general quantum operations, i.e., those defined by Kraus maps. In this context, we show that the Fisher information is a quantifier of quantum invasiveness. This result allows us to establish a direct connection between the concept of quantum invasiveness and quantum metrology, by determining the utility of the definition of quantum invasiveness in the context of metrological protocols. We also discuss the relationship between invasiveness and coherence within resource theoretical frameworks.
