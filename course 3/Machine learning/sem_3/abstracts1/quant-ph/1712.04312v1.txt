We investigate Dicke subradiance of distant quantum sources in free space, i.e., the spatial emission pattern of spontaneously radiating non-interacting multi-level atoms or multi-photon sources, prepared in totally antisymmetric states. We find that the radiated intensity is marked by a strong suppression of spontaneous emission in particular directions. In resemblance to the analogous, yet inverted, superradiant emission profiles of $N$ distant two-level atoms prepared in symmetric Dicke states, we call the corresponding emission pattern $\textit{directional Dicke subradiance}$. We also show that higher order intensity correlations of the light incoherently emitted by statistically independent thermal light sources display the same directional Dicke subradiant behavior. We present measurements of directional Dicke subradiance for $N = 2, \ldots, 5$ distant thermal light sources corroborating the theoretical findings.
