We theoretically propose a photonic flash based on a linearly coupled cavity system. Via driving the two side cavities by external fields, it forms a cyclic energy-level diagram and therefore the phase difference between the driving fields acts as a controller of the steady state due to the quantum interference effect. In the optical trimer structure, we show that the perfect photonic flash can be realized in the situation of resonant driving. The perfect photonic flash scheme is furthermore generalized to multiple coupled cavity system, where the cavities with odd and even number turn bright and dark alternatively. {Our proposal may be applied in the designing of quantum neon and realizing a controllable photonic localization.
