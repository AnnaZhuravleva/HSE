Recently, an efficient quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations introduced by Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, has received great concern from the academic community. However, the error and complexity analysis for this algorithm seems so complicated that it may not be applicable to other filter functions for other tasks. In this note, a concise proof is proposed. We hope that it may inspire some novel HHL-based algorithms that can compute $F(A)|b\rangle$ for any computable $F$.
