We demonstrate a technique based on optical heterodyne detection to measure Rydberg population in thermal atomic vapour. The technique used a probe beam far off resonant to the D2 line of rubidium along with a reference beam with frequency offset by 800 MHz in the presence of a coupling laser that couples to Rydberg state via two-photon resonance. The polarizations of the probe, reference and coupling beams are suitably chosen such that only the probe beam goes through a non-linear phase shift due to two-photon process which is measured relative to the phase shift of the reference beam using optical heterodyne detection technique. We show that the technique has a sensitivity to measure the minimum phase shift of the order of few $\mu$rad. We have used a suitable model of two-photon excitation of a 3-level atom to show that the minimum phase shift measured in our experiment corresponds to Rydberg population of the order of $10^{-5}$. The corresponding probe absorption for the given laser parameters is of the order of $10^{-7}$. We demonstrate that this technique is insensitive to polarization impurity or fluctuations in the beams. The technique is particularly useful in measuring Rydberg population via two-photon excitation in thermal vapour where multi channel plates (MCP) could be relatively difficult to impliment. It can also be used in ultra-cold atomic sample with suitable laser parameters.
