We present a general method to calculate the quasi-stationary state of a driven-dissipative system coupled to a transmission line (and more generally, to a reservoir) under periodic modulation of its parameters. Using Floquet's theorem, we formulate the differential equation for the system's density operator which has to be solved for a single period of modulation. On this basis we also provide systematic expansions in both the adiabatic and high-frequency regime. Applying our method to three different systems -- two- and three-level models as well as the driven nonlinear cavity -- we propose periodic modulation protocols of parameters leading to a temporary suppression of effective dissipation rates, and study the arising non-adiabatic features in the response of these systems.
