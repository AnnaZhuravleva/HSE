Rayleigh criterion has been continuously broken through with modern detecting instruments, many methods on resolving two emitters below the classical diffraction limit has been developed, one of these methods is detecting high order correlation functions of the emitters. We propose a method to resolve the single-photon emitters with only detecting the highest order correlation functions. We find that the variables that characterize the emitters are contained in the highest order correlation functions. Especially when there are more than two emitters, the spatial distribution of the emitters can be deduced only from the highest order correlation functions, which gives a new vision and a new method on beating classical diffraction limit using high order correlation functions.
