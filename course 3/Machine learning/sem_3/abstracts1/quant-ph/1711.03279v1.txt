Quantum routing of single photons in a system with two waveguides coupled to two whispering-gallery resonators (WGRs) are investigated theoretically. With a real-space full quantum theory, photonic scattering amplitudes along four ports of the waveguide network are analytically obtained. It is shown that, by adjusting the geometric and physical parameters of the two-WGR configuration, the quantum routing properties of single photons along the present waveguide network can be controlled effectively. For example, the routing capability from input waveguide to another one can significantly exceed 0.5 near the resonance point of scattering spectra, which can be achieved with only one resonator. By properly designing the distance between two WGRs and the waveguide-WGR coupling strengths, the transfer rate between the waveguides can also reach certain sufficiently high values even in the non-resonance regime. Moreover, Fano-like resonances in the scattering spectra are designable. The proposed system may provide a potential application in controlling single-photon quantum routing as a novel router.
