We theoretically present the quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds (QCRB) of an SU(1,1) interferometer for Gaussian states input with and without the internal photonic losses. The phase shifts in the single arm and in the double arms are studied and the corresponding analytical expressions of quantum Fisher information with Gaussian input states are presented. Different from the traditional Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the QCRB of single arm case is slightly higher or lower than that of double arms case depending on the input states. With a fixed mean photon number and for pure Gaussian state input, the optimal sensitivity is achieved with a squeezed vacuum input in one mode and the vacuum input in the other. We compare the QCRB with the standard quantum limit and Heisenberg limit. In the case of small internal losses the QCRB can beat the standard quantum limit.
