We investigate the quantum dynamics of two identical bosons in a one-dimensional harmonic trap following an interaction quench from zero to infinite interaction strength and vice versa. For both quench scenarios, closed analytical expressions for the temporal evolution of the wave function as well as the Loschmidt Echo are found and the dynamics of the momentum distribution as well as the reduced single-particle density matrix are analyzed. We observe a crossover of these quantities between bosonic, "symmetrized" fermionic and fermionic properties. Furthermore, several combined quenches are analyzed as well.
