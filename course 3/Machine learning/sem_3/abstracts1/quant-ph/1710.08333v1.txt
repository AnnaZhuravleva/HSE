In finite many-body quantum systems such as nuclei, atoms, mesoscopic systems like quantum dots and small metallic grains, interacting spin systems modeling quantum computing core and BEC, the interparticle interactions are essentially two-body in nature. Therefore, it is more appropriate to represent the complex Hamiltonian of these systems by random ensembles that incorporate the two-body nature of interactions. These ensembles are generically called embedded Gaussian ensembles (EGEs). The aim of the present thesis is to identify and systematically analyze many different physically relevant EGEs with symmetries by considering a variety of quantities and measures that are important for isolated finite interacting quantum systems.
