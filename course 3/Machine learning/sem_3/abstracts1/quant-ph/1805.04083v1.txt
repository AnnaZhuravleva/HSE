One often needs to estimate how fast an evolving state of a quantum system can depart from some target state. Quantum speed limits are bounds on the fidelity of the target state and the state evolving according to the Schrodinger equation. As a rule, target states are regarded to be independent on time, in which case various quantum speed limits are known. We prove a family of inequalities dealing with time-dependent target states. Two particular cases are detailed. First, we explore the case when the target state is an instant eigenstate of a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and prove a sufficient adiabatic condition. Second, we compare two states evolving under two differ Hamiltonians and derive a bound on the Loschmidt echo.
