For a simple set of observables we can express, in terms of transition probabilities alone, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relations, so that they are proven to be not only necessary, but sufficient too, in order for the given observables to admit a quantum model. Furthermore distinguished characterizations of strictly complex and real quantum models, with some ancillary results, are presented and discussed.
