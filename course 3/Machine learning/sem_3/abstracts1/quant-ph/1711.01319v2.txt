Here, we numerically simulate probabilistic elementary entangling operations between rail-encoded photons for the purpose of scalable universal quantum computation or communication. We propose grouping logical qubits into single-photon blocks wherein single-qubit rotations and the CNOT gate are fully deterministic and simple to implement. Inter-block communication is then allowed through said probabilistic entangling operations. We find a promising trend in the increasing probability of successful inter-block communication as we increase the number of optical modes operated on by our elementary entangling operations.
