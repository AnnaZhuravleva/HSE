After the remarkable work of simulating Dirac equation with the trapped ion (Nature, 463, 68, 2010), this flexibly controllable system has become a competitive candidate for quantum simulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper, we investigate a method for simulating the Weyl equation in $1+2$-dimension by a single trapped ion. The 2-dimension Zitterbewegung, an amazing trembling motion for Weyl fermions with different average momentum, is studied. It shows that, even though Weyl fermions are massless, the average velocity of their wave packets in this model can be still lower than light speed, which in essence aries from the quantum superposition principle in wave packet. The prediction about 2-dimension Zitterbewegung might be tested by later trapped ion experiment.
