We study the scattering of photons against a two-level quantum emitter subject to arbitrary correlated dephasing noise. This is particularly relevant to waveguide-QED setups with solid-state emitters, such as superconducting qubits or quantum dots, which couple to complex dephasing environments in addition to the propagating photons along the waveguide. Combining input-output theory and stochastic methods, we predict the effect of correlated dephasing in single-photon transmission experiments with weak coherent inputs. We show that these spectroscopic measurements contain the same information as standard time-resolved Ramsey interferometry, allowing us to characterize the noise correlations without direct access to the emitter. We exemplify the results with many dephasing models such as colored Gaussian noise, white noise, telegraph noise, and 1/f-noise, but the theory applies to any type of stationary dephasing appearing in quantum optical or solid-state environments.
