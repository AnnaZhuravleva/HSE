These notes were written for a set of three lectures given in a school at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in October/2017 before the workshop "Critical Stability of Quantum Few-Body Systems". These lectures are primarily dedicated to the students and represent a very idiosyncratic vision of the author, mainly in the last part of the text related to applications. These notes are only a tentative to show a technique, among many others, to solve problems in a very rich area of the contemporary physics - the Few-Body Physics - many times unknown by a considerable part of the students.
