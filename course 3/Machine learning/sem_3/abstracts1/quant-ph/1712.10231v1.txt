Quantum search algorithm can be described as the rotation of state vectors in a Hilbert space. The state vectors uniformly rotate by iterative sequences until they hit the target position. To optimize the algorithm, it is necessary to have the precise knowledge about some parameters like the number of target positions. Here we demonstrate the implementation of optimal fixed-point quantum search (OFPQS) algorithm in a five-qubit quantum computer developed by IBM Corporation. We perform the OFPQS algorithm for one and two-iterations and confirm the accuracy of our results by state tomography process.
