We show that the quantum Hamilton Jacobi approach to a class of quantum mechanical bound state problems and the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrix theory are equivalent. The Berry connection for both problems is identical to their quantum momentum function.The potential that appears in the joint probability distribution function in the random matrix theory is a super potential allowing us to apply it to exceptional polynomials.
