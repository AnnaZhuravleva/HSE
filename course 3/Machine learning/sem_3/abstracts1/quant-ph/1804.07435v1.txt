Integrated quantum photonics provides a scalable platform for the generation, manipulation, and detection of optical quantum states by confining light inside miniaturized waveguide circuits. Here we show the generation, manipulation, and interferometric stage of homodyne detection of non-classical light on a single device, a key step towards a fully integrated approach to quantum information with continuous variables. We use a dynamically reconfigurable lithium niobate waveguide network to generate and characterize squeezed vacuum and two-mode entangled states, key resources for several quantum communication and computing protocols. We measure a squeezing level of -1.38+-0.04 dB and demonstrate entanglement by verifying an inseparability criterion I=0.77+-0.02<1. Our platform can implement all the processes required for optical quantum technology and its high nonlinearity and fast reconfigurability makes it ideal for the realization of quantum computation with time encoded continuous variable cluster states.
