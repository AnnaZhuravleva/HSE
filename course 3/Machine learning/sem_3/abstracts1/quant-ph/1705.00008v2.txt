We study the collective dynamics of accelerated atoms interacting with a massless field via an Unruh-deWitt-type interaction. We first derive a general Hamiltonian describing such a system and then, employing a Markovian master equation, we study the corresponding collective dynamics. In particular, we observe that the emergence of entanglement between two-level atoms is linked to the building up of coherences between them and to superradiant emission. In addition, we show that the derived Hamiltonian can be experimentally implemented by employing impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates.
