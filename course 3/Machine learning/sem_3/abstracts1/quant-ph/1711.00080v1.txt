This article is a detailed introduction to Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, in which two photons interfere on a beamsplitter in a way that depends on the photons' distinguishability. We begin by considering distinguishability in the polarization degree of freedom. We then consider spectral distinguishability, and show explicitly how to calculate the HOM dip for three interesting cases: 1) photons with arbitrary spectral distributions, 2) spectrally entangled photons, and 3) spectrally mixed photons.
