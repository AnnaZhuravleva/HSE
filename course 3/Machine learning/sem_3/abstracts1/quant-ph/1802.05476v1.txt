We analytically investigate the recently proposed and implemented discrete-time quantum walk based on kicked ultra-cold atoms. We show how the internal level structure of the kicked atoms leads to the emergence of a relative light-shift phase immediately relevant for the experimental realization. Analytical solutions are provided for the momentum distribution for both the case of quantum resonance and the near-resonant quasimomenta.
