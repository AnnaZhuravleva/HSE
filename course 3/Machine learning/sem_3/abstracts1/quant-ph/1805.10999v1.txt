We demonstrate a reconfigurable 8x8 photonic integrated circuit suitable for implementing universal gates for quantum information processing protocols. The processor is implemented as a square mesh of tunable beam splitters based on stoichiometric silicon nitride waveguides, containing 128 tunable elements. In order to demonstrate its versatility, we perform a variety of photonic quantum information processing primitives, in the form of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, bosonic coalescence/anti-coalescence and high-dimensional single-photon quantum gates exploiting the whole mode structure of the processor. We achieve fidelities that demonstrate the potential for large-scale photonic quantum information processing using stoichiometric silicon nitride.
