Magnetically induced coherent population trapping has been studied in a single trapped laser cooled ion. The magnetic field dependent narrow spectral feature is found to be an useful tool in determining the null point of magnetic field at the ion position. In particular, we use a double lambda scheme that allows us to measure the null magnetic field point limited by the detector shot noise. We analyzed the system theoretically and found certain long lived bright states as the dark state is generated under steady state condition.
