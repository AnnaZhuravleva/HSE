We propose an experiment, where the Bell inequality is violated in a many-body system of massive particles. The source of correlated atoms is a spinor $F=1$ Bose-Einstein condensate residing in an optical lattice. We characterize the complete experimental procedure--- the local operations, the measurements and the inequality---necessary to run the Bell test. We show how the degree of violation of the Bell inequality depends on the strengths of the two-body correlations and on the number of scattered pairs. We show that the system can be used to demonstrate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. Also, the scattered pairs are an excellent many-body resource for the quantum-enhanced metrology. With the possibility to generalize our analysis to other configurations in a straightforward way, the presented inquiry can be important in the planning of the forthcoming Bell tests in correlated atomic systems.
