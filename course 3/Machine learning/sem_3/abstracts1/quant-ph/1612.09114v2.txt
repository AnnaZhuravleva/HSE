A new representation of quantum mechanics is presented, where energy and force are written in terms of linear momentum eigenvalues. These equations allow time evolution calculation for a set of point particles that produces a complete description of wave function. A system consisting of two electrons was analyzed, as result we found non locality as a conservation law and the need of an additional degree of freedom for bounded electrons as consequence for them to have the same energy. We associate this additional degree of freedom with electronic spin. As this method works in an analogous way to classic dynamics, it would be easily extended to N bodies.
