The arrival time statistics of spin-1/2 particles governed by Pauli's equation, and defined by their Bohmian trajectories, show unexpected and very well articulated features. Comparison with other proposed statistics of arrival times that arise from either the usual quantum flux or from semiclassical considerations suggest testing these notable deviations in an experimentum crucis of the validity of the Bohmian predictions for spin-1/2 particles. The suggested experiment, including the preparation of the wave functions, could be done with present-day experimental technology.
