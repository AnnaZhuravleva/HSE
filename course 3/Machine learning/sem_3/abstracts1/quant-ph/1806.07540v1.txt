The time-convolutionless (TCL) quantum master equation provides a powerful tool to simulate reduced dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a bath. The key quantity in the TCL master equation is the so-called kernel or generator, which describes effects of the bath degrees of freedom. Since the exact TCL generators are usually hard to calculate analytically, most applications of the TCL generalized master equation have relied on approximate generators using second and fourth order perturbative expansions. By using the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) and extended HEOM methods, we present a new approach to calculate the exact TCL generator and its high order perturbative expansions. The new approach is applied to the spin-boson model with different sets of parameters, to investigate the convergence of the high order expansions of the TCL generator. We also discuss circumstances where the exact TCL generator becomes singular for the spin-boson model, and a model of excitation energy transfer in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.
