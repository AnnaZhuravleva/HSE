We study the collective behavior of molecules placed in an infrared (IR) microcavity, incorporating the local fluctuations, i.e., dynamical disorder. The cooperative feature in vibrational polaritons is shown to be dynamically eroded, due to intermolecule coherence. To further resolve such process, we develop a two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-IR) for molecules interacting with cavity modes. The cooperative feature in correspondence to the spectroscopic signal is specified. The results reveal the dark states by the cross peaks apart from the ones for polaritons, as a result of the breakdown of cooperativity between molecules. We further show that the breakdown of cooperativity profoundly connects to the localization of the vibrational excitations whereas the polariton modes are extended wave over several molecules. Besides, our work offers new physical insight for understanding the recent 2D-IR experiments where the interaction between dark modes and bright polaritons was evident.
