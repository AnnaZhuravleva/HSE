Quantum kicked top is a fundamental model for time-dependent, chaotic Hamiltonian system and has been realized in experiments as well. As the quantum kicked top can be represented as a system of qubits, it is also popular as a testbed for the study of measures of quantum correlations such as entanglement, quantum discord and other multipartite entanglement measures. Further, earlier studies on kicked top have led to a broad understanding of how these measures are affected by the classical dynamical features. In this work, relying on the invariance of quantum correlation measures under local unitary transformations, it is shown exactly these measures display periodic behaviour either as a function of time or as a function of the chaos parameter in this system. As the kicked top has been experimentally realised using cold atoms as well as superconducting qubits, it is pointed out that these periodicities must be factored in while choosing of experimental parameters so that repetitions can be avoided.
