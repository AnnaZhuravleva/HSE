We present a theoretical investigation of the properties of quantum correlation functions in a dissipative multimode system. We define a total mth order equal-time correlation function, summed over all modes, which is shown to be conserved if the Hamiltonian possesses U(1) symmetry, provided any dissipation processes are linear in the system operators. As examples, we demonstrate this conservation using numerical simulations of a coupled cavity system and the Jaynes-Cummings model.
