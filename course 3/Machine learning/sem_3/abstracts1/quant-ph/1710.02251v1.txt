Within the f-deformed oscillator formalism, we derive a Markovian master equation for the description of the damped dynamics of nonlinear systems that interact with their environment. The applicability of this treatment to the particular case of a Morse-like oscillator interacting with a thermal field is illustrated, and the decay of quantum coherence in such a system is analyzed in terms of the evolution on phase space of its nonlinear coherent states via the Wigner function.
