A scheme for secure multiparty quantum summation was proposed by Run-hau Shi et al.,(SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, 6:19655, DOI:10.1038/srep19655). IBM Corporation has released a superconductivity based 5-qubit quantum computer named "Quantum Experience" and placed it on "cloud". In this paper we take advantage of the online availability of this real quantum processor(ibmqx2) and carry out the above protocol that has never been experimentally demonstrated earlier. Here, we set up experiments for secure quantum summation of one-qubit secret states . Besides, we propose a protocol for square and cubic summation and also simulate the proposed protocol for both cases. Experimental implementation of secure multiparty quantum summation protocol for two or more qubit secret state and the proposed protocol for square(and cubic) summation are not possible using the available 5-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx2). IBM has recently placed a 16-qubit quantum processor(ibmqx3) on the cloud but it is still not accessible for all users. We describe a simulation for two and three qubit secret state and proposed protocol for square(and cubic) summation using a simulator(Custom Topology) which is provided by IBM Corporation.
