We derived stochastic master equation for a system interacting with the Bose field prepared in a superposition of coherent states. We use the model of repeating interactions and measurements with the environment given by an infinite chain of identical and not interacting between themselves quantum systems being harmonic oscillators. Elements of the environment chain interact with the quantum system in turn one by one and they are subsequently measured. We determined the conditional evolution of the quantum system for the continuous in time observations as a limit of discrete recurrence equations.
