In this work, a mechanism for long time protection of entanglement of a two-qutrit V-type atomic system each of which interacts independently with a dissipative reservoir is investigated. It is shown that the protection process is related exclusively on the formation of bound states in the system-reservoir energy spectrum. It is demonstrated that the degree of boundedness for the system-reservoir bound states is well-controlled by entering other V-type qutrits into the reservoirs, and also through the manipulation of the spontaneously generated interference related to decay channels of the V-type atoms.
