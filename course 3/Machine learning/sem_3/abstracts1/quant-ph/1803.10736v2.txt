We show how general linear optical quantum entanglement experiments with probabilistic sources can be described using graph theory. By introducing complex weights in undirected graphs, we can naturally work with quantum superpositions. This immediately leads to many interesting results, some of which we present here. Firstly, we identify a conceptually new and experimentally completely unexplored method to solve classically intractable problems with quantum experiments. The problem is in the complexity class #P-complete, and deals with the computation of a generalization of the matrix function Permanent. Second, we show that a recent no-go result applies generally to linear optical quantum experiments, thus revealing important insights to quantum state generation with current photonic technology. Third, we show how to easily understand in a graphical way quantum experiments such as entanglement swapping. This connection offers a novel perspective on a widely used technology, and immediately raises many new questions.
