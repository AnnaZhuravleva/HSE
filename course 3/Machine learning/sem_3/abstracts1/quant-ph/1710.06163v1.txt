We propose a scheme for preparation of large-scale entangled $W$ states based on the fusion mechanism via quantum Zeno dynamics. By sending two atoms belonging to an $n$-atom $W$ state and an $m$-atom $W$ state, respectively, into a vacuum cavity (or two separate cavities), we may obtain a ($n+m-2$)-atom $W$ state via detecting the two-atom state after interaction. The present scheme is robust against both spontaneous emission of atoms and decay of cavity, and the feasibility analysis indicates that it can also be realized in experiment.
