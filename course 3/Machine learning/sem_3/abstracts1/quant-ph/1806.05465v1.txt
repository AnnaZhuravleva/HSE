We characterise non-selective global projective measurements capable of increasing quantum entanglement between two particles. We show that non-selective global projective measurements are capable of increasing entanglement between two particles, in particular, entanglement of any pure non-maximally entangled state can be improved in this way (but not of any mixed state) and we provide detailed analysis for two qubits. It is then shown that Markovian open system dynamics can only approximate such measurements, but this approximation converges exponentially fast as illustrated using Araki-Zurek model. We conclude with numerical evidence that macroscopic bodies in a random pure state do not gain entanglement in a random non-selective global measurement.
