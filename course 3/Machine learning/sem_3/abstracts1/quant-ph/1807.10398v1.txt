We model the evolution of a single atom in a cavity interacting with two lasers, one far off resonance which creates an optical potential lattice and one near resonance, which can interact with the atom. The atom may tunnel between sites in the lattice. We find the photon counting statistic $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ depends on the tunneling rate. Additionally we derive methods to work with a Bose-Einstein Condensate in the same situation, in ther Josephson junction regime. It is shown that oscillations in $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ are directly proportional to the tunneling coefficient. We work in the bad-cavity limit and give an example of the use of adiabatic elimination in quantum trajectory theory
