We propose an efficient strategy to find optimal control functions for state-to-state quantum control problems. Our procedure first chooses an input state trajectory, that can realize the desired transformation by adiabatic variation of the system Hamiltonian. The shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) formalism then provides a control Hamiltonian that realizes the reference trajectory exactly but on a finite time scale. As the final state is achieved with certainty, we define a cost functional that incorporates the resource requirements and a perturbative expression for robustness. We optimize this functional by systematically varying the reference trajectory. We demonstrate the method by application to population transfer in a laser driven three-level {\Lambda}-system, where we find solutions that are fast and robust against perturbations while maintaining a low peak laser power.
