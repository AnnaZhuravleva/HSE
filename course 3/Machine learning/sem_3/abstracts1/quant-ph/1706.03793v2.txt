Quantum Measure Theory (QMT) is an approach to quantum mechanics, based on the path integral, in which quantum theory is conceived of as a generalised stochastic process. One of the postulates of QMT is that events with zero quantum measure do not occur, however this is not sufficient to give a full picture of the quantum world. Determining the other postulates is a work in progress and this paper investigates a proposal called the Multiplicative Scheme for QMT in which the physical world corresponds, essentially, to a set of histories from the path integral. This scheme is applied to Sorkin's $n$-site hopper, a discrete, unitary model of a single particle on a ring of $n$ sites, motivated by free Schr\"odinger propagation. It is shown that the multiplicative scheme's global features lead to the conclusion that no non-trivial, time-finite event can occur.
