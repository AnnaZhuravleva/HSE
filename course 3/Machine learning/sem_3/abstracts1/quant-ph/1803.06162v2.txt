I show that the application of the quantum-mechanical (QM) which-way weak measurement scheme of Vaidman may lead to logical inconsistencies. To this end, I study weak values of projection operators. Weak values are (normalized) amplitudes, operationally defined by a weak measurement followed by postselection. Projector weak values have a direct physical significance. This allows formulating an inconsistency in classical terms, viz., the contradiction in the readings of several measuring devices. To arrive at the contradiction, I also invoke the property of weak measurements not to collapse the wave function but to leave the state of the system unchanged (to lowest order in the weak measurement strength). My arguments rely entirely on basic QM rules plus commonly accepted weak QM measurement approximations. Therefore, the inconsistency challenges QM as such.
