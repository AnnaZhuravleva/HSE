In this paper, we propose a scheme to implement the two-qubit controlled-Z gate via the Stark-tuned F\"orster interaction of Rydberg atoms, where the F\"orster defect is driven by a time-dependent electric field of a simple sinusoidal function while dipole-dipole interactions are time-independent. It is shown that when the system is initially in a specific state, it makes a cyclic evolution after a preset interaction time, returning to the initial state, but picks up a phase, which can be used for realizing a two-atom controlled-Z gate. Due to the interference of sequential Landau-Zener transitions, the population and phase of the state is quasi-deterministic after the cyclic evolution and therefore the gate fidelity is insensitive to fluctuations of the interaction time and the dipole-dipole interaction strength. Feasibility of the scheme realized with Cs atoms is discussed in detail, which shows that the two-qubit gate via Landau-Zener control can be realized with the state-of-the-art experimental setup.
