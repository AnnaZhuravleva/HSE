Strong light-matter interactions are critical for quantum technologies based on light, such as memories or nonlinear interactions. Solid state materials will be particularly important for such applications, because of the relative ease of fabrication of components. Silicon vacancy centers (SiV) in diamond feature especially narrow inhomogeneous spectral lines, which are rare in solid materials. Here, we demonstrate resonant coherent manipulation, stimulated Raman adiabatic passage, and strong light-matter interaction via four-wave mixing of a weak signal field in an ensemble of SiV centers.
