The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a quantum coherent feedback network composed of two two-level systems (qubits) driven by two counter-propagating photons. The coherent feedback network is a marginally stable system, and the spectral entanglement of photons could be enhanced as a consequence of the continuing two-photon interaction inside the feedback loop. By means of quantum stochastic calculus and the input-output framework, the analytic form of the steady-state output field states are derived in the Heisenberg picture for the first time. Based on the analytic form, significant enhancement of photon-photon interaction can be observed. In particular, we demonstrate that the famous Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be created using this coherent feedback structure. The proposed framework is also applicable in the single-photon scenario.
