Twin-filed quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) protocol and its variants, e.g. phase-matching (PM) QKD and TF-QKD based on sending or not sending, are highly attractive, since they are able to overcoming the well-known rate-loss limit of QKD protocols. However, all these protocols require active phase randomization and post-selection, which play essential role in their security proof. Counterintuitively, we find that in PM-QKD, beating the rate-loss limit is still possible even if phase randomization and post-selection in the coding mode are both removed. This finding is very helpful to simplify the implementation of PM-QKD in practice and sheds new light on the understanding of TF-QKD.
