We present a protocol to selectively decouple, recouple, and engineer effective couplings in mesoscopic dipolar spin networks. In particular, we develop a versatile protocol that relies upon magic angle spinning to perform Hamiltonian engineering. By using global control fields in conjunction with a local actuator, such as a diamond Nitrogen Vacancy center located in the vicinity of a nuclear spin network, both global and local control over the effective couplings can be achieved. We show that the resulting effective Hamiltonian can be well understood within a simple, intuitive geometric picture, and corroborate its validity by performing exact numerical simulations in few-body systems. Applications of our method are in the emerging fields of two-dimensional room temperature quantum simulators in diamond platforms, as well as in dipolar coupled polar molecule networks.
