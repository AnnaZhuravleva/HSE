We present a characterization of a bosonic field theory driven by a free (Gaussian) tachyonic Hamiltonian. This regime is obtained from a theory describing two coupled bosonic fields after a regular quench. Relevant physical quantities such as simple correlators, entanglement entropies, and the mutual information of disconnected subregions are computed. We show that the causal structure resembles a critical (massless) quench. For short times, physical quantities also resemble critical quenches. However, exponential divergences end up dominating the dynamics in a very characteristic way. This is related to the fact that the low-frequency modes do not equilibrate. Some applications and extensions are outlined.
