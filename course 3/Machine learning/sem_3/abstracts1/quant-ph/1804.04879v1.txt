Compared to fiber continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), atmospheric link offers the possibility of a broader geographical coverage and more flexible transmission. However, there are many negative features of the atmospheric channel that will reduce the achievable secret key rate, such as beam extinction and a variety of turbulence effects. Here we show how these factors affect the newly deduced achievable secret key rate for the atmospheric channel, which forms a transmission model for CVQKD. This established transmission model can help evaluate the feasibility of experiment scheme in practical applications. We found that the deterioration of the key rate of horizontal link on the surface of the earth is primarily caused by transmittance fluctuations (including beam wandering, broadening, deformation, and scintillation), while transmittance change due to pulse broadening under weak turbulence is negligible. Besides, we also found that communication interruptions can also cause a perceptible reduction in the key rate when the transmission distance is longer, while phase excess noise due to arrival time fluctuations requires new compensation techniques to reduce it to a negligible level. Furthermore, it is found that performing homodyne detection enables longer distances to be transmitted, whereas heterodyne allows higher key rates to be achieved over short distances.
