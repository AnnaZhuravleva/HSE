Coupled excitonic structures are found in natural and artificial light harvesting systems where optical transitions link different excitation manifolds. In systems with symmetry, some optical transitions are allowed, while others are forbidden. Here we examine an excitonic ring structure and identify an accidental degeneracy between two categories of double-excitation eigenstates with distinct symmetries and optical transition properties. To understand the accidental degeneracy, a complete selection rule between two arbitrary excitation manifolds is derived with a physically motivated proof. Remarkably, symmetry analysis shows the lack of certain symmetry elements in the Hamiltonian is responsible for this degeneracy, which is unique to rings with size N=4l+2 (l being an integer).
