Metrics have been used to investigate the relationship between wavefunction distances and density distances for families of specific systems. We extend this research to look at random potentials for time-dependent single electron systems, and for ground-state two electron systems. We find that Fourier series are a good basis for generating random potentials. These random potentials also yield quasi-linear relationships between the distances of ground-state densities and wavefunctions, providing a framework in which Density Functional Theory can be explored.
