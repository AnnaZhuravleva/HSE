Wave-particle duality relations express the fact that knowledge about the path a particle took suppresses information about its wave-like properties, in particular, its ability to generate an interference pattern. Recently, duality relations in which the wave-like properties are quantified by using measures of quantum coherence have been proposed. Quantum coherence can be generalized to a property called group asymmetry. Here we derive a generalized duality relation involving group asymmetry, which is closely related to the success probability of discriminating between the actions of the elements of a group. The second quantity in the duality relation, the one generalizing which-path information, is related to information about the irreducible representations that make up the group representation.
