For the development of long-distance quantum networks, sources of single photons and entangled photon pairs emitting in the low-loss wavelength region around 1550 nm are a crucial building block. Here we show that quantum dot devices based on indium phosphide are capable of electrically injected single photon emission in this wavelength region with multiphoton events suppressed down to 0.11$\pm$0.02. Using the biexciton cascade mechanism, they further produce entangled photons with a fidelity of 87$\pm$4%, sufficient for the application of one-way error correction protocols. The new material allows for entangled photon generation up to an operating temperature of 93 K, reaching a regime accessible by electric coolers. The quantum photon source can be directly integrated with existing long distance quantum communication and cryptography systems and provides a new material platform for developing future quantum network hardware.
