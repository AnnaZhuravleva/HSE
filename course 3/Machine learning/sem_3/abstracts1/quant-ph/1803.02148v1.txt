The distributed quantum computation plays an important role in large-scale quantum information processing. In the atom-cavity-fiber system, we put forward two efficient proposals to prepare the steady entanglement of two distant atoms with dissipation. The atomic spontaneous emission and the loss of fiber are exploited actively as powerful resources, while the effect of cavity decay is inhibited by quantum Zeno dynamics and quantum-jump-based feedback control. These proposals do not require precisely tailored Rabi frequencies or coupling strength between cavity and fiber. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of extending the present schemes into the systems consisting of two atoms at the opposite ends of the $n$ cavities connected by $(n-1)$ fibers, and the corresponding numerical simulation reveals that a high fidelity remains achievable with current experimental parameters.
