We develop a scheme of fast forward of adiabatic spin dynamics of quantum entangled states. We settle the quasi-adiabatic dynamics by adding the regularization terms to the original Hamiltonian and then accelerate it with use of a large time-scaling factor. Assuming the experimentally-realizable candidate Hamiltonian consisting of the exchange interactions and magnetic field, we solved the regularization terms. These terms multiplied by the velocity function give rise to the state-dependent counter-diabatic terms. The scheme needs neither knowledge of full spectral properties of the system nor solving the initial and boundary value problem. Our fast forward Hamiltonian generates a variety of state-dependent counter-diabatic terms for each of adiabatic states, which can include the state-independent one. We highlight this fact by using minimum (two-spin) models for a simple transverse Ising model, quantum annealing and generation of entanglement.
