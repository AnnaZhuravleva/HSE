We introduce an efficient iterative method to prepare a target state in Hilbert spaces with high dimensionality using a combination of unitary evolution, measurements and quantum Zeno dynamics. The latter confines the evolution within Zeno subspaces of decreasing size. This gives an exponential speed up relative to the case of states evolving in the full Hilbert space between projective measurements. We demonstrate our approach on the control problem of rapidly transferring a superfluid into the Mott insulator in the Bose-Hubbard model. We also demonstrate the general applicability of the method by preparing arbitrary superpositions using random Hamiltonians.
