Generative adversarial network (GAN) is an effective machine learning framework to train unsupervised generative models, and has drawn lots of attention in recent years. In the meantime, there are some researches that use parameterized quantum circuits to generate simple patterns. In this paper, we present a quantum version of GAN, where parameterized quantum circuits are trained by an adversarial discriminator, to generate new samples that follows the probability distribution of a given training dataset. Two families of quantum circuits, both composed of simple one-qubit rotation and two-qubit controlled-phase gates, are considered. The parameters are learned through classical gradient descent optimization. The results of a small-scale proof-of-principle numerical experiment demonstrate that quantum circuits can be trained in an adversarial way for generative tasks.
