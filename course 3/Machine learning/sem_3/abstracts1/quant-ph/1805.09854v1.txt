Inspired by the electromagnetic duality, we propose a scheme to realize the fractional angular momentum by using a cold neutral atom which possesses permanent magnetic dipole momentum. The atom is trapped by a harmonic potential and interacted with electric fields, which make the motion of the atom be planar and rotationally symmetric. We show that the eigenvalues of the canonical angular momentum of the cold atom can be taken as fractional values when the atom is cooled down to its lowest kinetic energy level. The fractional part of the canonical angular momentum is dual to that of the fractional angular momenta realized by using a charged particle.
