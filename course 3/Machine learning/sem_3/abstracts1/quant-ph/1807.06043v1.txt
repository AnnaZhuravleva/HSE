We describe the design, fabrication, and operation of a novel surface-electrode Paul trap that produces a radio-frequency-null along the axis perpendicular to the trap surface. This arrangement enables control of the vertical trapping potential and consequentially the ion-electrode distance via dc-electrodes only. We demonstrate confinement of single $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions at heights between $50~\mu$m and $300~\mu$m above planar copper-coated aluminium electrodes. We investigate micromotion in the vertical direction and show cooling of both the planar and vertical motional modes into the ground state. This trap architecture provides a platform for precision electric-field noise detection, trapping of vertical ion strings without excess micromotion, and may have applications for scalable quantum computers with surface ion traps.
