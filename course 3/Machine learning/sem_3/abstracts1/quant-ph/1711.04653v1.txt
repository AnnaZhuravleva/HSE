The quantum coherence (QC) of two comoving atoms in an arbitrary stationary trajectory is investigated. We give a criteria under which QC can be frozen to a nonzero value. For static atoms in thermal bath or not, we find that only in the case of the superradiant or subradiant spontaneous emission rate of atom equaling zero can QC be frozen, which implies that the presence of thermal reservoir does not affect the frozen condition (FC) for atoms at rest. The results may provide a more efficient way to utilize QC in practical quantum technologies.
