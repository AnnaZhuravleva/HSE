We present the experimental reconstruction of the Wigner function of an individual electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at room temperature. This spherical Wigner function contains the same information as the density matrix for arbitrary spin systems. As an example, we exactly characterize the quantum state of a single qubit undergoing a nearly pure dephasing process by Wigner function. The fidelities and purities during this process are extracted from the experimental reconstructed Wigner functions, whose dynamics agree with the theoretical prediction. Our method can be applied to multi-qubit systems for measuring the Wigner function of their collective spin state.
