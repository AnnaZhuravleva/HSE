We extend the concept of Anderson localization, the confinement of quantum information in a spatially irregular potential, to quantum circuits. Considering matchgate circuits, generated by time-dependent spin-1/2 XY Hamiltonians, we give an analytic formula for the out-of-time-ordered correlator of a local observable, and show that it can be efficiently evaluated by a classical computer even when the explicit Heisenberg time evolution cannot. Because this quantity bounds the average error incurred by truncating the evolution to a spatially limited region, we demonstrate dynamical localization as a means for classically simulating quantum computation and give examples of localized phases under certain spatio-temporal disordered Hamiltonians.
