We introduce the idea of a {\it beable-guided quantum theory}. Beable-guided quantum theories (BGQT) are generalisations of quantum theory, inspired by Bell's concept of beables. They modify the quantum probabilities for some specified set of fundamental events, histories, or other elements of quasiclassical reality by probability laws that depend on the realised configuration of beables. For example, they may define an additional probability weight factor for a beable configuration, independent of the quantum dynamics.   BGQT can be fitted to observational data to provide foils against which to compare explanations based on standard quantum theory. For example, a BGQT could, in principle, characterise the effects attributed to dark energy or dark matter, or any other deviation from the predictions of standard quantum dynamics, without introducing extra fields or a cosmological constant. The complexity of the beable-guided theory would then parametrise how far we are from a standard quantum explanation.   Less conservatively, we give reasons for taking suitably simple beable-guided quantum theories as serious phenomenological theories in their own right. Among these are that cosmological models defined by BGQT might in fact fit the empirical data better than any standard quantum explanation, and that BGQT suggest potentially interesting non-standard ways of coupling quantum matter to gravity.
