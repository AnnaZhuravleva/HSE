We introduce a measurement-device independent star network which is based on continuous variable systems and standard linear optics. Here an arbitrary number of users send modulated coherent states to an untrusted relay where a generalized Bell detection creates multipartite secret correlations. These correlations are then distilled into a shared secret key to implement a completely-secure quantum conference or, alternatively, a protocol of quantum secret-sharing. Our scheme is composably secure and able to achieve high rates with cheap optical implementation. We show that completely secure quantum conferencing is possible among 50 remote parties at rates as high as 0.1 bit per use within a radius of about 40 meters, compatible with fiber connections in large buildings.
