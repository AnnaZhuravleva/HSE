The dynamical behavior of interacting systems plays a fundamental role for determining quantum correlations, such as entanglement. In this Letter, we describe temporal quantum effects of the inseparable evolution of composite quantum states by comparing the trajectories to their classically correlated counterparts. For this reason, we introduce equations of motions describing the separable propagation of any interacting quantum system, which are derived by requiring separability for all times. The resulting Schroedinger-type equations allow for comparing the trajectories in a separable configuration with the actual behavior of the system and, thereby, identifying inseparable and time-dependent quantum properties. As an example, we study bipartite discrete- and continuous-variable interacting systems. The generalization of our developed technique to multipartite scenarios is also provided.
