We present a mathematical framework for quantum mechanics in which the basic entities and operations have physical significance. In this framework the primitive concepts are states and effects and the resulting mathematical structure is a convex effect algebra. We characterize the convex effect algebras that are classical and those that are quantum mechanical. The quantum mechanical ones are those that can be represented on a complex Hilbert space. We next introduce the sequential product of effects to form a convex sequential effect algebra. This product makes it possible to study conditional probabilities and expectations.
