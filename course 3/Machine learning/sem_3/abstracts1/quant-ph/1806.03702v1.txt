It has been shown that there is an advantage in transmitting both quantum and classical information simultaneously over a quantum channel, compared to independent transmissions. The characterization and construction of such codes, which we refer to as hybrid codes, has been done from a coding theory and an operator algebra quantum error correction (OAQEC) perspective. In this work we unify these two perspectives, and show that the coding theory formulation is a specific case of the OAQEC perspective. We also generalize the quantum hamming bound to the hybrid case. To date no such hybrid codes have been physically implemented. In this work we develop a hybrid code and provide the encoding and decoding circuit.
