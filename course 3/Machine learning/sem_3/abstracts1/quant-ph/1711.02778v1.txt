Using a circuit QED device, we present a theoretical study of real-time quantum state estimation via quantum Bayesian approach. Suitable conditions under which the Bayesian approach can accurately update the density matrix of the qubit are analyzed. We also consider the correlation between some basic and physically meaningful parameters of the circuit QED and the performance of the Bayesian approach. Our results advance the understanding of quantum Bayesian approach and pave the way to study quantum feedback control and adaptive control.
