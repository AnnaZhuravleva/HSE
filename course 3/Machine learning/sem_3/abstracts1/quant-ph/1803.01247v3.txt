In this paper we start with proving that the Schr\"odinger equation (SE) with the classical $12-6$ Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential is nonintegrable in the sense of the Differential Galois Theory (DGT), for any value of energy; i.e. there are no solutions in closed form for such differential equation. We study the $10-6$ potential through DGT and SUSYQM, being it one of the two partner potentials built with a superpotential of the form $w\left(r\right)\propto 1/r^5$. We also find that it is integrable in the sense of DGT for zero energy. A first analysis of the applicability and physical consequences of the model is carried out in terms of the so called de Boer principle of corresponding states. A comparison of the second virial coefficient $B\left(T\right)$ for both potentials shows a good agreement for low temperatures. As a consequence of these results we propose the $10-6$ potential as an integrable alternative to be applied in further studies instead of the original $12-6$ L-J potential. Finally we study through DGT and SUSYQM the integrability of the SE with a generalized $(2\nu-2)-\nu$ L-J potential.
