In this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme for detection of the emitter-resonator coupling strength in the ultra-strong coupling regime in the quantum Rabi model via introducing an auxiliary resonator. We demonstrate the total system as a two-mode Rabi model and obtain the ground state by the transformed rotating wave approximation, which is superior to the usually applied rotating wave approximation. Here, the emitter-resonator coupling strength is detected by monitoring the average excitation number in the auxiliary resonator and the sensitivity of the detection scheme is discussed in an analytical manner.
