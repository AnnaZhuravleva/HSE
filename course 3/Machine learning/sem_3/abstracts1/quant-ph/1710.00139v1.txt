The effect of three-spin interaction k on thermal entanglement between alternate qubits is studied using pairwise concurrence C and energy level diagram. It is found that k breaks the symmetry about the effect of magnetic field h on C. It shifts a dip structure and gradually effaces a boot structure when |k|<|J| (J is spin exchange coupling). A peak with C maintains 1 appears and expands, elbowing the dip backwards when |k|>|J|. A sudden change of the concurrence occurs around |k|=|J|, h=-k. Similar conclusions about nearest-neighbor qubits are directly given.
