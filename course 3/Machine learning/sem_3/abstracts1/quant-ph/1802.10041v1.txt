In this paper we demonstrate that the efficiency of quantum algorithms can be significantly altered by malicious manipulation of the input data. We exemplify the possibility of attacks on quantum spatial search based on Szegedy walk. We achieve this by proposing a framework suitable for analysing efficiency of attacks on quantum search algorithms. We provide the analysis of proposed attacks for different models of random graphs.
