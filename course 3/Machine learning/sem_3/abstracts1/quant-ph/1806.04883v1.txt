We report on precise localization spectroscopy experiments of individual 13C nuclear spins near a central electronic sensor spin in a diamond chip. By detecting the nuclear free precession signals in rapidly switchable external magnetic fields, we retrieve the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the nuclear spins with sub-Angstrom resolution and for distances beyond 10 Angstroms. We further show that the Fermi contact contribution can be constrained by measuring the nuclear g-factor enhancement. The presented method will be useful for mapping the atomic-scale structure of single molecules, an ambitious yet important goal of nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
