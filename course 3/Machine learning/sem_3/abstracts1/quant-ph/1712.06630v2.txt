The use of quantum resources can provide measurement precision beyond the shot noise limit (SNL). The task of ab initio optical phase measurement-the estimation of a completely unknown phase-has been experimentally demonstrated with precision beyond the SNL, and even scaling like the ultimate bound, the Heisenberg limit (HL), but with an overhead factor. However, existing approaches have not been able-even in principle-to achieve the best possible precision, saturating the HL exactly. Here we demonstrate a scheme to achieve true HL phase measurement, using a combination of three techniques: entanglement, multiple samplings of the phase shift, and adaptive measurement. Our experimental demonstration of the scheme, with photonic qubits and N = 3 photon-passes, achieves a precision that is within 4% of the HL, surpassing the best precision theoretically achievable with simpler techniques. This work represents a fundamental achievement of the ultimate limits of metrology, and the scheme can be extended to higher N and other physical systems.
