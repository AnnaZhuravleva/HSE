Entanglement distillation is the process of concentrating entanglement from a given quantum state. We present a technique for distillation of bi-partite polarization entanglement using interferometry. This technique can be optimized to extract maximal entanglement from any pure or mixed entangled state. A model for this method is presented and in particular we present experimental results for pure states when using polarizing Mach-Zehnder interferometers. These experimentally distilled states always demonstrate an increased violation of Bell's inequality.
