We propose, experimentally realize and study possible applications of a new type of logic element: random flip-flop. By definition it operates similarly to a conventional flip-flop except that it functions with probability of 1/2 otherwise it does nothing. We demonstrate one practical realization of the random flip-flop based on optical quantum random number generator and discuss possible usages of such a device in computers, cryptographic hardware and testing equipment.
