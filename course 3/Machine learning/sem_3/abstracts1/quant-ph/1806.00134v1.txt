Quantum interferences between non-orthogonal states are the best approximation of a joint realization of the non-commuting physical properties represented by the two states. As I have shown recently, such interferences can be used to demonstrate that quantum physics deviates from classical causality in the limit of small action. Here, I point out that this proof constitutes a failure of the principle of least action and consider possible implications for our understanding of fundamental physics.
