This is the 10th and final chapter of my book on Quantum Information, based on the course I have been teaching at Caltech since 1997. An earlier version of this chapter (originally Chapter 5) has been available on the course website since 1998, but this version is substantially revised and expanded. Topics covered include classical Shannon theory, quantum compression, quantifying entanglement, accessible information, and using the decoupling principle to derive achievable rates for quantum protocols. This is a draft, pre-publication copy of Chapter 10, which I will continue to update. See the URL on the title page for further updates and drafts of other chapters, and please send me an email if you notice errors.
