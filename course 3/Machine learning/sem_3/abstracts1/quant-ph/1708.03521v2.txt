Quantum bit commitment and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) are the building blocks of secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Of the numerous QKD schemes, the BB84 protocol was the first one proposed and it is also the most popular. Bennett and Brassard, in their 1984 paper, proposed both quantum bit commitment and the BB84 scheme of QKD. However, their scheme for bit commitment was later shown to be vulnerable to an EPR attack. Also, in a world with Deutschian Closed Timelike Curves (D-CTCs), the BB84 protocol can be broken as the eavesdropper can intercept whatever key the two parties communicate with each other using a circuit which detects non-orthogonal quantum states. Later, the idea of this circuit was extended using Postselected Closed Timelike Curves (P-CTCs), a second variant of CTCs. In this paper, we first propose a secure quantum bit commitment protocol using the Deutschian model of closed timelike curves. Then, we take up the BB84 protocol and propose a secure version of the protocol, transforming it to an entanglement based scheme using the postselected model of closed timelike curves. In short, we show that in the presence of Closed Timelike Curves, unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment and secure quantum key distribution are both possible.
