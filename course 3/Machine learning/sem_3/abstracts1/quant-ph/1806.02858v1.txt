A two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, realized by a controlled-phase (C-phase) gate combined with single-qubit gates, has been experimentally implemented recently for quantum-dot spin qubits in isotopically enriched silicon, a promising solid-state system for practical quantum computation. In the experiments, the single-qubit gates have been demonstrated with fault-tolerant control-fidelity, but the infidelity of the two-qubit C-phase gate is, primarily due to the electrical noise, still higher than the required error threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Here, by taking the realistic system parameters and the experimental constraints on the control pulses into account, we construct experimentally realizable high-fidelity CNOT gates robust against electrical noise with the experimentally measured $1/f^{1.01}$ noise spectrum and also against the uncertainty in the interdot tunnel coupling amplitude. Our optimal CNOT gate has about two orders of magnitude improvement in gate infidelity over the ideal C-phase gate constructed without considering any noise effect. Furthermore, within the same control framework, high-fidelity and robust single-qubit gates can also be constructed, paving the way for large-scale FTQC.
