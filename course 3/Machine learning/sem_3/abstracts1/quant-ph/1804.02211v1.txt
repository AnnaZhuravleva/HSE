The problem of estimating multiple loss parameters under energy constraints using the most general ancilla-assisted entangled parallel strategy is studied. An upper bound on the quantum Fisher information matrix is derived assuming the environment modes can be accessed. We then present a probe state that achieves this upper bound even in the practical case where the environment modes are inaccessible. This optimal probe can be prepared using single-photon sources and linear optics, and the optimal performance can be attained using on-off detection and classical processing. In the course of our analysis, we calculate explicitly the energy-constrained Bures distance between $M$-fold tensor products of two pure-loss channels.
