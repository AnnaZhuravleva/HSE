We report an accelerated laser phase diffusion quantum entropy source with all non-laser optical and optoelectronic elements implemented in silicon photonics. The device uses efficient and robust single-laser accelerated phase diffusion methods, and implements the whole quantum entropy source scheme including an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer with optimized splitting ratio, in a 0.5 mmx1 mm footprint. We demonstrate Gbps raw entropy-generation rates in a technology compatible with conventional CMOS fabrication techniques.
