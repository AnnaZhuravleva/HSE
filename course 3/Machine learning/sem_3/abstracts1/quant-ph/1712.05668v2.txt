The entanglement dynamics of a laser-pumped two-level quantum dot pair is investigated in the steady-state. The closely spaced two-level emitters, embedded in a semiconductor substrate, interact with both the environmental vacuum modes of the electromagnetic field reservoir as well as with the lattice vibrational phonon thermostat. We have found that the entanglement among the pair's components is substantially enhanced due to presence of the phonon subsystem. The reason is phonon induced decay among the symmetrical and antisymmetrical two-qubit collective states and, consequently, the population of the latter one. This also means that through thermal phonon bath engineering one can access the subradiant two-particle cooperative state.
