The quaternion is a natural representation of the magnetic moment of the fundamental particles. Under the hopf-fibration the parameter space of the quaternion separates into an intrinsic and extrinsic parameter space, and accounts for the intrinsic and extrinsic spin of the fundamental particles. The intrinsic parameter space is the global, geometric and dynamic phases which are presented in this article in full generality. The equivalence between the quantum and classical equations of motion is established, and the global phase of the quaternion is shown to be a natural hidden variable which deterministically accounts for the results of the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
