In a recent article, Banerji et al. introduced a novel quantum state of light, coined as the perfect quantum optical vortex state [Phys. Rev. A 94, 053838 (2016)] due to its mathematical similarity with the classical perfect vortex beam. This state is obtained by means of the Fourier transform of a Bessel-Gaussian vortex state, and the authors claim that this can be accomplished by means of a simple lens. Here, we will show that this statement is wrong since a lens cannot modify the quantum noise distribution related to the input optical quantum state and this has to be exchanged by an "effective lens".
