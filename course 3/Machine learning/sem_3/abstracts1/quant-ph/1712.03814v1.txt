Exceptional point (EP) is an exclusive critical point in non-Hermitian systems, at which pair of eigenstates coalesce and many exotic features occur. In general, EPs are sensitive to the parameters of a system. We show that EPs can be topologically stable through a simple non-Hermitian model. As a topological invariant, the topological charges of EPs can be 0,1/2, and -1/2. We also propose a concrete non-Hermitian tight-binding system to demonstrate our finding, which is a two-layer square lattice with diagonal couplings and staggered imaginary potentials. By mapping the eigenstates of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to a real auxiliary 2D vector field in k space, we find that the EPs are related to the topological defects of the field. The moving and merging of singularities in k space induces the occurrence of topological quantum phase transitions and forms different configurations, which outline the topological phase diagram of the system.
