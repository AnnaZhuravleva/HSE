We propose a randomized variant of the stabilizer rewiring algorithm (SRA), a method for constructing a transversal circuit mapping between any pair of stabilizer codes. As gates along this circuit are applied, the initial code is deformed through a series of intermediate codes before reaching the final code. With this randomized variant, we show that there always exists a path of deformations which preserves the code distance throughout the circuit, while using at most linear overhead in the distance. Furthermore, we show that a random path will almost always suffice, and discuss prospects for implementing general fault-tolerant code switching circuits.
