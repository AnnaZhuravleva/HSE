The preparation of the initial superposition state of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) is necessary for the study and applications of DTQWs. In linear optics, it is always easy to prepare an initial superposition state of the "coin", which is encoded by the polarization state; while the preparation of a superposition state of the walker is challenging. Based on a proposed encoding method, we here report the first DTQW protocol with the walker's position encoded in the polarization space of single photons as well as the first experimental demonstration of DTQW over six steps with the walker initially in a superposition state, by using only passive linear-optical elements. The effect of the walker's different initial superposition states on the spread speed of the DTQW and on the entanglement between the coin and the walker is also investigated, which has not been reported before. When the walker is initially in a superposition state, we show that the properties of DTQW are very different from those of DTQW starting from a single position. Our findings reveal different properties of DTQW and paves an avenue to study DTQW. Moreover, the encoding method enables one to encode an arbitrary high-dimensional quantum state using a single physical qubit and may be adopted to implement other quantum information tasks.
