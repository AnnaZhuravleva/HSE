As an important resource to realize quantum information, quantum correlation displays different behaviors, freezing phenomenon and non-localization, which are dissimilar to the entanglement and classical correlation, respectively. In our setup, the ordering of quantum correlation is represented for different quantization methods by considering an open quantum system scenario. The machine learning method (neural network method) is then adopted to train for the construction of a bridge between the R\`{e}nyi discord ($\alpha=2$) and the geometric discord (Bures distance) for $X$ form states. Our results clearly demonstrate that the machine learning method is useful for studying the differences and commonalities of different quantizing methods of quantum correlation.
