Non-redundant and normalized four-component vector tomographic portrait fully describing the states of spin 1/2 quantum particles was introduced. Dequantizer and quantizer for such portrait were found, and generalization to the case of spin (2^N-1)/2 was done (N is a natural number). It was shown that such a portrait is completely defined by a thriple of non-complanar vectors with the lengthes equal or less then unity. A clear geometric interpretation of the choice of parameters for finding normalized dequantizers and quantizers is presented and numerical examples of such dequantizers and quantizers for spin 1/2 are given.
