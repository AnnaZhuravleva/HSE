Many determinantal inequalities for positive definite block matrices are consequences of general entropy inequalities, specialised to Gaussian distributed vectors with prescribed covariances. In particular, strong subadditivity (SSA) yields \begin{equation*} \ln\det V_{AC} + \ln\det V_{BC} - \ln\det V_{ABC} - \ln\det V_C \geq 0 \end{equation*} for all $3\times 3$-block matrices $V_{ABC}$, where subscripts identify principal submatrices. We shall refer to the above inequality as SSA of log-det entropy. In this paper we develop further insights on the properties of the above inequality and its applications to classical and quantum information theory.   In the first part of the paper, we show how to find known and new necessary and sufficient conditions under which saturation with equality occurs. Subsequently, we discuss the role of the classical transpose channel (also known as Petz recovery map) in this problem and find its action explicitly. We then prove some extensions of the saturation theorem, by finding faithful lower bounds on a log-det conditional mutual information.   In the second part, we focus on quantum Gaussian states, whose covariance matrices are not only positive but obey additional constraints due to the uncertainty relation. For Gaussian states, the log-det entropy is equivalent to the R\'enyi entropy of order $2$. We provide a strengthening of log-det SSA for quantum covariance matrices that involves the so-called Gaussian R\'enyi-$2$ entanglement of formation, a well-behaved entanglement measure defined via a Gaussian convex roof construction. We then employ this result to define a log-det entropy equivalent of the squashed entanglement, which is remarkably shown to coincide with the Gaussian R\'enyi-$2$ entanglement of formation. This allows us to establish useful properties of such measure(s), like monogamy, faithfulness, and additivity on Gaussian states.
