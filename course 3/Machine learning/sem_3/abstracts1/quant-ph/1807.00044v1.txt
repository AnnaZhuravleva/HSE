We propose a novel squeezed light source capable of meeting the stringent requirements of continuous variable quantum sampling. Using the effective $\chi_2$ interaction induced by a strong driving beam in the presence of the $\chi_3$ response in an integrated microresonator, our device is compatible with established nanophotonic fabrication platforms. With typical realistic parameters, squeezed states with a mean photon number of 10 or higher can be generated in a single consistent temporal mode at repetition rates in excess of 100MHz. Over 15dB of squeezing is achievable in existing ultra-low loss platforms.
