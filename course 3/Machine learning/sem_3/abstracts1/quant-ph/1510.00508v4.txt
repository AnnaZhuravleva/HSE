We study the dynamics of a mechanical resonator parametrically coupled to a driven dissipative quantum emitter in the ultra-strong coupling regime. We show that this regime is fully compatible with a semi-classical treatment, and we derive master equations for the emitter and the resonator. We show that the fluctuations of the driven emitter's population induce the non-symmetrical scattering of the mechanical quadratures. At long timescales, such scattering back-acts on the emitter, which eventually decouples from the driving light. This optical noise at the quantum limit is observable with state of the art hybrid devices.
