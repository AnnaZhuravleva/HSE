Quantum adiabatic algorithm is of vital importance in quantum computation field. It offers us an alternative approach to manipulate the system instead of quantum gate model. Recently, an interesting work arXiv:1805.10549 indicated that we can solve linear equation system via algorithm inspired by adiabatic quantum computing. Here we demonstrate the algorithm and realize the solution of 8-dimensional linear equations $A\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$ in a 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system. The result is by far the solution of maximum-dimensional linear equation with a limited number of qubits in experiments, which includes some ingenious simplifications. Our experiment provides the new possibility of solving so many practical problems related to linear equations systems and has the potential applications in designing the future quantum algorithms.
