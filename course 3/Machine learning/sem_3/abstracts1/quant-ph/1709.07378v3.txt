We study the nonlinear dynamics of trapped-ion models far away from the Lamb-Dicke regime. This nonlinearity induces a sideband cooling blockade, stopping the propagation of quantum information along the Hilbert space of the Jaynes-Cummings and quantum Rabi models. We compare the linear and nonlinear cases of these models in the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes. Moreover, we propose a scheme that simulates the nonlinear quantum Rabi model in all coupling regimes. This can be done via off-resonant nonlinear red and blue sideband interactions, yielding applications as a dynamical quantum filter.
