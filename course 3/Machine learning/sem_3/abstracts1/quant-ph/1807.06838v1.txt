We study optomechanically induced transparency in a microresonator coupled with nanoparticles. By tuning the relative angle of the nanoparticles, exceptional points (EPs) emerge periodically in this system and thus strongly modify both the transmission rate and the group delay of the signal. As a result, controllable slow-to-fast light switching can be achieved by manipulating external nanoparticles. This provides a new way to engineer EP-assisted optomechanical devices for applications in optical communications and signal processing.
