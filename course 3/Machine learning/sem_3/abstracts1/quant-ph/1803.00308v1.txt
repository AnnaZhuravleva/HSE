Our goal is to provide a new approach to the construction of geometry-induced entanglement between a pair of $\Lambda$ type atoms in a system consists of $N$ identical atoms by means of nonadiabatic quantum holonomies. By employing the quantum Zeno effect, we introduce a tripod type interaction Hamiltonian between two selected atoms trapped in an optical cavity, which allows arbitrary geometric entangling power. This would be a substantial step toward resolving the feasibility of realizing universal nonadiabatic holonomic entangling two-qubit gates.
