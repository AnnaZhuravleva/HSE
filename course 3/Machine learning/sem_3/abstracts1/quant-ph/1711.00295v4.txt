Graph states have been used to construct quantum error correction codes for independent errors. Hypergraph states generalize graph states, and symmetric hypergraph states have been shown to allow for the correction of correlated errors. In this paper, it is shown that symmetric hypergraph states are not useful for the correction of independent errors, at least for up to 30 qubits. Furthermore, error correction for error models with protected qubits is explored. A class of known graph codes for this scenario is generalized to hypergraph codes.
