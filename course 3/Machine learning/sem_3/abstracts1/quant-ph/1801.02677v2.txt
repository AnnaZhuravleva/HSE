We revisit the representation of generalized quantum observables by establishing a geometric picture in terms of their positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). This leads to a clear geometric interpretation of Born's rule by introducing the concept of contravariant operator-valued measures. Our approach is applied to the theory of array detectors, which is a challenging task as the finite dimensionality of the POVM substantially restricts the available information about quantum states. Our geometric technique allows for a direct estimation of expectation values of different observables, which are typically not accessible with such detection schemes. In addition, we also demonstrate the applicability of our method to quantum-state reconstruction with unbalanced homodyne detection.
