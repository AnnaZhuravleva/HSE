Optical control of trapped dielectric objects provides a remarkably simple, yet versatile platform for studying a plethora of intriguing problems in single molecule biophysics, thermodynamics, sensing or fundamental physics. Realizing full quantum control of trapped nanoparticles will enable new insights into quantum-enhanced precision metrology as well as into fundamental aspects of quantum physics. One of the major challenges is to efficiently transduce and manipulate the particle motion at the quantum level. Here we present a nanophotonic platform suited to solve this problem. By optically trapping a 150 nm dielectric particle in the vicinity of the near field of a photonic crystal cavity, at a distance of $\sim310$ nm from its surface, we achieve strong, tunable single-photon optomechanical coupling of up to $g_0/2\pi=9$ kHz, three orders of magnitude larger than previously reported for levitated cavity optomechanical systems. In addition, efficient collection and guiding of light through our nanophotonic structure results in a per-photon displacement sensitivity that is increased by two orders of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art far-field detection. The demonstrated performance shows a promising route for quantum optical control of levitated nanoparticles.
