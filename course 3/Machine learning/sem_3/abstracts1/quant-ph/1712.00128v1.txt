Multi-mode NOON states have been attracting increasing attentions recently for their abilities of obtaining supersensitive and superresolved measurements for simultaneous multiple-phase estimation. In this paper, four different methods of generating multi-mode NOON states with high photon number are proposed. The first method is a linear optical approach that makes use of the Fock state filtration to reduce lower-order Fock state terms from the coherent state inputs, which are jointly combined to produce a multi-mode NOON state with the triggering of single-photon coincidence detections (SPCD) and appropriate postselection. The other three methods (two linear and one nonlinear) use N photon Fock states as the inputs and require SPCD triggering only. All of the four methods can theoretically create a multi-mode NOON state with arbitrary photon number. Comparisons among these four methods were made with respect to the feasibility and efficiency. The first method is experimentally most feasible since it takes considerably fewer photonic operations and, more importantly, requires neither the use of high-N Fock states nor high-degree of nonlinearity.
