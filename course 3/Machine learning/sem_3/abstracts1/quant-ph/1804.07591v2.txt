Geometric phases are noise-resilient, and thus provide a robust way towards high fidelity quantum manipulation. Here we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary non-adiabatic holonomic single-qubit quantum gates for both a superconducting transmon qubit and a microwave cavity in a single-loop way. In both cases, an auxiliary state is utilized, and two resonant microwave drives are simultaneously applied with well-controlled but varying amplitudes and phases for the arbitrariness of the gate. The resulting gates on the transmon qubit achieve a fidelity of 0.996 characterized by randomized benchmarking and the ones on the cavity show an averaged fidelity of 0.978 based on a full quantum process tomography. In principle, a nontrivial two-qubit holonomic gate between the qubit and the cavity can also be realized based on our presented experimental scheme. Our experiment thus paves the way towards practical non-adiabatic holonomic quantum manipulation with both qubits and cavities in a superconducting circuit.
