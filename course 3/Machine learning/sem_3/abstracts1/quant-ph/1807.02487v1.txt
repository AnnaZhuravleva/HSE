Based on a quantum-trajectory approach, we analyze the statistics of heat exchanges during a half-parity measurement that is known to generate entanglement between two distant qubits initially in a product state. We demonstrate that the presence of quantum heat fluctuations constitutes an hallmark of entanglement genesis in this setup. These quantum heat fluctuations are associated with the stochastic disturbance of the measurement on the qubits and have no classical counterpart. To highlight the link with entanglement genesis, we derive lower and upper bounds for the entanglement genesis rate based exclusively on heat fluctuations measurements. {Remarkably, these bounds can then be turned into witnesses to certify the presence of entanglement through the measurement of heat flow and heat fluctuations. We provide an analytic derivation of the witness when considering an average over many realizations and show numerically that our witness also holds in the single-shot regime along a single quantum trajectory.} This work paves the road towards a fundamental understanding of the stochastic thermodynamic processes associated with entanglement genesis, and opens new perspectives for witnessing non-local correlations with the help of thermodynamic quantities.
