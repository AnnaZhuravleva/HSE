We develop a systematic method of solving two noninteracting Jaynes-Cummings models by using the dressed state formalism in Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{AB}^{(2\otimes2)}$. It is shown that such model, called Double Jaynes-Cummings model (D-JCM), is exactly solved if we take the initial bare state as the linear superposition of two Bell states. The collapse and revival oscillation, which is the characteristic trait of typical Jaynes-Cummings model, can be recovered if we make measurement at each local site. Possible consequences of studying the entanglement-induced cavity QED are discussed.
