We demonstrate a robust, scale-factor-free vector magnetometer, which uses a closed-loop frequency-locking scheme to simultaneously track Zeeman-split resonance pairs of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Compared with open-loop methodologies, this technique is robust against fluctuations in temperature, resonance linewidth, and contrast; offers a three-order-of-magnitude increase in dynamic range; and allows for simultaneous interrogation of multiple transition frequencies. By directly detecting the resonance frequencies of NV centers aligned along each of the diamond's four tetrahedral crystallographic axes, we perform full vector reconstruction of an applied magnetic field.
