We demonstrate on chip generation of correlated pairs of photons in the near-visible spectrum using a CMOS compatible PECVD Silicon Nitride photonic device. Photons are generated via spontaneous four wave mixing enhanced by a ring resonator with high quality Q-factor of 320,000 resulting in a generation rate of 950,000 $\frac{pairs}{mW}$. The high brightness of this source offers the opportunity to expand photonic quantum technologies over a broad wavelength range and provides a path to develop fully integrated quantum chips working at room temperature.
