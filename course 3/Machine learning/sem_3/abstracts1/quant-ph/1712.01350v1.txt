Quantum Fourier transformation is important in many quantum algorithms. In this paper, we generalize quantum Fourier transformation over the Abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_N$ from two different points to get more efficient unitary transformations. The obtained unitary transformations are given in concise and explicit formula which can be used directly. A relationship between the generalized quantum Fourier transformation and the dihedral hidden subgroup problem are discussed in this paper. This may lead a way to solve the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. The second goal of this paper is to give an explicit formula of quantum Haar transformation.
