We show that 2D fractal subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases may serve as resources for universal measurement-based quantum computation. This is demonstrated explicitly for two cluster models known to lie within fractal symmetry-protected topological phases, and computational universality is shown to persist throughout those phases. One of the models considered is simply the cluster model on the honeycomb lattice in one limit. We discuss the importance of rigid subsystem symmetries, as opposed to global or $(\text{D}-1)$-form symmetries, in this context.
