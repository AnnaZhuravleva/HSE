We describe an approach to fix the gauge degrees of freedom in tensor networks, including those with closed loops, which allows a canonical form for arbitrary tensor networks to be realized. Additionally, a measure for the internal correlations present in a tensor network is proposed, which quantifies the extent of resonances around closed loops in the network. Finally we describe an algorithm for the optimal truncation of an internal index from a tensor network, based upon proper removal of the redundant internal correlations. These results, which offer a unified theoretical framework for the manipulation of tensor networks with closed loops, can be applied to improve existing tensor network methods for the study of many-body systems and may also constitute key algorithmic components of sophisticated new tensor methods.
