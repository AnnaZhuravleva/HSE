We consider a simple cavity optomechanics and study the ground-state cooling of mechanical resonator in the quantum regime. Using the effective master equations in the linear regime, the motion equations can be obtained for the second order moments. The steady state solutions are derived in the case where the antiresonant terms are ignored. The final mean value of phonon number is compared the case where the antiresonant terms are included. We find that the ground-state cooling in the last case is improved. Indeed, the inclusion of the antiresonant terms leads the system to generate a squeezed field, which is required for enhancing cooling. The variances of the resultant field are presented. Analytic calculations are presented in some appropriate regimes. Then our analytic predictions are confirmed with numerical calculations.
