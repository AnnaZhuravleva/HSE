We give a derivation for the indirect interaction between two magnetic dipoles induced by the quantized electromagnetic field. It turns out that the interaction between permanent dipoles directly returns to the classical form; the interaction between transition dipoles does not directly return to the classical result, yet returns in the short-distance limit. In a finite volume, the field modes are highly discrete, and both the permanent and transition dipole-dipole interactions are changed. For transition dipoles, the changing mechanism is similar with the Purcell effect, since only a few number of nearly resonant modes take effect in the interaction mediation; for permanent dipoles, the correction comes from the boundary effect: if the dipoles are placed close to the boundary, the influence is strong, otherwise, their interaction does not change too much from the free space case.
