The coarse-graining approach to deriving the quantum Markovian master equation is revisited, with close attention given to the underlying approximations. It is further argued that the time interval over which the coarse-graining is performed is a free parameter that can be given a physical measurement-based interpretation. In the case of the damping of composite systems to reservoirs of different temperatures, currently of much interest in the study of quantum thermal machines with regard to the validity of `local' and `global' forms of these equations, the coupling of the subsystems leads to a further timescale with respect to which the coarse-graining time interval can be chosen. Different choices lead to different master equations that correspond to the local and global forms. These can be then understood as having different physical interpretations based on the role of the coarse-graining, as well as different limitations in application.
