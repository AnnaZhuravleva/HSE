In this paper, we investigate the dynamics behaviors of genuine multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering (GMS) and genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMN), and explore how to recover the lost GMS and GMN under a mixed decoherence system. Explicitly, the decoherence system can be modeled by that a tripartite Werner-type state suffers from the non-Markovian regimes and one subsystem of the tripartite is under a non-inertial frame. The conditions for steerable and nonlocal states can be obtained with respect to the tripartite Werner-type state established initially. GMS and GMN are very fragile and vulnerable under the influence of the collective decoherence. GMS and GMN will vanish with growing intensity of the Unruh effect and the non-Markovian reservoir. Besides, all achievable GMN's states are steerable, while not every steerable state (GMS's state) can achieve nonlocality. It means that the steering-nonlocality hierarchy is still tenable and GMN's states are a strict subset of the GMS's states in such a scenario. Subsequently, we put forward an available methodology to recover the damaged GMS and GMN. It turns out that the lost GMS and GMN can be effectively restored, and the ability of GMS and GMN to suppress the collective decoherence can be enhanced.
