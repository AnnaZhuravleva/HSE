We explore the possibility of detecting entangled photon pairs from cosmic microwave background or other cosmological sources coming from two patches of the sky. The measurements use two detectors with different photon polarizer directions. When two photon sources are separated by a large angle relative to the earth, such that each detector has only one photon source in its field of view, the signal for entanglement can be separated from the background by changing the polarizer directions. When the angle between two photon sources is small enough such that both sources are in the fields of view of both detectors, then the background becomes more complicated which makes it more difficult to be subtracted.
