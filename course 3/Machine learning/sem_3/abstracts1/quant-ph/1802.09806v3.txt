The constraint relation for efficiency and power is crucial to design optimal heat engines operating within finite time. We find a universal constraint between efficiency and output power for heat engines in low-dissipation region with a phenomenological model. Such constraint is validated with an example of Carnot-like engine. Its microscopic dynamics is governed by the master equation. Based on the master equation, we connect the microscopic coupling strengths to the generic parameters in the phenomenological model. We find the usual assumption of low-dissipation is achieved with strong coupling to thermal environments. Additionally, such connection allows the design of practical cycle to optimize the engine performance.
