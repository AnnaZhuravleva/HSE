Quantum mechanics allows for a consistent formulation of particles that are neither bosons nor fermions. These para-particles are rather indiscernible in nature. Recently, we showed that strong coupling between a qubit and two field modes is required to simulate even order para-Bose oscillators. Here, we show that finite-dimensional representations of even order para-Fermi oscillators are feasible of quantum simulation under weak coupling, allowing their simulation in all contemporaneous quantum electrodynamics platforms. We emphasize the intrinsic value of para-particles for the quantum state engineering of bichromatic field modes. In particular, we demonstrate that binomial two field mode states result from the evolution of para-Fermi vacuum states in the quantum simulation of these oscillators.
