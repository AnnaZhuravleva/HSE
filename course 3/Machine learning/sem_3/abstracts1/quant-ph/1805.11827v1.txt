Linear optics has seen a resurgence for applications in quantum information processing owing to its miniaturisation on-chip, and increase in production efficiency and quality of single photons. Time-bin encodings have also become feasible owing to architectural breakthroughs, and new processing capabilities. Theoretical efforts have found new ways to implement universal quantum computations with linear optics requiring less resources, and to demonstrate the capabilities of linear optics without requiring a universal optical quantum computer.
