Quantum speed limits set an upper bound to the rate at which a quantum system can evolve. Adopting a phase-space approach we explore quantum speed limits across the quantum to classical transition and identify equivalent bounds in the classical world. As a result, and contrary to common belief, we show that speed limits exist for both quantum and classical systems. As in the quantum domain, classical speed limits are set by a given norm of the generator of time evolution.
