We present a protocol to study scrambling using statistical correlations between measurements, performed after evolving a quantum system from random initial states. We show that the resulting statistical correlations are directly related to OTOCs and can be used to probe scrambling in many-body systems. Our protocol, which does not require reversing time evolution or auxiliary degrees of freedom, can be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments.
