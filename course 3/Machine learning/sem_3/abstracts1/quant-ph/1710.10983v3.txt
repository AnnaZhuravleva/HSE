Long time behavior of a unitary quantum gate $U$, acting sequentially on two subsystems of dimension $N$ each, is investigated. We derive an expression describing an arbitrary iteration of a two-qubit gate making use of a link to the dynamics of a free particle in a $3D$ billiard. Due to ergodicity of such a dynamics an average along a trajectory $V^t$ stemming from a generic two-qubit gate $V$ in the canonical form tends for a large $t$ to the average over an ensemble of random unitary gates distributed according to the flat measure in the Weyl chamber - the minimal $3D$ set containing points from all orbits of locally equivalent gates. Furthermore, we show that for a large dimension $N$ the mean entanglement entropy averaged along a generic trajectory coincides with the average over the ensemble of random unitary matrices distributed according to the Haar measure on $U(N^2)$.
