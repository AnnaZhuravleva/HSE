We compare discrete-time quantum walks on graphs to their natural classical equivalents, which we argue are lifted Markov chains, that is, classical Markov chains with added memory. We show that these can simulate quantum walks, allowing us to answer an open question on how the graph topology ultimately bounds their mixing performance, and that of any stochastic local evolution. The results highlight that speedups in mixing and transport phenomena are not necessarily diagnostic of quantum effects, although superdiffusive spreading is more prominent with quantum walks.
