Levitated optomechanical systems, and particularly particles trapped in vacuum, provide unique platforms for studying the mechanical behavior of objects well-isolated from their environment. Ultimately, such systems may enable the study of fundamental questions in quantum mechanics, gravity, and other weak forces. While the optical trapping of nanoparticles has emerged as the prototypical levitated optomechanical system, it is not without problems due to the heating from the high optical intensity required, particularly when combined with a high vacuum environment. Here we investigate a magneto-gravitational trap in ultra-high vacuum. In contrast to optical trapping, we create an entirely passive trap for diamagnetic particles by utilizing the magnetic field generated by permanent magnets and the gravitational interaction. We demonstrate cooling the center of mass motion of a trapped silica microsphere from ambient temperature to an effective temperature near or below one milliKelvin in two degrees of freedom by optical feedback damping.
