Quantum steering means that in some bipartite quantum systems, the local measurements on one side can determine the state of the other side. Here we show that in high-dimensional systems, there exists a specific entangled state which can display a kind of chaos effect when being adopted for steering. That is, a subtle difference in the measurement results on one side can steer the other side into completely orthogonal states. Moreover, by expanding the result to infinite-dimensional systems, we find two sets of states for which, contrary to common belief, even though their density matrices approach being identical, the steering between them is impossible. This property makes them very useful for quantum cryptography.
