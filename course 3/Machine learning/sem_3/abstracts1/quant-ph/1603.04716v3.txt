In this paper, we study the concurrence of arbitrary dimensional tripartite quantum systems. An explicit operational lower bound of concurrence is obtained in terms of the concurrence of sub-states. A given example show that our lower bound may improve the well known existing lower bounds of concurrence. The significance of our result is to get a lower bound when we study the concurrence of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum systems.
