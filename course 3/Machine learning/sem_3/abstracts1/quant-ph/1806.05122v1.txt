We propose a protocol for state transfer and entanglement generation between two distant spin qubits (sender and receiver) that have different energies. The two qubits are permanently coupled to a far off-resonant spin-chain, and the qubit of the sender is driven by an external field, which provides the energy required to bridge the energy gap between the sender and the receiver. State transfer and entanglement generation are achieved via virtual single-photon and multi-photon transitions to the eigenmodes of the channel.
