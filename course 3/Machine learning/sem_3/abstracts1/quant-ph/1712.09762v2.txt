We investigate novel protocols for entanglement purification of qubit Bell pairs. Employing discrete optimization algorithms for the design of the purification circuit, we obtain shorter circuits achieving higher success rates and better final fidelities than what is currently available in the literature. We provide a software tool for analytical and numerical study of the generated purification circuits, under customizable error models. These new purification protocols pave the way to practical implementations of modular quantum computers and quantum repeaters. Our approach is particularly attentive to the effects of finite resources and imperfect local operations - phenomena neglected in the usual asymptotic approach to the problem.
