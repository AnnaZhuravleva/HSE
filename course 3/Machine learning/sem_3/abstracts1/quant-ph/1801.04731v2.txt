In this article we derive several upper bounds on the quantum capacity of qubit and bosonic thermal attenuators, commonly employed to model the effect of loss and thermal noise in real physical systems and communication processes. We introduce an extended version of such channels which is degradable and hence has a single-letter quantum capacity; the latter is an upper bound for the capacity of the original thermal attenuator channels that is tight in the limit of low thermal noise. For bosonic attenuators we also introduce a further bound based on the bottleneck inequality applied to a particular channel decomposition. With respect to previously known bounds we report better results in a broad range of attenuation and noise values, both for qubit and bosonic attenuators. Even if the exact quantum capacity of thermal attenuators is still unknown, we can approximate it up to an uncertainty which is negligible for most practical applications.
