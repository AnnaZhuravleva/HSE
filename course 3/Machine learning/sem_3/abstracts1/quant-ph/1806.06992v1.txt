We propose an electromechanical scheme where the electronic degree of freedom of an embedded color center is coupled to the motion of the hosting resonator via dispersive forces. The localized emitters on a free-standing two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride membrane are considered and studied, specifically. We show that the coupling of membrane vibrations to the electronic degree of freedom of the emitter can reach the strong regime. By suitable driving of a three-level $\Lambda$-system composed of two spin degrees of freedom in the electronic ground state as well as an isolated excited state of the emitter a multiple electromagnetically induced transparency spectrum becomes available. The experimental feasibility of the efficient vibrational ground state cooling of the membrane via quantum interference effects in the two-color drive scheme is numerically confirmed. More interestingly, the emission spectrum of the defect exhibits a frequency comb with frequency spacings as small as the fundamental vibrational mode, which finds applications in high-precision spectroscopy.
