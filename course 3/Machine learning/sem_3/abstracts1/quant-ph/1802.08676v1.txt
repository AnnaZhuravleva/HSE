Wireless Multihop Networks (WMHNs) have to strike a trade-off among diverse and often conflicting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. The resultant solutions may be included by the Pareto Front under the concept of Pareto Optimality. However, the problem of finding all the Pareto-optimal routes in WMHNs is classified as NP-hard, since the number of legitimate routes increases exponentially, as the nodes proliferate. Quantum Computing offers an attractive framework of rendering the Pareto-optimal routing problem tractable. In this context, a pair of quantum-assisted algorithms have been proposed, namely the Non-Dominated Quantum Optimization (NDQO) and the Non-Dominated Quantum Iterative Optimization (NDQIO). However, their complexity is proportional to $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ corresponds to the total number of legitimate routes, thus still failing to find the solutions in "polynomial time". As a remedy, we devise a dynamic programming framework and propose the so-called Evolutionary Quantum Pareto Optimization (EQPO) algorithm. We analytically characterize the complexity imposed by the EQPO algorithm and demonstrate that it succeeds in solving the Pareto-optimal routing problem in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate by simulations that the EQPO algorithm achieves a complexity reduction, which is at least an order of magnitude, when compared to its predecessors, albeit at the cost of a modest heuristic accuracy reduction.
