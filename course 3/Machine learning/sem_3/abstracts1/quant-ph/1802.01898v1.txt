This paper critically discusses an objection proposed by H. Nikolic against the naturalness of the stochastic dynamics implemented by the Bell-type Quantum Field Theory, an extension of Bohmian Mechanics able to describe the phenomena of particles creation and annihilation. Here I present: (i) Nikolic's ideas for a pilot-wave theory accounting for QFT phenomenology evaluating the robustness of his criticism, (ii) Bell's original proposal for a Bohmian QFT with a particle ontology and (iii) the mentioned Bell-type QFT. I will argue that although Bell's model should be interpreted as a heuristic example showing the possibility to extend Bohm's pilot- wave theory to the domain of QFT, the same judgement does not hold for the Bell-type QFT, which is candidate to be a promising possible alternative proposal to the standard version of quantum field theory. Finally, contra Nikolic, I will provide arguments in order to show how a stochastic dynamics is perfectly compatible with a Bohmian quantum theory.
