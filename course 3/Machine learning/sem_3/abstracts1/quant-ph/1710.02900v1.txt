We present in this work an analysis of the damage imposed by the atom on the field state inside a lossy superconducting cavity. To access such effects, we propose two procedures to preserve a qubit of the decay effects of an imperfect quantum memory: the first by means of an quasi-instantaneous phase kick applied in the atom, and the second by means of controlled resonant and dispersive interactions. We immediately demonstrate that, in both procedures, the dwell time of the qubit in the cavity increases significantly, being expressively higher for the second. A relation between the inaccuracy of the preparation of the atomic beam and the quality of the cavity arises naturally from our calculations for each procedure. This result is unprecedented, and sets out the rules to increase the dwell time of the qubit.
