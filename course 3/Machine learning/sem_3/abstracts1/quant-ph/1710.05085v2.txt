The rules of canonical quantization normally offer good results, but sometimes they fail, e.g., leading to quantum triviality ($=$ free) for certain examples that are classically nontrivial ($\ne$ free). A new procedure, called Enhanced Quantization, relates classical models with their quantum partners differently and leads to satisfactory results for all systems. This paper features enhanced quantization procedures and provides highlights of two examples, a rotationally symmetric model and an ultralocal scalar model, for which canonical quantization fails while enhanced quantization succeeds.
