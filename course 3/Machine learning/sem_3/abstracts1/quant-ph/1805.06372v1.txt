In this work we use the gravitational quantum well to model an effective two level system and perform two thermodynamic cycles, the iso-gravitational and the iso-energetic ones. It is shown that the iso-gravitational is independent of a scale parameter whereas the iso-energetic has a dependence on the eigenstates chosen to form the cycle. We also obtain an equivalent equation for the iso-energetic cycle which is similar to the equation of state for an isothermal process of an ideal gas. This equation reinforces the concept of an energy bath, where the temperature is replaced by the energy into the expression of efficiency.
