Twirling is a technique widely used for converting arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels in error threshold estimations of quantum error correction codes. Conventional twirling uses the full set of Pauli gates as the set of twirling gates. When we want to apply twirling in real experiments or classical quantum simulations, we might wish to minimise the size of the twirling gate set due to the challenges of gate implementations or to have fewer experimental or simulation runs. This article provides a theoretical background for Pauli twirling and a way to construct a twirling gate set with a number of members comparable to the size of the Pauli basis of the given error channel, which is usually much smaller than the full set of Pauli gates. We also show that twirling is equivalent to stabiliser measurements with discarded measurement results, which enables us to further reduce the size of the twirling gate set.
