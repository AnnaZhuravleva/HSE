Quantum communication (QC) concerns the faithful transmission of quantum states between separated parties, and represents a key enabler for many quantum applications, ranging from quantum key distribution (QKD) to distributed quantum computing. However, low information rates and short propagation distances, due to high channel losses and perturbations of the quantum states, limit the development of this field and its practical applications. High-dimensional (Hi-D) quantum communication can address these challenges by adding more information per photon, directly enhancing the information rate and the system's error tolerance. We transmit Hi-D quantum states using photons prepared in four orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in a 1.2 km long OAM-carrying fiber. This is the first experimental demonstration of Hi-D quantum states transmission using the OAM basis over an optical fiber. Furthermore, we successfully implement a real-time decoy-state Hi-D QKD protocol, and demonstrate the highest secret key rate and longest transmission distance of OAM-QKD presented to date.
