Twin-field (TF) quantum key distribution (QKD) was proposed as a scheme that could beat the private capacity of a point-to-point optical QKD link by using single-photon interference in a middle repeater node. This remarkable result has recently triggered an intense research activity to prove its security. Here, we introduce a TF-type QKD protocol which is conceptually simpler than the original proposal. It relies on local phase randomization, instead of global phase randomization, which significantly simplifies its security analysis and is arguably less demanding experimentally. We demonstrate that the secure key rate of our protocol has a square-root improvement over the point-to-point private capacity, as conjectured by the original TF-QKD scheme.
