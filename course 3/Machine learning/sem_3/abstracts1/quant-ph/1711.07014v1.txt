In this paper, we propose a scheme of a long-lived broadband superefficient multiresonator quantum memory in which a common resonator is connected with an external waveguide and with a system of high-quality miniresonators containing long-lived resonant electron spin ensembles. The scheme with 4 miniresonators has been analyzed in details and it was shown that it is possible to store an input broadband signal field to the electron spin ensembles with quantum efficiency 99.99%. The considered multiresonator system opens the way to elaboration of efficient multiqubit quantum memory devices for superconducting quantum computer.
