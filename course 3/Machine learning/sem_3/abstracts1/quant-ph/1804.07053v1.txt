We present a full operator approach to treatment of the cross-Kerr interaction combined with parametric amplification. It is shown that this problem can be exactly integrated using the method of higher-order operators. While the initial basis is infinite-dimensional, an orthogonal transformation can reduce the problem exactly into a six-dimensional basis which can be integrated conveniently.
