Topological- and strongly-correlated- materials are exciting frontiers in condensed matter physics, married prominently in studies of the fractional quantum hall effect [1]. There is an active effort to develop synthetic materials where the microscopic dynamics and ordering arising from the interplay of topology and interaction may be directly explored. In this work we demonstrate a novel architecture for exploration of topological matter constructed from tunnel-coupled, time-reversalbroken microwave cavities that are both low loss and compatible with Josephson junction-mediated interactions [2]. Following our proposed protocol [3] we implement a square lattice Hofstadter model at a quarter flux per plaquette ({\alpha} = 1/4), with time-reversal symmetry broken through the chiral Wannier-orbital of resonators coupled to Yttrium-Iron-Garnet spheres. We demonstrate site-resolved spectroscopy of the lattice, time-resolved dynamics of its edge channels, and a direct measurement of the dispersion of the edge channels. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of the approach by erecting a tunnel barrier investigating dynamics across it. With the introduction of Josephson-junctions to mediate interactions between photons, this platform is poised to explore strongly correlated topological quantum science for the first time in a synthetic system.
