In this paper, a novel protocol for bidirectional controlled quantum teleportation (BCQT) using eight-qubit entangled state as a quantum channel is proposed by which the users can teleport an arbitrary entangled state and a pure two-qubit state to each other simultaneously under permission of a third party as a controller. This protocol is based on the controlled-not operation, appropriate single-qubit unitary operations and single-qubit measurements in the Z and X basis which are more efficient than two-qubit measurements. In addition, in this protocol, the probability of guessing Charlie's qubit by eavesdropper is reduced and supervisor can select the control of one of the users or both. Also, the proposed protocol is optimal in terms of used quantum resources, the efficiency and the number of measurements into previous ones. Then, we review the proposed protocol in typical noisy channels including the amplitude-damping and the phase-damping noises. We analytically derive the fidelities of the BCQT process and show that they only depend on the amplitude parameter of the initial state and the decoherence noisy rate.
