Entanglement of three photons from the decay of ortho-positronium is re-analyzed. We use the full three body phase space to write down the entangled states classified according to the spin directions of the ortho-positronium. Even in the case when the spin is perpendicular to the decay plane, we find non-negligible phases entering the entangled state. This has not been noticed before. We advocate a fixed quantization axis of the spin for the sake of generality. A brief discussion of a three dimensional formalism for photons, including correlations, versus a two dimensional one is given.
