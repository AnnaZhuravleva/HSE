This paper demonstrates the use of entanglement resources in quantum speedup by presenting an algorithm which is the generalization of an algorithm proposed by Goswami and Panigrahi [arXiv:1706.09489 (2017)]. We generalize the algorithm and show that it provides deterministic solutions having an advantage over classical algorithm. The algorithm answers the question of whether a given function is constant or balanced and whether two functions are equal or unequal. Finally, we experimentally verify the algorithm by using IBM's five-qubit quantum computer with a high fidelity.
