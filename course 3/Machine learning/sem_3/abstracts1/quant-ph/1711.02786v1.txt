A Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) can create squeezed states of microwave light, lowering the noise associated with certain quantum measurements. We experimentally study how the JPA's pump influences the phase-sensitive amplification and deamplification of a coherent tone's amplitude when that amplitude is commensurate with vacuum fluctuations. We predict and demonstrate that by operating the JPA with a pump power greater than the value that maximizes gain, the amplifier distortion is reduced and consequently squeezing is improved. Optimizing the JPA's operation in this fashion, we directly observe $3.87 \pm 0.03$ dB of vacuum squeezing.
