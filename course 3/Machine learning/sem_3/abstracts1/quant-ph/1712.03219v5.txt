We show that a sequence $\{\Phi_n\}$ of quantum channels strongly converges to a quantum channel $\Phi_0$ if and only if there exist a common environment for all the channels and a corresponding sequence $\{V_n\}$ of Stinespring isometries strongly converging to a Stinespring isometry $V_0$ of the channel $\Phi_0$.   We also give quantitative description of the above characterization of the strong convergence in terms of the appropriate metrics on the sets of quantum channels and Stinespring isometries. As a result the uniform continuity of the complementary operation with respect to the strong convergence topology is established.   We show discontinuity of the unitary dilation by constructing a strongly converging sequence of channels which can not be represented as a reduction of a strongly converging sequence of unitary channels.   The above results are used to prove the lower semicontinuity of the entropic disturbance as a function of a pair (channel, input ensemble) w.r.t. the strong convergence of channels and the weak convergence of ensembles. Some corollaries of this property are considered.
