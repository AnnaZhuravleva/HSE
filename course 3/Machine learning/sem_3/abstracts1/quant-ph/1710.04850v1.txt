We address two-level systems arranged in ring configurations affected by static disorder. In particular we investigate the role of dephasing in the transport of an excitation along the ring. We compare the efficiency of the transfer process on isotropic rings and on biomimetic rings modelled according to the structure of light-harvesting complexes. Our analysis provides a simple but clear and interesting example of how an interplay between the coherent dynamics of the system and the incoherent action of the environment can enhance the transfer capabilities of disordered lattices.
