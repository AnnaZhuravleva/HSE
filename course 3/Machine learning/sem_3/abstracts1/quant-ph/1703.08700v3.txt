We establish the equivalence between the loss of coherence due to mixing in a quantum system and the loss of information after performing a projective measurement. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the quantum discord, a measure of correlation for the bipartite system $\rho_{Alice\leftarrow Bob}$, is identical to the minimum difference (over all projectors {|i><i|}) between local coherence (LQICC monotone) on Bob side and coherence of the reduced density matrix $\rho^B$.
