In every experimental test of a Bell inequality, we are faced with the problem of inefficient detectors. How we treat the events when no particle was detected has a big influence on the properties of the inequality. In this work, we study this influence. We show that the choice of post-processing can change the critical detection efficiency, the equivalence between different inequalities or the applicability of the non-signaling principle. We also consider the problem of choosing the optimal post-processing strategy. We show that this is a non-trivial problem and that different strategies are optimal for different ranges of detector efficiencies.
