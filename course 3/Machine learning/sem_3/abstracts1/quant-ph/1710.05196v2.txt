It is well known that Grover's algorithm asymptotically transforms an equal superposition state into an eigenstate (of a given basis). Here, we demonstrate a verification algorithm based on weak measurement which can achieve the same purpose even if the qubit is not in an equal superposition state. The proposed algorithm highlights the distinguishability between any arbitrary single qubit superposition state and an eigenstate. We apply this algorithm to propose the scheme of a Quantum Locker, a protocol in which any legitimate party can verify his/her authenticity by using a newly developed quantum One-Time Password (OTP) and retrieve the necessary message from the locker. We formally explicate the working of quantum locker in association with the quantum OTP, which theoretically offers a much higher security against any adversary, as compared to any classical security device.
