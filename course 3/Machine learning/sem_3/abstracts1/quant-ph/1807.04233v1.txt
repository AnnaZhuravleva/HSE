Over the last three decades, quantum key distribution (QKD) has been intensively studied for the unconditional security in quantum cryptography satisfied by quantum mechanics. Due to the limitations of deterministic single photon generations and quantum repeaters, however, the progress of QKD is still far behind from commercial implementations. Moreover, imperfect measurement is the major loophole of the unconditional security in practice. Here, a measurement-immune QKD is presented by using coherence optics in a phase-controlled double Mach Zehnder interferometer (MZI) compatible to the current fiber-optic networks to overcome the limitations of current QKDs, where the unconditional security is provided by indistinguishability between two superposed paths of MZI. The proposed measurement-immune QKD is sustained for both quantum and coherent lights and robust to noisy environments owing to the directional determinacy in the MZI regardless of light instability in both intensity and phase.
