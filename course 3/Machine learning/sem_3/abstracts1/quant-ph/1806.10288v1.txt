We report on an optimal binary strategy for angular displacement estimation. The measurement system is a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a coherent state input carrying orbital angular momentum, and two Dove prisms are embedded in two paths. Parity detection and Z detection are discussed in terms of the fidelity evaluation, and the optimal estimation strategy is presented. We additionally study the effects of several realistic scenarios on the fidelity, such as transmission loss, detection efficiency and dark counts. Finally, we exhibit a proof of principle experiment and perform Bayesian estimation on data processing. The experimental results imply a factor of 1.86 enhancement suggesting super-resolving signal. Meanwhile, on the trial greater than 500, we show that the angular displacement can be precisely estimated via acquired outcome information.
