Randomness is critical for many information processing applications, including numerical modeling and cryptography. Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) based on the loophole free violation of Bell inequality produces unpredictable genuine randomness without any device assumption and is therefore an ultimate goal in the field of quantum information science. However, due to formidable technical challenges, there were very few reported experimental studies of DIQRNG, which were vulnerable to the adversaries. Here we present a fully functional DIQRNG against the most general quantum adversaries. We construct a robust experimental platform that realizes Bell inequality violation with entangled photons with detection and locality loopholes closed simultaneously. This platform enables a continuous recording of a large volume of data sufficient for security analysis against the general quantum side information and without assuming independent and identical distribution. Lastly, by developing a large Toeplitz matrix (137.90 Gb $\times$ 62.469 Mb) hashing technique, we demonstrate that this DIQRNG generates $6.2469\times 10^7$ quantum-certified random bits in 96 hours (or 181 bits/s) with uniformity within $10^{-5}$. We anticipate this DIQRNG may have profound impact on the research of quantum randomness and information-secured applications.
