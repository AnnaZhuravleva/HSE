We propose a framework for the connection between local symmetries of discrete Hamiltonians and the design of compact localized states. Such compact localized states are used for the creation of tunable, local symmetry-induced bound states in an energy continuum and flat energy bands for periodically repeated local symmetries in one- and two-dimensional lattices. The framework is based on very recent theorems in graph theory which are here employed to obtain a block partitioning of the Hamiltonian induced by the symmetry of a given system under local site permutations. The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is thereby reduced to finding the eigenspectra of smaller matrices, with eigenvectors automatically divided into compact localized and extended states. We distinguish between local symmetry operations which commute with the Hamiltonian, and those which do not commute due to an asymmetric coupling to the surrounding sites. While valuable as a computational tool for versatile discrete systems with locally symmetric structures, the approach provides in particular a unified, intuitive, and efficient route to the flexible design of compact localized states at desired energies.
