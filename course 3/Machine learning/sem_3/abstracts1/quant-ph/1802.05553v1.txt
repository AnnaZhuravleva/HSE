Under paraxial propagation, light in bulk nonlinear media in known to behave as a quantum fluid, described by a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation formally equivalent to the Gross-Pitaevskii model of a weakly interacting Bose gas. Photon-photon interactions, mediated by third order optical nonlinearities, are at the origin of superfluidity and other quantum-like phenomena. Here, we develop an optical hydrodynamic theory to describe the onset of a kinetic instability when two fluids of light with different flow speeds interact via the optical nonlinearity. The experimental observation of such effects is also discussed in detail. The class of instabilities described here may provide a route towards the investigation of quantum turbulence, structure formation and general many-body and out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the quantum superfluid regime.
