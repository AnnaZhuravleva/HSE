The near-critical unitary dynamics of quantum Ising spin chains in transversal and longitudinal magnetic fields is studied using an artificial neural network representation of the wave function. A focus is set on strong spatial correlations which build up in the system following a quench into the vicinity of the quantum critical point. We compare correlations observed following reinforcement learning of the network states with analytical solutions in integrable cases and tDMRG simulations, as well as with predictions from a semi-classical discrete Truncated Wigner analysis. While the semi-classical approach excells mainly at short times and for small transverse fields, the neural-network representation provides accurate results for a much wider range of parameters. Where long-range spin-spin correlations build up in the long-time dynamics we find qualitative agreement with exact results while quantitative deviations are of similar size as for the semi-classically predicted correlations, and slow convergence is observed when increasing the number of hidden neurons.
