In the paper it is shown that the Kochen-Specker theorem follows from Burnside's theorem on noncommutative algebras. Accordingly, contextuality (as an impossibility of assigning binary values to projection operators independently of their contexts) is merely an inference from Burnside's fundamental theorem of the algebra of linear transformations on a Hilbert space of finite dimension.
