We investigate quantum teleportation of ensembles of coherent states of light with a Gaussian distributed displacement in phase space. Recently, the following general question has been addressed in [P. Liuzzo-Scorpo et al., arXiv:1705.03017]: Given a limited amount of entanglement and mean energy available as resources, what is the maximal fidelity that can be achieved on average in the teleportation of such an alphabet of states? Here, we consider a variation of this question, where Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is used as a resource rather than plain entanglement. We provide a solution by means of an optimisation within the space of Gaussian quantum channels, which allows for an intuitive visualisation of the problem. We first show that not all channels are accessible with a finite degree of steering, and then prove that practical schemes relying on asymmetric two-mode Gaussian states enable one to reach the maximal fidelity at the border with the inaccessible region. Our results provide a rigorous quantitative assessment of steering as a resource for secure quantum teleportation beyond the so-called no-cloning threshold. The schemes we propose can be readily implemented experimentally by a conventional Braunstein-Kimble continuous variable teleportation protocol involving homodyne detections and corrective displacements with an optimally tuned gain. These protocols can be integrated as elementary building blocks in quantum networks, for reliable storage and transmission of quantum optical states.
