In a recent work, Murmann {\it et. al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf114}, 080402 (2015)] have experimentally prepared and manipulated a double-well optical potential containing a pair of Fermi atoms as a possible building block of Hubbard model. Here, we carry out a comparative theoretical study on fermionic vs. bosonic two-site Hubbard models with a pair of interacting atoms in a double-well potential. The fermionic atoms are considered to be of two-component type. We show that, given the same input parameters for both bosonic and fermionic two-site Hubbard models, many of the statistical properties such as the single- and double-occupancy of a site, and the probabilities for the single-particle and pair tunneling are similar in both cases. But, the fluctuation quantities such as number and phase fluctuations are markedly different for the two cases. We treat the bosonic and fermionic phase variables in terms of the quantum mechanical phase operators of bosonic and fermionic matter-waves, respectively. Furthermore, we examine whether it is possible to account for the Feshbach-resonant atom-atom interactions into the models through the finite-ranged model interaction potentials of Jost and Kohn.
