The gaps separating two different states widely exist in various physical systems: from the electrons in periodic lattices to the analogs in photonic, phononic, and plasmonic systems even the quasi-crystals. Recently, a thermalization gap was proposed for light in disordered structures, which is intrinsically induced by the disorder-immune chiral symmetry and can be reflected by the photon statistics. The lattice topology was further identified a decisive role in determining the photon statistics when the chiral symmetry is satisfied. Being very distinct with one-dimensional lattices, the photon statistics in ring lattices are dictated by its parity, i.e. odd- or even-sited. Here, we for the first time experimentally observe the parity-induced thermalization gap in strongly disordered ring photonic structures. In limited scale, though the light tends to be localized, we are still able to find clear evidences of the parity-dependent disorder-immune chiral symmetry and the resulted thermalization gap by measuring photon statistics, while strong disorder-induced Anderson localization overwhelm such phenomenon in larger-scale structure. Our results shed new light on the relation among symmetry, disorder and localization, and may inspire new resources and artificial devices for information processing and quantum control on a photonic chip.
