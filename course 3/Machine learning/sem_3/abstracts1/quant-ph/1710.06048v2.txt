We propose a condition for a measure of quantum correlation to be polygamous without the traditional polygamy inequality. It is shown to be equivalent to the standard polygamy inequalities for any continuous measure of quantum correlation with the polygamy power. We then show that any entanglement of assistance is polygamous but not monogamous and any faithful entanglement measure is not polygamous.
