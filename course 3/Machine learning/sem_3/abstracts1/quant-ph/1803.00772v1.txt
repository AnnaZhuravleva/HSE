The quantum mechanical states of the neutral particle endowed with a magnetic moment in the combination of electromagnetic vortex field together with the constant magnetic field are dealt with. It is shown that this system of fields is capable to capture the particle in the perpendicular direction and guide it along the propagating wave. The quantum evolution is subject to tunneling processes, which can destroy the delicate trapping mechanism. The probability of these processes show that it should be in principle possible to catch and guide the particle for the time of several microseconds. This time can be lengthened by the appropriate adjustments of the external magnetic field.
