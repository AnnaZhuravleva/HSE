The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for a generalized quantum dissipative system is rigorously constructed in the frameworks of two different stochastic dynamical descriptions, i.e., the non-Markovian quantum state diffusion approach as well as the stochastic decoupling scheme. We demonstrated that the HEOMs obtained by these two different stochastic dynamical methods are identical. Moreover, we present some numerical examples to verify the feasibility of our formalism.
