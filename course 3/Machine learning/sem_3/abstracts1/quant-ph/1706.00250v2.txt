The Fubini-Study metric of quantum state manifold generated by the operators which satisfy the Heisenberg Lie algebra is calculated. The similar problem is studied for the manifold generated by the so(3) Lie algebra operators. Using these results we calculate the Fubini-Study metrics of state manifolds generated by the position and momentum operators. Also the metrics of quantum state manifolds generated by some spin systems are obtained. Finally, we generalize this problem for operators of an arbitrary Lie algebra.
