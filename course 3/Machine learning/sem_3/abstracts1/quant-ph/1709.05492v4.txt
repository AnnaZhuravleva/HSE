We study the dynamics of a macroscopic superconducting qubit coupled to two independent non-stationary reservoirs by using time-dependent perturbation theory. Our results show that a single equilibrium environment surpasses completely the coherent evolution of the macroscopic qubit. When the qubit couples to two different reservoirs, exemplifying a non-equilibrium environment, the short-time dynamics is affected by the interference between two reservoirs, implying the non-additivity of effects of two reservoirs. The non-additivity can be traced back to a non-Markovian effect, even though two reservoirs are independently assumed to be Markovian. Explicitly, the non-equilibrium environment intensifies both coherent and incoherent parts of the evolution. Therefore, the macroscopic system would evolve more coherently but at the price of a shorter decoherence time.
