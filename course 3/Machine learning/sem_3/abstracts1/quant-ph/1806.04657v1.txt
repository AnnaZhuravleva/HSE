We unify the resource-theoretic and the cohomological perspective on quantum contextuality. At the center of this unification stands the notion of the contextual fraction. For both symmetry and parity based contextuality proofs, we establish cohomological invariants which are witnesses of state-dependent contextuality. We provide two results invoking the contextual fraction, namely (i) refinements of logical contextuality inequalities, and (ii) upper bounds on the classical cost of Boolean function evaluation, given the contextual fraction of the corresponding measurement-based quantum computation.
