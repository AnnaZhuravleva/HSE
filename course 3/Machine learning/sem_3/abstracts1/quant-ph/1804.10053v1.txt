This work is a review and continuation of our previous works concerning Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) and Phase Space Representation of Quantum Theory. LCT are known to be transformations generalizing some classical integral transformations like Fourier and fractional Fourier transforms. In quantum theory, they can be defined as linear transformations mixing the coordinate and momentum operators and keeping invariant the canonical commutation relations. The aim of this work is to present a study on these transformations in the framework of relativistic quantum physics using a phase space representation of quantum theory. According to this study, these transformations can be considered as being the elements of a pseudo-symplectic group Sp (2,6).They have unitary and spinorial representations. We have also established that Lorentz transformations may be considered as special cases of these LCTs. From a physical point of view, LCTs can be considered as transformations which permit to define linear mixing between space, time, momentum and energy
