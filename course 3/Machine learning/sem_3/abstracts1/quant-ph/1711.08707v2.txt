A few million ytterbium atoms are magneto-optically trapped inside a 5 cm long high-finesse cavity and laterally pumped close to resonance with the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\to$ $^3$P$_1$ line. Frequency-shifted cavity emission on the same transition is observed and is found to require a threshold pump intensity and atom number; moreover, the emitted light shows a flat $g^{(2)}$ correlation function. These facts indicate lasing action via a two-photon process including the trap light, related to effects previously found in cold Rubidium clouds, but also pronouncedly different. We characterize the conditions and properties of this process and present a model.
