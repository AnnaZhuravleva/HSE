We conduct experimental simulations of many body quantum systems using a \emph{hybrid} classical-quantum algorithm. In our setup, the wave function of the transverse field quantum Ising model is represented by a restricted Boltzmann machine. This neural network is then trained using variational Monte Carlo assisted by a D-Wave quantum sampler to find the ground state energy. Our results clearly demonstrate that already the first generation of quantum computers can be harnessed to tackle non-trivial problems concerning physics of many body quantum systems.
