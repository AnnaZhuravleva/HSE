Processes with an indefinite causal structure may violate a causal inequality, which quantifies quantum correlations that arise from a lack of causal order. In this paper, we show that when the inequalities are analysed with a Gaussian-localised field theoretic definition of particles and labs, the causal indeterminacy of the fields themselves allows a causal inequality to be violated within the causal structure of Minkowski spacetime. We quantify the violation of the inequality and determine the optimal ordering of observers.
