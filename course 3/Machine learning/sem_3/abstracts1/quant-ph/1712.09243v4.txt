Discrete time crystals have attracted considerable theoretical and experimental studies but their potential applications have remained unexplored. A particular type of discrete time crystals, termed "Majorana time crystals", is found to emerge in a periodically driven superconducting wire accommodating two different species of topological edge modes. It is further shown that different Majorana edge modes separated in the time lattice can be braided, giving rise to an unforeseen scenario for topologically protected gate operations. The proposed braiding scheme can also generate a magic state that is important for universal quantum computation. This study thus advances the quantum control in discrete time crystals and reveals their great potential arising from their time-domain properties.
