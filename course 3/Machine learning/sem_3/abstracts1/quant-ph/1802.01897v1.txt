We investigate the properties of a distinguishable single excited state impurity pinned in the center of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a one-dimensional harmonic trapping potential by changing the bare mass of the impurity and its interspecies interaction strength with the BEC. We model our system by using two coupled differential equations for the condensate and the single excited-impurity wave function, which we solve numerically. For equilibrium, we obtain that an excited-impurity induces two bumps or dips on the condensate for the attractive- or repulsive-interspecies coupling strengths, respectively. Afterwards, we show that the excited-impurity induced imprint upon the condensate wave function remains present during a time-of-flight (TOF) expansion after having switched off the harmonic confinement. We also investigate shock-waves or gray-solitons by switching off the interspecies coupling strength in the presence of harmonic trapping potential. During this process, we found out that the generation of gray bi-soliton or gray quad-solitons (four-solitons) depends on the bare mass of the excited-impurity in a harmonic trap.
