We show that quantum states of a certain structure can be transferred from the sender to the receiver without mixing the matrix elements. The only effect of such a state transfer is scaling { of the} certain blocks (MQ-coherence matrices) of the transferred matrix. In addition, equal scaling of these blocks is also possible. We consider the transfer of two-qubit states along a homogeneous spin-1/2 chain and find the states admitting perfect transfer of their zero-order coherence matrices.
