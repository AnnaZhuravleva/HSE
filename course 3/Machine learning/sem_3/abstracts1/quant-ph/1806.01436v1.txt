As it is known, Gleason's theorem is not applicable for a two-dimensional Hilbert space since in this situation the set of Gleason's axioms is not strong enough to imply Born's rule thus leaving room for a dispersion-free probability measure i.e., one that has only the values 0 and 1. To strengthen Gleason's axioms one must add at least one more assumption.   But, as it is shown in the presented paper, alternatively, one can alter one of the implicit assumptions lying in the foundation of Gleason's theorem. Particularly, the assumption that the closed subspaces of the Hilbert space form an orthomodular lattice can be replaced by the assumption that the closed subspaces belonging to the incommutable projection operators are the elements of the different Boolean lattices that do not meet each other. Because of this change, no assumption additional to Gleason's axioms is necessary to imply Born's rule for two-dimensional quantum systems.
