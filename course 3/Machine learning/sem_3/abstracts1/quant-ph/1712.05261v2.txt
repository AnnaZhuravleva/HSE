We have synthesized the anti-symmetric spin exchange interaction (ASI), which is also called the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, in a superconducting circuit containing five superconducting qubits connected to a bus resonator, by periodically modulating the transition frequencies of the qubits with different modulation phases. This allows us to show the chiral spin dynamics in three-, four- and five-spin clusters. We also demonstrate a three-spin chiral logic gate and entangle up to five qubits in Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states. Our results pave the way for quantum simulation of magnetism with ASI and quantum computation with chiral spin states.
