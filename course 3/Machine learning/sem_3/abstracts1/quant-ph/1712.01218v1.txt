We investigate the generation of entanglement between two non interacting qubits coupled to a common reservoir. An experimental setup was conceived to encode one qubit on the polarization of an optical beam and another qubit on its transverse mode. The action of the reservoir is implemented as conditional operations on these two qubits, controlled by the longitudinal path as an ancillary degree of freedom. An entanglement witness and the two-qubit concurrence are easily evaluated from direct intensity measurements showing an excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction.
