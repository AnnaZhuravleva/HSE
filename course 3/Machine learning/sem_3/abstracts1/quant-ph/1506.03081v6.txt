We analyze the harvesting of entanglement and classical correlations from the quantum vacuum to particle detectors. We assess the impact on the detectors' harvesting ability of the spacetime dimensionality, the suddenness of the detectors' switching, their physical size and their internal energy structure. Our study reveals several interesting dependences on these parameters that can be used to optimize the harvesting of classical and quantum correlations. Furthermore, we find that, contrary to previous belief, smooth switching is much more efficient than sudden switching in order to harvest vacuum entanglement, especially when the detectors remain spacelike separated. Additionally, we show that the reported phenomenology of spacelike entanglement harvesting is not altered by subleading order perturbative corrections.
