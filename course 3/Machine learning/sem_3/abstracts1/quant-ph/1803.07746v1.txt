Weak value amplification has been applied to various small physical quantities estimation, however there still lacks a practical feasible protocol to amplify ultra-small longitudinal phase, which is of importance in high precision measurement. Very recently, a different amplification protocol within the framework of weak measurements is proposed to solve this problem, which is capable of measuring any ultra-small longitudinal phase signal that conventional interferometry tries to do. Here we experimentally demonstrate this weak measurements amplification protocol of ultra-small longitudinal phase and realize one order of magnitude amplification in the same technical condition, which verifies the validity of the protocol and show higher precision and sensitivity than conventional interferometry. Our results significantly broaden the area of applications of weak measurements and may play an important role in high precision measurements.
