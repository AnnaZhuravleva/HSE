In this paper, we introduce quantum fidelity based measurement induced nonlocality for the bipartite state over two-sided von Neumann projective measurements. While all the properties of this quantity are reflected from that of one-sided measurement, the latter one is shown to set an upper bound for arbitrary bipartite state. As an illustration, we have studied the nonlocality of Bell diagonal state.
