We predict dominating cooperative two-photon emission from two quantum dots coupled with a single mode photonic crystal cavity. The cooperative two photon emission occurs when excitons in two off-resonantly coupled quantum dots decay simultaneously. The interaction with common cavity field leads to cavity induced two-photon emission which is strongly inhibited by electron phonon coupling. The interaction with common phonon bath produces phonon induced two-photon emission which increases on increasing temperature. For identical quantum dots cavity induced two-photon emission is negligible but phonon induced two-photon emission could be large.
