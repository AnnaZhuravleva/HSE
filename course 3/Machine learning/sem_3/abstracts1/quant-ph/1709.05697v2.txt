Local implementation of non-local quantum gates is necessary in a distributed quantum computer. Here, we demonstrate the non-local implementation of controlled-unitary quantum gates proposed by Eisert \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. A 62, 052317 (2000)] using the five-qubit IBM quantum computer. Further, we analyze the same quantum task in the presence of a controller using a GHZ-like state as the quantum channel. Finally, we verify the fidelity and accuracy of the implementation through the techniques of quantum state and process tomographies.
