We demonstrate that the geometric phases for open quantum systems can be fundamentally modified by their non-Markovian environments. While the geometric phases have been shown to be feasible in implementing quantum gate to perform quantum information processing, the non-Markovian correction due to the environmental noises must be considered to achieve the required precision in geometric quantum computation.
