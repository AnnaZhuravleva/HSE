A central goal in quantum information science is the efficient generation of entanglement across multiple quantum memories while maintaining individual qubit control and readout. Atom-like emitters in solids have emerged as promising quantum memories, with demonstrations of spin-spin entanglement via both optical and magnetic interactions. Magnetic coupling in particular is attractive for efficient and deterministic entanglement gates, but requires nanoscopic separation between qubits, raising the problem of individual addressing. Here we demonstrate a technique that enables the control and measurement of individual solid-state quantum memories within an ensemble, well below the diffraction limit. The technique relies on optical addressing of spin-dependent transitions, and makes use of a feature unique to solid-state qubits: the built-in inhomogeneous distribution of emitters resulting from lattice strain. This allows measurement of individual spins in a manner that protects the quantum states of other nearby centers, with minimal bit-flip or phase errors resulting from readout crosstalk. We use this technique to demonstrate super-resolution localization of individual nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers with nanometer spatial resolution, as well as simultaneous control and serial readout of individual spin populations within a diffraction limited spot. This method opens the door to high-speed control and measurement of qubit registers in mesoscopic spin clusters, with applications ranging from quantum enhanced measurements to error-corrected qubit registers to multiplexed quantum repeater nodes.
