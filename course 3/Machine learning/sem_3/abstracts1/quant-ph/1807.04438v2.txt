Toward an alternative approach to the quantum mechanic ground state search, we theoretically introduce a protocol in which energy of two identical systems are deterministically exchanged. The protocol utilizes a quantum interference between "forward" and "backward" time evolved states with respect to a given Hamiltonian. In addition, to make use the protocol for the ground state search, we construct a network with which we may be able to efficiently apply the protocol successively among multiple systems so that energy of one of them is gradually approaching the lowest one. Although rigorous analysis on the validity of the network is left as a future challenge, some properties of the network are also investigated.
