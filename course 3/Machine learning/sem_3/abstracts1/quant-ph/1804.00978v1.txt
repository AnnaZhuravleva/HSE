We construct an extended quantum spin chain model by introducing new degrees of freedom to the Fredkin spin chain. The new degrees of freedom called arrow indices are partly associated to the symmetric inverse semigroup $\cS^3_1$. Ground states of the model fall into three different phases, and quantum phase transition takes place at each phase boundary. One of the phases exhibits logarithmic violation of the area law of entanglement entropy and quantum criticality, whereas the other two obey the area law. As an interesting feature arising by the extension, there are excited states due to disconnections with respect to the arrow indices. We show that these states are localized without disorder.
