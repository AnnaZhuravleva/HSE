Using the language of the Geometric Algebra, we recast the massive Dirac bispinor as a set of Lorentz scalar, vector, bivector, pseudovector, and pseudoscalar fields that obey a generalized form of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism. This field-based formulation requires careful distinction between geometric and non-geometric implementations of the imaginary unit scalar in the Dirac algebra. This distinction, which is obscured in conventional treatments, allows us to find alternative constructions of the field bilinears and a more natural interpretation of the discrete C, P, and T transformations.
