We investigate the ergodic and mixing properties for dynamics in the framework of general probabilistic theory as well as the decoupling properties with an asymptotic setting, where the ergodicity is defined as the convergence of the long time average state and the mixing condition is defined as the combination of the ergodicity and aperiodicity. In this paper, we give relations between the mixing and asymptotically decoupling conditions. In addition, we give conditions equivalent to the mixing one. One of them is useful in determining whether a given dynamical map is mixing or not, by calculation because this condition results in a system of linear equations. We apply our result to the studies on the irreducibility and the primitivity.
