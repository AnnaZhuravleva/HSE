Absorption refrigerators are autonomous thermal machines that harness the spontaneous flow of heat from a hot bath into the environment in order to perform cooling. Here we discuss quantum realizations of absorption refrigerators in two different settings: namely, cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. We first provide a unified description of these machines in terms of the concept of virtual temperature. Next, we describe the two different physical setups in detail and compare their properties and performance. We conclude with an outlook on future work and open questions in this field of research.
