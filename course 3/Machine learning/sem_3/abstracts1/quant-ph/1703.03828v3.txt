Free classical particles have well-defined momentum and position, while free quantum particles have well-defined momentum but a position fully delocalized over the sample volume. We develop a many-body formalism based on wave-packet operators that connects these two limits, the thermal energy being distributed between the state spatial extension and its thermal excitation. The corresponding `mixed quantum-classical' states, which render the Boltzmann operator diagonal, are the physically relevant states when the temperature is finite. The formulation of many-body Hamiltonians in terms of these thermally excited wave-packets and the resulting effective scatterings is provided.
