We present a general scheme of many-particle interferometry in which two identical sources are used and "which-way information" is erased by making paths of one or more particles identical. We show that an $(N-M)$-particle interference pattern is observed when each source can emit $N$ particles and paths of $M$ ($< N$) particles are made identical. These $M$ particles with identical paths are never detected. The scheme allows us to generate $(N-M)$-particle entangled states that directly correspond to the interference patterns: an entangled state is obtained when a maximum is attained in a corresponding set of interference patters. Properties of these states depend on the difference, $N-M$, rather than on the individual values of $N$ and $M$. We provide general forms of these states and show that they can be expressed as superpositions of various Dicke states. We also illustrate our results by examples: the scheme produces maximally entangled two-qubit states (Bell states) for $N-M=2$ and maximally three-tangled states for $N-M=3$. An important feature of the scheme is that the interference patterns and the entangled states can be modified without interacting with the associated particles.
