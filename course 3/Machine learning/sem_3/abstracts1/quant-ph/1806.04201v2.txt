We present a general, second quantization procedure for multi-transverse-spatial mode Gaussian beam dynamics in nonlinear interactions. Previous treatments have focused on the spectral density and angular distribution of spatial modes. Here we go a layer deeper by investigating the complex transverse-spatial mode in each angular-spatial mode. Furthermore, to implement the theory, we simulate four-wave mixing and parametric down-conversion schemes, showing how one can elucidate and tailor the underlying multi-transverse-spatial mode structure along with it's quantum properties.
