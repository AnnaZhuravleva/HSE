We study the influence of a two-dimensional transversal magnetic field with the asymptotics $B(r\to \infty)= B_0$ in a spin 1/2 charge particle. It is shown that the zero-energy solutions can exist only for one spin direction, depending on the sign of the magnetic field in the infinite boundary. This, shows that zero-energy level is robust with respect to possible inhomogeneities of the magnetic field. In addition, we show that the number of the states with zero energy for one spin projection is infinity.
