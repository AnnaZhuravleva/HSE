Parrondo's paradox is ubiquitous in games, ratchets and random walks.The apparent paradox, devised by J.~M.~R.~Parrondo, that two losing games $A$ and $B$ can produce an winning outcome has been adapted in many physical and biological systems to explain their working. However, proposals on demonstrating Parrondo's paradox using quantum walks failed {for large number of steps}. In this work, we show that instead of a single coin if we consider a two coin initial state which may or may not be entangled, we can observe a genuine Parrondo's paradox with quantum walks. Further we focus on reasons for this and pin down the asymmetry in initial two-coin state or asymmetry in shift operator, either of which are necessary for observing a genuine Parrondo's paradox. We extend our work to a 3-coin initial state too with similar results. The implications of our work for observing quantum ratchet like behavior using quantum walks is also discussed.
