The multiphoton-subtracted thermal states are an interesting example of quantum states of light which are both classical and non-Gaussian. All the properties of such states can be described by just two parameters of compound-Poisson photon number distribution. The non-Gaussianity dependency on these parameters has been calculated numerically and analytically. The loss of non-Gaussianity during the optical damping has been also studied experimentally.
