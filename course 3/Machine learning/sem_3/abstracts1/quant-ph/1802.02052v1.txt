One of the outstanding problems in non-equilibrium physics is to precisely understand when and how physically relevant observables in many-body systems equilibrate under unitary time evolution. While general equilibration results have been proven that show that equilibration is generic provided that the initial state has overlap with sufficiently many energy levels, at the same time results showing that natural initial states fulfill this condition are lacking. In this work, we present stringent results for equilibration for ergodic systems in which the amount of entanglement in energy eigenstates with finite energy density grows volume-like with the system size. Concretely, we carefully formalize notions of entanglement-ergodicity in terms of R\'enyi entropies, from which we derive that such systems equilibrate exponentially well. Our proof uses insights about R\'enyi entropies and combines them with recent results about the probability distribution of energy in lattice systems with initial states that are weakly correlated.
