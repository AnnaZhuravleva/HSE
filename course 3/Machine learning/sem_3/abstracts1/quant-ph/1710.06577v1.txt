We study monogamy relations for arbitrary dimensional multipartite systems. Monogamy relations based on concurrence and concurrence of assistance for any dimensional $m_1\otimes m_2\otimes...\otimes m_{N}$ quantum states are derived, which give rise to the restrictions on the entanglement distributions among the subsystems. Besides, we give the lower bound of concurrence for four-partite mixed states. The approach can be readily generalized to arbitrary multipartite systems.
