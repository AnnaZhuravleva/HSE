We propose a scheme to make use of recent advances in cavity QED-enhanced resonance fluorescence from quantum dots to generate a stream of entangled and indistinguishable photons. We then demonstrate that we can optically manipulate the state of a trapped hole spin to achieve complete coherent control of a qubit. In combination with the selective cavity enhancement of the resonantly excited transition, we use this capability to perform a proof-of-principle demonstration of our proposal by showing that the time bin of a single photon is dependent on the measured state of the trapped spin.
