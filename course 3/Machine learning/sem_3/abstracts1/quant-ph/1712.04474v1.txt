We generalize the quantum Langevin equations approach to study nonlinear light propagation through one-dimensional interacting open quantum lattice models. A matrix product operator description is developed to write and solve a large set of quantum Langevin equations of lattice operators obtained after integrating out the light fields. We first apply our method to a Heisenberg like interacting spin-1/2 chain with nearest-neighbor coupling. The transient and steady-state transport properties of an incoming monochromatic laser light are calculated for this model. We find how the local features of the spin chain and the chain length dependence of light transport coefficient evolve with an increasing power of the incident light. The steady-state light transmission coefficient at a higher power depends non-monotonically on the interaction in a finite chain. While the nonlinear light transmission in our studied model seems to be ballistic in the absence of interaction and for a high interaction, it shows an apparent system-size dependence at intermediate interactions. Later, we extend the method to the long-range interaction between spins of the driven-dissipative lattice model and to incorporate various losses typical in many atomic and solid-state systems.
