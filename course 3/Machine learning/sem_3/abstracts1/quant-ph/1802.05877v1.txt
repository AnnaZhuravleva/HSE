We obtained analytical expressions for Entangled of Formation (EoF) and Quantum Discord (QD) of Werner states and Generalized Werner-Like states. The optimization problem involved under the exact analytical form is obtained for both quantities. In order to illustrate the importance of our results we studied the EoF and the QD of these states. Using discrete formulation of continue states with the $f-$deformed coherent states obtained as deformed annihilation operator coherent states and as deformed displacement operator coherent states. The EoF and QD of bipartite Werner-Like states $f-$deformed coherent states are studied for the P\"{o}schl-Teller, Morse and quantum dot deformed potentials. The result obtained are compared with the case of bipartite Werner-Like coherent states.
