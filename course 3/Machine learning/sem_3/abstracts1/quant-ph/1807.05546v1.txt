All identical particles are entangled from the outset, regardless of how far apart their creation took place. In this paper, this fact is used for extraction of entanglement from independent particles unaffected by any interactions. Specifically, we are concerned with operational schemes for generation of all tripartite entangled states, essentially the GHZ state and the W state, which prevent the particles from touching one another during their evolution. In particular, we show that extraction of entanglement from three particles within the no-touching paradigm generates only states in the GHZ class, and for the W state another auxiliary particle is required. The protocols discussed in the paper work equally well for particles obeying boson, fermion or anyon statistics.
