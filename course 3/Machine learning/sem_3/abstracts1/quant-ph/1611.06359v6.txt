Using Gardiner and Collet's input-output model and the concept of cascade system, we determine the filtering equation for a quantum system driven by chosen non-classical states of light. The quantum system and electromagnetic field are described by making use of quantum stochastic unitary evolution. We consider two examples of the non-classical states of the field: a combination of vacuum and single photon states and a mixture of two coherent states. We describe the stochastic evolution conditioned on the results of the photon counting and quadrature measurements.
