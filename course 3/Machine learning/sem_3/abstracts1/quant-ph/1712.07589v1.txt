A modification of the Holstein-Primakoff transformation is proposed such that creation and annihilation operators for a bosonic field are rewritten as operators of a $SU(2)$ algebra. Once it is applied to a quantum Hamiltonian, a subsequent application of the prescription by Lieb to obtain the classical limit for spin operators allows one to write efficiently a classical Hamiltonian for the system. This process is illustrated for the $M$-atom Jaynes-Cummings model.
