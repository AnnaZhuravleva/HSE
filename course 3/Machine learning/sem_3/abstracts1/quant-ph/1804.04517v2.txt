By local measurements on party A of a system AB and classical communication between its two parties, one can achieve a nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC) on party \textit{B}. For the $l_1$ norm of coherence and the relative entropy of coherence, we generalized the framework of NAQC for two qubits and derived the criteria which capture NAQC in the $(d\times d)$-dimensional states when $d$ is a power of a prime. We also presented a new framework for formulating NAQC, and showed through explicit examples its capacity on capturing the NAQC states. Moreover, we proved that any bipartite state with NAQC is quantum entangled.
