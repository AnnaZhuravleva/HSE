For three given probability distributions describing positions of three classical coins the quantum density matrix of spin-$1/2$ state is constructed and its matrix elements are associated with triada of Malevich's squares. The superposition principle of spin-$1/2$ states is presented in the form of nonlinear addition rule for these classical coin probabilities. We illustrate the formulas by the statement"God does not play dice - God plays coins".
