Based on the novel idea of twin-field quantum key distribution, we present a sending-or-not-sending twin-field fault tolerant quantum key distribution protocol. Our protocol can access a secure distance longer than 700 km even though the misalignment error rate is $15\%$. In the case of zero alignment error, our protocol can exceeds a secure distance of 800 km. Thanks to the novel idea of TF-QKD !
