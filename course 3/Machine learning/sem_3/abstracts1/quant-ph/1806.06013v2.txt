This paper shows a novel way of simulating a Markov process by a quantum computer. The main purpose of the paper is to show a particular application of quantum computing in the field of stochastic processes analysis. Using a Quantum computer, the process could be superposed, where the random variables of the Markov chain are represented by entangled qubit states, which gives the great opportunity of having all the possible scenarios simultaneously.
