High-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates play an important role in many quantum information processing tasks and are a necessary building block for constructing a universal quantum computer. Such high-fidelity gates have been demonstrated on trapped-ion qubits, however, control errors and noise in gate parameters may still lead to reduced fidelity. Here we propose and demonstrate a general family of two-qubit entangling gates which are robust to different sources of noise and control errors. These gates generalize the celebrated M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate by using multi-tone drives. We experimentally implemented several of the proposed gates on $^{88}\text{Sr}^{+}$ ions trapped in a linear Paul trap, and verified their resilience.
