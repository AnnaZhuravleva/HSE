Laser-interferometric gravitational-wave detectors introduce multiple carrier frequencies for classical sensing and control purposes. An outstanding question is whether multi-carrier interferometers outperform their single-carrier counterpart in terms of quantum-limited sensitivity. We show that multiple carriers offer no improvement for the tuned configuration, in which different carriers are tuned to the resonance of optical cavities in the interferometer.
