We derive several expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) for multi-mode Gaussian quantum states. This quantity determines the ultimate precision with what parameters encoded into these states can be estimated. The derived expressions involve expression for a multi-mode Gaussian state for the case when the Williamson's decomposition of the covariance matrix is known, and an expression for a multi-mode state in terms of infinite series, together with the estimate of the remainder. We also discuss problematic behavior when some of the modes are pure, and present a method that allows to use expressions that have been previously defined only for mixed Gaussian states, to compute QFIM for states with any number of pure modes.
