We propose to enhance the generation of a phonon laser by exploiting optical superradiance. In our scheme, the optomechanical cavity contains a movable membrane, which supports a mechanical mode, and the superradiance cavity can generate the coherent collective light emissions by applying a transverse pump to an ultracold intracavity atomic gas. The superradiant emission turns out to be capable of enhancing the phonon laser performance. This indicates a new way to operate a phonon laser with the assistance of coherent atomic gases trapped in a cavity or lattice potentials.
