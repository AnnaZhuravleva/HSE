The prediction of arrival time or first passage time statistics of a quantum particle is an open problem, which challenges the foundations of quantum theory. One of the most promising and insightful approaches to this problem stems from the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory (a.k.a Bohmian mechanics). Applying the fundamental postulates of this theory, we analyze a simplified first passage time experiment and derive the empirical passage time distribution $\Pi(\tau)$. Implications of our results are also discussed.
