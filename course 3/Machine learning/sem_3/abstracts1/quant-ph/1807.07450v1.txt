Quantum coherence inherently affects the dynamics and the performances of a quantum machine. Coherent control can, at least in principle, enhance the work extraction and boost the velocity of evolution in an open quantum system. Using advanced tools from calculus of variations we develop a general technique for minimizing a wide class of cost functionals when the external control has access to full rotations of the system Hamiltonian. The method is then applied both to time and heat loss minimization problems and explicitly solved in the case of a two level system in contact with either bosonic or fermionic thermal environments.
