We introduce a toolbox for the quantum simulation of superluminal motion with superconducting circuits. We show that it is possible to simulate the motion of a superconducting qubit at constant velocities that exceed the speed of light in the electromagnetic medium and the subsequent emission of Ginzburg radiation. We consider as well possible setups for simulating the superluminal motion of a mirror, finding a link with the superradiant phase transition of the Dicke model.
