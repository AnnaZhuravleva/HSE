Quantum phase transitions are usually classified into discrete universality classes that typically only depend on symmetries and spatial dimensionalities. In this Letter, we demonstrate an opportunity to continuously vary the critical exponents or universalities by tuning experimental parameters in a given physical system. Particularly, we show that critical exponents in long-range spin systems simulated in ion traps can be easily tuned with laser detuning. We suggest that such experiments also effectively simulate some aspects of critical phenomena in conventional spin systems but in artificial non-integer spatial dimensions.
