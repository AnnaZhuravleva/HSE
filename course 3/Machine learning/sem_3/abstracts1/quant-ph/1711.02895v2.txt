We consider quantum steering by non-Gaussian entangled states. The Reid steering criterion based on the Heisenberg uncertainty relation fails to detect steerability for many categories of such states. Here, we derive a tighter steering criterion using the Robertson-Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relation. We show that our steering condition is able to detect steerability of several classes of non-Gaussian states such as entangled eigenstates of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the photon subtracted squeezed vacuum state and the NOON state.
