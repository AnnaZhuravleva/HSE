We give a careful proof that a parallelized version of adiabatic quantum computation can efficiently simulate universal gate model quantum computation. The proof specifies an explicit parameter-dependent Hamiltonian $H({\lambda})$ that is based on ground state quantum computation [1]. We treat both a 1-dimensional configuration in which qubits on a line undergo nearest neighbor 2-qubit gates and an all-to-all configuration in which every qubit undergoes 2-qubit gates with every other qubit in the system.
