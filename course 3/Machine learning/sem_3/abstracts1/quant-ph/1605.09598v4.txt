We present a general framework for the construction of quantum tensor product codes (QTPC). In a classical tensor product code (TPC), its parity check matrix is con- structed via the tensor product of parity check matrices of the two component codes. We show that by adding some constraints on the component codes, several classes of dual-containing TPCs can be obtained. By selecting different types of component codes, the proposed method enables the construction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide a wide variety of quantum error control abilities. In particular, if one of the component codes is selected as a burst-error-correction code, then QTPCs have quantum multiple-burst-error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in distinct subblocks. Compared with concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the component code selections of QTPCs are much more exible than those of CQCs since only one of the component codes of QTPCs needs to satisfy the dual-containing restriction. We show that it is possible to construct QTPCs with parameters better than other classes of quantum error-correction codes (QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with parameters better than previously known quantum codes available in the literature. Several classes of QTPCs that can correct multiple quantum bursts of errors are constructed based on reversible cyclic codes and maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes.
