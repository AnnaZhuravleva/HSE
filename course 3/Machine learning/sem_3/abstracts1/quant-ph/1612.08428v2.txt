In this paper we will establish a relation between geometric uncertainty relation and the determinant of the quantum covariance matrix for mixed quantum states. We will show that determinant of the covariance matrix represents the squared metric area of a parallelogram. In this setting the geometric uncertainty relation compares a metric area to a symplectic area. Moreover, we will in details investigate relation between J-holomorphic maps and geometric uncertainty relation for mixed quantum states. We will argue that determinant of the quantum covariance matrix is equal to the harmonic energy of a holomorphic map that minimize the areas.
