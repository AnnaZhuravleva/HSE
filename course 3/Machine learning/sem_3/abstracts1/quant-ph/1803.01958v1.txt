This document describes a family of quantum circuits which load classical data into a quantum state. When loading $N$ classical bits, the result quantum state is of order $\log_2(N)$ qubits. Furthermore the gate depth of the data loading circuit is of order $\log_2(N)$. Limitations to the efficiency of the data loading process such as the Holevo bound are discussed. Methods to improve the efficiency of the data loading procedure such as combining classical compression techniques with quantum decompression circuitry, are also discussed. Simulations using the Quipper language were conducted to verify the circuits behavior.
