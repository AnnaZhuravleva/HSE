We demonstrate that if the dynamics of quantum systems are expressed in the state-space of den- sity operators, then they exhibit dynamical flow properties that are analogous to classical Hamilto- nian systems. We show that individual quantum states can be formulated equivalently as different distributions on this state-space and that ambiguity in this formulation can be leveraged to gain information about how various sources of uncertainty influence system dynamics. We derive explicit equations of motion for populations on this state-space for both closed and open quantum systems. We argue that trajectory ensembles expressed in this state-space can be analyzed and interpreted using the tools of classical statistical mechanics and along these lines we present a quantum gener- alization of transition path sampling. Finally, as an example, we explore trajectory ensembles of a model open quantum system.
