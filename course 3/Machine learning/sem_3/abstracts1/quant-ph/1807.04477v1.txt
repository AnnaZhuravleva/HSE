The correlation properties of the pump field in spontaneous parametric down-conversion are crucial in determining the degree of entanglement of generated signal and idler photons. We find theoretically that continuous-variable entanglement of the transverse positions and momenta of these photons can be achieved only if the coherence of the pump beam is sufficiently high. The positions of signal and idler photons are found to be correlated, even for an incoherent pump. However, the momenta of the signal and idler photons are not anti-correlated, even though transverse momentum is conserved.
