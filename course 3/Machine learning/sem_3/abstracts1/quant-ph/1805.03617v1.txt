We study the continuous-variable (CV) quantum teleportation protocol in the case that one of the two modes of the shared entangled resource is sent to the receiver through a Gaussian Quantum Brownian Motion noisy channel. We show that if the channel is engineered in a non-Markovian regime, the information backflow from the environment induces an extra dependance of the phase of the two-mode squeezing of the shared Gaussian entangled resource on the transit time along the channel of the shared mode sent to the receiver. Optimizing over the non-Markovianity dependent phase of the squeezing yields a significant enhancement of the teleportation fidelity. For short enough channel transit times, essentially unit fidelity is achieved at realistic, finite values of the squeezing amplitude for a sufficiently large degree of the channel non-Markovianity.
