We show a quantum boost in the output power of a heat engine formed by a two-level system coupled to a single-mode cavity. The key ingredient here is the nonstationary regime achieved when some system parameter (atomic transition frequency, in our case) is subjected to a time-dependent perturbative modulation that is precisely tuned at certain frequencies. We discuss how the extracted power can lead to amplification of the external driving field. Quantum power boost is found both in the nonstationary Jaynes-Cummings and Rabi models, indicating that our predictions can be experimentally tested in circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.
