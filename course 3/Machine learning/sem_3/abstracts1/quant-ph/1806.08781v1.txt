We report on the usefulness of using neural networks as a variational state ansatz for many-body quantum systems in the context of quantum information-processing tasks. In the neural network state ansatz, the complex amplitude function of a quantum state is computed by a neural network. The resulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has proven rich enough to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of various physical systems of interest.   In the present paper, we supply further evidence for the usefulness of neural network states to describe multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing quantum codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error correction. In particular, we show that a) neural network states yield quantum codes with a high coherent information for two important quantum channels, the depolarizing channel and the dephrasure channel; b) neural network states can be used to represent absolutely maximally entangled states, a special type of quantum error correction codes. In both cases, the neural network state ansatz provides an efficient and versatile means as variational parametrization of these states.
