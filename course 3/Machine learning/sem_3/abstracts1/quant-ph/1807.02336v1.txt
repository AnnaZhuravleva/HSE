We address the problem of distributing approximation errors in large-scale quantum programs. It has been known for some time that when compiling quantum algorithms for a fault-tolerant architecture, some operations must be approximated as they cannot be implemented with arbitrary accuracy by the underlying gate set. This leads to approximation errors which often can be grouped along subroutines that the given quantum algorithm is composed of. Typically, choices can be made as to how to distribute approximation errors so that the overall error is kept beneath a user- or application-defined threshold. These choices impact the resource footprint of the fault-tolerant implementation. We develop an automatic approximation error management module to tackle the resulting optimization problems. The module is based on annealing and can be integrated into any quantum software framework. Using the benchmark of simulating an Ising model with transverse field, we provide numerical results to quantify the benefits and trade-offs involved in our approach.
