The vast majority of physical objects we are dealing with are almost exclusively made of atoms. Due to their discrete level structure, single atoms have proved to be emitters of light which is incompatible with the classical description of electromagnetic waves. We demonstrate this incompatibility for atomic fluorescence when scaling up the size of the source ensemble, which consists of trapped atomic ions, by several orders of magnitude. The presented measurements of nonclassical statistics on light unconditionally emitted from ensembles containing up to more than a thousand ions promise further scalability to much larger emitter numbers. The methodology can be applied to a broad range of experimental platforms focusing on the bare nonclassical character of single isolated emitters.
