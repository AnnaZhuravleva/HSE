We derive general conditions for the compatibility of channels in general probabilistic theory. We introduce formalism that allows us to easily formulate steering by channels and Bell nonlocality of channels as generalizations of the well-known concepts of steering by measurements and Bell nonlocality of measurements. The generalization does not follow the standard line of thinking stemming from the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, but introduces steering and Bell nonlocality as entanglement-assisted incompatibility tests. We show that all of the proposed definitions are, in the special case of measurements, the same as the standard definitions, but not all of the known results for measurements generalize to channels. For example, we show that for quantum channels, steering is not a necessary condition for Bell nonlocality. We further investigate the introduced conditions and concepts in the special case of quantum theory and we provide many examples to demonstrate these concepts and their implications.
