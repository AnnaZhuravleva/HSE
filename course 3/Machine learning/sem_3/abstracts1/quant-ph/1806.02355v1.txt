Many protocols require precise rotation measurements. We here present a general class of states that surpass the shot noise limit for measuring rotations around arbitrary axes. We then derive a quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for simultaneously estimating all three parameters of a rotation (e.g., the Euler angles), and discuss states that achieve Heisenberg-limited sensitivities for all parameters; the bound is saturated by "anticoherent" states. We elucidate geometrical and mathematical techniques for finding new anticoherent states, which have garnered much attention in recent years. Finally, we discuss the potential for divergences in multiparameter estimation due to singularities in spherical coordinate systems. These results are useful for numerous tasks in quantum metrology and quantum communication.
