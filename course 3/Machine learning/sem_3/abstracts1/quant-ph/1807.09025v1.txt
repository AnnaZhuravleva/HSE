In order to better understand the underlying fundamental physical processes in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and to realize improvements in the use of this system for technological applications, it is imperative to gain new insight into the origins of the apparent inhomogeneous broadening. In this work we make use of a novel type of spectroscopy developed specifically for this task. The pump-probe spectroscopy closely follows Doppler-free spectroscopy used in atomic vapor. We show that the origin of inhomogeneous broadening comes from local magnetic field variations in the diamond lattice.
