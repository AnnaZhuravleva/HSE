We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the computational ghost imaging with non-local quantum correlations is not impossible and that is a common phenomenon, which may change our original understanding of the computational ghost imaging. Two spatially separated spatial light modulators and two bucket detectors are adopted in this scheme. Since two spatially separated light fields with spatial correlations are used, this provides a powerful evidence that the computational ghost imaging with spatially separated two-wavelength beams indeed rely on non-local quantum correlations. In addition, the imaging quality of this new imaging scheme will be better than that of the conventional ghost imaging in optical harsh environment.
