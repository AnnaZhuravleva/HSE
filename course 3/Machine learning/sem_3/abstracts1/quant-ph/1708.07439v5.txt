This work recollects a non-universal set of quantum gates described by higher-dimensional Spin groups. They are also directly related with matchgates in theory of quantum computations and complexity. Various processes of quantum state distribution along a chain such as perfect state transfer and different types of quantum walks can be effectively modeled on classical computer using such approach.
