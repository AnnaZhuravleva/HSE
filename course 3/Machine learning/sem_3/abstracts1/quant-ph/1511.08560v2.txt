We consider causality respecting (CR) quantum systems interacting with closed timelike curves (CTCs), within the Deutsch model. We introduce the concepts of popping up and elimination of quantum information and use them to show that no-cloning and no-deleting, which are true in CR quantum systems, are no more valid in the same that are interacting with CTCs. We also find limits on the possibility of creation of entanglement between a CR system and a CTC, and the same between two CR systems in the presence of a CTC. We prove that teleportation of quantum information, even in its approximate version, from a CR region to a CTC is disallowed. Interestingly, we find that tweaking the Deutsch model, by allowing the input and output to be not the same, leads to a nontrivial approximate teleportation beyond the classical limit.
