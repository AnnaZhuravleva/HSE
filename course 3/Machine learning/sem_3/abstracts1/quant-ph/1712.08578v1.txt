We adapt a construction of Guth and Lubotzky [arXiv:1310.5555] to obtain a family of quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing rate and minimum distance scaling like $n^{0.2}$ where $n$ is the number of physical qubits. Similarly as in [arXiv:1310.5555], our homological code family stems from tessellated hyperbolic 4-manifolds. The main novelty of this work is that we consider a regular tessellation consisting of hypercubes. We exploit this strong local structure to design and analyze an efficient decoding algorithm.
