The back-action effect of a meter on the quantum system being observed is a central consideration for quantum-limited measurement. In cavity optomechanics, key experimental signatures of the quantum regimes arise because this back action can induce correlations between the degrees of freedom of the quantum meter. We propose two-timescale stochastic Langevin (T2SL) propagation as an effective procedure to analyse correlations between incoming quantum shot noise and measurement back action in new experiments, e.g. with nonlinearities or room-temperature quantum effects, where both the standard linearised theory or quantum master equation approaches are unfeasible or impractical. We show T2SL simulates well those measured quantum phenomena which, although of quantum origin, are insensitive to non-commutativity of quantum fluctuations. It reproduces sideband structures which are entirely submerged below the quantum imprecision floor. We consider both optical and position squared nonlinearities and investigate quantum squeezing as well as the linear to nonlinear frequency transduction observed recently.
