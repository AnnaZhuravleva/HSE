We present two verification protocols where the correctness of a `target' computation is checked by means of `trap' computations that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Our protocols only require trusted single-qubit state preparation or measurements in the XY -plane of the Bloch sphere, and have linear overhead. To the best of our knowledge, our protocols are the first in combining trusted operations on a single plane and linear overhead. They represent a step towards reducing the quantum requirements for verification and easing their experimental implementation.
