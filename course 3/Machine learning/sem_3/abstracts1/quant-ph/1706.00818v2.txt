Bohmian mechanics is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that describes the motion of quantum particles with an ensemble of deterministic trajectories. Several attempts have been made to utilize Bohmian trajectories as a computational tool to simulate quantum systems consisting of many particles, a very demanding computational task. In this paper, we present a novel ab-initio approach to solve the many-body problem for bosonic systems by evolving a system of one-particle wavefunctions representing pilot waves that guide the Bohmian trajectories of the quantum particles. The method is used to study the breathing dynamics and ground state properties in a system of many interacting bosons. The precision of our method is benchmarked aginst the numerically exact multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for Bosons.
