Mutually unbiased bases, mutually unbiased measurements and general symmetric informationally complete measurements are three related concepts in quantum information theory. We investigate multipartite systems using these notions and present some criteria detecting entanglement of arbitrary high dimensional multi-qudit systems and multipartite systems of subsystems with different dimensions. It is proved that these criteria can detect the $k$-nonseparability ($k$ is even) of multipartite qudit systems and arbitrary high dimensional multipartite systems of $m$ subsystems with different dimensions. We show that they are more efficient and wider of application range than the previous ones. They provide experimental implementation in detecting entanglement without full quantum state tomography.
