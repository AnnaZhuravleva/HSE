We study the effect of a thermal environment on the quantum annealing dynamics of a transverse-field Ising chain. The environment is modelled as a single Ohmic bath of quantum harmonic oscillators weakly interacting with the total transverse magnetization of the chain in a translationally invariant manner. We show that the density of defects generated at the end of the annealing process displays a minimum as a function of the annealing time, the so-called optimal working point, only in rather special regions of the bath temperature and coupling strength plane. We discuss the relevance of our results for current and future experimental implementations with quantum annealing hardware.
