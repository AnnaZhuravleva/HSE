In classical thermodynamics the work cost of control can typically be neglected. On the contrary, in quantum thermodynamics the cost of control constitutes a fundamental contribution to the total work cost. Evaluating this contribution is an important but non-trivial problem. Here, focusing on quantum refrigeration, we show how the level of control determines the fundamental limits to cooling. We compare coherent versus incoherent operations, and derive the minimal achievable temperature and associated work cost. We discuss both the single-shot and asymptotic regimes. Our work provides a unified picture of the different approaches to quantum refrigeration developed in the literature, including algorithmic cooling, autonomous quantum refrigerators, and the resource theory of quantum thermodynamics.
