Quantum field theory (QFT) in classical spacetime has revealed interesting and puzzling aspects about gravitational systems, in particular black hole thermodynamics and its information processing. Although quantum gravitational effects may be relevant for a better understanding of these topics, a commonly accepted framework for studying QFT with quantum gravitational effects is missing. We present a theory for studying quantum fields in the presence of quantum indefinite causal structure. This theory incorporates quantum properties of spacetime causal structure in a model independent way, and exposes universal features of quantum spacetime which are independent of the details about its microscopic degrees of freedom (strings, loops, causal sets...).
