When a quantum system is distributed to spatially separated parties, it is natural to consider how the system evolves when the parties perform local quantum operations with classical communication (LOCC). However, the structure of LOCC operations is exceedingly complex leaving many important physical problems unsolved. In this paper we consider generalized resource theories of entanglement based on different relaxations to the class of LOCC. The behavior of various entanglement measures are studied under non-entangling operations, as well as the newly introduced dually non-entangling and PPT-preserving operational classes. In an effort to better understand the nature of LOCC bound entanglement, we study the problem of entanglement distillation in these generalized resource theories. We show that all NPT entangled states can be distilled using operations that are both PPT and dually non-entangling. Furthermore, for any entangled state $\rho$ and any $\epsilon>0$, we prove the existence of a non-entangling map that is $\epsilon$ close to the set of LOCC and which is able to distill pure-state entanglement from $\rho$. This finding reveals a type of fragility to the phenomenon of bound entanglement in LOCC processing. We then turn to the stochastic convertibility of multipartite pure states and show that any two states can be interconverted by any polytope approximation to the set of separable operations. Finally, as an analog to $k$-positive maps, we introduce and analyze the set of $k$-non-entangling operations.
