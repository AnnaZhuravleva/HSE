In this paper we present a closed-form expression of the vibrational partition function for the one-dimensional q-deformed Morse potential energy model. Through this function the related thermodynamic functions are derived and studied in terms of the parameters of the model. Specially, we plotted the q-deformed vibrational partition function, and vibrational specific heat for some diatomic molecule systems such as H2, HCl, LiH and CO. The idea of a critical temperature T_{C} is introduced in relation to the specific heat.
