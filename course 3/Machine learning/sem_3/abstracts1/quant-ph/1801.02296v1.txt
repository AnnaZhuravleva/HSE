We propose a feasible scheme to realize all-optical photon transmission switching in a passiveactive optomechanical system, consisting of one ordinary passive cavity, one active cavity and one common movable membrane oscillator of perfect reflection, driven by two strong control fields and two weak probe fields symmetrically. By means of the gain effect of the active cavity, many novel and valuable phenomena arise, such as frequency-independent perfect reflection (FIPR) first proposed in this paper, adjustable photon bidirectional transmission, phase-dependent non-reciprocity and so on. The relevant parameters used for controlling the all-optical switching are precisely tunable by adjusting the strengths of control fields and the relative phase of probe fields. Furthermore, tunable fast and slow light can be realized in our system by accurately adjusting relevant parameters which is readily and feasible in experiments. These novel phenomena originate from the effective optomechanical coupling and the gain effect provide a promising platform for photonic devices, quantum network node fabrication and quantum information process (QIP).
