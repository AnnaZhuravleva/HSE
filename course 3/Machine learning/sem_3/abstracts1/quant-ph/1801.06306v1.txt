The quantum Zeno effect is deeply related to the quantum measurement process and thus studies of it may help shed light on the hitherto mysterious measurement process in quantum mechanics. Recently, the spatial quantum Zeno effect is observed in a Bose-Einstein condensate depleted by an electron beam. We theoretically investigate how different intrinsic tendencies of filling affect the quantum Zeno effect in this system by changing the impinging point of the electron beam along the inhomogeneous condensate. Surprisingly, we find no visible effect on the critical dissipation intensity at which the quantum Zeno effect appear. Our finding shows the recent capability of combining the Bose-Einstein condensate with an electron beam offers a great opportunity for studying the spatial quantum Zeno effect, and more generally the dynamics of a quantum many-body system out of equilibrium.
