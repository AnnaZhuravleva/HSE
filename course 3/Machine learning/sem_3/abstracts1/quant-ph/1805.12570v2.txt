This paper addresses the problem of finding the depth overhead that will be incurred when running quantum algorithms on near-term quantum computers. Specifically, it is envisaged that near-term quantum computers will have low qubit connectivity: each qubit will only be able to interact with a subset of the other qubits, a reality typically represented by a qubit interaction graph in which a vertex represents a qubit and an edge represents a possible direct 2-qubit interaction (gate). Thus the depth overhead is unavoidably incurred by introducing swap gates into the quantum circuit to enable general qubit interactions. In near-term quantum computers it is reasonable to assume that all qubits will be available for use in the algorithm, termed the full-width setting. This paper proves that there exist quantum circuits where a depth overhead of $\Omega(\log n)$ must necessarily be incurred when running quantum algorithms on full-width quantum computers whose qubit interaction graph has finite degree, but that such a depth overhead is achievable.
