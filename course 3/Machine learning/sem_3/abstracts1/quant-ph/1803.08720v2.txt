We unify the product and the sum form variance-based uncertainties to a Schr\"{o}dinger-liked uncertainty relation. Some well-known uncertainties in either product or sum form can be recovered by the Schr\"{o}dinger-liked uncertainty, i.e., the product form uncertainty is the Schr\"{o}dinger-liked uncertainty relation for Hermitian operators and the sum form uncertainty is actually Schr\"{o}dinger-liked uncertainty relation for non-Hermitian operators. Thus the Schr\"{o}dinger-liked uncertainty relation provides a unified uncertainty relation. Also, the unified uncertainty reveals some quantum properties that the traditional uncertainty relation cannot do, and indicates that the uncertainty relation for the incompatible observables is bounded not only by the commutation relation between themselves, but also by the quantities related with the other operator, which is named as auxiliary operator. The importance of the unified uncertainty, as well as the concept of the auxiliary operator deduced from it, is demonstrated in explaining and fixing the trivial lower bound appearing in the traditional uncertainty relations.
