In this work, we perform a series of phonon counting measurement with different methods in a 3-mode optomechanical system, and we compare the difference of the entanglement after measurement. In this article we focus on the two cases: imperfect measurement and on-off measurement. We find that whatever measurement you take, the entanglement will increase. The size of entanglement enhancement is the largest in perfect measurement, second in the imperfect measurement, and it is not obvious in the on-off measurement. We are sure that the more precise measurement information, the larger entanglement concentration.
