The pace of evolution of physical systems is fundamentally constrained by quantum speed limits (QSL), which have found broad applications in quantum science and technology. We consider the speed of evolution for quantum systems undergoing stochastic dynamics due to continuous measurements. It is shown that that there are trajectories for which standard QSL are violated, and we provide estimates for the range of velocities in an ensemble of realizations of continuous measurement records. We determine the dispersion of the speed of evolution and characterize the full statistics of single trajectories.
