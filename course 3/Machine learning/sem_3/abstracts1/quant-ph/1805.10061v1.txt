We study the evolution of N arbitrary spins described by the long-range Ising-type interaction. This fact allows us to obtain the Fubiny-Study metric of the manifold defined by this evolution. We explore the topology of this manifold and shown that it corresponds to a sphere. With the help of this fact the manifold geometry is determined. Also we calculate the Riemann curvature of manifold and represent it by means of the speed of evolution. This is important for an experimental measurement of the curvature. The conditions for achieving the minimal and maximal values of the speed of evolution are obtained. Finally, we examine the influence of an external magnetic field on the metric of manifold and on the speed of evolution. We obtain the conditions for achieving the minimal possible speed of evolution. For some predefined initial states the orientations of magnetic fields for reaching the minimal and maximal values of the speed are found.
