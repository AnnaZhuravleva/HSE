Physical implementations of quantum information processing devices are generally not unique, and we are faced with the problem of choosing the best implementation. Here, we consider the sensitivity of quantum devices to variations in their different components. To measure this, we adopt a quantum metrological approach, and find that the sensitivity of a device to variations in a component has a particularly simple general form. We use the concept of cost functions to establish a general practical criterion to decide between two different physical implementations of the same quantum device consisting of a variety of components. We give two practical examples of sensitivities of quantum devices to variations in beam splitter transmitivities: the KLM and Reverse nonlinear sign gates for linear optical quantum computing with photonic qubits, and the enhanced optical Bell detectors by Grice and Ewert & van Loock. We briefly compare the sensitivity to the diamond distance and find that the latter is less suited for studying the behaviour of components embedded within the larger quantum device.
