The power of quantum computers makes it possible to solve difficult problems more efficiently than is possible with traditional computers. Gate-model quantum computers provide an experimentally implementable architecture for quantum circuit computations. Here, we demonstrate an automated method for designing quantum circuits for experimental gate-model quantum computers. We define the Quantum Triple Annealing Minimization (QTAM) algorithm, which provides an automated quantum circuit minimization on the physical layout (circuit depth and area), quantum wire length minimization of the quantum circuit, Hamiltonian minimization, and the minimization of the input size and output measurements. We define a multilayer structure for quantum circuit computations using the hardware restrictions on the connection topology of gate-model quantum computers. The results can be straightforwardly applied to near term gate-model quantum computers.
