The use of multi-particle entangled states has the potential to drastically increase the sensitivity of atom interferometers and atomic clocks. The Twist-and-Turn (TNT) Hamiltonian can create multi-particle entanglement much more rapidly than ubiquitous one-axis twisting (OAT) Hamiltonian in the same spin system. In this paper, we consider the effects of detection noise - a key limitation in current experiments - on the metrological usefulness of these nonclassical states and also consider a variety of interaction-based readouts to maximize their performance. Interestingly, the optimum interaction-based readout is not the obvious case of perfect time reversal.
