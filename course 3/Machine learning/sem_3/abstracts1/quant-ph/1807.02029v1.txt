We present a general approach to measurement-based quantum feedback that employs independent variation of quantum state-based and proportional (PaQS) feedback components to obtain locally optimal feedback protocols. To demonstrate the power of the method, we apply it to generation of high-fidelity multipartite entanglement with an emphasis on remote entanglement, requiring spatially local feedback Hamiltonians. The symmetry of both measurement and feedback operators is found to be essential for construction of effective protocols. We show that entangled states can be reached with fidelity approaching unity under non-Markovian feedback control protocols, while Markovian protocols resulting from optimizing the feedback unitaries on ensemble averaged states still yield fidelities above 94%. Application of the PaQS approach to generation of N-qubit W, Dicke and GHZ states shows that such entangled states can be efficiently generated with high fidelity, for up to N=100 in some cases.
