We explore the use of weak quantum measurements for single-qubit quantum state tomography processes. Weak measurements are those where the coupling between the qubit and the measurement apparatus is weak; this results in the quantum state being disturbed less than in the case of a projective measurement. We employ a weak measurement tomography protocol developed by Das and Arvind, which they claim offers a new method of extracting information from quantum systems. We test the Das-Arvind scheme for various measurement strengths, and ensemble sizes, and reproduce their results using a sequential stochastic simulation. Lastly, we place these results in the context of current understanding of weak and projective measurements.
