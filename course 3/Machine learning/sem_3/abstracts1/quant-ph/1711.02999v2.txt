Autonomous quantum error correction utilizes the engineered coupling of a quantum system to a dissipative ancilla to protect quantum logical states from decoherence. We show that the Knill-Laflamme condition, stating that the environmental error operators should act trivially on a subspace, which then becomes the code subspace, is sufficient for logical qudits to be protected against Markovian noise. It is proven that the error caused by the total Lindbladian evolution in the code subspace can be suppressed up to very long times in the limit of large engineered dissipation, by explicitly deriving how the error scales with both time and engineered dissipation strength. To demonstrate the potential of our approach for applications, we implement our general theory with binomial codes, a class of bosonic error-correcting code, and outline how they can be implemented in a fully autonomous manner to protect against photon loss and dephasing errors in a microwave cavity.
