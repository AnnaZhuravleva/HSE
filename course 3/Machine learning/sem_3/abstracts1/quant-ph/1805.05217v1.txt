Physical annealing systems provide a heuristic approach to solve NP-hard Ising optimization problems. It is believed that the connectivity between spins in such annealers significantly impacts the machine's computational effectiveness. In this paper we study the performance of two types of annealing machines that have very different connectivity -- a commercially available quantum annealer built by \dwave Systems, which has sparse connectivity, and coherent Ising machines based on optical parametric oscillator networks, which have all-to-all connectivity. We demonstrate an exponential ($e^{-O(N^2)}$) penalty in performance for the \dwave quantum annealer relative to coherent Ising machines when solving Ising problems on dense graphs, which is attributable to the differences in internal connectivity between the machines. This leads to a several-orders-of-magnitude time-to-solution difference between coherent Ising machines and the \dwave system for problems with over 50 vertices. Our results provide strong experimental support to efforts to increase the connectivity of physical annealers.
