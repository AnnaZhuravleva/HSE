This is a derivation of the quantum-optical master equation using coarse-graining of time, which brings new insights into a decades old technique. My derivation is quite similar to derivations using quantum stochastic methods or Kraus operators, though I go through the derivation without explicitly invoking any of these concepts, so it may be easier to follow as an introduction. I also address the major pitfall of nearly all microscopic derivations of the master equation, namely that they assume the state of the system and bath factorize for all times. I show why this assumption actually holds for spontaneous emission, and coincidentally turns out to be correct.
