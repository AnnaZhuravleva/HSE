We propose a scheme to perform a Non-Clifford gate on a logical qudit encoded in a pair of $Z_N$ parafermionic zero modes via the Aharonov Casher effect. This gate can be implemented by moving a half fluxon around the pair of parafermionic zero modes that can be realized in a two-dimensional set-up via existing proposals. The half fluxon can be created as a part of half fluxon/anti-half fluxon pair in long Josephson junction with chiral superconductors and then moved around the parafermionic zero modes. Supplementing this gate with braiding of parafermions provides the avenue for universal quantum computing with parafermions.
