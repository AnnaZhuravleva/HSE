The problem of finding the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian using a quantum computer is currently solved using either the quantum phase estimation (QPE) or variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithms. For precision $\epsilon$, QPE requires $O(1)$ repetitions of circuits with depth $O(1/\epsilon)$, whereas each expectation estimation sub-routine within VQE requires $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$ samples from circuits with depth $O(1)$. We propose a generalised VQE algorithm that interpolates between these two regimes via a free parameter $\alpha\in[0,1]$ which can exploit quantum coherence over a circuit depth of $O(1/\epsilon^{\alpha})$ to reduce the number of samples to $O(1/\epsilon^{2(1-\alpha)})$.
