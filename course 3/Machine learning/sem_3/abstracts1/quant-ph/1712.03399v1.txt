This paper provides a characterization for the set of antidegradable qubit channels. The characterization arises from the correspondence between the antidegradability of a channel and the symmetric extendibility of its Choi operator. Using an inequality derived to describe the set of bipartite qubit states which admit symmetric extension, we are able to characterize the set of all antidegradable qubit channels. Using the characterization we investigate the antidegradability of unital qubit channels and arbitrary qubit channels with respect to the dimension of the environment. We additionally provide a condition which describes qubit channels which are simultaneously degradable and antidegradable along with a classification of self-complementary qubit channels.
