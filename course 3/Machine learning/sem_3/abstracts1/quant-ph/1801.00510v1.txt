By using path integrals, the stochastic process associated to the time evolution of the quantum probability density is formally rewritten in terms of a stochastic differential equation, given by Newton's equation of motion with an additional multiplicative stochastic force. However, the term playing the role of the stochastic force is defined by a non-positive-definite probability functional, providing a clear example of the negative (or "extended") probabilities characteristic of quantum mechanics.
