Concatenating different methods of error protection is of utmost importance for the development of quantum computation devices and quantum simulators. Here, we study the dynamics of a two-qubit system, during an entangling gate operation realized by the interaction between the qubits, whose strength is characterized by the separation between them. The inter-qubit separation also specifies the nature of reservoir coupling, that is, whether the qubits are collectively or individually interacting with the environment. We introduce a continuous dynamical decoupling protocol that enables us to protect the entangling gate operation from the environmental noise. More importantly, we present the conditions under which decoherence-free subspaces and continuous dynamical decoupling can be used complimentary to each other for protecting the system against general type of errors, presenting an example of using different protection techniques cooperatively.
