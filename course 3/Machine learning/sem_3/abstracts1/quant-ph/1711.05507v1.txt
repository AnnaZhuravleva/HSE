Employing counterdiabatic shortcut to adiabaticity (STA), we design shorter and robust achromatic two- and three- waveguide couplers. We assume that the phase mismatch between the waveguides has a sign flip at maximum coupling, while the coupling between the waveguides has a smooth spatial shape. We show that the presented coupler operates as a complete achromatic optical switch for two coupled waveguides and as an equal superposition beam splitter for three coupled waveguides. An important feature of our devices is that they do not require larger coupling strength as compared to previous designs, which make them easier to realize in an experimental setting. Additionally, we show that the presented waveguide couplers operate at a shorter device length and are robust against variations in the coupling strength and the phase mismatch.
