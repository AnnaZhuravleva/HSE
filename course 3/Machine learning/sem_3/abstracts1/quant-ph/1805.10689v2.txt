We construct a quantum Markovian master equation for a driven system coupled to a thermal bath. The derivation utilizes an explicit solution of the driven system propagator, extending the validity beyond the adiabatic limit. The Non Adiabatic Master Equation (NAME) is derived employing the weak system-bath coupling limit. In addition, the NAME is valid when a separation of time-scale exists between the bath dynamics and the external driving. In contrast to the adiabatic Master equation, the NAME couples population and coherence. We demonstrate the NAME for a specific example of a time-dependent Harmonic oscillator, predicting squeezing of the system's state as a result of the external driving. Such dressing of the state leads to emergence of coherence associated with both the dissipative and unitary terms. The results are then compared both to numerical calculations and to the adiabatic master equation.
