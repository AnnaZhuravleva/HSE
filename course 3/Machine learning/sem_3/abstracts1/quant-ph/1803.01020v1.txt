We discuss the Bohmian mechanics by means of the deformed Schr\"odinger equation for position dependent mass, in the context of a $q$-algebra inspired by nonextensive statistics. A deduction of the Bohmian quantum formalism is performed by means of a deformed Fisher information functional, from which a deformed Cram\'er-Rao bound is derived. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, inherited by the $q$-algebra, are also developed. Then, we illustrate the results with a particle confined in an infinite square potential well. The preservation of the deformed Cram\'er-Rao bound for the stationary states shows the role played by the $q$-algebraic structure.
