The recent development of general quantum resource theories has given a sound basis for the quantification of useful quantum effects. Nevertheless, the evaluation of a resource measure can be highly non-trivial, involving an optimisation that is often intractable analytically or intensive numerically. In this paper, we describe a general framework that provides quantitative lower bounds to any resource quantifier that satisfies the essential property of monotonicity under the corresponding set of free operations. Our framework relies on projecting all quantum states onto a restricted subset using a fixed resource non-increasing operation. The resources of the resultant family can then be evaluated using a simplified optimisation, with the result providing lower bounds on the resource contents of any state. This approach also reduces the experimental overhead, requiring only the relevant statistics of the restricted family of states. We illustrate the application of our framework by focussing on the resource of multiqubit entanglement.
