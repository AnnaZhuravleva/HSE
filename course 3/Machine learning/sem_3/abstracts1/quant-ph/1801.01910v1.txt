In 2013, Farid and Vasiliev [arXiv:quant-ph/1310.4922] for the first time proposed a way to construct a protocol for the realisation of $"Classical\quad to\quad Quantum"$ one way hash function, a derivative of the Quantum one way function as defined by Gottesman and Chuang [Technical Report arXiv:quant-ph/0105032] and used for constructing quantum digital signatures. We, on the other hand, for the first time, propose the idea of a different kind of one way function which is $"quantum$-$classical"$ in nature, that is, it takes an $n$-qubit quantum state of a definite class as its input and produces a classical output. We formally define such a one way function and propose a way to construct and realise it. The proposed one way function turns out to be very useful in authenticating a quantum state in any quantum money scheme and so we can construct many quantum money schemes based on such a one way function. Later in the paper, we also give explicit construction of quantum money schemes like quantum bitcoins and quantum currency schemes, solely based on the proposed one way function. The security of such schemes can be explained on the basis of the security of the underlying one way functions.
