Inverse engineering of Hamiltonian (IEH) from an evolution operator is a useful technique for protocol of quantum control with potential applications in quantum information processing. In this paper we introduce a particular protocol to perform IEH and we show how this scheme can be used for implementing a set of quantum gates by using minimal quantum resources (such as entanglement, interactions between more than two quits or auxiliary quits). Remarkably, while previous protocols request three-quits interactions and/or auxiliary quits for implementing such gates, our protocol requires just two-qubit interactions and no auxiliary qubits. By using this approach, we can obtain a large class of Hamiltonians that allow us to implement single and two-quit gates necessary to quantum computation. To conclude this article, we analyze the performance of our scheme against systematic errors related to amplitude noise, where we show that the free parameters introduced in our scheme can be useful for enhancing the robustness of the protocol against such errors.
