We propose an experimentally feasible method for enhancing the atom-field coupling as well as the ratio between this coupling and dissipation (i.e., cooperativity) of two atoms in an optical cavity. Our method also enables the generation of steady-state nearly-maximal quantum entanglement. Our approach exploits optical parametric amplification to exponentially enhance the atom-cavity interaction and, hence, the cooperativity of the system, with the squeezing-induced fluctuation noise being completely eliminated. Thus, an effective cooperativity much larger than $100$ can be achieved even for modest values of a squeezing parameter. We demonstrate that the entanglement infidelity (which quantifies the deviation of the generated state from a maximally-entangled state) is exponentially smaller than the lower bound on the infidelities obtained in other dissipative entanglement preparations without applying squeezing. Thus, this infidelity can be arbitrarily small. Our generic method for enhancing atom-cavity cooperativities can be implemented in a wide range of physical systems, and it can provide diverse applications for quantum information processing based on entanglement.
