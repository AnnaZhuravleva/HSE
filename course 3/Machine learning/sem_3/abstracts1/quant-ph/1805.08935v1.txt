We experimentally demonstrate a real-time optical quantum random number generator by measuring vacuum fluctuation. Analysis towards the impact of practical system components is done to obtain higher min-entropy, in which min-entropy represents extractable quantum randomness. The corresponding min-entropy is calculated as 6.93 bits per sample in our experiment when system components' parameters are suitably adjusted. To bridge the speed gap between the fast randomness generation and the slow randomness extraction, we propose an optimized extraction algorithm based on parallel implementation of Toeplitz hashing to reduce the influence of classical noise due to the imperfection of devices. Notably, the final rate of real-time randomness extraction reaches the highest speed of 6 Gbps. And this supports the generation of 6 Gbps real-time random numbers, which is the fastest among the reported experiments based on the same entropy source.
