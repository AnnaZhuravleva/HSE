In this article, for the first time in the context of TOP trap, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the adiabatic evolution of weak field seeking states have been quantitatively examined. It has been well accepted since decades that adiabaticity has to be obeyed by the atoms for successful magnetic trapping. However, we show, on the contrary, that atoms can also be confined beyond the adiabatic limit. Hence, our findings open new possibilities to relax the restrictions of atom trapping in laboratories.
