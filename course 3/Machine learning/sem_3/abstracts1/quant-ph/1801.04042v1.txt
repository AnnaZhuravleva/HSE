Standard randomized benchmarking protocols entail sampling from a unitary 2 design, which is not always practical. In this article we examine randomized benchmarking protocols based on subgroups of the Clifford group that are not unitary 2 designs. We introduce a general method for analyzing such protocols and subsequently apply it to two subgroups, the group generated by controlled-NOT, Hadamard, and Pauli gates and that generated by only controlled-NOT and Pauli gates. In both cases the error probability can be estimated to within a factor of two or less where the factor can be arranged to be conservative and to decay exponentially in the number of qubits. For randomized benchmarking of logical qubits even better accuracy will typically be obtained. Thus, we show that sampling a distribution which is close to a unitary 2 design, although sufficient, is not necessary for randomized benchmarking to high accuracy.
