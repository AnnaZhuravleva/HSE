We present the Markovian quantum master equation describing rotational decoherence, friction, diffusion, and thermalization of planar, linear, and asymmetric rotors in contact with a thermal environment. It describes how an arbitrary initial rotation state decoheres and evolves toward a Gibbs-like thermal ensemble, as we illustrate numerically for the linear and the planar top, and it yields the expected rotational Fokker-Planck equation of Brownian motion in the semiclassical limit.
