We address the generalized uncertainty principle in scenarios of successive measurements. Uncertainties are characterized by means of generalized entropies of both the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis types. Here, specific features of measurements of observables with continuous spectra should be taken into account. First, we formulated uncertainty relations in terms of Shannon entropies. Since such relations involve a state-dependent correction term, they generally differ from preparation uncertainty relations. This difference is revealed when position is measured by the first. In contrast, state-independent uncertainty relations in terms of R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies are obtained with the same lower bounds as in the preparation scenario. These bounds are explicitly dependent on the acceptance function of apparatuses in momentum measurements. Entropic uncertainty relations with binning are discussed as well.
