To overcome the limitations of current quantum key distribution protocols based on single photons and photon polarizations, a coherent light-based photon key distribution protocol is presented for measurement-independent unconditional security and continuous variable operations, using a quantum superposition between the two paths of a Mach Zehnder interferometer. Due to the benefits of indistinguishability between the two pathways in a Mach Zehnder interferometer, the present protocol inherits detection loophole-free unconditional security and directional determinacy in the outputs, resulting in the determinacy in key distribution. Moreover, the proposed method is fully compatible with current optical systems, such that its operational speed and transmission distance have no practical limit. Thus, the proposed protocol can be implemented in multi-core fiber-optic communications networks in the near future.
