Disordered superconducting materials provide a new capability to implement novel circuit designs due to their high kinetic inductance. Here, we realize a fluxonium qubit in which a long NbTiN nanowire shunts a single Josephson junction. We explain the measured fluxonium energy spectrum with a nonperturbative theory accounting for the multimode structure of the device in a large frequency range. Making use of multiphoton Raman spectroscopy, we address forbidden fluxonium transitions and observe multilevel Autler-Townes splitting. Finally, we measure lifetimes of several excited states ranging from $T_\mathrm{1}=620$ ns to $T_\mathrm{1}=20$ $\mu$s, by applying consecutive $\pi$-pulses between multiple fluxonium levels. Our measurements demonstrate that NbTiN is a suitable material for novel superconducting qubit designs.
