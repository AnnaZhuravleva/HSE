Nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are sensitive probes of time-varying magnetic fields that can be used to identify unknown spin defects in their nearby environment. Performing spectral quantum measurements on such single quantum probes enables gaining information about the internal structure and dynamics of nearby spin defects that would otherwise be inaccessible through direct or indirect measurements with classical probes. Here, we identify a system composed of two electron-nuclear spin defects in a diamond crystal by performing a series of spectral identification measurements using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Besides enabling the identification of new spin defects and studies of their formation mechanisms, these techniques will be useful for scaling up quantum systems by converting environmental spin defects into quantum resources.
