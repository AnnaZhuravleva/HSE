The interplay between classical and quantum mechanical evolution in the optical centrifuge (OC) is discussed. The analysis is based on the quantum mechanical formalism starting from either the ground state or a thermal ensemble. Two resonant mechanisms are identified, i.e. the classical autoresonance and the quantum mechanical ladder-climbing, yielding different dynamics and rotational excitation efficiencies. The rotating wave approximation is used to analyze the two resonant regimes in the associated dimensionless two-parameter space and calculate the OC excitation efficiency. The results show good agreement between numerical simulations and theory and are relevant to existing experimental setups.
