Atom-like defects in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as a promising platform for quantum information science. Here we investigate single-photon emissions from atomic defects in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). We demonstrate the first optical modulation of the quantum emission from BNNTs with a near-infrared laser. This one-dimensional system displays bright single-photon emission as well as high stability at room temperature and is an excellent candidate for optomechanics. The fast optical modulation of single-photon emission from BNNTs shows multiple electronic levels of the system and has potential applications in optical signal processing.
