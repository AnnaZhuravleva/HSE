Many physicists believe that the EPR experiment exhibits instantaneous non-local effects. I argue below that an application of Born's Rule to EPR shows no such instantaneous effects and that EPR is consistent with full Lorentz invariance. I then discuss how it is possible to understand the EPR correlations for non-commuting spin components without recourse to non-local effects. Finally, I use these results to discuss the Free Will Theorem, which I formulate in a new way.
