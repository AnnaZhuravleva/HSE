We define a time continuous version of the concept of "local operations and classical communication" (LOCC), ubiquitous in quantum information theory. It allows us to construct GKLS master equations for particle systems that have (1) an arbitrary pair potential, and (2) local decoherence terms, but that do not entangle the constituents. The local decoherence terms take a particularly simple form if a principle of least decoherence is applied.
