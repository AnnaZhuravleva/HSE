Realization of fast fault-tolerant quantum gates on a single spin is the core requirement for solid-state quantum-information processing. As polarized light shows geometric interference, spin coherence is also geometrically controlled with light via the spin-orbit interaction. Here, we show that a geometric spin in a degenerate subspace of a spin-1 electronic system under a zero field in a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond allows implementation of optical non-adiabatic holonomic quantum gates. The geometric spin under quasi-resonant light exposure undergoes a cyclic evolution in the spin-orbit space, and acquires a geometric phase or holonomy that results in rotations about an arbitrary axis by any angle defined by the light polarization and detuning. This enables universal holonomic quantum gates with a single operation. We demonstrate a complete set of Pauli quantum gates using the geometric spin preparation and readout techniques. The new scheme opens a path to holonomic quantum computers and repeaters.
