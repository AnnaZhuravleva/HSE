Quantum technology in the near future will facilitate information processing using quantum computers on the small and intermediate scale of up to several dozens of qubits. We investigate entanglement cost required for one-shot quantum state merging, aiming at quantum state transformation on this scale. In contrast to existing coding algorithms achieving nearly optimal approximate quantum state merging on a large scale, we construct algorithms for exact quantum state merging so that the algorithms are applicable to any given state of an arbitrarily-small-dimensional system. In the algorithms, entanglement cost can be reduced depending on a structure of the given state derived from the Koashi-Imoto decomposition. We also provide an improved converse bound for exact quantum state merging achievable for qubits. Our results are applicable to distributed quantum information processing and multipartite entanglement transformation on a small and intermediate scale.
