The non-Markovia dynamics of quantum evolution plays an important role in open quantum sytem. However, how to quantify non-Markovian behavior and what can be obtained from non- Markovianity are still open questions, especially in complex solid systems. Here we address the problem of quantifying non-Markovianity with entanglement in a genuine noisy solid state system at room temperature. We observed the non-Markovianity of quantum evolution with entanglement. By prolonging entanglement with dynamical decoupling, we can reveal the non-Markovianity usually concealed in the environment and obtain detailed environment information. This method is expected to be useful in quantum metrology and quantum information science.
