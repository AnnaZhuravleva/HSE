We examine the entanglement properties of a system that represents two driven microwave cavities each optomechanically coupled to two separate driven optical cavities which are connected by a single-mode optical fiber. The results suggest that it may be possible to achieve near-maximal entanglement of the microwave cavities, thus allowing a teleportation scheme to enable interactions for hybrid quantum computing of superconducting qubits with optical interconnects.
