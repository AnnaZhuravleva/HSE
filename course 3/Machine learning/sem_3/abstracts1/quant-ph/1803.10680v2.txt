We begin by seeking the qubit-qutrit and rebit-retrit counterparts to the now well-established Hilbert-Schmidt separability probabilities for (the 15-dimensional convex set of) two-qubits of $\frac{8}{33} = \frac{2^3}{3 \cdot 11} \approx 0.242424$ and (the 9-dimensional) two-rebits of $\frac{29}{64} =\frac{29}{2^6} \approx 0.453125$. Based in part on extensive numerical computations, we advance the possibilities of a qubit-qutrit value of $\frac{27}{1000} = (\frac{3}{10})^3 =\frac{3^3}{2^3 \cdot 5^3} = 0.027$ and a rebit-retrit one of $\frac{860}{6561} =\frac{2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 43}{3^8} \approx 0.131078$. These four values for $2 \times m$ systems ($m=2,3$) suggest certain numerator/denominator sequences involving powers of $m$, which we further investigate for $m>3$. Additionally, we find that the Hilbert-Schmidt separability/PPT-probabilities for the two-rebit, rebit-retrit and two-retrit $X$-states all equal $\frac{16}{3 \pi^2} \approx 0.54038$, as well as more generally, that the probabilities based on induced measures are equal across these three sets of $X$-states. Then, we extend the generalized two-qubit framework introduced by Lovas and Andai from Hilbert-Schmidt measures to induced ones. For instance, while the Lovas-Andai two-qubit function is $\frac{1}{3} \varepsilon^2 (4 -\varepsilon^2)$, yielding $\frac{8}{33}$, its $k=1$ induced measure counterpart is $\frac{1}{4} \varepsilon ^2 \left(3-\varepsilon ^2\right)^2$, yielding $\frac{61}{143} =\frac{61}{11 \cdot 13} \approx 0.426573$, where $\varepsilon$ is a singular-value ratio. We investigate, in these regards, the possibility of extending the previously-obtained "Lovas-Andai master formula".
