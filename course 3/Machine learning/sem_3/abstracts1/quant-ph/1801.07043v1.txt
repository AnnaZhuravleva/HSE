In this paper we complete the study on the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy for Kitaev chains with long range pairing. We discover that when the couplings decay with the distance with a critical exponent new properties for the asymptotic growth of the entropy appear. The coefficient of the leading term is not universal any more and the connection with conformal field theories is lost. We perform a numerical and analytical approach to the problem showing a perfect agreement. In order to carry out the analytical study, a new technique for computing the asymptotic behaviour of block Toeplitz determinants with discontinuous symbols has been developed.
