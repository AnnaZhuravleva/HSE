This work is a continuation of previous works that we have done concerning linear canonical transformations and a phase space representation of quantum theory. It is mainly focused on the description of an approach which permits to establish spinorial representation of linear canonical transformations. It begins with an introduction section in which the reason and context of the content are discussed. The introduction section is followed by a brief recall about Clifford algebra and spin group. The description of the approach is started with the presentation of an adequate parameterization of linear canonical transformations which permits to represent them with special pseudo-orthogonal transformations in an operators space. The establishment of the spinorial representation is deduced using relation between special pseudo-orthogonal groups and spin groups. The cases of one dimension quantum mechanics and general multidimensional theory are both studied. The case of linear canonical transformation related to Minkowski space is particularly studied and it is shown that Lorentz transformation may be considered as particular case of linear canonical transformation. Some results from the spinorial representation are also exploited to define operators which may be used to establish equations for fields if one considers the possibility of envisaging a field theory which admits as main symmetry group the group constituted by linear canonical transformations.
