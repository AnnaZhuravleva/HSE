We propose a method for entangling two non-interacting qubits by measuring their parity indirectly through an intermediate mesoscopic system. The protocol is designed to require only global control and course-grained collective measurement of the mesoscopic system along with local interactions between the target qubits and mesoscopic system. A generalization of the method measures the hamming weight of the qubits' state and probabilistically produces an entangled state by post-selecting on hamming weight one. Our technique provides a new design element that can be integrated into quantum processor architectures and quantum measurement devices.
