We use a Magnus approximation at the level of the equations of motion for a harmonic system with a time-dependent frequency, to find an expansion for its in-out effective action, and a unitary expansion for the Bogoliubov transformation between in and out states. The dissipative effects derived therefrom are compared with the ones obtained from perturbation theory in powers of the time-dependent piece in the frequency, and with those derived using multiple scale analysis in systems with parametric resonance. We also apply the Magnus expansion to the in-in effective action, to construct reality and causal equations of motion for the external system. We show that the nonlocal equations of motion can be written in terms of a "retarded Fourier transform" evaluated at the resonant frequency.
