The precision of any measurement is ultimately limited by quantum mechanics, due to the intrinsic back action of quantum measurements. This is particularly relevant for nanoscale precision measurements where the sensor and the target to be measured are both quantum objects in close contact. A potential solution is to use weak measurements, where one tries to mitigate back action by minimally entangling sensor and probe. While weak measurements have been studied extensively in theory and demonstrated experimentally in superconducting qubits and other systems, practical quantum sensing has not yet reached the back action limit. Here, we achieve quantum sensing at the ultimate precision limit set by the measurement strength and demonstrate back-action free precision quantum measurement of a single nuclear spin. By carefully timing the quantum measurement to the precession of the single nuclear spin we reach a regime where the measurement back action is negligible, yielding quantum evolution of the target nuclear spin unperturbed by the measurement over a timescale of 100 ms and hence a frequency resolution of 3.4 Hz. Upon increasing the measurement strength we observe a phase transition to a state where the nuclear spin is coherently trapped during the measurement process. We expect the findings to be of pivotal importance for single molecule NMR and nuclear spin based quantum computing.
