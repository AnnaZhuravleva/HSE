In this article we investigate the role of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction as a useful resource to distil the bound entanglement in two qutrits. Here we study the distillability of Jurkowski et al. bound entangled states. We consider the close system of two qutrits prepared initially in bound entangled states and an auxiliary qutrit prepared in pure state. The auxiliary qutrit interacts with any one of the qutrit of the closed system through DM interaction. The composite system evolve under unitary dynamics. Taking the partial trace operation over the auxiliary qutrit, we show the distillability of Jurkowski et al. bound entangled states under DM interaction. It is interesting to investigate that probability amplitude of auxiliary qutrit do not play the role in dynamics, while DM interaction strength is responsible to free the bound entangled states, which can be further distilled. In this work we have used the computable cross norm realignment criteria to detect the bound entanglement and negativity have been used to measure the free entanglement.
