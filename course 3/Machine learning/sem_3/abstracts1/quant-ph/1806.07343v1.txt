The quantum Nash equilibrium in the thermodynamic limit is studied for games like quantum Prisoner's dilemma and the quantum game of chicken. A phase transition is seen in both games as a function of the entanglement in the game. We observe that for maximal entanglement irrespective of the classical payoffs, a majority of players choose Quantum strategy over Defect in the thermodynamic limit.
