We propose a framework of bit commitment protocol using a comparison scheme and present a compound comparison scheme based on counterfactual cryptography. Finally, we propose a counterfactual quantum bit commitment protocol. In security analysis, we give the proper security parameters for counterfactual quantum bit commitment and prove that intercept attack and intercept/resend attack are ineffective attack for our protocol. In addition, we explain that counterfactual quantum bit commitment protocol cannot be attacked with no-go theorem attack by current technology.
