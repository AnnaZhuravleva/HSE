Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a key exchange protocol which is implemented over free space optical links and optical fiber cable. When direct communication is not possible, QKD is performed over fiber cables, but the imperfections in detectors used at receiver side and also the material properties of fiber cables limit the long distance communication. Free space based quan- tum key distribution is free from such limitations, and can pave way for satellite based quantum communication to set up a global network for sharing secret messages. To implement free space optical (FSO) links, it is essential to study the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Here, an analysis is made for satellite based quantum communication using QKD protocols. The results obtained indicate that SARG04 protocol is an effective approach for satellite based quantum communication.
