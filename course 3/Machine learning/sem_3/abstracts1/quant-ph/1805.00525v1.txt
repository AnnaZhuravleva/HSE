In the nonadiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts that the formation of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time. In inhomogeneous systems, the critical point is reached locally and causality reduces the effective system size for defect formation to regions where the velocity of the critical front is slower than the second-sound velocity, favoring adiabatic dynamics. The reduced density of excitations exhibits a much steeper dependence on the quench rate and is also described by a universal power-law, that we demonstrated in a quantum Ising chain.
