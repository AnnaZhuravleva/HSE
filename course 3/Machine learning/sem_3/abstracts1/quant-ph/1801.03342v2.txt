Quantum emitters are characterized by their quantum light emission statistics. We propose quantum feedback as a new degree of freedom to address directly the photon distribution. The versatility of quantum feedback is demonstrated for the case of a pulsed two-level emitter. We show that single- and two-photon events respond qualitatively different to feedback. Single photon events are either enhanced or suppressed, depending on the choice of parameters. In contrast, two-photon events undergo exclusively an enhancement up to $50\%$. To approach time delayed quantum control, we give a numerical recipe how to efficiently simulate time-dependent excitation schemes as well as evaluating higher-order correlations within a time-discrete matrix-product state description.
