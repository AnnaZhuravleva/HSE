In a recent article [Phys. Rev. A 94, 052128 (2016)], the authors compute the predictions of two collapse models on the transition probabilities of neutral mesons. Notably, they claim to find an influence on the decay rates and attempt to prove that a new parameter $\theta(0)$ is required to fully characterize the noise of standard collapse models. These two claims are incorrect and motivated by flawed computations. This comment derives the correct transition probabilities exactly from the master equation, explains how they could be computed perturbatively in a safe way and finally shows where the main mistake of the authors of the original article was made.
