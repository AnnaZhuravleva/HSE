A recent paper [P. Martin-Dussaud, C. Rovelli, F. Zalamea, arXiv:1806.08150] has given a lucid treatment of Bell's notion of local causality within the framework of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, the authors went on to conclude that the quantum violation of Bell's notion of local causality is no more surprising than a common cause. Here, I argue that this conclusion is unwarranted by the authors' own analysis. On the contrary, within the framework outlined by the authors, I argue that the implications of the relational interpretation are much more radical.
