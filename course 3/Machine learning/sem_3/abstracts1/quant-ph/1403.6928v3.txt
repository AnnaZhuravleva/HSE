The purpose of this paper is to present a network realization theory for a class of mixed quantum-classical linear stochastic systems. Two forms, the standard form and the general form, of this class of linear mixed quantum-classical systems are proposed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for their physical realizability are derived. Based on these physical realizability conditions, a network synthesis theory for this class of linear mixed quantum-classical systems is developed, which clearly exhibits the quantum component, the classical component, and their interface. An example is used to illustrate the theory presented in this paper.
