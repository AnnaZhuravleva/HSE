Unambiguous quantum state discrimination, assisted by an auxiliary system, generally requires quantum correlations as a resource. A particular case of unambiguous quantum state discrimination requiring only quantum discord without entanglement was introduced by Roa \emph{et al}. [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.080401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 107}, 080401 (2011)}]. Also, after the resource-theoretic formulation of quantum coherence, the transformation relations between quantum coherence and quantum correlations have been studied extensively. We propose here a protocol that requires only coherence to unambiguously discriminate nonorthogonal quantum states, and also quantify the required coherence for the optimal unambiguous quantum state discrimination strategy in some particular cases.
