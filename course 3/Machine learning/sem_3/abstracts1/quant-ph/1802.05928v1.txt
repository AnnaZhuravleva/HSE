Nano- and micro-scale particles levitated in vacuum are of great interest due to their minimal coupling to the environment, enabling ultra-sensitive force sensing and explorations of quantum physics. Typically, such particles are optically levitated and cooled through their interaction with an optical cavity or via active feedback. These methods are limited by optical absorption leading to significant heating, instabilities when operating in high vacuum, and the recoil noise of the trapping light. A limited range of materials can be optically trapped in vacuum, with materials such as metals or nanobiological objects not possible due to heavy absorption. Here we analyse a scheme which avoids these issues, by electrically cooling charged particles levitated in a quadrupole ion trap. Through simulations, we investigate both passive resistive cooling and active feedback cooling, and explore cooling limits in the presence of realistic noise. Working in cryogenic environments would allow cooling to the quantum level. This all-electrical cooling and detection platform will complement existing optomechanical schemes, act as pre-cooling for quantum applications, and enable state-of-the-art force-sensing with an electrically-networked system.
