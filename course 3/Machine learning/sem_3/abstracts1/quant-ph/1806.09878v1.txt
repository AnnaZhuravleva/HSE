We study synchronization in a two-node network built out of the smallest possible self-sustained oscillator: a spin 1. We first demonstrate that phase locking between the quantum oscillators can be achieved, even for limit cycles that cannot be synchronized to an external semi-classical signal. Building upon the analytical description of the system, we then clarify the relation between quantum synchronization and the generation of entanglement. These findings establish the spin-based architecture as a promising platform for understanding synchronization in complex quantum networks.
