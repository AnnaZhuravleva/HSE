Free-space Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows two parties to share a random key with unconditional security, between ground stations, between mobile platforms, and even in satellite-ground quantum communications. Atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in transmittance, which further affect the quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the secure key rate. Previous post-selection methods to combat atmospheric turbulence require a threshold value determined after all quantum transmission. In contrast, here we propose a new method where we pre-determine the optimal threshold value even before quantum transmission. Therefore, the receiver can discard useless data immediately, thus greatly reducing data storage requirement and computing resource. Furthermore, our method can be applied to a variety of protocols, including, for example, not only single-photon BB84, but also asymptotic and finite-size decoy-state BB84, which can greatly increase its practicality.
