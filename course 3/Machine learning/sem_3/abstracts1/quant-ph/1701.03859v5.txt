In the paper, we give a characterization of arbitrary $n$-mode Gaussian coherence breaking channels (GCBCs) and show the tensor product of a GCBC and arbitrary a Gaussian channel maps all input states into product states. The inclusion relation among GCBCs, Gaussian positive partial transpose channels (GPPTC), entanglement breaking channels (GEBC) and Gaussian classical-quantum channels (GCQC) is displayed. Finally, we prove that Gaussian classical ($\chi$-) capacity for the tensor products of GCBCs and arbitrary Gaussian channels is additive.
