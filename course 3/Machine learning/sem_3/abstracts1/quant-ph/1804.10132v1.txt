Subvacuum effects arise in quantum field theory when a classically positive quantity, such as the local energy density, acquires a negative renormalized expectation value. Here we investigate the case of states of the quantized electromagnetic field with negative mean squared electric field, and their effects on the propagation of light pulses in a nonlinear dielectric material with a nonzero third order susceptibility. We identify two distinct signature of the subvacuum effect in this situation. The first is an increase in the speed of the pulse, which is analogous to the superluminal light propagation in gravity which can arise from negative energy density. This increase in speed leads to a phase shift which might be large enough to observe. The second effect is a change in the frequency spectrum of the pulse. We identify a specific measure of the modified spectrum which can signal the presence of a negative mean squared electric field.
