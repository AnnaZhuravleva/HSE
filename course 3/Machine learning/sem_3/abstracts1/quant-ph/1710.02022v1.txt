The time evolution of the Wigner function for Gaussian states generated by Lindblad quantum dynamics is investigated in the semiclassical limit. A new type of classical phase-space dynamics is obtained, where the Lindblad terms generally introduce a non-Hamiltonian flow. In addition to this classical phase-space dynamics, the Gaussian approximation yields dynamical equations for the covariances. The approximation becomes exact for linear Lindblad operators and a quadratic Hamiltonian. By viewing the Wigner function as a wave function on a coordinate space of doubled dimension, and the phase-space Lindblad equation as a Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, a further set of semiclassical equations are derived. These are also capable of describing the interference terms in Wigner functions arising in superpositions of Gaussian states, as demonstrated for a cat state in an anharmonic oscillator subject to damping.
