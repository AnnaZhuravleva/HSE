A two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-like atom with a relativistic Dirac electron, placed in a weak, static, uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the atomic plane, is considered. Closed forms of the first- and second-order Zeeman corrections to energy levels are calculated analytically, within the framework of the Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory, for an arbitrary electronic bound state. The second-order calculations are carried out with the use of the Sturmian expansion of the two-dimensional generalized radial Dirac-Coulomb Green function derived in the paper. It is found that, in contrast to the case of the three-dimensional atom [P. Stefa\'nska, Phys. Rev. A 92 (2015) 032504], in two spatial dimensions atomic magnetizabilities (magnetic susceptibilities) are expressible in terms of elementary algebraic functions of a nuclear charge and electron quantum numbers. The problem considered here is related to the Coulomb impurity problem for graphene in a weak magnetic field.
