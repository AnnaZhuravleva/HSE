Visual tracking (VT) is the process of locating a moving object of interest in a video. It is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with various applications in human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, and so on. In this paper, we address this problem for the first time in the quantum setting, and present a quantum algorithm for VT based on the framework proposed by Henriques et al. [IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., \textbf{7}, 583 (2015)]. Our algorithm comprises two phases, training and detection. In the training phase, to discriminate the object and background in the training frame, the algorithm trains a ridge regression classifier in the quantum state form where the optimal fitting parameters of ridge regression are encoded in the amplitudes. In the detection phase, the classifier is then employed to generate a quantum state whose amplitudes encode the responses of all the candidate image patches. The algorithm is shown to be polylogarithmic in scaling, when the image data matrices have low condition numbers, and therefore may achieve exponential speedup over its classical counterpart. As examples, we discuss two important applications related to VT, namely object disappearance detection and motion behavior matching. This work demonstrates the power of quantum computing in solving computer vision problems.
