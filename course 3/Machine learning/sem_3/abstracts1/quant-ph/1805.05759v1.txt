We present here a new type of cold atom interferometry gravimeter based on Bragg diffraction, which is able to increase the gravity measurement sensitivity and stability of common Raman atom gravimeters significantly. By comparing with Raman transition, the principles and advantages of Bragg diffraction-based atom gravimeters have been introduced. The theoretical model for a time-domain Bragg atom gravimeter with atomic incident direction parallels to the wave vector of Bragg lasers has been constructed. Some key technical requirements for an nth-order Bragg diffraction-based atom gravimeter have been deduced, including the temperature of atom cloud, the diameter, curvature radius, frequency, intensity, and timing sequence of Bragg lasers, etc. The analysis results were verified by the existing experimental data in discussion. The present study provides a good reference for the understanding and construction of a Bragg atom gravimeter.
