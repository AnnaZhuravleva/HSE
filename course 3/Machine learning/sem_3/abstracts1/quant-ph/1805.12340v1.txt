In this work, we present a multiple-scale perturbation technique suitable for the study of open quantum systems, which is easy to implement and in few iterative steps allows finding quite good approximate solutions. For any time-local master equation, whether markovian or non-makovian, in Lindblad form or not, we give a general procedure to construct analytical approximations to the corresponding dynamical map and, consequently, to the temporal evolution of the density matrix. As a simple illustrative example, we study an atom-cavity system described by a dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model, which does not have an exact analytical solution. Performing a multiple-scale analysis we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the strong and weak coupling regimes that allow us to identify characteristic time scales in the state of the physical system.
