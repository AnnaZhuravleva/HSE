We introduce collective geometric phases of bosons and fermions interfering on a linear unitary multiport, where each phase depends on the internal states of the particles, not affected by the multiport, and corresponds to a cycle of the symmetric group. We show that quantum interference of $N$ particles in generic pure internal states, i.e., with no pair being orthogonal, is governed by $(N-1)(N-2)/2$ independent triad phases (each involving only three particles). The deterministic distinguishability, preventing quantum interference with two or three particles, allows for the genuine $(N\ge 4)$-particle interference on a multiport: setting each particle to be distinguishable from all others except two by their internal states allows for a novel (circle-dance) interference of $N\ge 4$ particles, while simultaneously preventing the $R$-particle interference for $3\le R\le N-1$. The genuine $N$-particle interference manifests the $N$th order quantum correlations between the particles, it cannot be observed if at least one of the particles is lost, or if the internal states are resolved by a particle counting detection. The results can be useful for quantum computation, quantum information, and other quantum technologies with single photons.
