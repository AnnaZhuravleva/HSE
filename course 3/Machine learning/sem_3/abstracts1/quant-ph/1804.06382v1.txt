Current work presents a new approach to quantum color codes on compact surfaces with genus $g \geq 2$ using the identification of these surfaces with hyperbolic polygons and hyperbolic tessellations. We show that this method may give rise to color codes with a very good parameters and we present tables with several examples of these codes whose parameters had not been shown before. We also present a family of codes with minimum distance $d=4$ and the encoding rate asymptotically going to 1 while $n \rightarrow \infty$.
