We present a critical examination of the difficulties with the quantum versions of a lifted weight that are widely used as work storage systems in quantum thermodynamics. To overcome those difficulties, inspired by the relations between information and work, we propose the concept of informational work storage, in contrast with that of mechanical work storage underlying the idealization of a lifted weight. This novel concept features an information-theoretic notion of work as the ability to increase the information content of a reference system that is referred to as a work storage system. An informational work storage system based on maximally mixed qubits and capable of truly distinguishing work from heat is studied, and applied to the problem of single-shot work extraction in various extraction schemes. We show that for a given system state the maximum extractable work is independent of extraction scheme, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics.
