We introduce a framework for the construction of completely positive maps for subsystems of indistinguishable fermionic particles. In this scenario, the initial global state is always correlated, and it is not possible to tell system and environment apart. Nonetheless, a map in the operator sum representation is possible if the particles have only exchange correlation. To classify the correlations, we introduce a multipartite mutual information for indistinguishable particles.
