Non-Hermitian systems with parity-time symmetry have been developed rapidly and hold great promise for future applications. Unlike most existing works considering the symmetry of the free energy terms (e.g., gain-loss system), in this paper, we report that a realizable non-Hermitian interaction between two quantum resonances can also have a real spectrum after the exceptional point. That phenomenon is similar with that in the gain-loss system so that the non-Hermitian interaction can be an excellent substitute for quantum gain. Such a non-Hermitian interaction can be realized in designed optomechanics, and we find that its dynamics are in accordance with those of normal gain system as expected. As examples, the phase transition near the exceptional point and the induced chaos in weak nonlinear coupling are shown and analyzed for an intuitive visual. Our results provide a platform for realizing parity-time symmetry devices and studying properties of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.
