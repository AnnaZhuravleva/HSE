The main results of our work is determining the differences between limiting properties in various models of quantum stochastic walks. In particular, we prove that in the case of strongly connected and a class of weakly connected directed graphs, local environment interaction evolution is relaxing, and in the case of undirected graphs, global environment interaction evolution is convergent. For other classes of directed graphs we show, that the character of connectivity large influence on the limiting properties. We also study the limiting properties for the non-moralizing global interaction case. We demonstrate that the digraph observance is recovered in this case.
