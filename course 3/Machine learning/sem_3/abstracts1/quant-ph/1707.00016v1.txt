We study (non-perturbatively) the interactions of delta-coupled detectors with coherent states of a scalar field. We show that the time-evolved density matrix spectra of i) a single detector, ii) two detectors, and iii) the partial transpose of the latter, are all independent of which coherent state the field was in. Furthermore, we find that the eigenvalues in iii) are non-negative, implying that a delta-coupled detector pair cannot harvest entanglement from the vacuum, or any other coherent field state.
