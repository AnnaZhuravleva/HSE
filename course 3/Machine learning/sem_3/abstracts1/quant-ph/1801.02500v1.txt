The result of a numerical simulation of two interacting particles in the framework of Nonunitary Newtonian Gravity is presented here. Particles are held close together by a 3-d harmonic trap and interact with each other via an `electrical' delta-like potential and via the ordinary Newtonian term, together with a fluctuational nonunitary counterpart of the latter. Fundamental nonunitarity can be seen as arising from the interaction of the physical degrees of freedom with (gravitational) hidden copies of them. Starting from an energy eigenstate within the ordinary setting, it is shown that, while energy expectation remains constant, a slow net variation of the von Neumann entropy for the system as a whole takes place, with a small modulation induced on the relative entanglement entropy of the two particles. Besides, the simulation shows explicitly how fundamental gravity-induced entropy can be clearly distinguished from the subjective notion of coarse-grained entropy, i.e. from the entropy of one particle with respect to the `environment' of the other.
