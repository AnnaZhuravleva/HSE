In a previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 110501] we proved that every entangled quantum state can be used to implement a non-classical teleportation channel. Here we turn to the question of quantifying how non-classical these channels are. We define several quantifiers of non-classical teleportation which can be computed using semidefinite programming. Furthermore, we prove quantitative relations between these quantifiers and the amount of entanglement in the underlying states. Apart from providing further insight on the relation between teleportation and entanglement, our work introduces a method to estimate entanglement in a teleportation experiment.
