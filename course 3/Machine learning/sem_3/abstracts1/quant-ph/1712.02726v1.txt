An interesting aspect of antiferromagnetic quantum spin ladders, with complete dimer coverings, is that the wave function can be recursively generated by estimating the number of coverings in the valence bond basis, which follow the fabled Fibonacci sequence. In this work, we show that generalized forms of such sequences can also be derived for multi-legged and doped quantum spin ladders, which allows the corresponding dimer covered state to be recursively generated. This simplifies the investigation and estimation of several important quantities in these many-body quantum systems. In particular, we show that the valence bond entanglement entropy, which is a substantial figure of merit for understanding critical behavior, can be conveniently derived for large spin ladders.
