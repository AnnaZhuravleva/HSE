Multiphoton pair production is investigated by focusing on the momentum structures of produced pairs in the polarization plane for the two circularly polarized fields. Upon the momentum spectra, different from the concentric rings with the familiar Ramsey interference fringes for the same handedness, however, the obvious vortex structures are found constituted by the Archimedean spirals for two opposite handedness fields. The underlying physical reasons are analyzed and discussed. It is also found that the vortex patterns are sensitive to the relative carrier envelope phase, the time delay, and the handedness of two fields, which can be used to detect the applied laser field characteristics as a probe way.
