We provide an initial characterization of pairwise concurrence in quantum states which are in- variant under cyclic permutations of party labeling. We give a general description of maxiamally entangled states and explicit calculations of specific subsets of 4 and 5 qubit states - X states. We also construct a monogamy bound on shared concurrences in the same subsets in 4 and 5 qubits. These analytic results on the X-state subspace appear to generalize to all cyclically symmetric states in numerical experiments.
