The uncertainty principle is the most important feature of quantum mechanics, which can be called the heart of quantum mechanics. This principle sets a lower bound on the uncertainties of two incompatible measurement. In quantum information theory, this principle is expressed in terms of entropic measures. Entropic uncertainty bound can be altered by considering a particle as a quantum memory. In this work we investigate the entropic uncertainty relation under the relativistic motion. In our scenario, we consider the bipartite system in which Bob move away from inertial partner Alice with a uniform proper acceleration $a$. Bob prepares a particle in a quantum state (constructed from the free fermionic mode) and sends it to Alice. We will show that the quantum information stored initially in B would be degraded, So as a result, we will have an inevitable increase in the uncertainty of the Alic's measurement outcome. In this work we look at the Unruh effect as a quantum noise.one can show that the Unruh effect is an amplitude-damping-like channel with zero temperature, even though the Unruh effect is Related to a non-zero temperature.
