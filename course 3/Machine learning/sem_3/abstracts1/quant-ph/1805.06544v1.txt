Rapid preparation, manipulation, and correction of spin states with high fidelity are requisite for quantum information processing and quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a fast and robust approach for controlling two spins with Heisenberg and Ising interactions. By using the concept of shortcuts to adiabaticity, we first inverse design the driving magnetic fields for achieving fast spin flip or generating the entangled Bell state, and further optimize them with respect to the error and fluctuation. In particular, the designed shortcut protocols can efficiently suppress the unwanted transition or control error induced by anisotropic antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange. Several examples and comparisons are illustrated, showing the advantages of our methods. Finally, we emphasize that the results can be naturally extended to multiple interacting spins and other quantum systems in an analogous fashion.
