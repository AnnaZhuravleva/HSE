Quantum coherence characterizes the non-classical feature of a single party system with respect to a local basis. Based on a recently introduced resource framework, coherence can be regarded as a resource and be systematically manipulated and quantified. Operationally, considering the projective measurement of the state in the computational basis, coherence quantifies the intrinsic randomness of the measurement outcome conditioned on all the other quantum systems. However, such a relation is only proven when randomness is characterized by the Von-Neumann entropy. In this work, we consider several recently proposed coherence measures and relate them to the general uncertainties of the projective measurement outcome conditioned on all the other systems. Our work thus provides a unified framework for redefining several coherence measures via general conditional entropies. Based on the relation, we numerically calculate the coherence measures via semi-definite programming. Furthermore, we discuss the operational meaning of the unified definition. Our result highlights the close relation between single partite coherence and bipartite quantum correlation.
