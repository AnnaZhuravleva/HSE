We focus on a hidden Markovian process whose internal hidden system is given as a quantum system, and we address a sequence of data obtained from this process. Using a quantum version of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the cumulant generating function of the sample mean of the data. Using these bound, we derive the central limit theorem and large and moderate deviations for the tail probability. Then, we give the asymptotic variance is given by using the second derivative of the cumulant generating function. We also derive another expression for the asymptotic variance by considering the quantum version of fundamental matrix. Further, we explain how to extend our results to a general probabilistic system.
