Superluminal communications have been proposed to solve the Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) paradox. So far, no evidence for these superluminal communications has been obtained and only lower bounds for the superluminal velocities have been established. In this paper we describe an improved experiment that increases by about two orders of magnitude the maximum detectable superluminal velocities. The locality, the freedom-of-choice and the detection loopholes are not addressed here. No evidence for superluminal communications has been found and a new higher lower bound for their velocities has been established.
