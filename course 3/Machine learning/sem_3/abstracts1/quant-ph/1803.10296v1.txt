Considering recent advancements and successes in the development of efficient quantum algorithms for electronic structure calculations --- alongside similarly impressive results using machine learning techniques for computation --- hybridizing quantum computing with machine learning for the intent of perform electronic structure calculations is a natural progression. Here we present a hybrid quantum algorithm employing a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine to obtain accurate molecular potential energy surfaces. The Boltzmann machine trains parameters within an Ising-type model which exists in thermal equilibrium. By exploiting a quantum algorithm to optimize the underlying objective function, we obtained an efficient procedure for the calculation of the electronic ground state energy for a system. Our approach achieves high accuracy for the ground state energy of a simple diatomic molecular system such as H2, LiH, H2O at a specific location on its potential energy surface. With the future availability of larger-scale quantum computers and the possible training of some machine units with the simple dimensional scaling results for electronic structure, quantum machine learning techniques are set to become powerful tools to obtain accurate values for ground state energies and electronic structure for molecular systems.
