We experimentally demonstrate a shaken lattice interferometer. Atoms are trapped in the ground Bloch state of a red-detuned optical lattice. Using a closed-loop optimization protocol based on the dCRAB algorithm, we phase-modulate (shake) the lattice to transform the atom momentum state. In this way, we implement an atom beamsplitter and build five interferometers of varying interrogation times $T_I$. The sensitivity of shaken lattice interferometry is shown to scale as $T_I^2$, consistent with simulation [1]. Finally, we show that we can measure the sign of an applied signal and optimize the interferometer in the presence of a bias signal.   [1] C. A. Weidner, H. Yu, R. Kosloff, and D. Z. Anderson, Phys.
