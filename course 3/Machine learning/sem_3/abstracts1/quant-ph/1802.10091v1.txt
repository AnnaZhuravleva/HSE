The development of quantum information platforms such as quantum computers and quantum simulators that will rival classical Turing computations are typically viewed as a threat to secure data transmissions and therefore to crypto-systems and financial markets in general. We propose to use such platforms as a proof-of-work protocol for blockchain technology, which underlies cryptocurrencies providing a way to document the transactions in a permanent decentralised public record and to be further securely and transparently monitored. We reconsider the basis of blockchain encryption and suggest to move from currently used proof-of-work schemes to the proof-of-work performed by analog Hamiltonian optimisers. This approach has a potential to significantly increase decentralisation of the existing blockchains and to help achieve faster transaction times, therefore, removing the main obstacles for blockchain implementation. We discuss the proof-of-work protocols for a few most promising optimiser platforms: quantum annealing hardware based on D-wave simulators and a new class of gain-dissipative simulators.
