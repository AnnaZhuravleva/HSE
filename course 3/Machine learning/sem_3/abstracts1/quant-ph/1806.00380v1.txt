Quantum tomography is currently the mainly employed method to assess the information of a system and therefore plays a fundamental role when trying to characterize the action of a particular channel. Nonetheless, quantum tomography requires the trust that the devices used in the laboratory perform state generation and measurements correctly. This work is based on the theoretical framework for the device-independent inference of quantum channels that was recently developed and experimentally implemented with superconducting qubits in [Dall'Arno, Buscemi, Vedral, arXiv:1805.01159] and [Dall'Arno, Brandsen, Buscemi, PRSA 473, 20160721 (2017)]. Here, we present a complete experimental test on a photonic setup of two device-independent quantum channels falsification and characterization protocols to analyze, validate, and enhance the results obtained by conventional quantum process tomography. This framework has fundamental implications in quantum information processing and may also lead to the development of new methods removing the assumptions typically taken for granted in all the previous protocols.
