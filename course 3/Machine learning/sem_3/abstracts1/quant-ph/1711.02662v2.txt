Bit-commitment is a fundamental cryptographic task, in which Alice commits a bit to Bob such that she cannot later change the value of the bit, while, simultaneously, the bit is hidden from Bob. It is known that ideal bit-commitment is impossible within quantum theory. In this work, we show that it is also impossible in generalised probabilistic theories (under a small set of assumptions) by presenting a quantitative trade-off between Alice's and Bob's cheating probabilities. Our proof relies crucially on a formulation of cheating strategies as cone programs, a natural generalisation of semidefinite programs. In fact, using the generality of this technique, we prove that this result holds for the more general task of integer-commitment.
