High-harmonic generation (HHG) of a two-level-system driven by an intense monochromatic phase-locked laser is studied in terms of complex spectral analysis with the Floquet method. In contrast to the phenomenological approaches, this analysis deals with the whole process as a coherent quantum process based on microscopic dynamics. The spectral decomposition corresponding to the contributions of the Floquet resonance and dressed continuous states of the total system have been obtained. The calculated HHG spectrum exhibits the characteristic features of the HHG from solids. We found that the quantum interference of the Floquet resonance states is responsible for the transition from the adiabatic to the stationary regime in the HHG process and that the phase of the driving laser controls the dynamics of the HHG photon emission.
