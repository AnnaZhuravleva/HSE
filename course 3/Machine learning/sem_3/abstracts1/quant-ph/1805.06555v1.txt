In this paper we introduced a novel model of quantum transistor based on coupled quantum oscillators devoted to linear optical quantum information processing tasks. To this end, we show how a single quantum oscillator can be used as a quantum switch, where its energy gap could work as an adjustable potential barrier to block or allow quantum information current from source to the drain. We argue about how such device could be useful for implementing high fidelity single-qubit phase-shift gates, as well as a two-qubit control-Z gate. To end, we study the performance of coupled-oscillators-based quantum transistors against decohering reservoir. From numerical calculations, we conclude that the high fidelities of our transistor can be kept for a large range of the parameters associated with the decohering environment.
