We demonstrate that quantum Fisher information and superradiance can be formulated as coherence measures in accordance with the resource theory of coherence, thus establishing a direct link between metrological information, superradiance and coherence. We also show that the trivial coherence measure has a metrological interpretation. The arguments are then generalized to show that coherence may be considered as the underlying fundamental resource for any functional of state that is first of all faithful, and second of all concave or linear. Arguments are then presented that show quantum Fisher information and the superradiant quantity are in fact antithetical resources in the sense that if coherence were directed to saturate one quantity, then it must come at the expense of the other. Finally, a key result of the paper is to demonstrate that coherence, quantum Fisher information, superradiant quantity, and entanglement are mutually interconvertible resources under incoherent operations.
