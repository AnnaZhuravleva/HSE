Quantum channels can be activated by a kind of channels whose quantum capacity is zero. This activation effect might be useful to overcome noise of channels by attaching other channels which can enhance the capacity of a given channel. In this work, we show that such an activation is possible by specific positive-partial-transpose channels for Gaussian lossy channels whose quantum capacities are known. We also test more general case involving Gaussian thermal attenuator whose the exact value of quantum capacity has been unknown so far. For a recently suggested narrow upper bound on quantum capacity of the thermal attenuator, we confirm the fact that an activation of quantum capacity occurs as well. This result is applicable for realistic situations in which Gaussian channels describe the noises of communication systems.
