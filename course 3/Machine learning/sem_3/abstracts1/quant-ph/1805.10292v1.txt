We discuss a class of quantum theories which exhibit a sharply increased memory storage capacity due to emergent gapless degrees of freedom. Their realization, both theoretical and experimental, is of great interest. On the one hand, such systems are motivated from a quantum information point of view. On the other hand, they can provide a framework for simulating systems with enhanced capacity of pattern storage, such as black holes and neural networks. In this paper, we develop an analytic method that enables us to find critical states with increased storage capabilities in a generic system of cold bosons with weak attractive interactions. The enhancement of memory capacity arises when the occupation number $N$ of certain modes reaches a critical level. Such modes, via negative energy couplings, assist others in becoming effectively gapless. This leads to degenerate microstates labeled by the occupation numbers of the nearly-gapless modes. In the limit of large $N$, they become exactly gapless and their decoherence time diverges. In this way, a system becomes an ideal storer of quantum information. We demonstrate our method on a prototype model of $N$ attractive cold bosons contained in a one-dimensional box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Although we limit ourselves to a truncated system, we observe a rich structure of quantum phases with a critical point of enhanced memory capacity.
