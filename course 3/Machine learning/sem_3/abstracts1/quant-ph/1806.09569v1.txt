Quantum correlation and its measurement are essential in exploring fundamental quantum physics problems and developing quantum enhanced technologies. Quantum correlation may be generated and manipulated in different spaces, which demands different measurement approaches corresponding to position, time, frequency and polarization of quantum particles. In addition, after early proof-of-principle demonstrations, it is of great demand to measure quantum correlation in a Hilbert space large enough for real quantum applications. When the number of modes goes up to several hundreds, it becomes economically unfeasible for single-mode addressing and also extremely challenging for processing correlation events with hardware. Here we present a general and large-scale measurement approach of Correlation on Spatially-mapped Photon-Level Image (COSPLI). The quantum correlations in other spaces are mapped into the position space and are captured by single-photon-sensitive imaging system. Synthetic methods are developed to suppress noises so that single-photon registrations can be faithfully identified in images. We eventually succeed in retrieving all the correlations with big-data technique from tens of millions of images. We demonstrate our COSPLI by measuring the joint spectrum of parametric down-conversion photons. Our approach provides an elegant way to observe the evolution results of large-scale quantum systems, representing an innovative and powerful tool added into the platform for boosting quantum information processing.
