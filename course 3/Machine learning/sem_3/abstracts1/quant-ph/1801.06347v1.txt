Identifying the property of the world that enforces the Born rule is a longstanding problem in physics. We prove that in any physical theory that assigns probabilities to the outcomes of ideal measurements, the maximal set of probability assignments for each graph of exclusivity is the one that satisfies the Born rule. Therefore, the agreement between quantum theory and experiments follows from a one-to-one correspondence between the logical possibilities and the physical possibilities and, in particular, implies that the outcomes of quantum measurements are not constrained by any physical reason.
