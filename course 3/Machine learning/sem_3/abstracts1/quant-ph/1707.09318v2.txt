Simple joint measurements of pairs of observables reveal that states considered universally as classical-like, such as SU(2) spin coherent states, Glauber coherent states, and thermal states are actually nonclassical. We show that this holds because we can find a joint measurement the statistics of which is not separable. Eventually this may be extended to all states different from the maximally mixed state.
