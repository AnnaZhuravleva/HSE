We study the problem of estimating a function of many parameters acquired by sensors that are distributed in space, e.g., the spatial gradient of a field. We restrict ourselves to a setting where the distributed sensors are probed with experimentally practical resources, namely, field modes in separable displaced thermal states, and focus on the optimal design of the optical receiver that measures the phase-shifted returning field modes. Within this setting, we demonstrate that a locally optimal measurement strategy, i.e., one that achieves the standard quantum limit for all phase shift values, is a Gaussian measurement, and moreover, one that is separable. We also demonstrate the utility of adaptive phase measurements for making estimation performance robust in cases where one has little prior information on the unknown parameters. In this setting we identify a regime where it is beneficial to use structured optical receivers that entangle the received modes before measurement.
