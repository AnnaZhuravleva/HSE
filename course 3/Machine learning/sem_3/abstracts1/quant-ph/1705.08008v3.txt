We study incompatibility of measurements and its relation to steering and nonlocality in a class of finite dimensional general probabilistic theories (GPT).The basic idea is to represent finite collections of measurements as affine maps of a state space into a polysimplex and show that incompatibility is characterized by properties of these maps. We introduce the notion of an incompatibility witness and show its relation to incompatibility degree. We find the maximum incompatibility degree attainable by pairs of two-outcome quantum measurements and characterize state spaces for which incompatibility degree attains maximal values possible in GPT. As examples, we study the spaces of classical and quantum channels and show their close relation to polysimplices. This relation explains the super-quantum non-classical effects that were observed on these spaces.
