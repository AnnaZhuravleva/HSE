A geometric theory of the irreducible tensor operators of quantum spin systems. It is based upon the Maxwell-Sylvester geometric representation of the multipolar electrostatic potential. In the latter, an order-$\ell$ multipolar potential is represented by a collection of $\ell$ equal length vectors, i.e. by $\ell$ points on a sphere, instead of by its components on some fixed (but arbitrary) basis. The geometric representation offers a much more appropriate tool for getting physical insight on specific characteristics of a multipole, such as its symmetries, or its departure from ideal symmetry. We derive explicit expressions enabling to perform any calculations we may need to perform on multipoles. All relevant quantities are eventually expressed in terms of scalar products of pairs of vectors (i.e., in terms of geometric quantities such as lengths and angles). The whole formalism is entirely independent of any particular choice of coordinate, and needs no use of the somehow abstract formalism traditionally used when dealing with angular momenta.   The formalism is then applied to treat the problem of the irreducible tensor operators of quantum spin systems. It enables to completely dispense with the calculation and use of the Stevens operators, which can be quite complicated even for moderate values of $\ell$. Explicit expressions for the calculation of expectations values of physical observables are derived. They essentially consist in combinations of scalar products of vector pairs. Together with the coherent state representation of the quantum states of spin systems, this provides a complete geometric, coordinate-free, description of the states, dynamics and physical properties of these systems.
