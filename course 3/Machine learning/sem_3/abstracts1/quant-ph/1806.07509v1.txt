Derivation of the analytic expressions of the position and momentum wave functions of the Dirichlet and Neumann circular quantum wells allows an efficient calculation of the corresponding quantum information measures, such as Shannon entropy $S$, Fisher information $I$ and Onicescu energy $O$ for arbitrary principal $n$ and magnetic $m$ quantum numbers. A comparative analysis between the two types of the boundary conditions demonstrates the decreasing difference between the measures for the larger indexes what is explained by the lesser sensitivity of the higher-energy quantum states to the interface requirement. Mathematical results for $S$, $I$ and $O$ are explained from physical point of view; for instance, unrestricted decrease (increase) at $|m|$ or $n$ tending to infinity of the position component of the entropy (Onicescu energy) is due to the transition from the quantum regime to the quasi-classical description. On the example of the lowest-energy Neumann orbital, it is demonstrated that i) the radial linear momentum operator is not a self-adjoint one and ii) two-dimensional entropic uncertainty relation is stronger than its Heisenberg counterpart.
