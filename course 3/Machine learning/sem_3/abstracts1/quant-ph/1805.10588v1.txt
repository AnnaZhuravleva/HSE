Previously, we built up a set of photon-free quantum random number generator(QRNG) with InGaAs single photon avalanche diodes. We exploited the stochastic property of quantum tunneling effect. Here, we utilized tunneling signals in Si diodes to implement quantum random number generator. In our experiment, instead of applying periodic pulses between the diode as we did in the InGaAs QRNG, we applied fixed voltage and detect time intervals between adjacent tunneling signals, as random source. This Si QRNG has a high performance in the randomness of its raw data and almost post-processing-free. Final data rate in our experiment is 6.98MB/s and could reach 23MB/s if the temperature-control system is ameliorated.
