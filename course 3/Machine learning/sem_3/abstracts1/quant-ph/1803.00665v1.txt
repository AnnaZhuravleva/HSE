We investigate the detailed properties of Observational entropy, introduced in arXiv:1707.09722 [quant-ph] as a generalization of Boltzmann entropy to quantum mechanics. This quantity is well-defined out of equilibrium, and generically rises to the correct thermodynamic value even in a genuinely closed quantum system. The quantity contains several other entropy definitions as special cases, it has interesting information-theoretic interpretations, and mathematical properties -- such as extensivity and upper and lower bounds -- suitable for an entropy. Here we describe and provide proofs for many of its properties, discuss its interpretation and connection to other quantities, and provide numerous simulations and analytic arguments supporting the claims of its relationship to thermodynamic entropy. This quantity may thus provide a clear and well-defined foundation on which to build a satisfactory understanding of the second thermodynamical law in quantum mechanics.
