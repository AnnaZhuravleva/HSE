We present a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium thermal states. The method depends upon classically computing a sparse approximation to the density matrix, and then time-evolving each matrix element via the quantum computer. For this exploratory study, we investigate the time-dependent Heisenberg model with five spins on the Rigetti Forest quantum virtual machine and a one spin system on the Rigetti 8Q-Agave quantum processor.
