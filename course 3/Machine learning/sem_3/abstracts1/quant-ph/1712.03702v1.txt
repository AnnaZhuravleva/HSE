The concept of quantum superposition is reconsidered and discussed from the viewpoint of Bohmian mechanics, the hydrodynamic picture of quantum mechanics, in order to elucidate its physical consequences beyond the simple mathematical idea of linearly combining vectors in a Hilbert space. Specifically, the discussion is focused around the connection between the symmetries displayed by the wave function and the behavior of the quantum flux, when the latter is analyzed in terms of streamlines (Bohmian trajectories). This will be illustrated by means of a series of analytical results and numerical simulations, including Young's two-slit experiment, counter-propagating wave packets, grating diffraction and quantum carpets (e.g., Talbot carpets), and diffraction under confinement conditions. Accordingly, it seems that quantum paradoxes appear whenever symmetries related to interference are neglected in the interpretation and understanding of the corresponding phenomena.
