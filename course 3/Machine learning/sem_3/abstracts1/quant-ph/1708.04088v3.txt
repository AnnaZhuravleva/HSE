We first consider quantum communication protocols between a sender Alice and a receiver Bob, which transfer Alice's quantum information to Bob by means of non-local resources, such as classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement. In these protocols, we assume that Alice and Bob may have quantum side information, not transferred. In this work, these protocols are called the state transfer with quantum side information. We determine the optimal costs for non-local resources in the protocols, and study what the effects of the use of quantum side information are. Our results can give new operational meanings to the quantum mutual information and the quantum conditional mutual information, which directly provide us with an operational interpretation of the chain rule for the quantum mutual information.
