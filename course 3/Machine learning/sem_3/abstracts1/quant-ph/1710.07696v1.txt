We demonstrate that a numerical linked cluster expansion method is a powerful tool to calculate quantum dynamics. We calculate the dynamics of the magnetization and spin correlations in the two-dimensional transverse field Ising and XXZ models evolved from a product state. Such dynamics are directly probed in ongoing experiments in ultracold atoms, molecules, and ions. We show that a numerical linked cluster expansion gives dramatically more accurate results at short-to-moderate times than exact diagonalization, and simultaneously requires fewer computational resources. More specifically, the cluster expansion frequently produces more accurate results than an exact diagonalization calculation that would require $10^{5}$--$10^{10}$ more computational operations and memory.
