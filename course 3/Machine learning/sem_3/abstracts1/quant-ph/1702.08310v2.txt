We revisit the Fermi two-atoms problem in the framework of disordered systems. In our model we consider a two-qubits system linearly coupled with a quantum massless scalar field. We analyze the energy transfer between the qubits under different experimental perspectives. In addition, we assume that the coefficients of the Klein-Gordon equation are random functions of the spatial coordinates. The disordered medium is modeled by a centered, stationary and Gaussian process. We demonstrate that the classical notion of causality emerges only in the wave zone in the presence of random fluctuations of the light cone. Possible repercussions are discussed.
