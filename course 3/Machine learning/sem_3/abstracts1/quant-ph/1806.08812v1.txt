In standard quantum theory, time is not an observable. It enters as a parameter in the Schr\"odinger equation, but there is no measurement operator associated to it. Nevertheless, one may take an operational viewpoint and regard time as the information one can read from clocks. The Alternate Ticks Game, introduced in arXiv:1506.01373, is a completely operational means to quantify the accuracy of time scales generated by clocks. The idea is to count the number of ticks that two copies of a clock can produce until they run out of synchronisation. Here we investigate the performance of stochastic clocks in this game. These are clocks which are classical in the sense that they do not exploit quantum coherence. Our results support earlier conjectures that their accuracy grows linearly in the size of the clockwork, measured in terms of the dimension of the associated Hilbert space. In particular, we derive explicit bounds on the accuracy of a natural class of stochastic clocks, the stochastic ladder clocks.
