We develop the resource theory of private randomness extraction in the distributed and device-dependent scenario. We begin by introducing the notion of independent bits (ibits), which are bipartite states that contain ideal private randomness for each party, and motivate the natural set of the allowed free operations. As the main tool of our analysis, we introduce Virtual Quantum State Merging (VQSM), which is essentially the flip side of Quantum State Merging, without the communication. We focus on the bipartite case and find the rate regions achievable in different settings. Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out that local noise can boost randomness extraction. As a consequence of our analysis, we resolve a long-standing problem by giving an operational interpretation for the reverse coherent information in terms of the number of private random bits obtained by sending quantum states from one honest party (server) to another one (client) via the eavesdropped quantum channel.
