We consider the transfer functions describing the input-output relation for a class of linear open quantum systems involving feedback with nonzero time delays. We show how such transfer functions can be factorized into a product of terms which are transfer functions of canonical physically realizable components. We prove under certain conditions that this product converges, and can be approximated on compact sets. Thus our factorization can be interpreted as a (possibly infinite) cascade. Our result extends past work where linear open quantum systems with a state-space realization have been shown to have a pure cascade realization [Nurdin, H. I., Grivopoulos, S., & Petersen, I. R. (2016). The transfer function of generic linear quantum stochastic systems has a pure cascade realization. Automatica, 69, 324-333.]. The functions we consider are inherently non-Markovian, which is why in our case the resulting product may have infinitely many terms.
