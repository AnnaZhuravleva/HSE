We present uncertainty relations based on Wigner--Yanase--Dyson skew information with quantum memory. Uncertainty inequalities both in product and summation forms are derived. \mbox{It is} shown that the lower bounds contain two terms: one characterizes the degree of compatibility of two measurements, and the other is the quantum correlation between the measured system and the quantum memory. Detailed examples are given for product, separable and entangled states.
