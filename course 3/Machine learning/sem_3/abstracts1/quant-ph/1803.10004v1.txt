Ultracold molecules can be formed from ultracold atoms by photoassociation involving a spontaneous emission process, resulting in a number of final states. Here, we propose to use coupling to an optical cavity with high cooperativity to selectively enhance the creation of a certain final state. During this process, a photon will be emitted into the cavity mode which can be detected. We discuss the efficiency and the dynamics of cavity-assisted molecule formation in the frame of realistic parameters that can be achieved in current ultracold-atom setups. In particular, we consider the production of Rb$_2$ molecules in the $a^3\Sigma_u$ ground state. Moreover, when working with more than two atoms in the cavity, collective enhancement effects in chemistry should be observable.
