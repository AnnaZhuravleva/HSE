Because of the intrinsic robustness, adiabatic evolutions find a broad range of applications in quantum state engineering, quantum computing, and quantum simulation. According to the original form of the quantum adiabatic theorem, for a process to remain adiabatic, its rate of change at all times must be much smaller than the energy gap of the Hamiltonian. On the other hand, in order to avoid perturbations from the environment high rates of change are desirable. This tension imposes severe limitations on the practical use of adiabatic methods. Current approaches to obtain adiabatic evolution within system coherence times are shortcuts to adiabaticity by using intricate schemes of additional counterdiabatic driving fields which however can be exceedingly challenging to implement experimentally. Here, we investigate the roles of energy gaps in quantum adiabatic processes by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond. We demonstrate experimentally that energy gaps may vanish while maintaining adiabatic evolution, a result that challenges traditional views. This shows that dynamic phases are more fundamental than energy gaps in quantum adiabatic evolution, the key insight that allows us to overcome the limits on evolution times imposed by the traditional form of the adiabatic theorem and to achieve, within experimental uncertainties, unit fidelity quantum adiabatic processes in finite time. The results provide a deeper understanding on quantum adiabatic processes, as well as promising strategies and directions in the control of quantum systems.
