We examine the generation and entanglement of discrete system-time history states. These states arise for a quantum reference clock of finite dimension and lead to a unitary evolution of system states when satisfying a static discrete Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation. We first analyze their different representations, showing that for any given initial system state there is a "proper time" clock basis for which the evolution corresponds to a constant Hamiltonian. It is also shown that while their entanglement depends normally on the initial state, it becomes maximum and independent of the latter when the evolution operators form a complete orthogonal set, in which case the history state can be generated with a simple two-clock scheme. We then provide an analytic evaluation of the quadratic system-time entanglement entropy, showing it satisfies strict upper and lower bounds determined by the energy spread and the geodesic evolution connecting the initial and final states. We finally show that the unitary operator that generates the history state can itself be considered as an operator history state, whose quadratic entanglement entropy determines its entangling power. Simple measurements on the clock enable to efficiently determine overlaps between system states and also evolution operators at any two times.
