Electron-electron correlation forms the basis of difficulties encountered in many-body problems. Accurate treatment of the correlation problem is likely to unravel some nice physical properties of matter embedded in this correlation. In an effort to tackle this many-body problem, two complementary parameter-free pseudopotentials for $n$-electron atoms and ions are suggested in this study. Using one of the pseudopotentials, near-exact values of the groundstate ionization potentials of helium, lithium, and berrylium atoms have been calculated. The other pseudopotential also proves to be capable of yielding reasonable and reliable quantum physical observables within the non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
