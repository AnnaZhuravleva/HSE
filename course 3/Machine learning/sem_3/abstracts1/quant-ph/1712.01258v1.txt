In this work, we will show how the topological order of the Toric Code appears when the lattice on which it is defined discretizes a three-dimensional torus. In order to do this, we will present a pedagogical review of the traditional two-dimensional Toric Code, with an emphasis on how its quasiparticles are conceived and transported. With that, we want to make clear not only how all these same quasiparticle conception and transportation fit into this three-dimensional model, but to make it clear how topology controls the degeneracy of ground state in this new situation.
