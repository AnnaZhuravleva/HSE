We propose to generate macroscopic superposition states of a large number of atoms in the ground state of a three-mode spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. The ground state is protected by a finite energy gap, is immune to phase noise, and the measurement of the number of particles in one mode heralds the coherent preparation of the two other modes simultaneously empty and filled. Highly entangled macroscopic superposition states are generated with large probability also taking into account quasi-adiabatic preparation of the ground state. All the key ingredients necessary to realize our proposal are experimentally available.
