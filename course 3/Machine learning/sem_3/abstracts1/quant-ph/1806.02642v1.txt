We introduce a novel generalization of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) game to a multiplayer setting, i.e., Hypercube game, where all $m$ players are required to assign values to vertices on corresponding facets of an $m$-dimensional hypercube. The players win if and only if their answers satisfy both parity and consistency conditions. We completely characterize the maximum winning probabilities (game value) under classical, quantum and no-signalling strategies, respectively. In contrast to the original CHSH game designed to demonstrate the superiority of quantumness, we find that the quantum advantages in the Hypercube game significantly decrease as the number of players increase. Notably, the quantum value decays exponentially fast to the classical value as $m$ increases, while the no-signalling value always remains to be one.
