We use tools from non-standard analysis to formulate the building blocks of quantum field theory within the framework of categorical quantum mechanics. Building upon previous work, we construct an object of $^\star\!\operatorname{Hilb}$ having quantum fields as states and we show that the usual ladder and field operators can be defined as suitable endomorphisms. We deal with relativistic normalisation and we obtain the Lorentz invariant Heisenberg picture operators. By moving to a `coherent' perspective---where the `classical' time and momentum parameters are replaced by wavefunctions over the parameter spaces---we show that ladder operators and field operators can be obtained by applying the same morphism to plane waves and delta functions respectively. Finally, we formulate the commutation relations diagrammatically and we use them to derive the propagator.
