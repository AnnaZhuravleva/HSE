We experimentally emulate the non-Markovian dynamics of a pure dephasing spin-boson model at zero temperature. Specifically, we use a randomized set of external radio-frequency fields to engineer a desired ohmic noise power-spectrum to effectively realize a non-Markovian environment for a single NMR qubit. The information back-flow characteristic to the non-Markovianity is captured in the non-monotonicity of decoherence function and von Neumann entropy of the system. Using such emulated non-Markovian environments, we experimentally show the inefficiency of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill dynamical decoupling sequence to inhibit the loss of coherence. Finally, we design an optimized dynamical decoupling sequence which utilizes the information back-flow to maximize coherence protection for non-Markovian environments.
