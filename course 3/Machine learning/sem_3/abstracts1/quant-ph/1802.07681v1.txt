We study a quantum Stirling cycle which extracts work using quantized energy levels. The work and the efficiency of the engine depend on the length of the potential well, and the Carnot efficiency is achieved in a low temperature limiting case. We show that the lack of information about the position of the particle inside the potential well can be converted into useful work without resorting to any measurement. In the low temperature limit, we calculate the amount of work extractable from distinguishable particles, fermions and bosons.
