We demonstrate fast counting and multiphoton detection abilities of a Silicon Photo Multiplier (SiPM). In fast counting mode we are able to detect two consecutive photons separated by only 2.3 ns corresponding to 430 MHz. The counting efficiency for small optical intensities at a wavelength of 532 nm was found to be around 8.3% with a dark count rate of 50 kHz at T=-7 degrees Celsius. Using the SiPM in multiphoton detection mode, we find a good signal discrimination for different numbers of simultaneous detected photons.
