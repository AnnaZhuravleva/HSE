Using spatial modes for quantum key distribution (QKD) has become highly topical due to their infinite dimensionality, promising high information capacity per photon. However, spatial distortion reduce the feasible secret key rates and compromise the security of the quantum channel. In an extreme form, such a distortion would be blocking the channel almost completely with an obstacle. By controlling the radial degree of freedom of a photon's spatial mode, we are able to demonstrate high-dimensional QKD through obstacles with self-reconstructing single photons. We construct high-dimensional mutually unbiased bases using spin-orbit hybrid states that are radially modulated with a non-diffracting Bessel-Gaussian (BG) profile, and show secure transmission through partially obstructed quantum links. Using a prepare-measure protocol we report higher quantum state self-reconstruction and information retention for the non-diffracting BG modes as compared to Laguerre-Gaussian modes, obtaining a quantum bit error rate (QBER) that is up to 3 times lower. This work highlights the importance of controlling the radial mode of single photons in quantum information processing and communication.
