We investigate the optimal quantum state distribution from cloud to many spatially separated users by measure-broadcast-prepare scheme without the availability of quantum channel. The quantum information equally distributed from cloud to arbitrary number of users is generated at each port by ensemble of known quantum states with assistance of classical information of measurement outcomes by broadcasting. The obtained quantum state for each user is optimal in the sense that the fidelity universally achieves the upper bound. We present the universal quantum state distribution by providing physical realizable measurement bases in the cloud as well as the reconstruction method for each user. The quantum information distribution scheme works for arbitrary many identical pure input states in general dimensional system.
