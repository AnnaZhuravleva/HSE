We are considering the time-dependent transport through a discrete system, consiting of a quantum dot T-coupled to an infinite tight-binding chain. The periodic driving that is induced on the coupling between the dot and the chain, leads to the emergence of a characteristic multiple Fano resonant profile in the transmission spectrum. We focus on investigating the underlying physical mechanisms that give rise to the quantum resonances. To this end, we use Floquet theory for calculating the transmission spectrum and in addition employ the Geometric Phase Propagator (GPP) approach [Ann. Phys. 375, 351 (2016)] to calculate the transition amplitudes of the time-resolved virtual processes, in terms of which we describe the resonant behavior. This two fold approach, allows us to give a rigorous definition of a quantum resonance in the context of driven systems and explains the emergence of the characteristic Fano profile in the transmission spectrum.
