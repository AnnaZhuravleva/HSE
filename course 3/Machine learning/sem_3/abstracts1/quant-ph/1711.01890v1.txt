We investigate entangled qudits evolving under random, local $SU(d)$ operations and demonstrate that this evolution is constrained by intrinsic bounds, showing robust features of two-qudit entangled states that can be useful for fault tolerant implementations of phase gates. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations and confirmed by experiments on liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits.
