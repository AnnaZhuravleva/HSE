We apply the strategy of the back action evading measurement of a quadrature component of mechanical motion of a test mass to detection of a classical force acting on the mass (Science, 209, (1980) 547) and study both classical and quantum limitations of the technique. We are considering a resonant displacement transducer interrogated with a dichromatic optical pump as a model system in this study. The transducer is represented by a Fabry Perot cavity with a totally reflecting movable end mirror the resonant force of interest acts upon. The cavity is pumped with two coherent optical carriers equally detuned from one of the cavity resonances. We show that the quantum back action cannot be completely excluded from the measurement result due to the dynamic instability of the opto-mechanical system that either limits the allowable power of the optical pump or calls for introducing an asymmetry to the pump configuration destroying the quantum nondemolition nature of the measurement.
