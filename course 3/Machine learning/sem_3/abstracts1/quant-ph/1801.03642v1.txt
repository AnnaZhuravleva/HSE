We show that semiclassical theories are inconsistent since evolution transfers nonclassical features to the classical subsystem and nonquantum behavior to the quantum subsystem. We specially aim at interaction between light and a two-level atom, and we also illustrate it via the coupling of two harmonic oscillators. Quantum and classical systems are treated on the same grounds via the Wigner-Weyl phase-space correspondence of the quantum theory.
