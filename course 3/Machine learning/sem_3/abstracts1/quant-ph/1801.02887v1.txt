We investigate fast transport and spin manipulation of tunable spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a moving harmonic trap. Motivated by the concept of "shortcuts to adiabaticity", we design inversely the time-dependent trap position and spin-orbit coupling strength. By choosing appropriate boundary conditions we obtain fast transport and spin flip simultaneously. The non-adiabatic transport and relevant spin dynamics are illustrated with numerical examples, and compared with the adiabatic transport with constant spin-orbit-coupling strength and velocity. Moreover, the influence of nonlinearity induced by interatomic interaction is discussed in terms of the Gross-Pitaevskii approach, showing the robustness of the proposed protocols. With the state-of-the-art experiments, such inverse engineering technique paves the way for coherent control of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in harmonic traps.
