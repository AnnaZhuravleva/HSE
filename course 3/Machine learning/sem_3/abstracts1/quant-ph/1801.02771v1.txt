We propose a protocol based on coherent states and linear optics operations for solving the appointment-scheduling problem. Our main protocol leaks strictly less information about each party's input than the optimal classical protocol, even when considering experimental errors. Along with the ability to generate constant-amplitude coherent states over two modes, this protocol requires the ability to transfer these modes back-and-forth between the two parties multiple times with low coupling loss. The implementation requirements are thus still challenging. Along the way, we develop new tools to study quantum information cost of interactive protocols in the finite regime.
