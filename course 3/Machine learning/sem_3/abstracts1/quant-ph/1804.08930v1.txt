Two quantum states of two half-charge optical vortexes with an azimuthally relative angle pi are orthogonal, whereby two half-charge spiral phase plates with intersection angle pi can be used to demonstrate a parabolic coincident fringe in Bell inequality experiment with high-dimensional two-photon orbital angular momentum entanglement and then obtain a strong Bell's parameter 3.2. I theoretically demonstrate various orthogonal relations between two quantum states, each of which is with the rotational symmetry superposition made up of n fractional orbital angular momentum states, where n is of N. I propose a Bell inequality experiment with two n-section spiral phase plates that are with these two quantum states, whereby various angle periods of parabolic coincident fringes 2*pi/n and in each of periods Bell's parameter 3.2 can be obtained.
