Robust quantum state transfer (QST) is an indispensable ingredient in scalable quantum information processing. Here we present an experimentally feasible scheme for robust QST via topologically protected edge states in superconducting circuits. Using superconducting X-mon qubits with tunable couplings, the generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models with topological magnon bands can be constructed. A novel entanglement-dependent topological Thouless pumping can be directly observed in this system. More importantly, we show that single-qubit states and entanglement can be robustly transferred with high fidelity in the presence of qubit-coupling imperfection, which is a hallmark of topological protection. This approach is experimentally applicable to a variety of quantum systems.
