In the quantum world correlations can take form of entanglement which is known to be monogamous. In this work we show that another type of correlations, indistinguishability, is also restricted by some form of monogamy. Namely, if particles A and B simulate bosons, then A and C cannot perfectly imitate fermions. Our main result consists in demonstrating to what extent it is possible.
