The system identification problem is to estimate dynamical parameters from the output data, obtained by performing measurements on the output fields. We investigate system identification for quantum linear systems. Our main objectives are to address the following general problems: (1) Which parameters can be identified by measuring the output? (2) How can we construct a system realisation from sufficient input-output data? (3) How well can we estimate the parameters governing the dynamics? We investigate these problems in two contrasting approaches; using time-dependent inputs or time-stationary (quantum noise) inputs.
