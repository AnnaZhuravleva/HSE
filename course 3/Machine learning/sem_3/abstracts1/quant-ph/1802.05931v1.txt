We develop a real-time Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo approach for the modeling of driven-dissipative open quantum systems. The method enables stochastic sampling of the Liouville-von-Neumann time evolution of the density matrix, thanks to a massively parallel algorithm, thus providing estimates of observables on the non-equilibrium steady state. We present the underlying theory, and introduce initiator technique and importance sampling to reduce the statistical error. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying it to the driven- dissipative two-dimensional XYZ spin model on lattice.
