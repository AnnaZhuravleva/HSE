Quantum systems are currently gaining momentum, however, a general "Single-Source Multi-Use" system for quantum-information processing and networks does not yet exist. A virtual state, the so-called "dressed state," is a potential host with an increased number of hybridizations of quantum physical systems with various operational ranges. Herein, we give an experimental demonstration of a dressed state using an electron and a nuclear spin in a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The dressed state was generated via electromagnetically inducing with microwave (mw) and radio-frequency (rf) fields, which operational ranges differ. The experimental results open up new quantum and semi-classical hybrid systems with the devices on different operational ranges in superconductivity and spintronics.
