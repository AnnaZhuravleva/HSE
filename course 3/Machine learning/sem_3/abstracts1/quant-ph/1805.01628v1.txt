The pilot wave interpretation proposed by de Broglie and later by Bohm contains not only a dynamical ontology but also relies on a statistical assumption known as quantum equilibrium. In this work which follows our recent article [1] we develop a Langevin force description of the relaxation process which leads to quantum equilibrium. Based on a application of the Caldera-Leggett model for a thermal bath we show how a Brownian motion leads naturally to quantum relaxation.
