We have obtained the commutation relation for a cavity mode driven by coherent light and interacting with a two-level atom. We have found that the commutation relation for a free cavity mode with or without photons is just the usual commutation relation. However, the commutation relation for a cavity mode, which is interacting with a two-level atom, turns out to be different from the usual one.
