Non-Gaussian continuous-variable quantum states represent a pivotal resource in many quantum information protocols. Production of such states can occur through photonic subtraction process either at the transmitter side prior to sending a state through the channel, or at the receiver side on receipt of a state that has traversed the channel. In the context of quantum protocols implemented over communication channels to and from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites it is unclear what photonic subtraction set-up will provide for the best performance. In this work we show that for a popular version of continuous-variable Quantum Key Distribution between terrestrial stations and LEO satellites, photon subtraction at the transmitter side is the preferred set-up. Such a result is opposite to that found for fiber-based implementations. Our results have implications for all future space-based missions that seek to take advantage of the opportunities offered by non-Gaussian quantum states.
