In physics, causality has two faces. Traditionally, causality meant that states evolve according to a deterministic law. Recently, due to the influence of quantum information theory and statistical modeling, causality has also come to be understood as the power to influence the probability of an event by manipulating its causes. This raises some new questions: are causal relations properties of systems in themselves, or are they relative properties of a system and an observer (where an `observer' may here be construed as another physical system)? Does causality play any role in restricting the amount by which quantum systems can violate classical inequalities? In this work, I argue that causal relations are observer-dependent. Leveraging a result of the Quantum Bayesian (QBist) program, I argue that the Born rule can be interpreted as a causal principle, which serves to define bounds on quantum correlations. An interesting side-effect of this approach is that the resulting causal model turns out to be symmetric under reversal of the direction of causality, suggesting that the orientation of cause and effect is a genuinely observer-dependent feature of causality that has no meaning in a system independently of its observation.
