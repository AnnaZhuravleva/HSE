We propose a usage of a weak value for a quantum processing between preselection and postselection. While the weak value of a projector of 1 provides a process with certainty like the probability of 1, the weak value of -1 negates the process completely. Their mutually opposite effect is approved without a conventional `weak' condition. In addition the quantum process is not limited to be unitary; in particular we consider a loss of photons and experimentally demonstrate the negation of the photon loss by using the negative weak value of -1 against the positive weak value of 1.
