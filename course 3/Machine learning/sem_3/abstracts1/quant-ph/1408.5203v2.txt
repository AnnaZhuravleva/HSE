We explore theoretically the optical response properties in an optomechanical system under electromagneti- cally induced transparency condition but with the mechanical resonator being driven by an additional coherent field. In this configuration, more complex quantum coherent and interference phenomena occur. In partic- ular, we find that the probe transmission spectra depend on the total phase of the applied fields. Our study also provides an efficient way to control propagation of amplification.
