The cooperative resonance for a spin one half system interacting with dc and ac magnetic field is considered. This interaction in the system collective regime can result in parametic resonance and rapid excitation of the excited spin state of the dense atomic gas. The phenomenon is studied using the density matrix approach. We discuss the implementation of this effect and possible applications of the quantum amplification by superradiant emission of radiation.
