The need for a measure of coherence which does not change under the change of basis has been recognized long before. The resource-theoretical framework proposed by Baumgratz \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401, (2014) for quantifying coherence in high-dimensional quantum systems is manifestly basis-dependent and has implications incongruent with the conventional understanding of coherence. In contrast, within the conventional, optical coherence theory, the coherence of a 2-dimensional system can be quantified in terms of a basis-independent quantity called the degree of polarization $P_2$. The quantity $P_2$ has five different known physical interpretations, namely: (i) It is the Frobenius distance between the state and identity matrix (ii) it is the norm of the Bloch-vector representing the state, (iii) it is the visibility of an interference experiment, (iv) it is the maximum pairwise-coherence of the state over all orthonormal bases, and (v) it is determined by the weightage of the pure part of the state. Recently, Yao \textit{et al.}, Sci. Rep. 6, 32010, (2016) have constructed a basis-independent measure of coherence $P_{N}$ for $N$-dimensional quantum states by generalizing the Frobenius distance interpretation of $P_2$. In this paper, we demonstrate that all the remaining interpretations of $P_{2}$ generalizes to $P_N$ as well. Our results theoretically establish the suitability of $P_{N}$ as an intrinsic measure of coherence. This measure can be used for quantifying coherence in high-dimensional quantum states in orbital-angular-momentum and photon number bases.
