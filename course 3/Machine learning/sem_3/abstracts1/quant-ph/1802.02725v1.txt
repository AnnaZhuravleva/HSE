Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol, whose security analysis does not rely on any assumption on the detection system, can immune all the detection attacks. We give a first composable security analysis for continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution using squeezed states against general coherent attacks. The security analysis is derived based on the entanglement-based scheme considering finite size effect. A version of state-independent entropic uncertainty relation is exploited to give a lower bound on the conditional smooth min-entropy, thus the security analysis does not rely on any assumption about the measured state. The simulation results indicate that, in the universal composable security framework, the protocol can tolerate 2.5 dB and 6.5 dB channel loss against coherent attacks with direct and reverse reconciliation, respectively.
