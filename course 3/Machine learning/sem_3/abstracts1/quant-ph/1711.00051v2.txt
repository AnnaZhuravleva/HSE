Digital quantum simulators are among the most appealing applications of a quantum computer. Here we propose a universal, scalable, and integrated quantum computing platform based on tunable nonlinear electromechanical nano-oscillators. It is shown that very high operational fidelities for single and two qubits gates can be achieved in a minimal architecture, where qubits are encoded in the anharmonic vibrational modes of mechanical nanoresonators, whose effective coupling is mediated by virtual fluctuations of an intermediate superconducting artificial atom. An effective scheme to induce large single-phonon nonlinearities in nano-electromechanical devices is explicitly discussed, thus opening the route to experimental investigation in this direction. Finally, we explicitly show the very high fidelities that can be reached for the digital quantum simulation of model Hamiltonians, by using realistic experimental parameters in state-of-the art devices, and considering the transverse field Ising model as a paradigmatic example.
