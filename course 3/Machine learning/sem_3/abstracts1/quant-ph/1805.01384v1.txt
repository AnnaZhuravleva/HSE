We show that a very large class of quantum pure states of isolated macroscopic bodies, which are superpositions of energy eigenstates within arbitrary finite energy intervals, have sharply peaked energy distributions, with their width relative to the average, scaling between $\sim N^{-1}$ and $\sim N^{-1/2}$, with $N \gg 1$, the number of atoms conforming the body. The implication of this statement is that closed systems in those states are {\it microcanonical} in the sense that, in their evolution and relaxation to equilibrium, visit only energy eigenstates very near to the mean energy. Since thermodynamics accurately describes processes of macroscopic bodies and requires that closed systems have constant energy, we argue that these pure states are typical of those systems. The main assumption beneath the energy sharpness is that the isolated body can reach thermal equilibrium if left unaltered.
