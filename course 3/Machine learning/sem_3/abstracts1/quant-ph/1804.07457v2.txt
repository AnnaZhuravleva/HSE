A two-pass fiber-optic quantum key distribution system with phase-encoded photon states in synchronization mode has been investigated. The possibility of applying the analytical expressions for the calculation of the correct detection probability of the signal time window at synchronization has been proved. A modernized algorithm of photon pulse detection, taking into account the dead time of the single-photon avalanche photodiode was proposed. The method of engineering an optical pulse detection process during the synchronization in a quantum key distribution system has been offered.
