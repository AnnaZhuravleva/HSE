On-demand generation of indistinguishable single- and multi-photon states is a key technology for scaling up optical quantum information and communication applications. Nonlinear parametric photon-pair sources and heralded single-photon sources (HSPSs) had been the most standard resource of quantum information applications for decades. However, the intrinsic uncertainty of the produced number of photon pairs in such sources is a critical drawback that prevents on-demand photon-pair and heralded single-photon generation. Here we demonstrate large-scale time multiplexing of indistinguishable heralded single photons, employing a low-loss HSPS and adjustable delay line. We observed 66.7% presence probability of single-photon states collected into a single-mode optical fiber by multiplexing 40 periodic time bins of heralded single photons. To our knowledge, this is the highest fiber-coupled single-photon probability achieved to date. A high indistinguishability (~90%) of our time-multiplexed photons has also been confirmed. We also experimentally investigate trade-off relations of single-photon probability and unwanted multi-photon contribution by using different pump powers for a HSPS. Our results demonstrate that low-loss, large-scale multiplexing can realize highly efficient single-photon generation as well as highly scalable multi-photon generation from inefficient HSPSs. We predict that our large-scale time multiplexing will pave the way toward generation of > 30 coincident photons with unprecedented efficiencies, enabling a new frontier in optical quantum information processing.
