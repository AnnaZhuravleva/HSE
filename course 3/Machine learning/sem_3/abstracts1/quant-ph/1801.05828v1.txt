We provide exact analytical solutions for a two dimensional explicitly time-dependent non-Hermitian quantum system. While the time-independent variant of the model studied is in the broken PT-symmetric phase for the entire range of the model parameters, and has therefore a partially complex energy eigenspectrum, its time-dependent version has real energy expectation values at all times. In our solution procedure we compare the two equivalent approaches of directly solving the time-dependent Dyson equation with one employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld method of invariants. We conclude that the latter approach simplifies the solution procedure due to the fact that the invariants of the non-Hermitian and Hermitian system are related to each other in a pseudo-Hermitian fashion, which in turn does not hold for their corresponding time-dependent Hamiltonians. Thus constructing invariants and subsequently using the pseudo-Hermiticity relation between them allows to compute the Dyson map and to solve the Dyson equation indirectly. In this way one can bypass to solve nonlinear differential equations, such as the dissipative Ermakov-Pinney equation emerging in our and many other systems.
