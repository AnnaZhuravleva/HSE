We theoretically study non-destructive detection of ultracold molecules, using a Fabry-Perot cavity. Specifically, we consider vacuum Rabi splitting where we demonstrate the use of collective strong coupling for detection of molecules with many participating energy levels. We also consider electromagnetically induced transparency and transient response of light for the molecules interacting with a Fabry-Perot cavity mode, as a mean for non-destructive detection. We identify the parameters that are required for the detection of molecules in the cavity electromagnetically induced transparency configuration. The theoretical analysis for these processes is parametrized with realistic values of both, the molecule and the cavity. For each process, we quantify the state occupancy of the molecules interacting with the cavity and determine to what extent the population does not change during a detection cycle.
