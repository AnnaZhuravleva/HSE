Entangled light can provide a seminal improvement in resolution sensitivity even without achieving Heisenberg limit in a single channel. In this paper, based on the back-of-the-envelope type calculations, I demonstrate an alternative path to space based long-arm interferometer. Its advantage with respect to LISA is that it does not require complex satellites with many active components to achieve similar resolution.
