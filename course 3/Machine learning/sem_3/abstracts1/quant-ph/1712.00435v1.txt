We investigate the electron and nuclear spin coherence properties of ytterbium ($\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$) ions with non-zero nuclear spin, within an yttrium orthosilicate (Y$_2$SiO$_5$) crystal, with a view to their potential application in quantum memories or repeaters. We find electron spin-lattice relaxation times are maximised at low magnetic field ($<100$ mT) where $g~\sim6$, reaching 5 s at 2.5 K, while coherence times are maximised when addressing ESR transitions at higher fields where $g\sim0.7$ where a Hahn echo measurement yields $T_2$ up to 73 $\mu$s. Dynamical decoupling (XY16) can be used to suppress spectral diffusion and extend the coherence lifetime to over 0.5 ms, close to the limit of instantaneous diffusion. Using Davies electron-nuclear-double-resonance (ENDOR), we performed coherent control of the $^{173}\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ nuclear spin and studied its relaxation dynamics. At around 4.5 K we measure a nuclear spin $T_1$ and $T_2$ of 4 and 0.35 ms, respectively, about 4 and 14 times longer than the corresponding times for the electron spin.
