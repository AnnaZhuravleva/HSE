We investigate the relation between the ballistic spreading and entanglement between the internal (spin) and external (position) degrees of freedom in one-dimensional discrete time quantum walks. We obtain closed-form expressions for the long-time position variance and asymptotic entanglement of quantum walks whose time evolution is given by any balanced quantum coin, starting from any initial qubit and position states following a delta-like (local) and Gaussian distributions. We find out that the knowledge of long-time expected position together with the polar angle of the initial qubit provide the asymptotic entanglement for local states, while the expected position with the quantum coin phases give it for highly delocalized states.
