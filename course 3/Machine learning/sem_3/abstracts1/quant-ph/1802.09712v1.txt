We present a method to map the evolution of photonic random walks that is compatible with nonclassical input light. Our approach is based on the insight that tuning the jumping rate between spatial modes can be equivalent to varying the evolution time. In a proof-of-principle demonstration we reconstruct the evolution of photons through an array of coupled waveguides by tuning the coupling coefficient and monitoring the end-face. This approach enables direct observation of mode occupancy at arbitrary resolution, extending the utility of photonic random walks for quantum simulations and related applications.
