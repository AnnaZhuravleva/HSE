Why does controlling quantum phenomena appear easy to achieve? Why do effective quantum controls appear easy to find? Why is chemical synthesis and property optimization easier than expected? How to explain the commonalities across the optimal control applications in quantum mechanics, chemistry, material science, biological evolution and engineering? The theory of quantum control landscapes (QCL) is developed by Prof. Rabitz and his colleagues to address these puzzling questions. Unfortunately, the obtained conclusions are subject of gross misinterpretations which are spread in hundreds of published papers. We investigate, summarize and report several previously unknown subtleties of the QCL theory which have far-reaching implications for nearly all practical applications.
