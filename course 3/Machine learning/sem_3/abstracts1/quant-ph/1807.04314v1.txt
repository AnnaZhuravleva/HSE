A quantum particle in an infinite one-dimensional well potential is considered. Let the boundaries of well changes in a finite time $T$. The standard methods for calculating probability of transition from an initial to the final state are in general inapplicable since the states of different wells belong to different Hilbert spaces. If the final well covers only a part of the initial well (and, possibly, some outer part of the configuration space), the total probability of the transition from any stationary state of the initial well into {\bf all} possible states of the final well is less than 1 at $T\to 0$. If the problem is regularized with a finite-height potential well, this missing probability can be understood as a non-zero probability of transitions into the continuous spectrum, despite the fact that this spectrum disappears at the removal of regularization. This phenomenon ("transition to nowhere") can result important phenomena in some fundamental problems. We discuss also how to calculate the probabilities of discussed transitions at final $T$ for some ranges of parameters.
