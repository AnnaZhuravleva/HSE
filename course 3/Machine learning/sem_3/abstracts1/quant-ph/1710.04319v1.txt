The optimal quantum control theory is employed to determine electric pulses capable of producing quantum gates with high fidelity (higher than 0.9997). Particularly, these quantum gates were chosen to perform the permutation algorithm (Z. Gedik et al., Scientific reports 5, 14671, (2015).) in hybrid qubits in a double quantum dot (DQD) platform. The permutation algorithm is an oracle based quantum algorithm that solves the problem of the permutation parity faster than a classical algorithm without the necessity of entanglement between particles. The only requirement for achieving the speedup is the use of a one-particle quantum system with at least three levels. The high fidelity found in our results is closely related to quantum speed limit, which is a measure of how fast a quantum state can be manipulated. Furthermore, our scheme can be used for the practical realization of different quantum algorithms in DQDs.
