We summarise the main results that follow from our theory of frequency- and time-resolved photon correlations, which provides exact computations in nontrivial systems. We illustrate the theory with original results as interesting cases can be picked up from the endless configurations that abound in any quantum optical system. In particular, we compare our exact results with previous approximations, upgrade correlations to the case of photon bundles as otherwise no clear physical picture emerge, highlight the interest of measuring away from the peaks in rich landscapes of correlations and emphasize the joint time and frequency aspect of our theory.
