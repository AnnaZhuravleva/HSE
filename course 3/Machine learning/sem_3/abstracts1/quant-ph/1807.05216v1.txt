Motion of a charged particle in uniform magnetic field has been studied in detail, classically as well as quantum mechanically. However, classical dynamics of a charged particle in non-uniform magnetic field is solvable only for some specific cases. We present in this paper, a general integral equation for some specific class of non-uniform magnetic field and its solutions for some of them. We also examine the supersymmetry of Hamiltonians in exponentially decaying magnetic field with radial dependence and conclude that this kind of non-uniformity breaks supersymmetry.
