Einstein`s equivalence principle states the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and corresponding inertial field in an accelerated reference frame. However, to what extent the equivalence principle remains valid in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is a controversial issue. To avoid violation of the equivalence principle, Bargmann`s superselection rule forbids a coherent superposition of states with different masses. Here we suggest a quantum simulation of non-relativistic Schr\"odinger particle dynamics in non-inertial reference frames, which is based on propagation of polarization-entangled photon pairs in curved and birefringent optical waveguides and Hong-Ou-Mandel quantum interference measurement. The photonic simulator can emulate superposition of mass states, which would lead to violation of the EP.
