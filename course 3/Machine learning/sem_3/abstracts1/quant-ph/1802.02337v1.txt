We propose a quantum interference cooling scheme for a nano-mechanical resonator (NAMR) in a hybrid optomechanical system, where the atoms are trapped in an optomechanical cavity, coupling to an additional optical cavity. The absorption of the optomechanical resonator can be modified by quantum interference effects induced by the atom-cavity and cavity-cavity couplings independently. With the employment of the quantum interference, the desired transition for cooling is enhanced, along with the heating suppression due to the undesired transition. As a result, the NAMR vibration can be cooled down to its ground state. Particularly, with the assistance of the atoms, our scheme is experimentally feasible even for lower qualities cavities, which much reduces the experimental difficulty.
