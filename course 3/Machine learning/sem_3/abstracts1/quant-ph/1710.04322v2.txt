Measurable quantities that have positive values in classical dynamical systems need not to be positive in quantum theory. For example, consider a free quantum mechanical particle in one dimension. There are quantum states in which the particle's velocity is positive with probability 1, but where the probability flux for its position is locally negative; that is, while its velocity points to the right, the particle travels to the left. These effects are however small and limited in space and time by certain lower bounds, which are called "quantum inequalities". Similar effects also appear for a particle whose motion is governed by a Schroedinger equation with a certain class of potentials.
