We introduce a general method for the construction of quasiprobability representations for arbitrary notions of quantum coherence. Our technique yields a nonnegative probability distribution for the decomposition of any classical state. Conversely, quantum phenomena are certified in terms of signed distributions, i.e., quasiprobabilities, and a residual component unaccessible via classical states. Our unifying method combines well-established concepts, such as phase-space distributions in quantum optics, with resources of quantumness relevant for quantum technologies. We apply our approach to analyze various forms of quantum coherence in different physical systems. Moreover, our framework renders it possible to uncover complex quantum correlations between systems, for example, via quasiprobability representations of multipartite entanglement.
