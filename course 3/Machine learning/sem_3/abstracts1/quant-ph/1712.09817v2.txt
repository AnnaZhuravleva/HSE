Given a coin with unknown bias $p\in [0,1]$, can we exactly simulate another coin with bias $f(p)$? The exact set of simulable functions has been well characterized 20 years ago. In this paper, we ask the quantum counterpart of this question: Given the quantum coin $|p\rangle=\sqrt{p}|0\rangle+\sqrt{1-p}|1\rangle$, can we exactly simulate another quantum coin $|f(p)\rangle=\sqrt{f(p)}|0\rangle+\sqrt{1-f(p)}|1\rangle$? We give the full characterization of simulable quantum state $k_0(p)|0\rangle+k_1(p)|1\rangle$ from quantum coin $|p\rangle=\sqrt{p}|0\rangle+\sqrt{1-p}|1\rangle$, and present an algorithm to transform it. Surprisingly, we show that simulable sets in the quantum-to-quantum case and classical-to-classical case have no inclusion relationship with each other.
