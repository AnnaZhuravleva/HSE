Quantum computers promise not only to outperform classical machines for certain important tasks, but also to preserve privacy of computation. For example, the blind quantum computing protocol enables secure delegated quantum computation, where a client can protect the privacy of their data and algorithms from a quantum server assigned to run the computation. However, this security comes at the expense of interaction: the client and server must communicate after each step of the computation. Homomorphic encryption, on the other hand, avoids this limitation. In this scenario, the server specifies the computation to be performed, and the client provides only the input data, thus enabling secure non-interactive computation. Here we demonstrate a homomorphic-encrypted quantum random walk using single-photon states and non-birefringent integrated optics. The client encrypts their input state in the photons' polarization degree of freedom, while the server performs the computation using the path degree of freedom. Our random walk computation can be generalized, suggesting a promising route toward more general homomorphic encryption protocols.
