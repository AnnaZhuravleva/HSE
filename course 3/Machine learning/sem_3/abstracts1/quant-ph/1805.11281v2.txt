Quadrature squeezing of light is investigated in a hybrid atom-optomechanical system comprising a cloud of two-level atoms and a movable mirror mediated by a single-mode cavity field. When the system is at high temperatures with quadrature fluctuations of light much above the standard quantum limit (SQL), excitation counting on the collective atomic state can effectively reduce the light noise close to the SQL. When the system is at low temperatures, considerable squeezing of light below the SQL is found at steady state. The squeezing is enhanced by simply increasing the atom-light coupling strength with the laser power optimized close to the unstable regime, and further noise reduction is achieved by decreasing various losses in the system. The presence of atoms and excitation counting on the atoms lessen the limitation of thermal noise, and the squeezing can be achieved at environment temperature of the order K. The nonclassicality of the light, embodied by the negative distributions of the Wigner function, is also studied by making non-Gaussian measurements on the atoms. It is shown that with feasible parameters excitation counting on the atoms is effective in inducing strongly optical nonclassicality.
