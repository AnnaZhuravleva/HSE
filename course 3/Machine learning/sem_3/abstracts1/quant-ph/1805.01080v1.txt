A number of techniques exist to use an ensemble of atoms as a quantum memory for light. Many of these propose to use backward retrieval as a way to improve the storage and recall efficiency. We report on a demonstration of an off-resonant Raman memory that uses backward retrieval to achieve an efficiency of $65\pm6\%$ at a storage time of one pulse duration. The memory has a characteristic decay time of 60 $\mu$s, corresponding to a delay-bandwidth product of $160$.
