We present a theoretical framework called Lorentz quantum mechanics, where the dynamics of a system is a complex Lorentz transformation in complex Minkowski space. In contrast, in usual quantum mechanics, the dynamics is the unitary transformation in Hilbert space. In our Lorentz quantum mechanics, there exist three types of states, space-like, light-like, and time-like. Fundamental aspects are explored in parallel to the usual quantum mechanics, such as matrix form of a Lorentz transformation, construction of Pauli-like matrices for spinors. We also investigate the adiabatic evolution in this mechanics, as well as the associated Berry curvature and Chern number. Three typical physical systems, where this Lorentz quantum dynamics can arise, are presented. They are one dimensional fermion gas, Bose-Einstein condensate (or superfluid), and one dimensional antiferromagnet.
