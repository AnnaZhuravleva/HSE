We derive the strong subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy with a strict lower bound dependent on the distribution of quantum correlation in the system. We investigate the structure of states saturating the bounded subadditivity and explore its consequences for the quantum data processing inequality. The quantum data processing achieves a lower bound associated with the locally inaccessible information.
