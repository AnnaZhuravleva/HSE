The generation of GHZ states in quantum networks is a key element for the realization of several quantum information tasks. Given the complexity of the implementation of such generation, it is not easy to find an unambigous proof for an optimal protocol. Motivated by recent improvements in NV center manipulation, we present and compare an extensive list of protocols for generating GHZ states using realistic parameters. Furthermore, in order to establish the goodness of the various protocols, we test them on a specific application, i.e. conference key agreement. We show that for an high number of nodes the best protocol is one presented here for the first time.
