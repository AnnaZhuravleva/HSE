Determining an unknown quantum state from an ensemble of identical systems is a fundamental, yet experimentally demanding, task in quantum science. Here we study the resources needed to fully characterize an arbitrary multi-mode state containing a definite number of photons. We show this task can be achieved using only linear optics and photon counting, which yield a practical though non-universal set of projective measurements. We derive the minimum number of measurement settings required and show that this lower bound is saturated if the linear optics correspond to Haar-random unitary transformations. Furthermore, we show that for N photons, any unitary 2N-design can be used to derive an analytical, though non-optimal, state reconstruction protocol.
