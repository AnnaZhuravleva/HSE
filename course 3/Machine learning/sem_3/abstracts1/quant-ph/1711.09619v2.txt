A major goal within the field of optomechanics is to achieve the single-photon strong coupling regime, wherein even a mechanical displacement as small as the zero-point uncertainty is enough to shift an optical cavity resonance by more than its linewidth. This goal is difficult, however, due to the small zero-point motion of conventional mechanical systems. Here, we show that an atom trapped in and coupled to a cavity constitutes an attractive platform for realizing this regime. In particular, while many experiments focus on achieving strong coupling between a photon and the atomic internal degree of freedom, this same resource also naturally enables one to obtain optomechanical strong coupling, in combination with the low mass of an atom and the isolation of its motion from a thermal environment. As an example, we show that optomechanically-induced photon blockade can be realized in realistic setups, and provide signatures of how this effect can be distinguished from the conventional Jaynes-Cummings blockade associated with the two-level nature of the atomic transition.
