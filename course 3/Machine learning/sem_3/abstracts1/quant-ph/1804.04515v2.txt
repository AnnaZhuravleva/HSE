Entanglement is the powerful and enigmatic resource central to quantum information processing, which promises capabilities in computing, simulation, secure communication, and metrology beyond what is possible for classical devices. Achieving a quantum advantage requires scaling quantum systems to sizes that can support a large amount of entanglement. Because real-world systems are varied and imperfect, the quantum resources they provide must be characterized before use. However, exactly quantifying the entanglement of an unknown system requires completely determining its quantum state, a task which requires an intractable number of measurements even for modestly sized systems. Here we demonstrate a new method for rigorously quantifying high-dimensional entanglement from extremely limited data. We improve an entropic, quantitative entanglement witness to operate directly on compressed experimental data acquired via an adaptive, multilevel sampling procedure. Only 6,456 measurements are needed to certify an entanglement-of-formation of $7.11 \pm .04$ ebits shared between spatially-entangled photon pairs. With a Hilbert space exceeding 68 billion dimensions, this is 10-million-fold fewer measurements than traditional approaches. The procedure does not computationally recover an underlying state and allows straightforward error analysis. Our technique offers a universal method for quantifying entanglement in any large quantum system shared by two parties.
