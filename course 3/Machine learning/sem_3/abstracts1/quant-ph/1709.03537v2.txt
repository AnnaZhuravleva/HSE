We present an approximate analytical solution to the dynamic equation of two Ising-coupled qubits with oscillating classical control fields that are nonperpendicular to the static drift fields. This is a situation that has recently arisen in some solid-state experiments. With our solution we derive the analytical expressions for the local invariants as well as the local rotations needed to isolate a purely nonlocal gate. This determines the set of parameters that are required to generate any entangling gate. Moreover, we use our results to describe a recent experimental work on capacitively coupled singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs and discuss possible differences for a similar device in silicon.
