Bottom-up assembly of few- and many-body systems from individual atoms could deliver robust entanglement, which is a key resource for quantum technologies\cite{Isenhower2010, Regal2015, Endres2016}. Furthermore, it allows quantum processes to be observed at the individual event level, revealing information concealed by ensemble-averaged measurements\cite{Toschek1986, Andersen2010} and providing insights into molecular processes\cite{Andersen2013, Liu2018}, thermalization\cite{Greiner2016}, and quantum thermodynamics\cite{Rosnagel:2016}. Here, we study the spin dynamics of a two-body system consisting of individually-assembled pairs of \boldsymbol{$^{85}$}Rb atoms, whose collisional properties prevent investigation in the many-body regime. The thermal spin-2 atoms show perfect pair correlation between magnetic sublevels on timescales exceeding one second, with measured relative number fluctuations \boldsymbol{$11.9\pm0.3$} dB below quantum shot noise (QSN), limited only by detection efficiency. Both microscopic simulations and experiments display relaxation dynamics, contrary to the coherent spin waves witnessed in finite-temperature many-body experiments\cite{Lett2013} and zero-temperature two-body experiments\cite{Bloch2005}. The relative relaxation rates are consistent with theoretical predictions of the \boldsymbol{$^{85}$}Rb spin-dependent interaction strengths\cite{Greene2001}. Our experiment is a versatile platform for studying two-body quantum dynamics and may provide a route to thermally-robust entanglement generation.
