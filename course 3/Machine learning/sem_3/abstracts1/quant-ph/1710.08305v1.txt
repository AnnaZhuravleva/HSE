Some fundamental aspects related with the construction of Robertson-Schr\"odinger like uncertainty principle inequalities are reported in order to provide an overall description of quantumness, separability and nonlocality of quantum systems in the noncommutative phase-space. Some consequences of the deformed noncommutative algebra are also considered in physical systems of interest.
