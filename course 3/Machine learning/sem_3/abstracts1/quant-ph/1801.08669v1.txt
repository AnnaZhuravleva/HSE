We theoretically study high-order optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) process in a nonlinear Kerr resonator. A frequency shift induced by the Kerr effect, is identified for the optical cavity mode, which results in asymmetric OMIT windows of the signal and its higher-order sidebands. We also find that both the sideband amplitude and its associated group delay sensitively depend on the strength of the Kerr nonlinearity. This indicates the possibility to enhance or steer the performance of OMIT devices with various nonlinear optical cavities.
