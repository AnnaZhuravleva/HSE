In a conventional atomic interferometer employing $N$ atoms, the phase sensitivity is at the standard quantum limit: $1/\sqrt{N}$. Using spin-squeezing, the sensitivity can be increased, either by lowering the quantum noise or via phase amplification, or a combination thereof. Here, we show how to increase the sensitivity, to the Heisenberg limit of $1/N$, while increasing the quantum noise by $\sqrt{N}$, thereby suppressing by the same factor the effect of excess noise. The proposed protocol makes use of a Schr\"odinger Cat (SC) state representing a mesoscopic superposition of two collective states of $N$ atoms, behaving as a single entity with an $N$-fold increase in Compton frequency. The resulting $N$-fold phase magnification is revealed by using atomic state detection instead of collective state detection.
