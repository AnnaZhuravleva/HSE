The model of a neutral planar atom which possesses a non-vanishing electric dipole momentum interacting with magnetic fields in a specific setting is studied. The energy spectra of this model and its reduced model, which is the limit of cooling down the atom to the negligible kenetic energy, are solved exactly. We show that %similar with the Chern-Simons quantum mechanics, the energy spectra of the reduced model can not be obtained directly from the full ones by taking the same limit. In order to match them, we must regularize the energy spectra of the full model when the limit of the negligible kenetic energy is taken. It is one of the characteristics of the Chern-Simons quantum mechanics. Besides it, the canonical angular momentum of the reduced model will take fractional values although the full model can only take integers. It means that it is possible to realize the Chern-Simons quantum mechanics and fractional angular momentum simultaneously by this model.
