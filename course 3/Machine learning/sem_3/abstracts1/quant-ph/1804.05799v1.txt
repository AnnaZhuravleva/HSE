Nonlinear Riccati and Ermakov equations are combined to pair the energy spectrum of two different quantum systems via the Darboux method. One of the systems is assumed Hermitian, exactly solvable, with discrete energies in its spectrum. The other system is characterized by a complex-valued potential that inherits all the energies of the former one, and includes an additional real eigenvalue in its discrete spectrum. If such eigenvalue coincides with any discrete energy (or it is located between two discrete energies) of the initial system, its presence produces no singularities in the complex-valued potential. Non-Hermitian systems with spectrum that includes all the energies of either Morse or trigonometric Poeschl-Teller potentials are introduced as concrete examples.
