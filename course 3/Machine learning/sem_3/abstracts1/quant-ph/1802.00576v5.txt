Single-loop cyclic three-level ($\Delta$-type) configuration of chiral molecules was used for enantio- separation in many theoretical works based on the electric-dipole coupling with three microwave fields. Considering the molecular rotation, this simple single-loop model is generally replaced by a complicated multiple-loop one containing multi degenerated magnetic sub-levels and the ability of the enantio-separation methods is suppressed. For chiral molecules of asymmetric top, we propose a real single-loop $\Delta$-type configuration by applying three microwave fields with appropriate polar- izations and frequencies to resonantly couple respectively with the transitions among three single rotational levels, where each of the levels does not involve multi degenerated magnetic sub-levels. With our scheme, the previous theoretical proposals for enantio-separation based on single-loop $\Delta$-type configuration can be experimentally realized when the molecular rotation is considered.
