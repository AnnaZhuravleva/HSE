In this paper, we propose an approach to accelerate the dissipation dynamics for quantum state generation with Lyapunov control. The strategy is to add target-state-related coherent control fields into the dissipation process to intuitively improve the evolution speed. By applying the current approach, without losing the advantages of dissipation dynamics, the target stationary states can be generated in a much shorter time as compared to that via traditional dissipation dynamics. As a result, the current approach containing the advantages of coherent unitary dynamics and dissipation dynamics allows for significant improvement in quantum state generation.
