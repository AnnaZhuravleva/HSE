We propose and analyze a new method for quantum metrology based on stable non-equilibrium states of quantum matter. Our approach utilizes quantum correlations stabilized by strong interactions and periodic driving. As an example, we present an explicit protocol to perform Floquet enhanced measurements of an oscillating magnetic field in Ising-interacting spin systems. Our protocol allows one to circumvent the interaction-induced decoherence associated with high density spin ensembles and is robust to the presence of noise and imperfections. Applications to nanoscale magnetic sensing and precision measurements are discussed.
