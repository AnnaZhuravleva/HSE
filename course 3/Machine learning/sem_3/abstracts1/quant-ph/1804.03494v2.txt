Metasurfaces based on resonant nanophotonic structures have enabled novel types of flat-optics devices often outperforming the capabilities of bulk components, yet these advances remain largely unexplored for quantum applications. We show that non-classical multi-photon interferences can be achieved at the subwavelength scale in all-dielectric metasurfaces. We simultaneously image multiple projections of quantum states with a single metasurface, enabling a robust reconstruction of amplitude, phase, coherence, and entanglement of multi-photon polarization-encoded states. One- and two-photon states are reconstructed through nonlocal photon correlation measurements with polarization-insensitive click-detectors positioned after the metasurface, and the scalability to higher photon numbers is established theoretically. Our work illustrates the feasibility of ultra-thin quantum metadevices for the manipulation and measurement of multi-photon quantum states with applications in free-space quantum imaging and communications.
