Through the $\eta$-inner product, we investigate $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum mechanics from the viewpoint of superposition and coherence theory. It is argued that $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum systems are endowed with stationary superposition or superposition-free properties. A physical interpretation of $\eta$-inner product in $\mathbb C^2$ is given through the Stokes parameters, showing the difference between broken and unbroken $\cal PT$-symmetric quantum systems.
