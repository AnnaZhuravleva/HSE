We revisit the algebraic description of shape invariance method in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. In this note we focus on four particular examples: the Kepler problem in flat space, the Kepler problem in spherical space, the Kepler problem in hyperbolic space, and the Rosen-Morse potential problem. Following the prescription given by Gangopadhyaya et al., we first introduce certain nonlinear algebraic systems. We then show that, if the model parameters are appropriately quantized, the bound-state problems can be solved solely by means of representation theory.
