Randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols have become an essential tool for providing a meaningful partial characterization of experimental quantum operations. While the RB decay rate is known to enable estimates of the average fidelity of those operations under gate-independent Markovian noise, under gate-dependent noise this rate is more difficult to interpret rigorously. In this paper, we prove that single-qubit RB experiments provide direct estimates of the gateset circuit fidelity, a novel figure of merit which characterizes the expected average fidelity over arbitrary circuits of operations from the gateset. We also prove that, in the limit of high-fidelity single-qubit experiments, the difficulty introduced by gate-dependence reduces to a basis mismatch between the gates and the state-preparation and measurement procedures, that is, to a unitary degree of freedom in labeling the Pauli matrices. Based on numerical evidence and physically motivated arguments, we conjecture that these result hold for higher dimensions.
