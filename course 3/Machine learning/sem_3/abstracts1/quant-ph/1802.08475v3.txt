We investigate the diagonal entropy of the ground state of quantum many-body systems. Diagonal entropy is concerning about only the diagonal form of the ground state reduced density matrix, which can be obtained more easily in comparison to the whole reduced density matrix. We show that the diagonal entropy can be represented as a volume term plus a logarithm term on the number of spins and a constant term. Remarkably, the diagonal entropy provides signatures of all quantum phase transitions for the studied XY-model. The quantum phase transitions characterized by diagonal entropy agree well with the phase diagram. Besides, by combining the entanglement entropy and diagonal entropy, we naturally find the relative entropy of quantum coherence. Our findings show that the diagonal entropy contains rich physics and is worth exploring in studying various quantum systems.
