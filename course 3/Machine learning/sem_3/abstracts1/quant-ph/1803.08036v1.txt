We establish design principles for light-harvesting antennae whose energy capture scales superlinearly with system size. Controlling the absorber dipole orientations produces sets of `guide-slide' states which promote steady-state superabsorbing characteristics in noisy condensed-matter nanostructures. Inspired by natural photosynthetic complexes, we discuss the example of ring-like dipole arrangements and show that, in our setup, vibrational relaxation enhances rather than impedes performance. Remarkably, the superabsorption effect proves robust to O(5%) disorder simultaneously for all relevant system parameters, showing promise for experimental exploration across a broad range of platforms.
