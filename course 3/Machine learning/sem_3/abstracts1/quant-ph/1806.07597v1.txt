A comparison of gate fidelities between different spin qubit types defined in quantum dots and donor under different control errors is reported. We studied five qubit types, namely the quantum dot spin qubit, the double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit, the double quantum dot hybrid qubit, the donor qubit and the quantum dot spin-donor qubit. For each one, we derived analytical time sequences that realize single qubit rotations along the principal axis of Bloch sphere. We estimated the effects on the gate fidelity of errors disturbing the control parameters by using a Gaussian noise model. Then we compared all the gate fidelities for each implementations due to the time interval error by using a realistic set of values for the error parameters of amplitude controls.
