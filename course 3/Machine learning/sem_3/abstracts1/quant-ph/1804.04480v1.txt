Mutual unbiasedness of the eigenstates of phase-space operators-such as position and momentum, or their standard coarse grained versions-exists only in the limiting case of infinite squeezing. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 040403 (2018)] it was shown that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered for periodic coarse grainings of these two operators. Here we investigate mutual unbiasedness of coarse-grained measurements for more than two phase-space variables. We show that mutual unbiasedness can be recovered between periodic coarse graining of any two non-parallel phase-space operators. We illustrate these results through optics experiments using the fractional Fourier transform to prepare and measure mutually unbiased phase-space variables. The differences between two and three mutually unbiased measurements is discussed. Our results contribute to bridging the gap between continuous and discrete quantum mechanics and could be useful in quantum information protocols.
