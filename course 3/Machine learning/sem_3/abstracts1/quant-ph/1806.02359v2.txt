Quantum computers will require encoding of quantum information to protect them from noise. Fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures illustrate how this might be done, but have not yet shown a conclusive practical advantage. Here we demonstrate that a small but useful error detecting code improves the fidelity of the fault-tolerant gates implemented in the code space as compared to the fidelity of physically equivalent gates implemented on physical qubits. By running a randomized benchmarking protocol in the logical code space of the [4,2,2] code, we observe an order of magnitude improvement in the infidelity of the gates, with the two-qubit infidelity dropping from 5.8(2)% to 0.60(3)%. Our results are consistent with fault tolerance theory and conclusively demonstrate the benefit of carrying out computation in a code space that can detect errors.
