In non-Hermitian coulped-resonator networks, the eigenvectors of degenerate eigenmodes may become parallel due to the singularity at so-called Exceptional Points (EP). To exploit the parametric sensitivity at EPs, an important problem is, given an arbitrary set of coupled resonators, how to generate a desired EP by properly coupling them together. This paper provides the solution for the case of three resonators. We show that all physically admissible EPs can be realized with either weakly coupled linear networks or strongly coupled circular networks, and the latter type of EPs has not been reported in the literature. Each admissible EP eigenvalue can be realized by two and only two resonator networks, and the formulas for calculating the required coupling constants are provided. The characteristics of these EPs are illustrated by the change of transmission spectra near them, which verify the enhanced sensitivity induced by the singularity of EPs.
