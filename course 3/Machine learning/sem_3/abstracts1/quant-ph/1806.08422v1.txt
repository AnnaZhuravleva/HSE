The coherent Ising machine is an optical processor that uses coherent laser pulses, but does not employ coherent quantum dynamics in a computational role. Core to its operation is the iterated simulation of all-to-all spin coupling via mean-field calculation in a classical FPGA coprocessor. Although it has been described as "operating at the quantum limit" and a "quantum artificial brain", interaction with the FPGA prevents the coherent Ising machine from exploiting quantum effects in its computations. Thus the question naturally arises: Can the optical portion of the coherent Ising machine be replaced with classical mean-field arithmetic? Here we answer this in the affirmative by showing that a straightforward noisy version of mean-field annealing closely matches CIM performance scaling, while running roughly 20 times faster in absolute terms.
