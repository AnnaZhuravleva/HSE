Given a set of multipartite entangled states, can we find a common state to prepare them by local operations and classical communication? Such a state, if exists, will be a common resource for the given set of states. We completely solve this problem for bipartite pure states case by explicitly constructing a unique optimal common resource state for any given set of states. In the multipartite setting, the general problem becomes quite complicated, and we focus on finding nontrivial common resources for the whole multipartite state space of given dimensions. We show that GHZ_3 is a nontrivial common resource for three-qubit systems.
