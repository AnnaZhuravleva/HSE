We analytically verify that the computational complexity of Grover's search is of order $\log N$, where $N$ is the number of items in the database, for quantum annealing by the imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger equation with linearly decreasing fluctuation. The computational complexity in quantum annealing by the real-time Schr\"{o}dinger equation is of order $\sqrt{N}$, even if the time-dependent Hamiltonian is optimally tuned during the protocol to efficiently identify the ground state. The contrastive results for real-time and imaginary-time evolution seem to imply that classical dynamics, which can be mapped to imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics, are exponentially faster than real-time Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics. However, this result dose not immediately suggest that the exponential fast algorithm is established, but rather our system is not physically realistic. Quantum annealing behavior is fundamentally different in the real-time and imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger equations when the annealing time is not sufficiently long and the Landau-Zener transition is dominant. We found that simulations of quantum annealing based on imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo methods were reliable for demonstrating actual behavior in a real-time region, only for an adiabatically evolved system.
