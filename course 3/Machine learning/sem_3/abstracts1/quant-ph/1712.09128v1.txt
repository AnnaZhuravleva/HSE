We propose a highly efficient dynamic nuclear polarization technique that is robust against field in-homogeneity. This technique is designed to enhance the detection sensitivity in nano-MRI, where large Rabi field gradients are required. The proposed technique consists of an adiabatic half passage pulse followed by an adiabatic linear sweep of the electron Rabi frequency and can be considered as an adiabatic version of nuclear orientation via electron spin locking (adiabatic-NOVEL). We analyze the spin dynamics of an electron-nuclear system that is under microwave irradiation at high static magnetic field and at cryogenic temperature. The result shows that an amplitude modulation of the microwave field makes adiabatic-NOVEL highly efficient and robust against both the static and microwave field in-homogeneity.
