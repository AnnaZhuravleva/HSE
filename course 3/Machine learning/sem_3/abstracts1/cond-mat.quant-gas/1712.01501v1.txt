Based on a one-dimensional double-well superlattice with a unit filling of ultracold atoms per site, we propose a scheme to generate scalable entangled states in the superlattice through resonant lattice shakings. Our scheme utilizes periodic lattice modulations to entangle two atoms in each unit cell with respect to their orbital degree of freedom, and the complete atomic system in the superlattice becomes a cluster of bipartite entangled atom pairs. To demonstrate this we perform $ab \ initio$ quantum dynamical simulations using the Multi-Layer Multi-Configuration Time-Dependent Hartree Method for Bosons, which accounts for all correlations among the atoms. The proposed clusters of bipartite entanglements manifest as an essential resource for various quantum applications, such as measurement based quantum computation. The lattice shaking scheme to generate this cluster possesses advantages such as a high scalability, fast processing speed, rich controllability on the target entangled states, and accessibility with current experimental techniques.
