Typical treatments of superconducting or superfluid Josephson junctions rely on mean-field or two-mode models; we explore many-body dynamics of an isolated, ultracold, Bose-gas long Josephson junction using time-evolving block decimation simulations. We demonstrate that with increasing repulsive interaction strength, localized dynamics emerge that influence macroscopic condensate behavior and can lead to formation of solitons that directly oppose the symmetry of the junction. Initial state population and phase yield insight into dynamic tunneling regimes of a quasi one-dimensional double well potential, from Josephson oscillations to macroscopic self-trapping. Population imbalance simulations reveal substantial deviation of many-body dynamics from mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii predictions, particularly as the barrier height and interaction strength increase. In addition, the sudden approximation supports localized particle-hole formation after a diabatic quench, and correlation measures unveil a new dynamic regime: the Fock flashlight.
