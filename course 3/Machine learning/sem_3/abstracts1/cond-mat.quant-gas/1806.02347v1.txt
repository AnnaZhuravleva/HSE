We present a non-equilibrium quantum field theory approach to the initial-state dynamics of spin models based on two-particle irreducible (2PI) functional integral techniques. It employs a mapping of spins to Schwinger bosons for arbitrary spin interactions and spin lengths. At next-to-leading order (NLO) in an expansion in the number of field components, a wide range of non-perturbative dynamical phenomena are shown to be captured, including relaxation of magnetizations in a 3D long-range interacting system with quenched disorder, different relaxation behaviour on both sides of a quantum phase transition and the crossover from relaxation to arrest of dynamics in a disordered spin chain previously shown to exhibit many-body-localization. Where applicable, we employ alternative state-of-the-art techniques and find rather good agreement with our 2PI NLO results. As our method can handle large system sizes and converges relatively quickly to its thermodynamic limit, it opens the possibility to study those phenomena in higher dimensions in regimes in which no other efficient methods exist. Furthermore, the approach to classical dynamics can be investigated as the spin length is increased.
