Many types of dissipative processes can be found in nature or be engineered, and their interplay with a system can give rise to interesting phases of matter. Here we study the interplay among interaction, tunneling, and disorder in the steady state of a spin chain coupled to a tailored bath. We consider a dissipation which, in contrast to disorder, tends to generate a homogeneously polarized steady state. We find that the steady state can be highly sensitive even to weak disorder. We also establish that, in the presence of such dissipation, even in the absence of interaction, a finite amount of disorder is needed for localization. Last, we show that for strong disorder the system reveals signatures of localization both in the weakly and strongly interacting regimes.
