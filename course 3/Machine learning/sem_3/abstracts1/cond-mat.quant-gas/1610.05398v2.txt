We investigate the effects of disorder and lattice geometry against localization phenomenon in a weakly interacting ultracold bosonic gas confined in a 2D optical lattice. The behaviour of the quantum fluid is studied as a function of disorder strength, considering lattices of sizes similar to current experiments at the mean-field level. Performing computational experiments, we find that the disorder induced localization transition strongly depends on the geometry of the system. The coordination number determines how fast this transition occurs as the system size increases. The quantification of localization in 2D given in terms of the localization cross section $\xi_{\textrm{Loc}}$, which exhibits gaussian behavior as compared to the polynomial dependence of the localization length in 1D. As expected, $\xi_{\textrm{Loc}}$ strongly depends on the coordination number for small disorder strengths. Signatures of disorder are also found in the energy spectrum, where a continuous distribution emerges instead of a distribution of sharp peaks proper to the system in the absence of disorder.
