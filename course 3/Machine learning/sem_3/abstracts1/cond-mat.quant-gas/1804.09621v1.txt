We address the effects of quenched disorder averaging in the time-evolution of systems of ultracold atoms in optical lattices in the presence of noise, imposed by the presence of an environment. For bosonic systems governed by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we numerically quantify the result of the presence of disorder in the Hamiltonian parameters in terms of physical observables, including bipartite entanglement in the ground state and report the existence of disorder-induced enhancement in weakly interacting cases. For systems of two-species fermions described by the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find similar results. In both cases, our dynamical calculations show no appreciable change in the effects of disorder from that of the initial state of the evolution. We explain our findings in terms the statistics of the disorder in the parameters and the behaviour of the observables with the parameters.
