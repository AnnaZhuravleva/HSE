Dissipation can fundamentally influence quantum many-body systems and their phase transitions in often counter-intuitive ways. For example, new universality classes emerge in driven-dissipative systems, and dissipation can generate topological effects. Open system dynamics is particularly relevant as state of the art experiments are able to engineer and control dissipation channels. Concurrently, due to the inapplicability of the framework of equilibrium statistical physics, our understanding of driven-dissipative models remains limited. Here, we explore the influence of dissipation on a paradigmatic driven-dissipative model, hosting a multicritical point and phase transitions breaking discrete and continuous symmetries. We show that already infinitesimal dissipation radically alters the model's phase diagram, resulting in rich phenomena, including a splitting of the multicritical point into two tricritical points, coexistence of phases, and relics of the continuous symmetry in rotated order parameters. Furthermore, we analyze the model's quantum fluctuations and find that the dissipation-induced tricritical points which mark the meeting between first- and second-order symmetry-breaking transitions exhibit anomalous finite fluctuations, as opposed to standard tricritical points arising in $^3He-^4He$ mixtures. Our work has direct implications for a variety of fields, including cold atoms and ions in optical cavities, circuit-quantum electrodynamics, THz light-matter systems as well as optomechanical systems.
