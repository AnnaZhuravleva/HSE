Between space crystals and amorphous materials there exists a third class of aperiodic structures which lack translational symmetry but reveal long-range order. They are dubbed quasi-crystals and their formation, similarly as the formation of space crystals, is related to spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry of underlying Hamiltonians. Here, we investigate spontaneous emergence of quasi-crystals in periodically driven systems. We consider a quantum many-body system which is driven by a harmonically oscillating force and show that interactions between particles result in spontaneous self-reorganization of the motion of a quantum many-body system and in the formation of a quasi-crystal structure in time.
