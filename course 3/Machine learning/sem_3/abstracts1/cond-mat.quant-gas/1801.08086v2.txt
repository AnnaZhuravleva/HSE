The relationship between 2D $SO(2,1)$ conformal anomalies in nonrelativistic systems and the virial expansion is explored using recently developed path-integral methods. In the process, the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula for the shift of the second virial coefficient $\delta b_2$ is obtained, as well as a virial expansion for the Tan contact. A possible extension of these techniques for higher orders in the virial expansion is discussed.
