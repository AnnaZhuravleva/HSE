We discuss the relaxation dynamics for a bosonic tunneling junction with two modes in the central potential well. We use a master equation description for ultracold bosons tunneling in the presence of noise and incoherent coupling processes into the two central modes. Whilst we cannot quantitatively reproduce the experimental data of the setup reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 115}, 050601 (2015)], we find a reasonable qualitative agreement of the refilling process of the initially depleted central site. Our results may pave the way for the control of bosonic tunneling junctions by the simultaneous presence of decoherence processes and atom-atom interaction.
