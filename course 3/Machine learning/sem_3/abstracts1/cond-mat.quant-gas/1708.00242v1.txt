We investigate the correspondence between the tight-binding Floquet Hamiltonian of a periodically modulated honeycomb lattice and the Haldane model. We show that - though the two systems share the same topological phase diagram, as reported in a breakthrough experiment with ultracold atoms in a stretched honeycomb lattice [Jotzu et al., Nature 515, 237 (2014)] - the corresponding Hamiltonians are not equivalent, the one of the shaken lattice presenting a much richer structure.
