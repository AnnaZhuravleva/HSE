Ramsey interferometers (RIs) using internal electronic or nuclear states find wide applications in science and engineering. We develop a matter wave Ramsey interferometer for motional quantum states exploiting the S- and D-bands of an optical lattice and identify the different de-phasing and de-coherence mechanisms. We implement a band echo technique, employing repeated $\pi$-pulses. This suppresses the de-phasing evolution and significantly increase the coherence time of the motional state interferometer by one order of magnitude. We identify thermal fluctuations as the main mechanism for the remaining decay contrast. Our demonstration of an echo-Ramsey interferometer with motional quantum states in an optical lattice has potential application in the study of quantum many body lattice dynamics, and motional qubits manipulation.
