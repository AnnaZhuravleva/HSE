The frequency of the breathing mode of a classical two dimensional Fermi gas in a harmonic confinement is fixed by the scale invariance of the Hamiltonian. Scale invariance is broken on the quantum mechanical level by introducing the two dimensional scattering length as a regulator. This is an example of a quantum anomaly in the field of ultracold atoms and leads to a shift of the frequency of the collective breathing mode of the cloud. In this work, we study this anomalous frequency shift for a two component Fermi gas in the strongly interacting regime. We measure significant shifts away from the scale invariant result that depend strongly on both interactions and temperature. We find qualitative agreement with theoretical calculations at zero temperature.
