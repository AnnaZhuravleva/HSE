The Aharonov-Bohm, and its dual, the Aharonov-Casher effects have been extremely fruitful in physics and, nowadays, they are of central importance for quantum technologies. Here, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a Bose-Einstein condensate propagating out of equilibrium along a mesoscopic ring-shaped laser light potential, pierced by an effective magnetic flux. We found how the system experiences a subtle crossover between physical regimes dominated by pronounced interference patterns and others in which the Aharonov-Bohm effect is effectively washed out. We propose various applications for this system.
