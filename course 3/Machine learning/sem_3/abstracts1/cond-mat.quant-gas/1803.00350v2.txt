The double kicked rotor model is a physically realizable extension of the paradigmatic kicked rotor model in the study of quantum chaos. Even before the concept of Floquet topological phases became widely known, the discovery of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum in the double kicked rotor model [J. Wang and J. Gong, Phys. Rev. A 77, 031405 (2008)] already suggested the importance of periodic driving to the generation of unconventional topological matter. In this work, we explore Floquet topological phases of a double kicked rotor with an extra spin-1/2 degree of freedom. The latter has been experimentally engineered in a quantum kicked rotor recently by loading Rb87 condensates into a periodically pulsed optical lattice. Under the on-resonance condition, the spin-1/2 double kicked rotor admits fruitful topological phases due to the interplay between its external and internal degrees of freedom. Each of these topological phases is characterized by a pair of winding numbers, whose combination predicts the number of topologically protected 0 and \pi-quasienergy edge states in the system. Topological phases with arbitrarily large winding numbers can be easily found by tuning the kicking strength. We discuss an experimental proposal to realize this model in kicked Rb87 condensates, and suggest to detect its topological invariants by measuring the mean chiral displacement in momentum space.
