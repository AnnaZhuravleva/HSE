We study the dynamical process of equilibration of topological properties in quantum many-body systems undergoing a parameter quench between two topologically inequivalent Hamiltonians. This scenario is motivated by recent experiments on ultracold atomic gases, where a trivial initial state is prepared before the Hamiltonian is ramped into a topological insulator phase. While the many-body wave function must stay topologically trivial in the coherent post-quench dynamics, here we show how the topological properties of the single particle density matrix dynamically change and equilibrate in the presence of interactions. In this process, the single particle density matrix goes through a characteristic level crossing as a function of time, which plays an analogous role to the gap closing of a Hamiltonian in an equilibrium topological quantum phase transition. We exemplify this generic mechanism with a numerical case study on one-dimensional topological insulators.
