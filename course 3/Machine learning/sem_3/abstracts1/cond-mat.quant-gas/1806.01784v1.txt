We present a detailed beyond-mean-field analysis of a weakly interacting Bose gas in the crossover from three to low dimensions. We find an analytical solution for the energy and provide a clear qualitative picture of the crossover in the case of a box potential with periodic boundary conditions. We also characterize the crossover for harmonic potentials in a model system with particularly chosen short and long-range interactions. Our analysis is applicable to Bose-Bose mixtures and gives a starting point for developing the beyond-mean-field theory in inhomogeneous systems with long-range interactions such as dipolar particles or Rydberg-dressed atoms.
