In the two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions a pseudogap regime, in which pairing correlations are present without superfluidity, can exist at temperatures between the superfluid critical temperature $T_c$ and a temperature $T^* > T_c$. However, the existence of a pseudogap in the unitary limit of infinite scattering length is debated. To help address this issue, we have used finite-temperature auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) methods to study the thermodynamics of the spin-balanced homogeneous unitary Fermi gas on a lattice. We present results for the thermal energy, heat capacity, condensate fraction, a model-independent pairing gap, and spin susceptibility, and compare them to experimental data when available. Our model space consists of the complete first Brillouin zone of the lattice, and our calculations are performed in the canonical ensemble of fixed particle number. We find that the energy-staggering pairing gap vanishes above $T_c$ and that $T^*$ at unitarity, as determined from the spin susceptibility, is lower than previously reported in AFMC simulations.
