We study the phase-space representation of dynamics of bosons in the semiclassical regime where the occupation number of the modes is large. To this end, we employ the van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator to obtain an approximation for the Green's function of the Wigner distribution. The semiclassical analysis incorporates interference of classical paths and reduces to the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) when the interference is ignored. Furthermore, we identify the Ehrenfest time after which the TWA fails. As a case study, we consider a single-mode quantum nonlinear oscillator, which displays collapse and revival of observables. We analytically show that the interference of classical paths leads to revivals, an effect that is not reproduced by the TWA or a perturbative analysis.
