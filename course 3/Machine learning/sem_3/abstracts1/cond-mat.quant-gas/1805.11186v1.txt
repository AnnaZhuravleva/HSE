We study a liquid quantum droplets in a mixture of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates under a variable confinement introduced along one or two spatial dimensions. Despite the atom-atom scattering has a three-dimensional character, discreetness of the available modes in the reduced dimension(s) strongly influences the zero-point energy -- the Lee-Huang-Yang term. In a weakly interaction limit, it is the leading correction to the mean-field energy at the crossover from three to two dimensions, or from three to one dimension. We analyze the properties of the droplets at the dimensional crossovers, and provide the demanding conditions for accessing quasi-low dimensions. We predict new kinds of droplets which are formed only due to the quantum fluctuations when the mean-field interaction vanishes. Our results pave the way for exploring new states of quantum matter, and are important for experiments with liquid quantum droplets in reduced dimensions.
