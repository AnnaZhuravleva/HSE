The ability to measure single quanta has allowed complete characterization of small quantum systems such as quantum dots in terms of statistics of detected signals known as full-counting statistics. Quantum gas microscopy enables one to observe many-body systems at the single-atom precision. We extend the idea of full-counting statistics to nonequilibrium open many-particle dynamics and apply it to discuss the quench dynamics. By way of illustration, we consider an exactly solvable model to demonstrate the emergence of unique phenomena such as nonlocal and chiral propagation of correlations, leading to a concomitant oscillatory entanglement growth. We find that correlations can propagate beyond the conventional maximal speed, known as the Lieb-Robinson bound, at the cost of probabilistic nature of quantum measurement. These features become most prominent at the real-to-complex spectrum transition point of an underlying parity-time-symmetric effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. A possible experimental realization with quantum gas microscopy is discussed.
