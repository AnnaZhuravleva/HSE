Quantum mechanical few-body systems in reduced dimensionalities can exhibit many interesting properties such as scale-invariance and universality. Analytical descriptions are often available for integer dimensionality, however, numerical approaches are necessary for addressing dimensional transitions. The Fully-Correlated Gaussian method provides a variational description of the few-body real-space wavefunction. By placing the particles in a harmonic trap, the system can be described at various degrees of anisotropy by squeezing the confinement. Through this approach, configurations of two and three identical bosons as well as heteronuclear (Cs-Cs-Li and K-K-Rb) systems are described during a continuous deformation from three to one dimension. We find that the changes in binding energies between integer dimensional cases exhibit a universal behavior akin to that seen in avoided crossings or Zeldovich rearrangement.
