The two-component Fermi gas with contact attractive interactions between different spin components can be described by the Yang-Gaudin model. Applying the Bethe ansatz approach, one finds analytical formulae for the system eigenstates that are uniquely parametrized by the solutions of the corresponding Bethe equations. The lowest energy egenstates at a given non-zero total momentum subspaces called yrast states were recently analyzed for periodic boundary conditions. The numerical studies show that the yrast spectrum of the Yang-Gaudin model resembles yrast dispersion relation of the Lieb-Liniger model which in turn matches the dark soliton dispersion obtained within the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. It was shown that such conjecture in the case of the Lieb-Liniger model was not accidental and that dark soliton features emerged in the course of particle positions measurement, when the system was initially prepared in an yrast eigenstate. Following the idea of particle detection, we employ the Bethe ansatz approach as well as numerical diagonalization to show that, starting from yrast eigenstates, the key soliton signatures, like density notch and phase flip, are visible in the wave function when all fermions, but two belonging to different components have been detected. With the help of the Bethe ansatz, we study soliton signatures in a wide range of interaction strength. The discussion is supplemented by the analysis of the formation of two-particle bound states built up by fermions with opposite spins.
