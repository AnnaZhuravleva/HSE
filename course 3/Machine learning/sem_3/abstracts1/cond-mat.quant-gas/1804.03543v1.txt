We present a fermionic description of non-equilibrium few-level systems. Our approach uses the Keldysh path integral formalism and allows us to take into account periodic drives, as well as dissipative channels. The technique is based on the Majorana fermion representation of spin-1/2 models which follows earlier applications in the context of spin and Kondo systems. We demonstrate that our technique provides a convenient and powerful framework for analyzing generalized Dicke models with many few-level atoms coupled to a single cavity. We consider a concrete example of the non-equilibrium dynamics of such a system. We compare our theoretical predictions with recent experiments and point out the features of a lasing transition.
