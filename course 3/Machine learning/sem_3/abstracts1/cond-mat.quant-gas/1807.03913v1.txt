We discuss the pseudogap regime in the cold atomic unitary Fermi gas, with a particular emphasis on the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFMC) approach. We discuss possible signatures of the pseudogap, review experimental results, and survey analytic and quantum Monte Carlo techniques before focusing on AFMC calculations in the canonical ensemble. For the latter method, we discuss results for the heat capacity, energy-staggering pairing gap, spin susceptibility, and compare to experiment and other theoretical methods.
