We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice and loaded into an optical resonator that is driven transversely. We derive an effective quantum master equation for weak atom-light coupling that can be brought into Lindblad form both in the bad and good cavity limits. In the so-called bad cavity regime, we find that the steady state is always that of infinite temperature, but that the relaxation dynamics can be highly non-trivial. For small hopping, the interplay between dissipation and strong interactions generally leads to anomalous diffusion in the space of atomic configurations. However, for a fine-tuned ratio of cavity-mediated and on-site interactions, we discover a limit featuring normal diffusion. In contrast, for large hopping and vanishing on-site interactions, the system can be described by a linear rate equation leading to an exponential approach of the infinite-temperature steady state. Finally, in the good cavity regime, we show that for vanishing on-site interactions, the system allows for optical pumping between momentum mode pairs enabling cavity cooling.
