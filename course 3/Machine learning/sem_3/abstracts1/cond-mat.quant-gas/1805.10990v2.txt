We experimentally and numerically investigate the sudden expansion of fermions in a homogeneous one-dimensional optical lattice. For initial states with an appreciable amount of doublons, we observe a dynamical phase separation between rapidly expanding singlons and slow doublons remaining in the trap center, realizing fermionic quantum distillation in the strongly-interacting limit. For initial states without doublons, we observe a suppressed interaction dependence of the asymptotic expansion speed compared to bosons, which is traced back to the interaction energy produced in the quench.
