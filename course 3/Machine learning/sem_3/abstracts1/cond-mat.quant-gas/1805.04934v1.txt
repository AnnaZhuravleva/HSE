We simulate the thermalization of qubits forming a quantum Ising spin chain when coupled to a thermal reservoir or environment. We consider different schemes in the system-reservoir coupling: the system qubits coupled to a common reservoir, and an independent local reservoir for each qubit, and a single reservoir coupled only to the first site of the system. Our simulations show the presence of favorable scenarios for enhancing or preventing thermalization of the spins. First, all independent local reservoirs enable more rapid thermalization in the comparison to a common reservoir. Second, the thermalization timescale changes depending on the position in the phase diagram of the quantum Ising model, which stops thermalizing in the paramagnetic limit for our choice of the model. Further, growing system sizes show a slow down in the thermalization process for a common reservoir. These results use the Lindblad master equation with multi-channel Lindblad operators. Moreover, we explore if these Lindblad operators which are non-local can be approximated with Lindblad operators acting on a small neighborhood of spins. We find that this approach is most successful in the extreme ferromagnetic and paramagnetic limits. Throughout our analysis, we use exact diagonalization methods.
