Resolving the presence of entanglement and the interplay of different correlations is one of the key challenges for understanding complex quantum systems in and out of equilibrium. In itinerant systems, for example, the occurrence of spatial and spin entanglement is intimately connected to the competition between coherent motion and interactions. With synthetic quantum systems based on ultracold atoms, the properties of such systems can be directly studied by measuring correlations in phase, position, or momentum observables. Here, we demonstrate simultaneous spin-resolved measurements of correlation functions in two conjugate variables, namely particle position and momentum, on the single-particle level using a versatile new imaging scheme. We apply this method to the fermionic Hubbard dimer, a paradigmatic example of an itinerant system containing itinerant mobile, interacting particles. From the observed mode occupations and coherences, we constrain the density matrix of the dimer and reveal its changing nature in different interaction regimes. In particular, we directly detect entanglement in the spin and spatial modes of a Hubbard-like system. The generic methods established in this letter can be extended to a broad range of continuum and lattice systems realized with ultracold atoms, and can be used to analyze correlations and entanglement in many-body phases.
