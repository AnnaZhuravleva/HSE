We analyze the energy spectrum and eigenstates of cold atoms in a tilted brick-wall optical lattice. When the tilt is applied, the system exhibits a sequence of topological phase transitions reflected in an abrupt change of the eigenstates. It is demonstrated that these topological phase transitions can be easily detected in a laboratory experiment by observing Bloch oscillations of cold atoms.
