Slow variations (quenches) of the magnetic field across the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition of spin systems produce heat. In short-ranged systems the heat exhibits a universal power-law scaling as a function of the quench rate, known as Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling. Attempts to extend this hypothesis to long-range interacting systems have lead to seemingly contradicting results. In this work we analyse slow quenches of the magnetic field in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, which describes fully-connected quantum spins. We determine the quantum contribution to the residual heat as a function of the quench rate by means of a Bogoliubov expansion about the mean-field value and calculate the exact solution. For a quench which ends at the quantum critical point we identify two regimes: the adiabatic limit for finite-size chains, where the scaling is dominated by the Landau-Zener tunneling, and the KZ scaling. For a quench symmetric about the critical point, instead, there is no KZ scaling. Here we identify three regimes depending on the velocity of the ramp and on the size of the system: (i) the adiabatic limit for finite-size chains; (ii) the opposite regime, namely, the thermodynamic limit, where the residual heat is independent of the quench rate; and finally (iii) the intermediate regime, which is a crossover between the two solutions. We argue that this behaviour is a property of all-connected spin systems. Our findings agree with previous studies and identify the respective limits in which they hold.
