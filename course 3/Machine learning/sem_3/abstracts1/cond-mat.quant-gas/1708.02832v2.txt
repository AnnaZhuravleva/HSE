Ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in a two-leg ladder pierced by a magnetic field provide a minimal and quasi-one-dimensional instance to study the interplay between orbital magnetism and interactions. Using time-dependent matrix-product-states simulations, we investigate the properties of the so-called "Meissner" and "vortex" phases which appear in such system, focusing on experimentally accessible observables. We discuss how to experimentally monitor the phase transition, and show that the response to a modulation of the density imbalance between the two legs of the ladder is qualitatively different in the two phases. We argue that this technique can be used as a tool for many-body spectroscopy, allowing to quantitatively measure the spin gap in the Meissner phase. We finally discuss its experimental implementation
