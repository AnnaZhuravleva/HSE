We consider Landau damping of elementary excitations in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with dipolar interactions. We discuss quantum and quasi-classical regimes of Landau damping. We use a generalized wave-kinetic description of BECs which, apart from the long range dipolar interactions, also takes into account the quantum fluctuations and the finite energy corrections to short-range interactions. Such a description is therefore more general than the usual mean field approximation. The present wave-kinetic approach is well suited for the study of kinetic effects in BECs, such as those associated with Landau damping, atom trapping and turbulent diffusion. The inclusion of quantum fluctuations and energy corrections change the dispersion relation and the damping rates, leading to possible experimental signatures of these effects.   Quantum Landau damping is described with generality, and particular examples of dipole condensates in two and three dimensions are studied. The occurrence of roton-maxon configurations, and their relevance to Landau damping is also considered in detail, as well as the changes introduced by the three different processes, associated with dipolar interactions, quantum fluctuations and finite energy range collisions. The present approach is mainly based on a linear perturbative procedure, but the nonlinear regime of Landau damping, which includes atom trapping and atom diffusion, is also briefly discussed.
