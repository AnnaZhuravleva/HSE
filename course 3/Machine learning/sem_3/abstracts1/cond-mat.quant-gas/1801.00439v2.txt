The Dirac fermion is an important fundamental particle appearing in high-energy physics and topological insulator physics. In particular, a Dirac fermion in a one-dimensional lattice system exhibits the essential properties of topological physics. However, the system has not been quantum simulated in experiments yet. Herein, we propose a one-dimensional generalized lattice Wilson-Dirac fermion model and study its topological phase structure. We show the experimental setups of an atomic quantum simulator for the model, in which two parallel optical lattices with the same tilt for trapping cold fermion atoms and a laser-assisted hopping scheme are used. Interestingly, we find that the model exhibits nontrivial topological phases characterized by gapless edge modes and a finite winding number in the broad regime of the parameter space. Some of the phase diagrams closely resemble those of the Haldane model. We also discuss topological charge pumping and a lattice Gross-Neveu model in the system of generalized Wilson-Dirac fermions.
