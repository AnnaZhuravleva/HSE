Recent experimental realization of synthetic topological models in ultracold atomic gases have stimulated extensive studies on dynamics of topological systems when a Hamiltonian is varied across distinct topological phases. However, previous study shows that the coherent dynamics of Hall response exhibits strong and long-lasting oscillations even for slow variation of a system parameter due to the non-adiabatic passage through a gap closing point. Here we demonstrate that the Hall response can coherently follow the change of the Chern number of a Hamiltonian without oscillations, owing to the electric field induced damping, thus paves the way for observing the topological phase transition through measuring the intrinsic physical quantity of the Hall response. Furthermore, high controllability of ultracold atomic gases allows for implementation and manipulation of simple Weyl semimetals. We find that tuning a parameter in a Hamiltonian of Weyl semimetals, combined with appropriate manipulation of an electric field, enables us to control the corresponding Hall response without oscillations, despite the existence of a gapless band structure. Our finding lays the theoretical foundation for observation and tuning of Weyl semimetals in ultracold atomic gases.
