For the quantum kinetic system modelling the Bose-Einstein Condensate that accounts for interactions between condensate and excited atoms, we use the Chapman-Enskog expansion to derive its hydrodynamic approximations, include both Euler and Navier-Stokes approximations. The hydrodynamic approximations describe not only the macroscopic behavior of the BEC but also its coupling with the non-condensates, which agrees with Landau's two fluid theory.
