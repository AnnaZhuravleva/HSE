Sliding phases have been long sought-after in the context of coupled XY-models, of relevance to various many-body systems such as layered superconductors, free-standing liquid-crystal films, and cationic lipid-DNA complexes. Here we report an observation of a dynamical sliding-phase superfluid that emerges in a nonequilibrium setting from the quantum dynamics of a three-dimensional ultracold atomic gas loaded into the P-band of a one-dimensional optical lattice. A shortcut loading method is used to transfer atoms into the P-band at zero quasi-momentum within a very short time duration. The system can be viewed as a series of "pancake"-shaped atomic samples. For this far-out-of-equilibrium system, we find an intermediate time window with lifetime around tens of milliseconds, where the atomic ensemble exhibits robust superfluid phase coherence in the pancake directions, but no coherence in the lattice direction, which implies a dynamical sliding-phase superfluid. This experiment potentially opens up a novel venue to search for exotic dynamical phases by creating high-band excitations in optical lattices.
