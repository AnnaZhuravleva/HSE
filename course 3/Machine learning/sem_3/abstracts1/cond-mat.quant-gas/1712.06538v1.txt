One-dimensional superlattices with periodic spatial modulations of onsite potentials or tunneling coefficients can exhibit a variety of properties associated with topology or symmetry. Recent developments of ring-shaped optical lattices allow a systematic study of those properties in superlattices with or without boundaries. While superlattices with additional modulating parameters are shown to have quantized topological invariants in the augmented parameter space, we also found localized or zero-energy states associated with symmetries of the Hamiltonians. Probing those states in ultracold-atoms is possible by utilizing recently proposed methods analyzing particle depletion or the local density of states. Moreover, we summarize feasible realizations of configurable optical superlattices using currently available techniques.
