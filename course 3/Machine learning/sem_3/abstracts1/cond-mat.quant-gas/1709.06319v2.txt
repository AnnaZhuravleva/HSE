The Hugenholtz-Pines (HP) theorem for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with internal degrees of freedom has been an open problem, in particular, in the field of quantum gases for spinor BECs. We here exactly clarified the HP theorem where an original Hamiltonian has a U$(1)$$\times$SO$(N)$ or U$(1)$$\times$SU$(N)$ symmetry, but applied to it are SO$(N)$ or SU$(N)$ symmetry breaking external fields. This identity serves to organize the HP theorem of the spin-$f$ spinor BEC in the presence of a magnetic field with broken U$(1)$$\times$SO$(3)$ symmetry.
