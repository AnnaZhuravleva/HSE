The physics of quantum impurities coupled to a many-body environment is among the most important paradigms of condensed matter physics. In particular, the formation of polarons, quasiparticles dressed by the polarization cloud, is key to the understanding of transport, optical response, and induced interactions in a variety of materials. Despite recent remarkable developments in ultracold atoms and solid-state materials, the direct measurement of their ultimate building block, the polaron cloud, has remained a fundamental challenge. We propose and anlalyze a unique platform to probe time-resolved dynamics of polaron-cloud formation with an interferometric protocol. We consider an impurity atom immersed in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate, where the impurity generates spin-wave excitations that can be directly measured by the Ramsey interference of surrounding atoms. The dressing by spin waves leads to the formation of magnetic polarons and reveals a unique interplay between few- and many-body physics that is signified by single- and multi-frequency oscillatory dynamics corresponding to the formation of many-body bound states. Finally, we discuss concrete experimental implementations in ultracold atoms.
