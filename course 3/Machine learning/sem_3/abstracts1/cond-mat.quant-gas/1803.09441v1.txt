We present rigorous and universal results for the ground states of the $f=2$ spinor Bose-Hubbard model. With $c_1$ and $c_2$ being the coefficients of the two spin-dependent interaction terms, we prove that the ground state has a maximum total spin when $c_1<0$ and $c_2 \geqslant 5 c_1$, while tends to be a singlet if $c_1=0$ and $c_2<0$. The latter case is proved by exploiting the SO(5) symmetry of the Hamiltonian. When $c_1=c_2=0$, the model has SU(5) symmetry and the ground state is highly degenerate. We also exactly determine the ground-state degeneracy in each case.
