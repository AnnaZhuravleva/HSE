We report on the controlled immersion of individual localized neutral Cesium atoms of total angular momentum, i.e. quasi-spin, $F=3$ into a BEC of Rubidium in $F=1$. We study spin-exchange dynamics of the impurities interacting with the BEC with both position and time resolution. We observe a clear signature of the BEC's internal $m_F$ state in the rate of spin-exchange and demonstrate the interaction of impurities with the condensate. Moreover, by preparing the impurities in a quantum superposition of internal hyperfine states, we study the coherent dynamics within the quantum bath. We find that coherence is maintained in the presence of elastic collisions with BEC atoms. Our results pave the way for future local and coherent single-atom probing of a quantum many-body system, highly relevant for, e.g., insights into thermalization of non-equilibrium systems, local state manipulation or cooling of quantum information carriers by superfluid immersion.
