We measure the polarization of a photon gas in a dye-filled microcavity. The polarization is obtained by a single-shot measurement of the Stokes parameters. We find that the polarization of both the thermal cloud and the Bose-Einstein condensate of photons (phBEC) does not differ from shot to shot. In the case of the phBEC, we find that the polarization correlates with the polarization of the pump pulse. The polarization of the thermal cloud is independent of parameters varied in the experiment and is governed by a hidden anisotropy in the system.
