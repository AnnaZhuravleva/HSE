We consider two distinguishable atoms trapped in a double-well potential. For each atom, two orthogonal spatial modes are accessible: the states $ |L\rangle$ and $|R\rangle$ spatially localized in the left and right wells respectively. We propose a method for experimentally quantifying the entanglement between these atoms and probing a violation of Bell's inequality. It is based on measuring the correlations in the atoms' momentum distribution. If the tunnelling and the energy difference between the wells are tunable, then full state tomography is achievable.
