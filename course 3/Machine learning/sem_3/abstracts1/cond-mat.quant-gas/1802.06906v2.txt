We report the formation of a macroscopic coherent state emerging from colliding polariton fluids. Four lasers with random relative phases, arranged in a square, pump resonantly a planar microcavity, creating four coherent polariton fluids propagating toward each other. When the density (interactions) increases, the four fluids synchronise and the topological excitations (vortex or soliton) disappear to form a single superfluid.
