We create fermionic dipolar $^{23}$Na$^6$Li molecules in their triplet ground state from an ultracold mixture of $^{23}$Na and $^6$Li. Using magneto-association across a narrow Feshbach resonance followed by a two-photon STIRAP transfer to the triplet ground state, we produce $3\,{\times}\,10^4$ ground state molecules in a spin-polarized state. We observe a lifetime of $4.6\,\text{s}$ in an isolated molecular sample, approaching the $p$-wave universal rate limit. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy of the triplet state was used to determine the hyperfine structure of this previously unobserved molecular state.
