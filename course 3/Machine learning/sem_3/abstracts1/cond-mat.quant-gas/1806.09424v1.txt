We investigate strong-coupling effects in a three-component atomic Fermi gas. It is a promising candidate for simulating quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and furthermore, the emergence of various phenomena such as color superfluidity and Efimov effect are anticipated in this system. In this paper, we study the effects of two-body and three-body correlations by means of the many-body $T$-matrix approximation (TMA) as well as the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian (STM) equation with medium corrections. We investigate the effects of finite temperature and chemical potential on the trimer binding energy at the superfluid critical point of the unitarity limit.
