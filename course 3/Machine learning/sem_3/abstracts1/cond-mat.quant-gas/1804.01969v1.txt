We study the relaxation of ultra-cold bosons in one dimension. In a setting similar to the Newton's cradle experiment by Kinoshita et al.[Nature (London) 440, 900 (2006)], we excite the atoms to oscillate and collide in a 2D optical lattice of 1D tubes and observe the oscillations for up to 4.8 seconds (400 oscillations) with very little heating and loss. Tuning the initial distribution, we can probe the onset of relaxation in the cross over between 1D and 3D. Investigating the population of the transverse excited state by band mapping, we show that even for samples where the energy put into the system is initially not sufficient to excite transverse state, relaxation starts through a minimal (1%) seed of atoms in transverse excited states.
