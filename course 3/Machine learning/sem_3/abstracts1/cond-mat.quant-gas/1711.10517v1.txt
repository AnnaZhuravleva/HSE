We consider a field theory describing interacting nonrelativistic particles of two types, which map to each other under time reversal, with point-like interaction. We identify a new type of interaction which depends on the relative velocity between the particles. We compute the renormalization group running of the coupling constants and find a fixed point and a fixed line. We show that the scattering amplitudes can be expressed in terms of three parameters. The result matches with a quantum mechanical analysis and represents the most general point-like interaction consistent with unitarity and time reversal invariance.
