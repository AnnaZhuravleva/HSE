The achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation of photons (phBEC) in a dye-filled microcavity has led to a renewed interest in the density distribution of the ideal Bose gas in a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. We present measurements of the radial profile of photons inside the microcavity below and above the critical point for phBEC with a good signal-to-noise ratio. We obtain a good agreement with theoretical profiles obtained using exact summation of eigenstates.
