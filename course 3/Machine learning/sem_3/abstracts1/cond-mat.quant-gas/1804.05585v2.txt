For one-dimensional systems with delta-contact interactions, the convergence of the exact-diagonalization method is tested with a basis of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions with frequency $\Omega$ optimized through the minimization of the eigenenergy of the desired level. It is shown that within the framework of this approach the well-converged results can be achieved at much smaller dimensions of the Hamiltonian matrix than with the standard approach that uses $\Omega=1$. We present calculations for model systems of identical bosons with harmonic and double-well potentials. Our results show promising potential for diminishing the computational cost of numerical simulations of various systems of trapped ultracold atoms.
