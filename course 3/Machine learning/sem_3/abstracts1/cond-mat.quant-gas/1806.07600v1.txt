Following a strong analogy with two-dimensional physics, the three-body pseudo-potential in one dimension is derived. The Born approximation is then considered in the context of ultracold atoms in a linear harmonic waveguide. In the vicinity of the dimer threshold a direct connection is made between the zero-range potential and the dimensional reduction of the three-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation.
