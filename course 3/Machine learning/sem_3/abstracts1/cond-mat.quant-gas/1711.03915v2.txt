As recently realized experimentally [L\'eonard et al., Nature 543, 87 (2017)], one can engineer models with continuous symmetries by coupling two cavity modes to trapped atoms, via a Raman pumping geometry. Considering specifically cases where internal states of the atoms couple to the cavity, we show an extended range of parameters for which continuous symmetry breaking can occur, and we classify the distinct steady states and time-dependent states that arise for different points in this extended parameter regime.
