We develop a quantum model based on the correspondence between energy distribution between harmonic oscillators and the partition of an integer number. A proper choice of the interaction Hamiltonian acting within this manifold of states allows us to examine both the quantum typicality and the non-exponential relaxation in the same system. A quantitative agreement between the field-theoretical calculations and the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is demonstrated.
