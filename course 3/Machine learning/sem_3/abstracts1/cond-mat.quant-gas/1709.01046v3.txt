Topology plays an important role in modern solid state physics describing intriguing quantum states such as topological insulators. It is an intrinsically non-local property and therefore challenging to access, often studied only via the resulting edge states. Here, we measure the topological index directly from the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of the bulk. We use the mapping of the Chern number to the linking number of dynamical vortex trajectories appearing after a quench to the Hamiltonian of interest. We thereby map out the topological phase diagram of quantum gases in optical lattices via a purely dynamical response. Such relations between two topological indices in static and dynamical properties could be also an important approach for exploring topology in the case of interactions.
