We numerically investigate the low-lying entanglement spectrum of the ground state of random one dimensional spin chains obtained after a partition of the chain in two equal halves. We consider two paradigmatic models: the spin-1/2 random transverse field Ising model, solved exactly, and the spin-1 random Heisenberg model, simulated using the density matrix renormalization group. In both cases we analyse the mean Schmidt gap, defined as the difference of the two largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of one of the two partitions, averaged over many disorder realizations. We find that the Schmidt gap detects very well the critical point and scales with universal critical exponents.
