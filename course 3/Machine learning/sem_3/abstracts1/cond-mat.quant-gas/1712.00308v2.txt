We demonstrate that identical impurities immersed in a two-dimensional many-particle bath can be viewed as flux-tube-charged-particle composites described by fractional statistics. In particular, we find that the bath manifests itself as an external magnetic flux tube with respect to the impurities, and hence the time-reversal symmetry is broken for the effective Hamiltonian describing the impurities. The emerging flux tube acts as a statistical gauge field after a certain critical coupling. This critical coupling corresponds to the intersection point between the quasiparticle state and the phonon wing, where the angular momentum is transferred from the impurity to the bath. This amounts to a novel configuration with emerging anyons. The proposed setup paves the way to realizing anyons using electrons interacting with superfluid helium or lattice phonons, as well as using atomic impurities in ultracold gases.
