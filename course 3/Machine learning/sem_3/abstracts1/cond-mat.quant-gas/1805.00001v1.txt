In this paper, I'm going to talk about the theoretical and experimental progress in studying spin-orbit coupled spin-1 bosons. Realization of spin-orbit coupled quantum gases opens a new avenue in cold atom physics. In particular, the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and inter-atomic interaction leads to many intriguing phenomena. Moreover, the non-zero momentum of ground states can be controlled by external fields, which allows for good quantum control.
