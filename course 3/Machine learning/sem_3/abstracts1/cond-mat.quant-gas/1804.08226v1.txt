Topological quantum states are characterized by nonlocal invariants, and their detection is intrinsically challenging. Various strategies have been developed to study topological Hamiltonians through their equilibrium states. We present a fundamentally new, high-precision dynamical approach, revealing topology through the unitary evolution after a quench from a topological trivial initial state with a two-dimensional Chern band realized in an ultracold Rb-87 atom gas. The emerging ring structure in the spin dynamics uniquely determines the Chern number for the post-quench band and enables probing the full phase diagram of the band topology with high precision as well as the complex band structure. Our dynamical approach provides a way towards observing a universal bulk-ring correspondence, which has broad applications in exploring topological quantum matter.
