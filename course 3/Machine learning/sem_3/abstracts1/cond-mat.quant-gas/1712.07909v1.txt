The hallmark of superfluidity is the appearance of metastable flow-states that carry a persistent circulating current. Considering Bose-Hubbard superfluid rings, we clarify the role of "quantum chaos" in this context. We show that the standard Landau and Bogoliubov superfluidity criteria fail for such low-dimensional circuits. We also discuss the feasibility for a coherent operation of a SQUID-like setup. Finally, we address the manifestation of the strong many-body dynamical localization effect.
