We present a flexible scheme to realize exact flat Landau levels on curved spherical geometry in a system of spinful cold atoms. This is achieved by Floquet engineering of a magnetic quadrupole field. We show that a synthetic monopole field in real space can be created. We prove that the system can be exactly mapped to the electron-monopole system on sphere, thus realizing Haldane's spherical geometry for fractional quantum Hall physics. The scheme works for either bosons or fermions. We investigate the ground state vortex pattern for an $s$-wave interacting atomic condensate by mapping this system to the classical Thompson's problem. We further study the distortion and stability of the vortex pattern when dipolar interaction is present. Our scheme is compatible with current experimental setup, and may serve as a promising route of investigating quantum Hall physics and exotic spinor vortex matter on curved space.
