We present analytical results for the nonlocal pair correlations in one-dimensional bosonic systems with repulsive contact interactions that are uniformly valid from the classical regime of high temperatures down to weak quantum degeneracy entering the regime of ultralow temperatures. By using the information contained in the short-time approximations of the full many-body propagator we derive results that are non-perturbative in the interaction parameter while covering a wide range of temperatures and densities. For the case of three particles we give a simple formula for arbitrary couplings that is exact in the dilute limit while remaining valid up to the regime where the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_T$ is of the order of the characteristic length $L$ of the system. We then show how to use this result to find analytical expressions for the nonlocal correlations for arbitrary but fixed particle numbers $N$ including finite size corrections. Neglecting the latter in the thermodynamic limit provides an expansion in the quantum degeneracy parameter $N\lambda_T/L$. We compare our analytical results with numerical Bethe ansatz calculations finding excellent agreement.
