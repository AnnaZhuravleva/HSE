An array of single Rydberg atoms driven by a frequency modulated light field is studied. The periodic modulation effectively modifies the Rabi coupling, leading to unprecedented dynamics in the presence of Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. They include state dependent population trapping, the Rydberg blockade for small and anti-blockades at large interaction strengths. Interestingly, the Schrieffer-wolf transformation reveals a fundamental process in Rydberg gases, correlated Rabi oscillations, arising from the long-range interactions, provides an alternative depiction for Rydberg blockade and it exhibits a nontrivial behaviour in the presence of periodic modulation. The dynamical localization of a many body configuration in a driven Rydberg-lattice is discussed.
