We explore novel features of a fermionic superfluid in which the pairing interaction includes a contribution from the exchange of a dynamical bosonic mode. We show that the interaction retardation effect (IRE) generically leads to a quantum depletion of the superfluid density and hence a nonzero normal fraction even at zero temperature. For s-wave pairing, the IRE also leads to a nonvanishing spin susceptibility at zero temperature, providing a mechanism for the coexistence of pairing and magnetization. While these effects are negligible for weak pairing, they become sizable at strong pairing. For the double superfluidity in ultracold Fermi-Bose mixtures, the quantum depletion induced by the IRE just gives rise to the Andreev-Bashkin drag effect, indicating a strong entrainment between the two superfluid components. The IRE may also provide a new source for the superfluid fraction reduction of neutron matter, which is crucial for models of neutron star glitches based on neutron superfluidity.
