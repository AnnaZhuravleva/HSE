Here, I focus on the use of microscopic, few-body techniques that are relevant in the many-body problem. These methods can be divided into indirect and direct. In particular, indirect methods are concerned with the simplification of the many-body problem by substituting the full, microscopic interactions by pseudopotentials which are designed to reproduce collisional information at specified energies, or binding energies in the few-body sector. These simplified interactions yield more tractable theories of the many-body problem, and are equivalent to effective field theory of interactions. Direct methods, which so far are most useful in one spatial dimension, have the goal of attacking the many-body problem at once by using few-body information only. Here, I will present non-perturbative direct methods to study one-dimensional fermionic and bosonic gases in one dimension.
