We describe an experiment where spin squeezing occurs spontaneously within a standard Ramsey sequence driving a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of 87Rb atoms trapped in an elongated magnetic trap. Multiparticle entanglement is generated by state-dependent collisional interactions, despite the near-identical scattering lengths of the spin states in 87Rb. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we observe a metrological spin squeezing that reaches 1.3+/-0.4dB for 5000 atoms, with a contrast of 90+/-1%. The method may be applied to realize spin-squeezed BEC sources for atom interferometry without the need for cavities, state-dependent potentials or Feshbach resonances.
