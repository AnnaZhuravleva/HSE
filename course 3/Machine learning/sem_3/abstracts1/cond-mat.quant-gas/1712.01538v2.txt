We study the ground state of a one-dimensional (1D) trapped Bose gas with two mobile impurity particles. To investigate this set-up, we develop a variational procedure in which the coordinates of the impurity particles are slow-like variables. We validate our method using the exact results obtained for small systems. Then, we discuss energies and pair densities for systems that contain of the order of one hundred atoms. We show that bosonic non-interacting impurities cluster, in a way realizing a few-body analogue of the phase separation of two Bose gases. To explain the clustering, we calculate and discuss induced impurity-impurity potentials in a harmonic trap. Further, we compute the force between static impurities in a ring ({\it {\'a} la} the Casimir force), and contrast the two effective potentials: the one obtained from the mean-field approximation, and the one due to the one-phonon exchange. Our formalism and findings are important for understanding [beyond the polaron model] the physics of modern 1D cold-atom systems with more than one impurity.
