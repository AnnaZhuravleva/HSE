Any experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) deals with composite bosons (cobosons), which are quasi-particles made of fermion pairs that suffer Pauli blocking. We evidence that the prime consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle is to prevent cobosons from having their centers of mass located at the same position within their spatial extension. We moreover predict a many-body effect induced by Pauli blocking that leads to high interference wave modes resulting from fermion exchanges between two colliding coboson condensates. These two effects can be detected by measuring spatial correlation functions. We here propose an original procedure to exactly derive such correlation functions for Frenkel-like cobosons characterized by just their momentum. We physically extend the obtained results to more complex Wannier-like cobosons that have an additional relative motion index. In addition to revealing the physics involved in results previously obtained for elementary boson condensates, we use Shiva diagrams to show how it is changed for cobosons. The predictions we here present, established for matter bosons, are directly applicable to experiments.
