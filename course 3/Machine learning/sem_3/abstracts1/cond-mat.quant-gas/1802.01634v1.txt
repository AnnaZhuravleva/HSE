We show that a system of three species of one-dimensional fermions, with an attractive three-body contact interaction, features a scale anomaly directly related to the anomaly of two-dimensional fermions with two-body forces. We show, furthermore, that those two cases (and their multi species generalizations) are the only non-relativistic systems with contact interactions that display a scale anomaly. While the two-dimensional case is well-known and has been under study both experimentally and theoretically for years, the one-dimensional case presented here has remained unexplored. For the latter, we calculate the impact of the anomaly on the equation of state, which appears through the generalization of Tan's contact for three-body forces, and determine the pressure at finite temperature. In addition, we show that the third-order virial coefficient is proportional to the second-order coefficient of the two-dimensional two-body case.
