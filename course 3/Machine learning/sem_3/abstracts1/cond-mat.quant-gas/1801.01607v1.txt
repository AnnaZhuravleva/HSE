We consider propagation of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the presence of a step-like BEC horizon -- a stationary superfluid flow where the superfluid velocity abruptly changes from subsonic to supersonic. We argue that the astrophysical analogue of this system is a black hole with a small mass in a theory whose UV completion breaks Lorentz symmetry at short distances. We solve the corresponding Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and find that the scattering process responsible for Hawking radiation also necessarily produces an evanescent tail of negative-norm quasiparticles localized near the horizon. These evanescent modes, which we dub "sonic hairs," are a direct result of the Lorentz-violating non-linear dispersion relation. Even though the localized modes do not enter the S-matrix they must be accounted for in order to obtain the Hawking distribution. Additionally, we show that the black hole's sonic hair undergoes quantum-interference effects with the outgoing Hawking particles which dresses physical observables near the event-horizon. We conclude by discussing possible connections between these modes and the black-hole information problem.
