Following up on a recent analysis of two cold atoms in a time-dependent harmonic trap in one dimension, we explore the entanglement entropy of two and three fermions in the same situation when driven through a parametric resonance. We find that the presence of such a resonance in the two-particle system leaves a clear imprint on the entanglement entropy. We show how the signal is modified by attractive and repulsive contact interactions, and how it remains present for the three-particle system. Additionaly, we extend the work of recent experiments to demonstrate how restricting observation to a limited subsystem gives rise to locally thermal behavior.
