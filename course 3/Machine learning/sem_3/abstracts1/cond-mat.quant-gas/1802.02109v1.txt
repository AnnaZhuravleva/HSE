Topology and disorder have deep connections and a rich combined influence on quantum transport. In order to probe these connections, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. We characterize the system's topology through measurement of the mean chiral displacement of the bulk density extracted from quench dynamics. We find evidence for the topological Anderson insulator phase, in which the band structure of an otherwise trivial wire is driven topological by the presence of added disorder. In addition, we observed the robustness of topological wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform will enable future realizations of strongly interacting topological fluids.
