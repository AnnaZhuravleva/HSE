The dissipative response of a quantum system upon a time-dependent drive can be exploited as a probe of its geometric and topological properties. In this work, we explore the implications of such phenomena in the context of two-dimensional gases subjected to a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that a filled Landau level exhibits a quantized circular dichroism, which can be traced back to its underlying non-trivial topology. Based on selection rules, we find that this quantized circular dichroism can be suitably described in terms of Rabi oscillations, whose frequencies satisfy simple quantization laws. Moreover, we discuss how these quantized dissipative responses can be probed locally, both in the bulk and at the boundaries of the quantum Hall system. This work suggests alternative forms of topological probes in quantum systems based on circular dichroism.
