We study entanglement and squeezing of two uncoupled impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate. We treat them as two quantum Brownian particles interacting with a bath composed of the Bogoliubov modes of the condensate. The Langevin-like quantum stochastic equations derived exhibit memory effects. We study two scenarios: (i) In the absence of an external potential, we observe sudden death of entanglement; (ii) In the presence of an external harmonic potential, entanglement survives even at the asymptotic time limit. Our study considers experimentally tunable parameters.
