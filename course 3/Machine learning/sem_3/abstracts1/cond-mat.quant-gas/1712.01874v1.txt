When a mobile hole is moving in an anti-ferromagnet it distorts the surrounding Neel order and forms a magnetic polaron. Such interplay between hole motion and anti-ferromagnetism is believed to be at the heart of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates. We study a single hole described by the t-Jz model with Ising interactions between the spins in 2D. This situation can be experimentally realized in quantum gas microscopes. When the hole hopping is much larger than couplings between the spins, we find strong evidence that magnetic polarons can be understood as bound states of two partons, a spinon and a holon carrying spin and charge quantum numbers respectively. We introduce a microscopic parton description which is benchmarked by comparison with results from advanced numerical simulations. Using this parton theory, we predict a series of excited states that are invisible in the spectral function and correspond to rotational excitations of the spinon-holon pair. This is reminiscent of mesonic resonances observed in high-energy physics, which can be understood as rotating quark antiquark pairs. We also apply the strong coupling parton theory to study far-from equilibrium dynamics of magnetic polarons observable in current experiments with ultracold atoms. Our work supports earlier ideas that partons in a confining phase of matter represent a useful paradigm in condensed-matter physics and in the context of high-Tc superconductivity. While direct observations of spinons and holons in real space are impossible in traditional solid-state experiments, quantum gas microscopes provide a new experimental toolbox. We show that, using this platform, direct observations of partons in and out-of equilibrium are possible. Extensions of our approach to the t-J model are also discussed. Our predictions in this case are relevant to current experiments with quantum gas microscopes for ultracold atoms.
