This paper studies the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model with the nearest-neighbor repulsion by using time-dependent Gutzwiller methods. Near the unit fillings, the phase diagram of the model contains density wave (DW), supersolid (SS) and superfluid (SF). The above three phases are separated by two second-order phase transitions. We study "slow-quench" dynamics by varying the hopping parameters in the Hamiltonian as a function of time. In the phase transition from the DW to SS and SF, we focus on how the SF order forms and study scaling laws of the SF correlation length, vortex density, etc. The results are compared with the Kibble-Zureck scaling. On the other hand from the SF to DW, we study how the DW order evolves and generation of the domain walls and vortices. Measurement of first-order SF coherence reveals interesting behavior in the DW regime.
