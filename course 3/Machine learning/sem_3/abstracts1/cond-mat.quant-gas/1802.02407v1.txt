Ultracold interacting atoms are an excellent tool to study correlation functions of many-body systems that are generally eluding detection and manipulation. Herein, we investigate the ground state of bosons in a tilted triple-well potential and characterize the many-body state by the eigenvalues of its reduced one-body density matrix and Glauber correlation functions. We unveil how the interplay between the interaction strength and the tilt can be used to control the number of correlated wells as well as the fragmentation, i.e. the number of macroscopic eigenvalues of the reduced one-body density matrix.
