We investigate the process of spin squeezing in a ferromagnetic dipolar spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate under the driven oneaxis twisting scheme, with emphasis on the detrimental effect of noisy environments (stray magnetic fields) which completely destroy the spin squeezing. By applying concatenated dynamical decoupling pulse sequences with a moderate bias magnetic field to suppress the effect of the noisy environments, we faithfully reconstruct the spin squeezing process under realistic experimental conditions. Our noise-resistant method is ready to be employed to generate the spin squeezed state in a dipolar spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate and paves a feasible way to the Heisenberg-limit quantum metrology
