We study from the perspective of quantum information scrambling an acoustic black hole modelled by two semi-infinite, stationary, one dimensional condensates, connected by a spatial step-like discontinuity, and flowing respectively at subsonic and supersonic velocities. We develop a simple analytical treatment based on Bogolyubov theory of quantum fluctuations which is sufficient to derive analogue Hawking emission, and we compute out-of-time order correlations (OTOCs) of the Bose density field. We find that sonic black holes are slow scramblers contrary to their astrophysical counterparts: this manifests in a power law growth $\propto t^2$ of OTOCs in contrast to the exponential increase in time expected for fast scramblers.
