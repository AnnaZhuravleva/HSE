We theoretically study the width of the s-wave confinement-induced resonance (CIR) in quasi-one-dimensional atomic gases under tunable transversely anisotropic confinement. We find that the width of the CIR can be tuned by varying the transverse anisotropy. The change in the width of the CIR can manifest itself in the position of the discontinuity in the interaction energy density, which can be probed experimentally.
