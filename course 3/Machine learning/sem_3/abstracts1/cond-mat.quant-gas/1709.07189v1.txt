The realization of quantum field theories on an optical lattice is an important subject toward the quantum simulation. We argue that such efforts would lead to the experimental realizations of quantum black holes. The basic idea is to construct non-gravitational systems which are equivalent to the quantum gravitational systems via the holographic principle. Here the `equivalence' means that two theories cannot be distinguished even in principle. Therefore, if the holographic principle is true, one can create actual quantum black holes by engineering the non-gravitational systems on an optical lattice. In this presentation, we consider the simplest example: the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We design an experimental scheme for creating the SYK model with use of ultra-cold fermionic atoms such as Lithium-6.
