We characterize the anisotropic differential AC Stark shift for the Dy 626 nm narrow line transition, induced in a far-detuned 1070 nm optical dipole trap, and observe the existence of a "magic polarization" for which the polarizabilities of the ground and excited states are equal. From our measurements we extract both the scalar and tensorial components of the dynamic dipole polarizability for the excited state, $\alpha_{e}^\text{s} = 179 (5)\,\alpha_\text{0}$ and $\alpha_{e}^\text{t} = 35 (2)\,\alpha_\text{0}$, respectively, where $\alpha_\text{0}$ is the atomic unit for the electric polarizability. Furthermore, we utilize our findings to optimize the efficiency of Doppler cooling of a trapped gas, by controlling the sign and magnitude of the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transition.
