We study a one-dimensional system of strongly-correlated bosons interacting with a dynamical lattice. A minimal model describing the latter is provided by extending the standard Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian to include extra degrees of freedom on the bonds of the lattice. We show that this model is capable of reproducing phenomena similar to those present in usual fermion-phonon models. In particular, we discover a bosonic analog of the Peierls transition, where the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice is spontaneously broken. The latter provides a dynamical mechanism to obtain a topological insulator in the presence of interactions, analogous to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for electrons. We numerically characterize the phase diagram of the model, which includes different types of bond order waves and topological solitons. Finally, we study the possibility of implementing the model experimentally using atomic systems.
