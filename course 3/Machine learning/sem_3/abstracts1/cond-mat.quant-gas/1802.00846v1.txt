Weak potential wells (or traps) in one and two dimensions, and the potential wells slightly deeper than the critical ones in three dimensions, feature shallow bound states with localization length much larger than the well radii. We address a simple fundamental question of how many repulsively interacting bosons can be localized by such traps. We find that under rather generic conditions, for both weakly and strongly repulsive particles, in two and three dimensions--but not in one-dimension!--the potential well can trap infinitely many bosons. For example, even hard-core repulsive interactions do not prevent this "trapping collapse" phenomenon from taking place. For the weakly interacting/dilute regime, the effect can be revealed by the mean-field argument, while in the case of strong correlations the evidence comes from path-integral simulations. We also discuss the possibility of having a transition between the infinite and finite number of trapped particles when strong repulsive inter-particle correlations are increased.
