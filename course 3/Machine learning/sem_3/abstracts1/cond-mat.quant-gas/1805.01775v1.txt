We consider the two-dimenstional Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing a Bose-Einstein condensate in an isotropic harmonic trap. In the small coupling regime, this equation is accurately approximated over long times by the corresponding nonlinear resonant system whose structure is determined by the fully resonant spectrum of the linearized problem. We focus on two types of consistent truncations of this resonant system: first, to sets of modes of fixed angular momentum, and second, to excited Landau levels. Each of these truncations admits a set of explicit analytic solutions with initial conditions parametrized by three complex numbers. Viewed in position space, the fixed angular momentum solutions describe modulated oscillations of dark rings, while the excited Landau level solutions describe modulated precession of small arrays of vortices and antivortices. We place our findings in the context of similar results for other spatially confined nonlinear Hamiltonian systems in recent literature.
