We present an extension of the framework introduced in [1] to treat multicomponent systems, showing that new degrees of freedom are necessary in order to obtain the desired boundary conditions. We then apply this extended framework to the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations to investigate the ground states of two-component systems with equal masses thereby extending previous work in the lowest Landau limit [2] to arbitrary interactions within Gross-Pitaevskii theory. We show that away from the lowest-Landau level limit, the predominant vortex lattice consists of two interlaced triangular lattices. Finally, we derive a linear relation which accurately describes the phase boundaries in the strong interacting regimes.
