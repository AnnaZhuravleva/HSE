This letter explains features of the emission of jets by driven Bose--Einstein condensates, discovered by Clark et al. (Nature 551, 356359), by drawing analogies with particle and nuclear physics. The widening of the $\Delta\phi=\pi$ peak in the angular correlation function is due to a dijet acollinearity, like in parton--parton scattering with "intrinsic $k_{T}$". I propose new studies of exotic forms of matter formed by driven ultra-cold atoms by analogy to studies of the quark--gluon plasma.
