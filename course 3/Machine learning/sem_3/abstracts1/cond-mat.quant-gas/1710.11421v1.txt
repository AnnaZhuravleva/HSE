The theoretical treatment of Fermi systems consisting of particles with unequal masses is challenging. Even in one spatial dimension analytic solutions are limited to special configurations and numerical progress with Monte Carlo simulations is hindered by the sign-problem. To circumvent this issue, we exploit the Complex Langevin approach and study one-dimensional mass-imbalanced two-component Fermi gases with attractive and repulsive interactions. We find perfect agreement with results obtained by other methods in a range of parameter space. Promisingly, our approach is not limited to the specific model presented here and can easily be extended to finite spin polarization and, most notably, can also be applied in higher dimensions.
