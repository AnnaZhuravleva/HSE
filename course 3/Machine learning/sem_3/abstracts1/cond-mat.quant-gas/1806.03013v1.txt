We study a quasi-two dimensional gas of bosonic dipoles, calculating the beyond mean field corrections to the ground state energy and chemical potential neglecting the transverse mode structure. We show that the corrections are sensitive to the high momentum part of the interaction and cannot be expressed solely in terms of the scattering length and the dipole strength. While nonuniversal, the correction is found to be negative, which provides an additional attractive term in the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, enhancing the roton instability.
