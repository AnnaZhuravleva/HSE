We analyze the spectral properties of the Goldstino excitation in a Bose-Fermi mixture of cold atoms, whose masses and interaction strengths are tuned so that the hamiltonian is supersymmetric. We consider systems at zero temperature and assume that, in the weak coupling regime, the fermions form a Fermi sea, while the bosons form a Bose-Einstein condensate. We study the excitation spectrum within a simple extension of the random phase approximation, taking into account the mixing between the supercharge and the fermion caused by the condensate. This mixing affects the fermion spectrum strongly. We argue that the corresponding modification of the fermion spectrum, and the associated fermion distribution in momentum space, could be accessible experimentally, and potentially allow for a determination of the Goldstino properties.
