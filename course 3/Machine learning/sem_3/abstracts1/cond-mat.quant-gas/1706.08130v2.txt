In this paper, we study a one-dimensional boson system in a superlattice potential.This system is experimentally feasible by using ultracold atomic gases,and attracts much attention these days. It is expected that the system has a topological phase called topological Mott insulator (TMI). We show that in strongly-interacting cases, the competition between the superlattice potential and the on-site interaction leads to various TMIs with non-vanishing integer Chern number. Compared to hard-core case, the soft-core boson system exhibits rich phase diagrams including various non-trivial TMIs. By using the exact diagonalization,we obtain detailed bulk-global phase diagrams including the TMIs with high Chern numbers and also various non-topological phases. We also show that in adiabatic experimental setups, the strongly-interacting bosonic TMIs exhibit the topological particle transfer, i.e., topological charge pumping phenomenon, similarly to weakly-interacting systems. The various TMIs are characterized by topological charge pumping as it is closely related to the Chern number, and therefor the Chern number is to be observed in feasible experiments.
