Dark and grey soliton-like states are shown to emerge from numerically constructed superpositions of translationally-invariant eigenstates of the interacting Bose gas in a toroidal trap. The exact quantum many-body dynamics reveals a density depression with superdiffusive spreading that is absent in the mean-field treatment of solitons. A simple theory based on finite-size bound states of holes with quantum-mechanical center-of-mass motion quantitatively explains the time-evolution of the superposition states and predicts quantum effects that could be observed in ultra-cold gas experiments. The soliton phase step is shown to be a key ingredient of an accurate finite size approximation, which enables us to compare the theory with numerical simulations. The fundamental soliton width, an invariant property of the quantum dark soliton, is shown to deviate from the Gross-Pitaevskii predictions in the interacting regime and vanishes in the Tonks-Girardeau limit.
