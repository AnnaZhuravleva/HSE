To realize high-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) couplings for ultracold atoms is of great importance for quantum simulation. Here we report the observation of a long-lived two-dimensional (2D) SO coupled Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of novel band topology and high controllability. Unlike our recent achievement of 2D SO coupling which is restricted in blue-detuned optical lattice and has limitations in controllability and lifetime, in the present report we overwhelm all the previous restrictions and realize the SO coupling with precisely controllable $C_4$ symmetry based on a new scheme. Due to the high symmetry, the present realization suits for both blue- and red-tuned lattices, renders broad topological regions in arbitrary lattice and Raman coupling strengths, and has a lifetime being up to several seconds, one order exceeding that observed in previous experiment. We measure a stable crossover between 1D and 2D SO couplings, map the band structure through spin injection radio-frequency spectroscopy, and observe topological phase boundaries which are well consistent with theoretical predictions. The high controllability and long lifetime of the 2D SO coupled degenerate atom gas pave the way for the further studies of exotic quantum phenomena with novel topology, particularly for the quantum many-body physics and quantum far-from-equilibrium dynamics.
