A generalisation of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model for coupled-cavity arrays is introduced, where the embedded two-level system in each cavity is replaced by a $\Xi$-type three-level system. We demonstrate that the resulting effective photon-photon interactions at each site are both two-body and three-body, and that the tuning of the ratio of the two transition dipole matrix elements allows for the modulation of the strength and sign of the two-body attraction respective to the three-body repulsion. This results in a novel mean-field phase diagram for the associated superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum phase transition, with the coexistence of first- and second-order phase transitions and a possible pair superfluid phase in the two-body attractive regime.
