We introduce a rigorous, physically appealing, and practical way to measure distances between exchange-only correlations of interacting many-electron systems, which works regardless of their size and inhomogeneity. We show that this distance captures fundamental physical features such as the periodicity of atomic elements, and that it can be used to effectively and efficiently analyze the performance of density functional approximations. We suggest that this metric can find useful applications in high-throughput materials design.
