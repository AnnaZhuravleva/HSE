We demonstrate optically induced switching between bright and dark charged divacancy defects in 4H-SiC. Photoluminescence excitation and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal the excitation conditions for such charge conversion. For an energy below ~1.3 eV (above ~950 nm), the PL is suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. The PL is recovered in the presence of a higher energy repump laser with a time-averaged intensity less than 0.1% that of the excitation field. Under a repump of 2.33 eV (532 nm), the PL increases rapidly, with a time constant ~30 $\mu$s. By contrast, when the repump is switched off, the PL decreases first within ~100-200 $\mu$s, followed by a much slower decay of a few seconds. We attribute these effects to the conversion between two different charge states. Under an excitation at energy levels below 1.3 eV, V$_{Si}$V$_C$$^0$ are converted into a dark charge state. A repump laser with an energy above 1.3 eV can excite this charged state and recover the bright neutral state. This optically induced charge switching can lead to charge-state fluctuations but can be exploited for long-term data storage or nuclear-spin-based quantum memory.
