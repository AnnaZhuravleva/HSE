We establish a solvable Heisenberg-Ising model on a spin-1 Ni-containing polymer chain, $[Ni (NN'-dmen) (\mu-N_3)_2]$, with $NN'-dmen$ being $NN'-dimethylethylenediamine$, that fully covers the interaction characteristics of the material and by which, we can characterize all the peculiar magnetic features of the polymer, which has been partly studied in experiment. By purely analytical calculations, we can see that the magnetization exhibits three plateaus at zero, mid, and 3/4 of the saturation value at low temperatures below 2 K. The corresponding featuring peaks of magnetic susceptibility are clearly shown. The model also displays plateaus in thermal entanglement that captures the one-to-one correspondence between thermal entanglement plateaus and those of the magnetization. The calculations are done by the transfer matrix technique.
