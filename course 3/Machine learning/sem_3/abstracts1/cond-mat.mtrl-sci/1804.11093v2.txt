We investigate and compare experimental and numerical excitonic spectra of the yellow series in cuprous oxide Cu$_2$O in the Voigt configuration and thus partially extend the results from Schweiner et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 035202 (2017)], who only considered the Faraday configuration. The main difference between the configurations is given by an additional effective electric field in the Voigt configuration, caused by the motion of the exciton through the magnetic field. This Magneto-Stark effect was already postulated by Gross et al. and Thomas et al. in 1961 [Sov. Phys. Solid State 3, 221 (1961); Phys. Rev. 124, 657 (1961)]. Group theoretical considerations show that the field most of all significantly increases the number of allowed lines by decreasing the symmetry of the system. This conclusion is supported by both the experimental and numerical data.
