We present some theoretical results on the lattice vibrations that are necessary for a concise derivation of the Debye-Waller factor in the harmonic approximation. First we obtain an expression for displacement of an atom in a crystal lattice from its equilibrium position. Then we show that an atomic displacement has the Gaussian distribution. Finally, we obtain the computational formula for the Debye-Waller factor in the Debye model.
