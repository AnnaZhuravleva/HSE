Skyrmions are particle-like topological excitations, studied in various condensed matter systems and models of high-energy physics (HEP). They occur as stable spin textures in certain planar magnetic materials and as configurations in chiral nematic liquid crystals, having been originally proposed as model of atomic nuclei. Since magnetic Skyrmions can be accelerated with a current, they have the potential to encode bits in low-power magnetic storage devices. Drawing on techniques from HEP, we demonstrate that magnetic and liquid crystal Skyrmions interact like orientation dependent, localised particles, explaining previously observed Skyrmion behaviour. This interaction motivates the construction of Skyrmion bags: textures of high topological degree which we realise experimentally in liquid crystals, and in magnetic materials by computer simulations. These Skyrmion bags configurations are nested multiple Skyrmions, which act like single Skyrmions in pairwise interaction, and under the influence of a current in magnetic materials. These results emphasize equivalent Skyrmion behaviour in different physical systems, and suggest new, high-density magnetic memory storage devices based on Skyrmion bags.
