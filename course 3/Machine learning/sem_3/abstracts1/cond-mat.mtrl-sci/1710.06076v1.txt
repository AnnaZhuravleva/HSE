Nanodiamonds containing color centers open up many applications in quantum information processing, metrology, and quantum sensing. In particular, silicon vacancy (SiV) centers are prominent candidates as quantum emitters due to their beneficial optical qualities. Here we characterize nanodiamonds produced by a high-pressure high-temperature method without catalyst metals, focusing on two samples with clear SiV signatures. Different growth temperatures and relative content of silicon in the initial compound between the samples altered their nanodiamond size distributions and abundance of SiV centers. Our results show that nanodiamond growth can be controlled and optimized for different applications.
