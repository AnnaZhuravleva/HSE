Could there be a large population of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) formed in the early universe? Whether primordial or formed in Population III, these are likely to be very subdominant compared to the dark matter density, but could seed early dwarf galaxy/globular cluster and supermassive black hole formation. Via survival of dark matter density spikes, we show here that a centrally concentrated relic population of IMBHs, along with ambient dark matter, could account for the Fermi gamma-ray "excess" in the Galactic center because of dark matter particle annihilations.
