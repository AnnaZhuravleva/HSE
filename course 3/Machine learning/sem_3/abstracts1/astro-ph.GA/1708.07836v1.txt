We derive the local dark matter density by applying the integrated Jeans equation method from Silverwood et al. (2016) to SDSS-SEGUE G-dwarf data processed and presented by B\"udenbender et al. (2015). We use the MultiNest Bayesian nested sampling software to fit a model for the baryon distribution, dark matter and tracer stars, including a model for the 'tilt term' that couples the vertical and radial motions, to the data. The $\alpha$-young population from B\"udenbender et al. (2015) yields the most reliable result of $\rho_{\rm DM} = 0.46^{+0.07}_{-0.09}\, {{\rm GeV\, cm}^{-3}} = 0.012^{+0.001}_{-0.002}\, {{\rm M}_\odot \, {\rm pc}^{-3}}$. Our analyses yield inconsistent results for the $\alpha$-young and $\alpha$-old data, pointing to problems in the tilt term and its modelling, the data itself, the assumption of a flat rotation curve, or the effects of disequilibria.
