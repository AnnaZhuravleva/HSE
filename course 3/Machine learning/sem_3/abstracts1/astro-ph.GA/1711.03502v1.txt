Using the dataset of stellar kinematics for the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies, we underpin the goodness of the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) proposal as a solution to the "too-big-to-fail" problem through a detailed fit of the stellar velocity dispersion profiles. The kinematic data are consistent with SIDM if we allow for spatially varying stellar orbital anisotropies. We provide the first data-driven estimate for the SIDM cross-section per unit mass probed by these galaxies, pointing to $\sigma/m \sim$ 0.5 - 3 cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$, in good agreement with recent estimates from the study of the dynamics in spiral galaxies. Our results well match the trends previously observed in pure SIDM N-body simulations. The analysis in this work outlines a complementary approach to simulations in testing SIDM with astrophysical observations.
