We report an empirical relation between radial accelerations due to baryons ($a_{\rm B}$) and dark (or phantom) matter (DM or PM) ($a_{\rm X}$) in the super-critical acceleration range $10^{-9.5} < a_{\rm B} /[{\rm m}~{\rm s}^{-2}] < 10^{-8}$ of galaxies. The relation is derived from a Bayesian inference of the ratio $a_{\rm X}/a_{\rm B}$ based on spherical Jeans Monte Carlo modeling of nearly round pure-bulge (spheroidal, dispersion-supported) galaxies under the $\Lambda$CDM and MOND paradigms. The galaxy sample contains 24 ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ galaxies and 4201 SDSS galaxies covering a wide range of masses, sizes and luminosity density profiles. These galaxies follow a relation $a_{\rm X}/a_{\rm B} = 10^{p} (a_{\rm B}/a_{+1})^q$ with $p = -0.98 \pm 0.03$ (stat) $^{+0.08}_{-0.22}$ (sys) and $q=-0.96 \pm 0.09$ (stat) $^{+0.05}_{-0.23}$ (sys) around a super-critical acceleration $a_{+1}\equiv 1.2\times 10^{-9}~{\rm m}~{\rm s}^{-2}$. This relation narrows down theoretical possibilities of DM or modified gravity, ruling out the vast majority of theoretical proposals and fitting functions motivated mainly from sub-critical acceleration data.
