We examine the possibility that accretion of Dissipative Dark Matter (DDM) onto Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) contributes to the growth rate of Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). Such a scenario could alleviate tension associated with anomalously large SMBHs measured at very early cosmic times, as well as observations that indicate that the growth of the most massive SMBHs occurs before $z\sim6$, with little growth at later times. These observations are not readily explained within standard AGN theory. We find a range in the parameter space of DDM models where we both expect efficient accretion to occur and which is consistent with observations of a large sample of measured SMBHs. When DDM accretion is included, the predicted evolution of this sample seems to be more consistent with assumptions regarding maximal BH seed masses and maximal AGN luminosities.
