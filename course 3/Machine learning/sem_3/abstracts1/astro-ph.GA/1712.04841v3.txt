Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) has long been proposed as a solution to small scale problems posed by standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM). We use numerical simulations to study the effect of dark matter interactions on the morphology of disk galaxies falling into galaxy clusters. The effective drag force on dark matter leads to offsets of the stellar disk with respect to the surrounding halo, causing distortions in the disk. For anisotropic scattering cross-sections of 0.5 and 1.0$\,\textrm{cm}^{2}\textrm{g}^{-1}$, we show that potentially observable warps, asymmetries, and thickening of the disk occur in simulations. We discuss observational tests of SIDM with galaxy surveys and more realistic simulations needed to obtain detailed predictions.
