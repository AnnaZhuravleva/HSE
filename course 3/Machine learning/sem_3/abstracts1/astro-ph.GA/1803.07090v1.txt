Gravitational torques among objects orbiting a supermassive black hole drive the rapid reorientation of orbital planes in nuclear star clusters (NSCs), a process known as vector resonant relaxation. In this letter, we determine the statistical equilibrium of systems with a distribution of masses, semi-major axes, and eccentricities. We average the interaction over the apsidal precession time and construct a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to sample the microcanonical ensemble of the NSC. We examine the case of NSCs formed by episodes of star formation or globular cluster infall. We find that the massive stars and stellar mass black holes form a warped disk, while low mass stars resemble a spherical distribution with a possible net rotation. This explains the origin of the clockwise disk in the Galactic center and predicts a population of black holes (BHs) embedded within this structure. The rate of mergers among massive stars, tidal disruption events among BHs and massive stars, and BH-BH mergers are highly increased in such disks. The first two may explain the origin of the observed G1 and G2 clouds, the latter may be important for gravitational wave detections with LIGO and VIRGO. More generally, black holes are expected to settle in disks in all spherical dense stellar systems including globular clusters.
