In this work, we use current astrometric and spectroscopic data on the S2 star at the Galactic Centre to derive specific constraints on the size of a dark matter density spike around the central supermassive black hole Sgr A*. Our limits are the best direct constraints on a DM spike at the GC for non-annihilating dark matter and exclude a spike with radius greater than a few pc for cuspy outer halos and a few hundred pc for cored outer halos.
