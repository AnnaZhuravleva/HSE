Given an $\alpha > 1$ and a $\theta$ with unbounded continued fraction entries, we characterise new relations between Sturmian subshifts with slope $\theta$ with respect to (i) an $\alpha$-H\"oder regularity condition of a spectral metric, (ii) level sets defined in terms of the Diophantine properties of $\theta$, and (iii) complexity notions which we call $\alpha$-repetitive, $\alpha$-repulsive and $\alpha$-finite; generalisations of the properties known as linearly repetitive, repulsive and power free, respectively. We show that the level sets relate naturally to (exact) Jarn\'{\i}k sets and prove that their Hausdorff dimension is $2/(\alpha + 1)$.
