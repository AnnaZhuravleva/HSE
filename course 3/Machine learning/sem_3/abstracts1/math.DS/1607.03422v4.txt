In the following we are interested in the spectral gaps of discrete quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger operators when the frequency is Diophantine, the potential is analytic, and in the subcritical regime. The gap-labelling theorem asserts in this context that each gap has constant rotation number, labeled by some integer. We prove that the size of these gaps decays exponentially fast with respect to their label. This refines a subexponential bound obtained previously by Sana Ben Hadj Amor. Contrary to her approach, which is based on KAM methods, the arguments in the present paper are non-perturbative, and use quantitative reducibility estimates obtained by Artur Avila and Svetlana Jitomirskaya. As a corollary of our result, we show that under the previous assumptions, the spectrum is 1/2-homogeneous.
