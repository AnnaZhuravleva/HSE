We show a linear response statement for fixed points of a family of Markov operators adapted to transfer operators which are mixing and regularizing. We apply it to random dynamical systems on the interval given by a deterministic map $T$ on the interval and additive noise (distributed according to a bounded variation kernel). We prove linear response, also providing explicit formulas both for deterministic perturbations of the map $T$ and for changes in the size and shape of the noise kernel. The response holds with mild assumptions on the system, allowing the map $T$ to have critical points, contracting and expanding regions. We apply our theory to a model of the Belozuv-Zabotinsky chemical reaction and to random rotations. In the final part of the paper we discuss the linear request problem, determining which perturbations of $T$ return a prescribed response.
