We consider pattern spaces of aperiodic and repetitive Delone sets of finite local complexity. These spaces are compact metric spaces and constitute a special class of foliated spaces. We define and study the natural, essentially unique, diffusion processes on these pattern spaces. These (leafwise) diffusions are defined by Euclidean Brownian motions on the orbits, under the translative action of $\mathbb{R}^d$, of their starting points. We give a simple metric-based proof of their Feller property and prove that, on the other hand, they lack the strong Feller property, hypercontractivity and ultracontractivity. When considered with respect to the unique $\mathbb{R}^d$-invariant measure, these diffusions are symmetric, but heat kernels do not exist. Related self-adjoint Laplacians can be identified, and their spectra are determined by the underlying dynamical system. The associated Dirichlet forms are strongly local, irreducible and recurrent, but not strictly local. We discuss the associated heat semigroup and Sobolev spaces. For harmonic functions we prove a Liouville theorem and orbit-wise regularity results. In the one-dimensional case we establish a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in the $L^2$-sense.
