In this paper we study the phenomenon of phase transitions for the geodesic flow on some geometrically finite negatively curved manifolds. We define a class of potentials going slowly to zero through the cusps of $M$ for which the pressure map exhibits a phase transition. By a careful choice of the metric at the cusp we construct a geometrically finite manifold for which the geometric potential (or unstable Jacobian) exhibits a phase transition. Our results apply, in particular, to the geodesic flow on an $M$-puncture sphere, for every $M\ge 3$, and a suitable choice of Riemannian metric.
