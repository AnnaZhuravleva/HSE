We present and analyze a nonabelian version of the Kuramoto system, which we call the quantum Kuramoto system. We study the stability of several classes of special solutions to this system, and show that for certain connection topologies the system supports multiple attractors. We also present estimates on the maximal possible heterogeneity in this system that can support an attractor, and study the effect of modifications analogous to phase-lag.
