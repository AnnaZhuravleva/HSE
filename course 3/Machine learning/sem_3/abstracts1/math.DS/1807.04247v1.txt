The evolution of an infinite population of interacting point entities placed in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is studied. The elementary evolutionary acts are death of an entity with rate that includes a competition term and independent fission into two entities. The population states are probability measures on the corresponding configuration space and the result is the construction of the evolution of states in the class of sub-Poissonian measures, that corresponds to the lack of clusters in such states. This is considered as a self-regulation in the population due to competition.
