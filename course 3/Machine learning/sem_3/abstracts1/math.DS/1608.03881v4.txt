In this work we study the Ruelle Operator associated to continuous potentials on general compact spaces. We present a new criterion for uniqueness of the eigenmeasures associated to the spectral radius of this operator acting on the space of all real-valued continuous functions defined on some suitable compact metric space. This uniqueness result is obtained by showing that set of eigenmeasures for any continuous potential is a subset of the DLR-Gibbs measures for a suitable quasilocal specification. In particular, we proved that the phase transition in the DLR sense can be obtained by showing the existence of more than one eigenprobability for the dual of the Ruelle operator.   On the context of compact metric state spaces, we obtain the uniform convergence of $n^{-1}\log \mathscr{L}^{n}_{f}(1)(x)$, when $n\to\infty$, to the topological pressure $P(f)$, for any continuous potential $f$. We also consider bounded extensions of the Ruelle operator to the Lebesgue space of integrable functions with respect to the eigenmeasures. We give very general sufficient conditions for the existence of integrable and almost everywhere positive eigenfunctions associated to the spectral radius of the Ruelle operator.   Techniques of super and sub solutions to the eigenvalue problem is developed and employed to construct (semi-explicitly) eigenfunctions for a very large class of continuous potentials having low regularity.
