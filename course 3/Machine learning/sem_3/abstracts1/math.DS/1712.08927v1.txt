We reconsider the Schr\"oder-Siegel problem of conjugating an analytic map in $\mathbb{C}$ in the neighborhood of a fixed point to its linear part, extending it to the case of dimension $n>1$. Assuming a condition which is equivalent to Bruno's one on the eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$ of the linear part we show that the convergence radius $\rho$ of the conjugating transformation satisfies $\ln \rho(\lambda )\geq -C\Gamma(\lambda)+C'$ with $\Gamma(\lambda)$ characterizing the eigenvalues $\lambda$, a constant $C'$ not depending on $\lambda$ and $C=1$. This improves the previous results for $n>1$, where the known proofs give $C=2$. We also recall that $C=1$ is known to be the optimal value for $n=1$.
