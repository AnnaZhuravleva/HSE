Spin polarized states in nuclear matter with an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction are studied for a wide range of isospin asymmetries and densities. Based on a Fermi liquid theory, it is shown that there are a few possible scenarios of spin ordered phase transitions: (a) nuclear matter undergoes at some critical density a phase transition to a spin polarized state with the oppositely directed spins of neutrons and protons (Skyrme SLy4 and Gogny D1S interactions); (b) at some critical density, a spin polarized state with the like-directed neutron and proton spins appears (Skyrme SkI5 interaction); (c) nuclear matter under increasing density, at first, undergoes a phase transition to the state with the opposite directions of neutron and proton spins, which goes over at larger density to the state with the same direction of nucleon spins (Skyrme SkI3 interaction).
