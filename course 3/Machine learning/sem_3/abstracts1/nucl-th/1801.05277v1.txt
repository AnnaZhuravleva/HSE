In this work, we calculate the neutron anomalous magnetic moment supposing that this value can depend on the density and magnetic field of system. We employ the lowest order constraint variation (LOCV) method and $AV_{18}$ nuclear potential to calculate the medium dependency of the neutron anomalous magnetic moment. It is confirmed that the neutron anomalous magnetic moment increases by increasing the density, while it decreases as the magnetic field grows. The energy and equation of state for the system have also been investigated.
