The behavior of the collective rotor in wobbling motion is investigated within the particle-rotor model for the nucleus $^{135}$Pr by transforming the wave functions from the $K$-representation to the $R$-representation. After reproducing the experimental energy spectra and wobbling frequencies, the evolution of the wobbling mode in $^{135}$Pr, from transverse at low spins to longitudinal at high spins, is illustrated by the distributions of the total angular momentum in the intrinsic reference frame (azimuthal plot). Finally, the coupling schemes of the angular momenta of the rotor and the high-$j$ particle for transverse and longitudinal wobbling are obtained from the analysis of the probability distributions of the rotor angular momentum ($R$-plots) and their projections onto the three principal axes ($K_R$-plots).
