The creation of transuranium nuclides under pulsed neutron fluxes of thermonuclear explosions is investigated within the kinetic model of the astrophysical r process, taking into account the time dependence of the external parameters and the processes accompanying the beta decay of neutron-rich nuclei. Time-dependent neutron fluxes in the interval ~ 10e-6 s were modeled within the framework of the developed adiabatic binary model. The probabilities of beta-delayed processes were calculated on the base of the microscopic theory of finite Fermi systems. Calculations of transuranium nuclides yields Y(A) are made for three experimental USA thermonuclear explosions "Mike" (YM), "Par" (YP) and "Barbel" (YB). The root-mean-square deviations of the calculations compare to the experimental data (r.m.s.) are 91% for YM, 33% for YP, 29% for YB , which are significantly lower than for other known calculations. The exponential approximation of the experimental dependences Y(A) is carried out and the obtained values of r.m.s are equal to 56%, 86.8% and 60.2% for YM, YP and YB correspondingly, which is better or comparable with other calculations. An even-odd anomaly in the observed yields of heavy nuclei is explained by the predominant influence of processes accompanying the beta decay of heavy neutron-excess isotopes.
