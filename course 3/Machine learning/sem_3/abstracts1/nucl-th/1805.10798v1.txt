We aim to describe the process of dissociation and recombination of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma. Therefore we developed a model which allows to observe the time evolution of a system with various numbers of charm-anticharm-quark pairs at different temperatures. The motion of the heavy quarks is realized within a Langevin approach. We use a simplified version of a formalism developed by Blaizot et al. in which an Abelian plasma is considered where the heavy quarks interact over a Coulomb like potential. We have demonstrated, that the system reaches the expected thermal distribution in the equilibrium limit.
