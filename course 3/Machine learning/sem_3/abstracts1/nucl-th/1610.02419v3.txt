The charged-particle multiplicity distribution and the transverse-energy distribution measured in heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and LHC energies are described using the two-component model approach based on a convolution of the Monte Carlo Glauber model with the Weibull model for particle production. The model successfully describes the multiplicity and transverse-energy distribution of minimum-bias collision data for a wide range of energies. The Weibull-Glauber model can be used to determine the centrality classes in heavy-ion collisions as an alternative to the conventional negative binomial distribution (NBD)-Glauber approach.
