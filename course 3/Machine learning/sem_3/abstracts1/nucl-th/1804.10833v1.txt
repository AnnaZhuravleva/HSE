Encouraged with the evidence for Z = 6 magic number in neutron-rich carbon isotopes, we have performed relativistic mean-field plus BCS calculations to investigate ground state properties of entire chains of isotopes(isotones) with Z(N) = 6 including even and odd mass nuclei. Our calculations include deformation, binding energy, separation energy, single particle energy, rms radii along with charge and neutron density profile etc., and are found in an excellent match with latest experimental results demonstrating Z = 6 as a strong magic number. N = 6 is also found to own similar kind of strong magic character.
