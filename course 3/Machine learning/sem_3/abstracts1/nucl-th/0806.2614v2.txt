We calculate the one-photon loop radiative corrections to charged pion Compton scattering, $\pi^- \gamma \to \pi^- \gamma $. Ultraviolet and infrared divergencies are both treated in dimensional regularization. Analytical expressions for the ${\cal O}(\alpha)$ corrections to the invariant Compton scattering amplitudes, $A(s,u)$ and $B(s,u)$, are presented for 11 classes of contributing one-loop diagrams. Infrared finiteness of the virtual radiative corrections is achieved (in the standard way) by including soft photon radiation below an energy threshold $\lambda$, and its relation to the experimental detection threshold is discussed. We find that the radiative corrections are maximal in backward directions, reaching e.g. -2.4% for a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=4m_\pi$ and $\lambda=5 $MeV. Furthermore, we extend our calculation of the radiative corrections by including the leading pion structure effect (at low energies) in form of its electric and magnetic polarizability difference, $\alpha_\pi - \beta_\pi \simeq 6\cdot 10^{-4} $fm$^3$. We find that this structure effect does not change the relative size and angular dependence of the radiative corrections to pion Compton scattering. Our results are particularly relevant for analyzing the COMPASS experiment at CERN which aims at measuring the pion electric and magnetic polarizabilities with high statistics using the Primakoff effect.
