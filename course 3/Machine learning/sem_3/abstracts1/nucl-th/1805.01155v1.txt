Photoproduction of eta mesons from nucleons can provide valuable information about the excitation spectrum of the nucleons. The angular dependence of photoproduction in the photon-induced reaction is investigated in the multi-source thermal model. The results are compared with experimental data from the decay mode. They are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is shown that the movement factor increases linearly with the photon beam energies. And, the deformation and translation of emission sources are visually given in the formalism.
