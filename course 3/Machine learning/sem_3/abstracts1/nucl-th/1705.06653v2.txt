$\phi$-meson--nucleus bound state energies and absorption widths are calculated for seven selected nuclei by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with complex optical potentials. Essential input for the calculations, namely the medium-modified $K$ and $\overline{K}$ meson masses, as well as the density distributions in nuclei, are obtained from the quark-meson coupling model. The attractive potential for the $\phi$-meson in the nuclear medium originates from the in-medium enhanced $K\overline{K}$ loop in the $\phi$-meson self-energy. The results suggest that the $\phi$-meson should form bound states with all the nuclei considered. However, the identification of the signal for these predicted bound states will need careful investigation because of their sizable absorption widths.
