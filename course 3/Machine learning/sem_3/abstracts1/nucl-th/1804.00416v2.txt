We construct a microscopic optical potential including breakup effects for $d$ scattering within the Glauber model, in which a nucleon-nucleus potential is derived by the $g$-matrix folding model. The derived microscopic optical potential is referred to as the eikonal potential. For $d$ scattering, the calculated elastic cross section with the eikonal potential well reproduces the result with an exact calculation estimated by the continuum-discretized coupled channels method. We found that the eikonal potential takes into account breakup effects of $d$ within the adiabatic approximation, which is valid for scattering at high incident energies. The eikonal potential model is expected to be the Glauber model excluded the eikonal approximation.
