Non-equilibrium corrections in a hot QCD medium modify the "hard thermal loops" (HTL) which determine the resummed propagators for gluons with soft momenta as well as the Debye screening and Landau damping mass scales. We focus on bulk viscous corrections to a thermal fixed point. The screening and damping mass scales are sensitive to the bulk pressure and perhaps to (pseudo-) critical dynamical scaling of the bulk viscosity in the vicinity of a second-order critical point. This would affect the properties of quarkonium bound states in the deconfined phase.
