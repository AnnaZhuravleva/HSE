Recently, a new parameterization of the Gogny interaction suitable for astrophysical applications, named D1M*, has been presented. We investigate the possible existence of spurious finite-size instabilities of this new Gogny force by repeating a study that we have already performed for the most commonly used parameterizations (D1, D1S, D1N, D1M) of the Gogny force. This study is based on a fully-antisymmetrized random phase approximation (RPA) calculation of the nuclear matter response functions employing the continued fraction technique. The conclusions from this study are then tested against mean-field calculations in a coordinate representation for several nuclei. It turns out that this new Gogny interaction is affected by spurious finite-size instabilities in the scalar isovector channel; hence, unphysical results are expected in the calculation of bulk properties, like neutron and proton densities, of some nuclei if this D1M* force is used. Unphysical results for some nuclei are also obtained with the D1N parameterization of the Gogny force. These observations strongly advocate for the use of the linear response formalism to detect and avoid finite-size instabilities during the fit of the parameters of Gogny interactions as it is already done for some Skyrme forces.
