We investigate the impact of neutron capture rates near the A=130 peak on the $r$-process abundance pattern. We show that these capture rates can alter the abundances of individual nuclear species, not only in the region of A=130 peak, but also throughout the abundance pattern. We discuss the nonequilibrium processes that produce these abundance changes and determine which capture rates have the most significant impact.
