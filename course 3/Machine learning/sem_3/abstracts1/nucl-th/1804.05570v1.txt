Anisotropic flow of hadronic matter is considered as a sensitive tool to detect the early stage dynamics of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Taking the event by event fluctuations of the collision geometry into account, the elliptic flow parameter and the triangular flow parameter derived from the azimuthal distribution of produced hadrons, are investigated within the framework of a multiphase transport (AMPT) model, at a collision energy that in near future will typically be available at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research. The dependence of elliptic and triangular flow parameters on initial fluctuations, on parton scattering cross-sections, their mass ordering on different hadron species and on the constituent quark number scaling are examined. The AMPT simulation can not exactly match the elliptic flow results on Pb + Pb collision at 40A GeV of the NA49 experiment. The simulation results presented in this work are expected to provide us with an insight to study flow properties at high baryonic density but moderate temperature, and also with an opportunity to compare similar results available from RHIC and LHC experiments.
