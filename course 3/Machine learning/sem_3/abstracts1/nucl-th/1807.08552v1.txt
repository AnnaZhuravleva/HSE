In this work we use matrix models to study the problem of strength distributions. This is motivated by noticing near exponential fall offs of strengths in calculated magnetic dipole excitations. We emphasize that the quality of the exponential fall offs depend on the parameters in our matrices, especially the relative size of the couplings to the unperturbed level separations. We also find a matrix for which all transitions vanish.
