We find the general analytical solution of the viscous relativistic hydrodynamic equations (in the absence of bulk viscosity and chemical potential) for a Bjorken expanding fluid with a constant shear viscosity relaxation time. We analytically determine the hydrodynamic attractor of this fluid and discuss its properties. We show for the first time that the slow-roll expansion, a commonly used approach to characterize the attractor, diverges. This is shown to hold also in a conformal plasma. The gradient expansion is found to converge in an example where causality and stability are violated.
