The transverse momentum spectra of $\pi^{-}$, $\pi^{+}$, $K^{-}$, $K^{+}$, $\bar{p}$, and $p$ produced in Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 130, and $200$ GeV are described by the one- or two-component standard distribution. The calculated results are in good agreement with the data measured in midrapidity interval by the STAR Collaboration. The effective temperature of emission source increases obviously with the increase of the particle mass and the collision energy. At different collision energies, the transverse momentum dependent chemical potentials of up-, down-, and strange-quarks are obtained from the antiparticle to particle yield ratios in given transverse momentum bins with different bin centers. With the increase of logarithmic collision energy, the chemical potentials of light flavor quarks integrated over the wide transverse momentum range decrease exponentially.
