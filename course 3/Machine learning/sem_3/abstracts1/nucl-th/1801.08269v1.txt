It is shown that in the framework of the modified potential cluster model we succeeded in correct describing the available experimental data for neutron radiative capture on 10Be total cross-sections at low, astrophysical and thermal energies. All interaction potentials for different partial waves are constructed by describing the basic characteristics of the bound states and spectra of final nucleus. Experimental data for the total cross-sections of the neutron radiative capture on 10Be were obtained by using known data for reduced probabilities of 11Be Coulomb dissociation.
