We present a new lattice formulation of chiral effective field theory interactions with a simpler decomposition into spin channels. With these interactions the process of fitting to the empirical scattering phase shifts is simplified, and the resulting lattice phase shifts are more accurate than in previous studies. We present results for the neutron-proton system up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order for lattice spacings of $1.97~{\rm fm}$, $1.64~{\rm fm}$, $1.32~{\rm fm}$, and $0.99~{\rm fm}$. Our results provide a pathway to $\textit{ab initio}$ lattice calculations of nuclear structure, reactions, and thermodynamics with accurate and systematic control over the chiral nucleon-nucleon force.
