We study the production and dynamics of heavy quarks in the parton cascade model for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model is motivated by the QCD parton picture and describes the dynamics of an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision in terms of cascading partons which undergo scattering and multiplication while propagating. We focus on the dynamics of charm quark production and evolution in p+p and Au+Au collisions for several different interaction scenarios, i.e. collisions only between primary partons without radiation of gluons, multiple collisions without radiation of gluons and multiple collisions with radiation of gluons, allowing us to isolate the contributions of parton rescattering and radiation to charm production. We also discuss results of an eikonal approximation of the collision which provides a valuable comparison with mini-jet calculations and clearly brings out the importance of multiple collisions.
