The angular momentum basis method is introduced to solve the inclusive breakup within the model proposed by Ichimura, Austern, and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)]. This method is based on the geometric transformation between Jacobi coordinates, thus it is easy to corporate with particle spins. To test the validity of this partial wave expansion method, a benchmark calculation is done comparing with the one given in [Phys. Rev. C 92, 044616 (2015)]. Using the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) version of IAV model, some applications to $^7$Li reactions are presented and compared with available data.
