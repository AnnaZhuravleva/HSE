We have studied the properties of hot $^{234,236}$U and $^{240}$Pu nuclei in the framework of relativistic mean field formalism. The recently developed FSUGarnet and IOPB-I parameter sets are implemented for the first time to deform nuclei at finite temperature. The results are compared with the well-known NL3 set. The said isotopes are structurally important because of the thermally fissile nature of $^{233,235}$U and $^{239}$Pu as these nuclei ($^{234,236}$U and $^{240}$Pu) are formed after the absorption of a thermal neutron, which undergoes fission. Here, we have evaluated the nuclear properties, such as shell correction energy, neutron-skin thickness, quadrupole and hexadecapole deformation parameters and asymmetry energy coefficient for these nuclei as a function of temperature.
