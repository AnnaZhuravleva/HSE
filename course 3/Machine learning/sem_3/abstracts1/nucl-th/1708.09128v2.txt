Talk given at the "International Workshop on (e,e'p) Processes", July 2-6, 2017, Bled, Slovenia. Various many-body calculations are compared and the results provided by the Normalization Conserving Linked Cluster Expansion with realistic NN interactions are reviewed and analyzed in detail, as far as ground state energies, momentum distributions and spectral functions of few-nucleon system and complex nuclei are concerned.
