A new parameter set is generated for finite and infinite nuclear system within the effective field theory motivated relativistic mean field (ERMF) formalism. The isovector part of the ERMF model employed in the present study includes the coupling of nucleons to the {\delta} and \r{ho} mesons and the cross-coupling of \r{ho} mesons to the {\sigma} and {\omega} mesons. The results for the finite and infinite nuclear systems obtained using our parameter set are in harmony with the available experimental data. We find the maximum mass of the neutron star to be 2.03M\odot? and yet a relatively smaller radius at the canonical mass, 12.69 km, as required by the available data.
