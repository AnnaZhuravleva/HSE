The effect of strange interactions in neutron star matter and the role of the strange meson-hyperon couplings are studied in a relativistic quark model where the confining interaction for quarks inside a baryon is represented by a phenomenological average potential in an equally mixed scalar-vector harmonic form. The hadron-hadron interaction in nuclear matter is then realized by introducing additional quark couplings to $\sigma$, $\omega$, $\rho$, $\sigma^*$ and $\phi$ mesons through mean-field approximations. The meson-baryon couplings are fixed through the SU(6) spin-flavor symmetry and the SU(3) flavor symmetry to determine the hadronic equation of state (EoS). We find that the SU(3) coupling set gives the potential depth between $\Lambda$s around $-5$ MeV and favours a stiffer EoS.The radius for the canonical neutron star lies within a range of $12.7$ to $13.1$ km.
