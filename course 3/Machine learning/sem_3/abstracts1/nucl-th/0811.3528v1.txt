We apply the variational theory for fermions at finite temperature and high density, developed in an earlier paper, to symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. This extension generalizes to finite temperatures, the many body technique used in the construction of the zero temperature Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall equation of state. We discuss how the formalism can be used for practical calculations of hot dense matter. Neutral pion condensation along with the associated isovector spin longitudinal sum rule is analyzed. The equation of state is calculated for temperatures less than 30 MeV and densities less than three times the saturation density of nuclear matter. The behavior of the nucleon effective mass in medium is also discussed.
