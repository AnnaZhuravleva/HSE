We extend the confined-isospin-density-dependent mass (CIDDM) model to include temperature dependence of the equivalent mass for quarks. Within the CIDDM model, we study the equation of state (EOS) for $\beta$-equilibrium quark matter, quark symmetry energy, quark symmetry free energy, and the properties of quark stars at finite temperature. We find that including the temperature dependence of the equivalent mass can significantly influence the properties of the strange quark matter (SQM) as well as the quark symmetry energy, the quark symmetry free energy, and the maximum mass of quark stars at finite temperature. The mass-radius relations for different stages of the proto-quark stars (PQSs) along the star evolution are analyzed. Our results indicate that the heating (cooling) process for PQSs will increase (decrease) the maximum mass within CIDDM model by including temperature dependence of the equivalent mass for quarks.
