A novel Monte-Carlo event generator for jet propagation in a heavy-ion collision, based on the higher-twist energy loss formalism: the Modular All Twist Transverse-scattering Elastic-drag and Radiation (Matter) is developed and coupled with a viscous fluid dynamical simulation of the bulk medium, for studying jet modification in relativistic nuclear collisions. The probability of parton splitting is calculated using a medium modified Sudakov form factor that is constructed by a combination of vacuum and medium-induced splitting functions. Full parton showers are simulated, including both energy-momentum and space-time evolution of all jet partons. Within this framework, we provide a reasonable description of the nuclear modification of both single hadrons and jets at high transverse momentum at RHIC and the LHC. The extracted jet transport coefficients are consistent with the values constrained by the JET Collaboration.
