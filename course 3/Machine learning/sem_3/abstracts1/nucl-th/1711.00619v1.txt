The present paper is provided in response to the comment of M. R. Hadizadeh et.al on our original paper Six-body bound system calculations in the case of effective Alpha-core structure [Eur. Phys. J. Plus (2016) 131: 240].In this paper we have presented our clarifications on their arguments about of the accuracy of the procedure of the calculations. In this paper our arguments turn out to be very efficient mainly discussed from the authors misunderstanding of the issues discussed in the original paper. In fact, their comment aims to exaggeratedly show that our paper is poor,but our following statements demonstrate that their comment is misleading and consequently unacceptable.
