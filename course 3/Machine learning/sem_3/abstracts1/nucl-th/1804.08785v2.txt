Compact objects are the name used to classify the following objects: white dwarf, neutron star and black holes. In addition to them, some authors have suggested that in the core of a neutron star we may have the quarks u,d,s and c. In this work we investigate the structure of neutron star and strange star, described by the Tolman-Openheimer-Volkof equations. For the neutron star, we used the relativistic EoS from Walecka's model and the non-relativistic EoS PAL model. For the strange star, we used the M.I.T. bag model. We obtain results for the mass-radius relation and then we compared ours results with the actual pulsar data recently observed PSR J1614-2230 with a mass $1.97\pm 0.04\ M_{\odot}$.
