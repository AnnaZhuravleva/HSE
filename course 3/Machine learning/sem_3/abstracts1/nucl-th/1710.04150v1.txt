The many approaches that have been pursued in seeking an understanding of nuclear rotational dynamics are reviewed and reassessed with a view to their development in the light of recent progress and the research tools that are now available. A motivation for this review is the widespread observation of nuclear shape coexistence and sequences of rotational states in all regions of the nuclear periodic table combined with the recognition that the study of the rotational dynamics of quantum fluids has led to significant advances in the quantum theory of many-boson systems. Recent experimental investigations of the rotational dynamics of a low-temperature $^6$Li gas indicate that its slow rotational flows are likewise the irrotational flows of a superfluid. In this context, the dynamics of rotating nuclei are of fundamental interest because the nucleus is a unique zero-temperature finite many-fermion quantum system. A promising approach is provided by algebraic mean-field theory which, as its name suggests, is a combination of algebraic and mean-field methods. Static mean-field theories play a central role in many-body theory by defining optimal independent-particle and independent quasi-particle basis states for the quantum mechanics of many-fermion systems. Their time-dependent extensions also lead, in the small-amplitude random-phase approximation, to the quantisation of the classical normal-mode vibrations of many-fermion systems about their static equilibrium states. This review shows that mean-field methods become significantly more powerful when combined with algebraic methods and an appropriate coupling scheme for the nuclear shell model.
