Polarization observables of the A(d,d')X reactions have been calculated according to the received coeffcients of the analytical form for deuteron wave function in coordinate space for the nucleon-nucleon Nijmegen group potentials (NijmI, NijmII, Nijm93). The obtained values of tensor Ayy and vector Ay analyzing powers have been compared with the published experimental data at t- scaling for the inelastic scattering of deuterons on hydrogen, carbon and beryllium. Theoretical values of tensor-tensor Kyy and vector-vector Ky polarization transfers have been also evaluated in the plane-wave impulse approximation.
