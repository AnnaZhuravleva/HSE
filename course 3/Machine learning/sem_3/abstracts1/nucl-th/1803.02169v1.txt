We investigate universal correlations between electromagnetic low-energy observables in systems with shallow D-wave states in the framework of Halo Effective Field Theory (Halo EFT). We propose a power counting scenario for weakly bound D-wave states in one-neutron halos and discuss its implications for universality. The scenario is applied to the 5/2^+ first excited state and the 1/2^+ ground state of 15-C. We obtain several universal correlations between electric observables and use experimental data for the E2 transition 5/2^+ to 1/2^+ together with ab initio results from the No-Core Shell Model to predict the quadrupole moment at LO. We also discuss the effects of next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections for our results.
