Using the coalescence model based on the phase-space distribution of nucleons from an extended blast-wave model that includes the space-momentum correlation of high momentum nucleons, we study the transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows of deuteron and helium-3 in Pb+Pb collisions at the energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find that the measured elliptic flows of deuteron can be satisfactorily described if nucleons of large transverse momenta are more spread in space when their momenta are more aligned along the reaction plane.
