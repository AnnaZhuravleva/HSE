The exotic $^9$He nucleus, which presents one of the most extreme neutron-to-proton ratios, belongs to the $N=7$ isotonic chain famous for the phenomenon of ground-state parity inversion with decreasing number of protons. Consequently, it would be expected to have an unnatural (positive) parity ground state similar to $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li. Despite many experimental and theoretical investigations, its structure remains uncertain. Apart from the fact that it is unbound, other properties including the spin and parity of its ground state and the very existence of additional low-lying resonances are still a matter of debate. In this work we study the properties of $^9$He by analyzing the $n+^8$He continuum in the context of the ab initio no-core shell model with continuum (NCSMC) formalism with chiral interactions as the only input. The NCSMC is a state-of-the-art approach for the ab initio description of light nuclei. With its capability to predict properties of bound states, resonances, and scattering states in a unified framework, the method is particularly well suited for the study of unbound nuclei such as $^9$He. Our analysis produces an unbound $^9$He nucleus. Two resonant states are found at the energies of ${\sim}1$ and ${\sim}3.5$ MeV, respectively, above the $n+^8$He breakup threshold. The first state has a spin-parity assignment of $J^{\pi} = {1/2}^-$ and can be associated with the ground state of $^9$He, while the second, broader state has a spin-parity of ${3/2}^-$. No resonance is found in the ${1/2}^+$ channel, only a very weak attraction. We find that the $^9$He ground-state resonance has a negative parity and thus breaks the parity-inversion mechanism found in the $^{11}$Be and $^{10}$Li nuclei of the same $N=7$ isotonic chain.
