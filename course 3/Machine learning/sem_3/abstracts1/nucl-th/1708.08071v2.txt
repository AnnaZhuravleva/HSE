A formalism for treating the scattering of decuplet baryons in chiral effective field theory is developed. The minimal Lagrangian and potentials in leading-order SU(3) chiral effective field theory for the interactions of octet baryons ($B$) and decuplet baryons ($D$) for the transitions $BB\to BB$, $BB\leftrightarrow DB$, $DB\to DB$, $BB\leftrightarrow DD$, $DB\leftrightarrow DD$, and $DD\to DD$ are provided. As an application of the formalism we compare with results from lattice QCD simulations for $\Omega\Omega$ and $N\Omega$ scattering. Implications of our results pertinent to the quest for dibaryons are discussed.
