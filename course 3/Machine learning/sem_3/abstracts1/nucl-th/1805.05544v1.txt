We calculate $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hadron production cross sections in charged lepton semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering off nuclear target ($A$, using iron $\mathrm{Fe}$ as an example) and deuteron ($D$) target. The results show that the ratio $(\bar{\Lambda}^{A}/\Lambda^{A})/(\bar{\Lambda}^{D}/\Lambda^{D})$ is sensitive to the sea quark content of the nucleus. We adopt three different models to take the nuclear EMC effect into account. The ratio $(\bar{\Lambda}^{A}/\Lambda^{A})/(\bar{\Lambda}^{D}/\Lambda^{D})$ is predicted to be different by these different models.
