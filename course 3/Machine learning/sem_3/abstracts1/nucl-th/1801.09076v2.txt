Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions from high-spin isomers are studied using the sum-rule approach and the shell model. The GT transition strengths from the high-spin isomeric states show a stronger collectivity than those from the ground states in two $N=Z$ nuclei, $^{52}$Fe and $^{94}$Ag. It is argued that the spin-up and spin-down Fermi spheres involved in the GT transitions from the high-spin isomeric states play important roles. These Fermi spheres are analogous to the isospin-up and isospin-down Fermi spheres for the GT transitions from the ground states in $N>Z$ nuclei and create a strong collectivity.
