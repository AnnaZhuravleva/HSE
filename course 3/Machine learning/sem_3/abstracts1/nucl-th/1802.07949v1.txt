Recently, it has been investigated how the thermodynamic functions vary when the surface interactions are taken into account for a nucleon which is confined in a Woods-Saxon potential well, with a non-relativistic point of view. In this manuscript, the same problem is handled with a relativistic point of view. More precisely, the Klein-Gordon equation is solved in presence of mixed scalar-vector generalized symmetric Woods-Saxon potential energy that is coupled to momentum and mass. Employing the continuity conditions the bound state energy spectra of an arbitrarily parameterized well are derived. It is observed that, when a term representing the surface effect is taken into account, the character of Helmholtz free energy and entropy versus temperature are modified in a similar fashion as this inclusion is done in the non-relativistic regime. Whereas it is found that this inclusion leads to different characters to internal energy and specific heat functions for relativistic and non-relativistic regimes.
