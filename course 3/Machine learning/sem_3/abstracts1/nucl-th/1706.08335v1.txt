Recent experiments at RHIC and LHC have demonstrated that there are excellent opportunities to produce light baryonic clusters of exotic matter (strange and anti-matter) in ultra-relativistic ion collisions. Within the hybrid-transport model UrQMD we show that the coalescence mechanism can naturally explain the production of these clusters in the ALICE experiment at LHC. As a consequence of this mechanism we predict the rapidity domains where the yields of such clusters are much larger than the observed one at midrapidity. This new phenomenon can lead to unique methods for producing exotic nuclei.
