Background: Applications of nuclear time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) are often capable of providing quantitative description of heavy ion reactions. However, the structure of pre-compound states produced in heavy ion reactions are difficult to assess theoretically in TDDFT as the s.p. density alone is a weak indicator of shell structure and cluster states. Purpose: We employ the time-dependent nucleon localization function (NLF) to reveal structure of pre-compound states in nuclear reactions involving light and medium-mass ions. We primarily focus on spin saturated systems with N = Z. Furthermore, we study reactions with oxygen and carbon ions, for which experimental evidence for {\alpha} clustering in pre-compound states exists. Method: We utilize the symmetry-free TDDFT approach and compute the NLFs to describe $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, and $^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier. Results: We show that NLFs reveal a variety of time-dependent modes involving cluster structures. For instance, the $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O collision results in a vibrational mode of a quasi-molecular \alpha-$^{12}$C-$^{12}$C-\alpha{} state. For heavier ions, a variety of cluster configurations are predicted. For the collision of $^{16,18}$O + $^{12}$C, we showed that the pre-compound system has a tendency to form {\alpha} clusters. This result supports the experimental findings that the presence of cluster structures in the projectile and target nuclei gives rise to strong entrance channel effects and enhanced {\alpha} emission. Conclusion: The time-dependent NLF is a good indicator of clusters structures in complex pre-compound states formed in heavy-ion fusion reactions. The localization reveals the presence of collective vibrations involving cluster structures, which dominate the initial dynamics of the fusing system.
