The ground and excited states of the 3H and 4He nuclei are studied in the framework of group-theoretical methods. Basis functions of the unitary scheme model corresponding to even numbers of quanta of excitation in the range from zero to twenty are constructed for the even-parity states of these two nuclei, and bases from one to nineteen are constructed for the odd-parity states of the 4He nucleus. The ground-state and first-excited-state energies and wave functions, the ground S-, P- and D-state probabilities, the root-mean-square radius and the magnetic dipole moment of Triton are calculated. Furthermore, for the 4He nucleus, the spectrum and the wave functions, the ground S-, P- and D-state probabilities, the root-mean-square radius and the total integral cross section of the dipole electric transition accompanying the photoabsorption of gamma quanta by this nucleus are calculated. The GPT and AV8' two-body interactions and the Urbana nine three-nucleon interaction are used in these investigations. Moreover, the convergence of the calculations is examined by incrementally extrapolating the nuclear characteristics calculated for N less than or equal to twenty to N equals thirty.
