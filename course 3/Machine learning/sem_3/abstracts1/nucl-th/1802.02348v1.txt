The structure of even-even $^{108-116}$Cd isotopes is investigated based on the self-consistent mean-field approach. By mapping the quadrupole-$(\beta,\gamma)$ deformation energy surface, obtained from the constrained self-consistent mean-field calculations with a choice of the Skyrme force and pairing property, onto the Hamiltonian of the interacting boson model with configuration mixing, the strength parameters of the Hamiltonian are determined. The low-lying excitation spectra and electric quadrupole transition rates for the considered Cd nuclei are computed by the resultant Hamiltonian, and are compared in detail with the experimental data. Our semi-microscopic prediction identifies several intruder states as suggested empirically, and overall, provides a reasonable qualitative description of the experimental energy levels and transition rates.
