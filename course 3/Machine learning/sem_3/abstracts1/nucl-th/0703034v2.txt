The best natural candidates for the realization of color superconductivity are quark stars -not yet confirmed by observation- and the extremely dense cores of compact stars, many of which have very large magnetic fields. To reliably predict astrophysical signatures of color superconductivity, a better understanding of the role of the star's magnetic field in the color superconducting phase that realizes in the core is required. This paper is an initial step in that direction. The field scales at which the different magnetic phases of a color superconductor with three quark flavors can be realized are investigated. Coming from weak to strong fields, the system undergoes first a symmetry transmutation from a Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase to a Magnetic-CFL (MCFL) phase, and then a phase transition from the MCFL phase to the Paramagnetic-CFL (PCFL) phase. The low-energy effective theory for the excitations of the diquark condensate in the presence of a magnetic field is derived using a covariant representation that takes into account all the Lorentz structures contributing at low energy. The field-induced masses of the charged mesons and the threshold field at which the CFL $\to$ MCFL symmetry transmutation occurs are obtained in the framework of this low-energy effective theory. The relevance of the different magnetic phases for the physics of compact stars is discussed.
