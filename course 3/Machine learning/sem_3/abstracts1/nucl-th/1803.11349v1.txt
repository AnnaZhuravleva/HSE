We calculate two-body $J^{\pi}=0^{+}, 1^{+}$, and $J^{\pi}=2^{+}$ resonance states of $Y_{c}$ ($= \Lambda_{c}$, $\Sigma_{c}$, or $\Sigma_{c}^{*}$) and $N$ using the complex scaling method. We employ the $Y_{c}N$-CTNN potentials, which were proposed in our previous study, and obtain four resonances near $\Sigma_{c}N$ and $\Sigma_{c}^{*}N$ thresholds. From the analysis by the binding energies of partial channel systems, we conclude that these resonance states are Feshbach resonances. We compare the results with the $Y_{c}N$ resonance states in the heavy quark limit, where the $\Sigma_{c}N$ and $\Sigma_{c}^{*}N$ thresholds are degenerate, and find that they form two pairs of the heavy-quark doublets in agreement with the heavy quark spin symmetry.
