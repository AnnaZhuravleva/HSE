The charge asymmetry due to higher-order QED corrections in elastic lepton-proton scattering is estimated without employing the ultrarelativistic approximation. Our calculation is performed by generalizing the soft-photon approximation approach suggested by Tsai. Corresponding loop integrals that take a form of Passarino-Veltman scalar three-point functions are calculated analytically without neglecting the mass of the lepton. Our results provide model-independent charge asymmetry predictions for scattering of unpolarized and massive leptons on proton targets. These predictions can be used in corresponding experiments to determine the contribution coming from model-dependent hard two-photon exchange processes.
