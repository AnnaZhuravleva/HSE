The one- plus two-body isospin nonconserving nuclear interactions are included in the prediction of ground state energies of fp shell nuclei using spectral distribution theory. This in turn is used to calculate the linear term in the isobaric mass-multiplet equation and the predictions are then compared to experimental values after the addition of the Coulomb contribution. The agreement is found to be reasonable as observed for sd shell nuclei earlier. One also sees that in this method the contribution to the linear term comes almost completely from the one body isovector Hamiltonian and that results in a huge simplification of the problem.
