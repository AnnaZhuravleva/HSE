We computed a new set of static fission properties suited for r-process calculations. The potential energy surfaces and collective inertias of 3640 nuclei in the superheavy region are obtained from Self-Consistent Mean-Field calculations using the Barcelona-Catania-Paris-Madrid energy density functional. The fission path is computed as a function of the quadrupole moment by minimizing the potential energy and exploring octupole and hexadecapole deformations. The spontaneous fission lifetimes are evaluated employing different schemes for the collective inertias and vibrational energy corrections. This allows to explore the sensitivity of the lifetimes to those quantities together with the collective ground state energy along the superheavy landscape. We computed neutron induced stellar reaction rates relevant for r-process nucleosynthesis using the statistical approach and study the impact of collective inertias. The competition between different reaction channels including neutron induced rates, spontaneous fission and alpha decay is discussed for typical r-process conditions.
