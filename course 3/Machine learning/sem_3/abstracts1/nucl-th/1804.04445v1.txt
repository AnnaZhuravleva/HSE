Updated values and corresponding uncertainties of Isovector Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) parameters which are obtained by the least-squares fitting of theoretical photoabsorption cross sections to experimental data are presented. The theoretical photoabsorption cross sections are taken as a sum of the components corresponding to the excitation of the GDR and quasideuteron photodisintegration. The current compilation is an extension and improvement of the earlier compilations of Lorentzian parameters for ground-state photoneutron and photoabsorption cross sections and covers experimental data made available up to June 2017.
