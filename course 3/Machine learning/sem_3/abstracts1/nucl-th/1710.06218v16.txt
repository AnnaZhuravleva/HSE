We perform shell model calculations using a quadrupole-quadrupole interaction (Q.Q).We show results in single j shell spaces and the full S-D shell . We show that one gets useful results with Q.Q in both spaces.. We emphasize the importance of the choice of single particle energies in order to obtain the results of Elliott using a Q.Q interaction without the momentum terms. We show a J(J+1) spectrum for a ground state band but with B(E2)'s different from the rotational model. We also show excited J(J-1), J((J-1) and J(J+3) spectra.We find spectra starting with J=0 which have both even J and odd J members.
