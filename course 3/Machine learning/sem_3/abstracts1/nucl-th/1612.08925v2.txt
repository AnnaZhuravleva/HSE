The binding system of a hadron and a nucleus is a topic of great interest for investigating the hadron properties. In the heavy-flavor region, the attraction between a $P(=\bar{D},B)$ meson and a nucleon $N$ can appear, where the $PN-P^\ast N$ mixing plays an important role in relation to the heavy-quark spin symmetry. The attraction can produce exotic heavy mesic nuclei that are stable against the strong decay. We study an exotic system where the $\bar{D}$ ($B$) meson and nucleus are bound. The meson-nucleus interaction is given by a folding potential with single-channel $PN$ interaction and the nucleon number distribution function. By solving the Schr\"odinger equations of the heavy meson and the nucleus, we obtain several bound and resonant states for nucleon number $A=16,\dots,208$. The results indicate the possible existence of exotic mesic nuclei with a heavy antiquark.
