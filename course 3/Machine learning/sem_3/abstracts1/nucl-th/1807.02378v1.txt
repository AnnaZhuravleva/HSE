We present the latest results from the NLO pQCD + saturation + viscous hydrodynamics (EbyE NLO EKRT) model. The parameters in the EKRT saturation model are fixed by the charged hadron multiplicity in the 0-5 \% 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. The $\sqrt{s}$, $A$ and centrality dependence of the initial particle production follows then from the QCD dynamics of the model. This allows us to predict the $\sqrt{s}$ and $A$ dependence of the particle production. We show that our results are in an excellent agreement with the low-$p_T$ data from 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC as well as with the data from the 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC. In particular, we study the centrality dependences of hadronic multiplicities, flow coefficients, and various flow correlations. Furthermore, the nuclear mass number dependence of the initial particle production and hydrodynamic evolution can be tested in the 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. To this end, we show our predictions for charged particle multiplicities, and in particular, show how the deformations of the Xe nuclei reflect into the flow coefficients.
