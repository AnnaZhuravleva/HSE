We report a systematic study of Z+jet correlation in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC by combining the next-leading-order matrix elements calculations with matched parton shower in Sherpa for the initial Z+jet production, and Linear Boltzmann transport Model for jet propagation in the expanding quark-gluon-plasma. Our numerical results can well explain CMS measurements on Z+jet correlation in Pb+Pb collisions: the shift of $p_T$ imbalance $x_{jZ}=p_T^{jet}/p_T^Z$ and their mean values, the suppression of the average number of jet partners per Z boson $R_{jZ}$, as well as the modification of azimuthal angle correlations $\Delta \phi_{jZ}$. We also demonstrate that high-order corrections play a significant role in the understanding of Z+jet correlations at high energies.
