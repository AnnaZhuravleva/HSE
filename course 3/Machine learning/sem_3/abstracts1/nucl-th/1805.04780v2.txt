Neutron stars are unique cosmic laboratories for the exploration of matter under extreme conditions of density and neutron-proton asymmetry. Due to their enormous dynamic range, neutron stars display a myriad of exotic states of matter that are impossible to recreate under normal laboratory conditions. In these three lectures I will discuss how the strong synergy that has developed between nuclear physics and astrophysics will uncover some of the deepest secrets behind these fascinating objects. In particular, I will highlight the enormous impact that the very first detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron-star merger GW170817 is having in constraining the composition, structure, and dynamics of neutron stars.
