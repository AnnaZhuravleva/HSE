By solving a simple kinetic equation, in the relaxation time approximation, and for a particular set of moments of the distribution function, we establish a set of equations which, on the one hand, capture exactly the dynamics of the kinetic equation, and, on the other hand, coincide with the hierarchy of equations of viscous hydrodynamics, to arbitrary order in the viscous corrections. This correspondence sheds light on the underlying mechanism responsible for the apparent success of hydrodynamics in regimes that are far from local equilibrium.
