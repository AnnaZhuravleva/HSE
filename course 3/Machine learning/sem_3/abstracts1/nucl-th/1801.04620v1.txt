Applying an equation of state (EOS) with its symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) part and the low-density symmetry energy $E_{sym}(\rho)$ constrained by heavy-ion reaction data, we calculate the tidal deformability $\lambda$ of neutron stars in coalescing binary systems. Corresponding to the partially constrained EOS that predicted earlier a radius of 11.5 km $< R_{1.4} <$ 13.6 km for canonical neutron star configurations, $\lambda$ is found to be in the range of $\sim[1.7 - 3.9]\times 10^{36}$ (gr cm$^2$s$^2$) consistent with the very recent observation of the GW170817/AT2017gfo event. The upper limit for the radius of canonical neutron stars inferred from the GW170817 event is consistent with but less restrictive than the earlier prediction based on the EOS partially constrained by the terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments. Coherent analyses of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter EOS underlying both nuclear laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations are emphasized.
