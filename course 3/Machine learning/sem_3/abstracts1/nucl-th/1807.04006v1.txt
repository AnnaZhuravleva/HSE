Strutinsky's method is reviewed through a new understanding. This method depends on two free parameters: The smoothing parameter and the order of the curvature correction. It turns out that this method is nothing but a compromise between two fundamental conditions which are the so-called asymptotic limit which imposes a small as possible smoothing parameter and the smoothing condition which forces that parameter to be, at least, of the order of the inter shell spacing. In this paper, to find the best value of the smoothing parameter, a new criterion is proposed instead the plateau condition . This new criterion is much more clear and free from ambiguities of the usual plateau condition. It is also found, that the second free parameter, i.e. the order of the curvature correction, plays an accessory role since, it is connected intimately to the smoothing parameter.
