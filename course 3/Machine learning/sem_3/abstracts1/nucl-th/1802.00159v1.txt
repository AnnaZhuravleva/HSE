We have combined the complex momentum representation method with the Green's function method in the relativistic mean-field framework to establish the RMF-CMR-GF approach. This new approach is applied to study the halo structure of $^{74}$Ca. All the continuum level density of concerned resonant states are calculated accurately without introducing any unphysical parameters, and they are independent of the choice of integral contour. The important single-particle wave functions and densities for the halo phenomenon in $^{74}$Ca are discussed in detail.
