Rope Hadronization is a model extending the Lund string hadronization model to describe environments with many overlapping strings, such as high multiplicity pp collisions or $AA$ collisions. Including effects of Rope Hadronization drastically improves description of strange/non-strange hadron ratios as function of event multiplicity in all systems from $e^+ e^-$ to $AA$. Implementation of Rope Hadronization in the MC event generators DIPSY and Pythia8 is discussed, as well as future prospects for jet studies and studies of small systems.
