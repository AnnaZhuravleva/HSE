The conclusions of the manuscript 1806.02080v1 questioning the adequacy of the recently proposed Gogny D1M* interaction for finite nuclei calculations using harmonic oscillator (HO) basis are revised. Several convergence and stability studies are performed with HO basis of different sizes and oscillator parameters and the results show the robustness of the D1M* results for finite nuclei. This analysis is also extended to beyond mean-field calculations of generator-coordinate-method type with D1M*. On the other hand, the existence of a finite-size instability in finite nuclei when coordinate space methods are used to solve the HF equations (as shown in 1806.02080v1) is independently confirmed for D1M* using an in-house computer code based on a quasilocal approximation to the HF exchange potential. We confirm that the most affected quantity in the coordinate space calculation is the spatial density at the origin, but integrated quantities like binding energies or radii show a plateau against the number of iterations, where they are consistent with the values from the HO basis calculation, before diverging for a larger number of iterations. A connection between the last occupied s-orbital in the nucleus and the appearance of instabilities in coordinate space is observed.
