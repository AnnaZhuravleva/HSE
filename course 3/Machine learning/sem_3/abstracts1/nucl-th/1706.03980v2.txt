We study nuclear modification of the photon-tagged jets in $AA$ collisions within the jet quenching scheme based on the light-cone path integral approach to the induced gluon emission. The calculations are performed for running coupling. Collisional energy loss is treated as a perturbation to the radiative mechanism. We obtain a reasonable agreement with the recent data from the STAR Collaboration on the mid-rapidity nuclear modification factor $I_{AA}$ for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV for parametrization of running $\alpha_s$ consistent with that necessary for description of the data on suppression of the high-$p_T$ spectra.
