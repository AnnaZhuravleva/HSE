The determination of nucleus-nucleus potentials is important not only to describe the properties of the colliding system, but also to extract nuclear-structure information and for modelling nuclear reactions for astrophysics. We present the first determination of double-folding potentials based on chiral effective field theory at leading, next-to-leading, and next-to-next-to-leading order. To this end, we construct new soft local chiral effective field theory interactions. We benchmark this approach in the $^{16}$O-$^{16}$O system, and present results for cross sections computed for elastic scattering up to 700 MeV in energy, as well as for the astrophysical $S$-factor of the fusion reaction.
