We studied the ${\bar p}$ interactions with the nuclear medium within the 2009 version of the Paris ${\bar N}N$ potential model. We constructed the $\bar{p}$--nucleus optical potential using the Paris $S$- and $P$-wave ${\bar p}N$ scattering amplitudes and treated their strong energy and density dependence self-consistently. We considered a phenomenological $P$-wave term as well. We calculated $\bar{p}$ binding energies and widths of the $\bar{p}$ bound in various nuclei. The $P$-wave potential has very small effect on the calculated ${\bar p}$ binding energies, however, it reduces the corresponding widths noticeably. Moreover, the $S$-wave potential based on the Paris amplitudes supplemented by a phenomenological $P$-wave term yields the ${\bar p}$ binding energies and widths in very good agreement with those obtained within the RMF model consistent with ${\bar p}$-atom data.
