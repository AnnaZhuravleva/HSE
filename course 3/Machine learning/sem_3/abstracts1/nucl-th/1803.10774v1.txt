We consider phenomenological consequences arising from simple analytic solutions for holographic heavy-ion collisions. For these solutions, early-time longitudinal flow is initially negative (inward), sizable direct, elliptic, and quadrangular flow is generated, and the average vorticity of the system is tunable by a single parameter. Despite large vorticity and angular momentum, we show that the system does not complete a single rotation.
