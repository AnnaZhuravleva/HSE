In hydrodynamic approach to relativistic heavy ion collisions, hadrons with nonzero spin, produced out of the hydrodynamic medium, can acquire polarization via spin-vorticity thermodynamic coupling mechanism. The hydrodynamical quantity steering the polarization is the thermal vorticity, that is minus the antisymmetric part of the gradient of four-temperature field.   Based on this mechanism there have been several calculations in hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic models for non-central heavy ion collisions in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan energy range, showing that the amount of polarization of produced $\Lambda$ hyperons ranges from few percents to few permille, and decreases with collision energy. We report on an extension of our existing calculation of global $\Lambda$ polarization in UrQMD+vHLLE model to full RHIC and LHC energies, and discuss the component of polarization along the beam direction, which is the dominant one at high energies.
