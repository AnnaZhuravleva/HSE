Within the multiple scattering formulation, we predict the cross sections of $d(\gamma,\pi)NN$ by using a dynamical model of $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ reactions in the nucleon resonance region. The calculations include the impulse term and the final-state interaction (FSI) terms due to pion-exchange and nucleon-exchange. We show that the off-shell effects, calculated from the meson-exchange mechanisms, on the propagations of the exchanged nucleon and pion are significant in determining the reaction amplitudes. The FSI effects on the predicted cross sections are found to be important at energies near the $\Delta$(1232) resonance, and are still significant at higher energies. The results are in good agreement with most of the available data of $d(\gamma,\pi^0)np$ and $d(\gamma,\pi^-)pp$ reactions. We use our predictions to examine a commonly used procedure for extracting the (un)polarized $\gamma n\to \pi N$ observables from the $d(\gamma,\pi) NN$ data. It is demonstrated that the extracted $\gamma n \to\pi N$ unpolarized cross sections still contain the FSI effects even after the kinematical cuts are applied to isolate the quasi-free events. However the same procedure works well for the polarization observables $\Sigma$, $E$, and $G$. We also find that the FSI effects on the determinations of the cross sections of $\gamma n\to\pi^0n$ can be somewhat different from those of $\gamma p \to\pi^0p$. We point out the importance of applying a cut on the final $\pi N$ invariant mass to efficiently suppress a problematic Fermi smearing effect, thereby maintaining a good accuracy of the extraction. An experiment-theory iteration procedure for extracting the observables of $\gamma n \to \pi N$ from the $d(\gamma, \pi) NN$ data is suggested.
