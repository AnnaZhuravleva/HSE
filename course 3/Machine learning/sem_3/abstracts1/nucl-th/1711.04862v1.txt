Recent experimental results revealed large elliptic flow of the charmed hadrons at LHC energies, unexpectedly similar to that of the charged pions. The mentioned measurements are often interpreted using transport models, which incorporate dissociation and recombination mechanisms for charm quarks. In this report, a modified version of the Monte Carlo model with string repulsion is used to calculate azimuthal correlations with charmed hadrons. The string repulsion mechanism may provide significant angular correlations and can be considered as an alternative to thermalization picture.
