We construct a multiplicity distribution characterized by large factorial cumulants (integrated genuine correlation functions) from a simple combination of two {\it ordinary} multiplicity distributions characterized by small factorial cumulants. We find that such a model, which could be interpreted as representing two event classes, reproduces the preliminary data for the proton cumulants measured by the STAR collaboration at $7.7$ GeV very well. This model then predicts very large values for the fifth and sixth order factorial cumulants, which can be tested in experiment.
