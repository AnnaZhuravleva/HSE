Compton scattering off the proton in the third resonance region is analyzed for the first time, owing to the full combined analysis of pion- and photo-induced reactions in a coupled-channel effective Lagrangian model with K-matrix approximation. Two isospin $I=3/2$ resonances $D_{33}(1700)$ and $F_{35}(1930)$ are found to be essential in the range of 1.6 - 1.8 GeV. The recent beam asymmetry data of Compton scattering from the GRAAL facility are used to determine the helicity couplings of these resonances, and strong constraints are coming also from $\pi N$ and $K\Sigma$ photoproduction data. The possible spin and parity of new narrow resonances is discussed.
