We reanalyze the experiment of Schmitt $\textit{et al.}$ on the $^{10}$Be$(d,p)^{11}$Be transfer reaction [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{108}$, 192701 (2012)] by exploring the beam-energy and angular ranges at which the reaction is strictly peripheral. We consider the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) to model the reaction and use a Halo-EFT description of $^{11}$Be to systematically explore the sensitivity of our calculations to the short-range physics of the $^{10}$Be-$n$ wave function. We find that by selecting the data at low beam energy and forward scattering angle the calculated cross sections scale nearly perfectly with the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the $^{11}$Be bound states. Following these results, a comparison of our calculations with the experimental data gives a value of $C_{1s1/2}=0.785\pm0.03$ fm$^{-1/2}$ for the $\frac{1}{2}^+$ ground-state ANC and $C_{0p1/2}=0.135\pm0.005$ fm$^{-1/2}$ for the $\frac{1}{2}^-$ excited-state, which are in perfect agreement with the $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of Calci $\textit{et al.}$, who obtain $C^{\textit{ab initio}}_{1/2^+}=0.786$ fm$^{-1/2}$ and $C^{\textit{ab initio}}_{1/2^-}=0.129$ fm$^{-1/2}$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{117}$, 242501 (2016)].
