It is shown that the random-phase approximation (RPA) method with its nonlinear generalization, which was previously considered as approximation, reproduces the exact solutions of the Lipkin model. The nonlinear RPA is based on an equation nonlinear on eigenvectors and includes many-particle-many-hole components in the creation operator of the excited states. We demonstrate the exact character of solutions analytically for the particle number $N$ = 2 and, numerically, for $N$ = 20. This finding indicates that the nonlinear RPA is equivalent to the exact Schr\"{o}dinger equation, which opens up new possibilities for realistic calculations in many-body problems.
