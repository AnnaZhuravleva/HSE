We have investigated the effect of the finite size of the constituent quarks on singlet and triplet nucleon-nucleon potentials, obtained in the framework of the $SU(2)$ nonrelativistic quark model using the resonating group method in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The full Hamiltonian used in the investigation includes the kinetic energy, two-body confinement potential, one gluon exchange potential (OGEP), and instanton induced interaction (III). The contributions of the OGEP and III to the nucleon-nucleon adiabatic potential are discussed.
