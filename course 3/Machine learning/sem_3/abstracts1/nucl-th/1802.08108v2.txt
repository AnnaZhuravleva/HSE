Neutron drops confined in an external field are studied in the framework of relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory using the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction. The ground state energies and radii of neutron drops with even numbers from $N = 4$ to $N=50$ are calculated and compared with results obtained from other nonrelativistic \textit{ab initio} calculations and from relativistic density functional theory. Special attention has been paid to the magic numbers and to the sub-shell closures. The single-particle energies are investigated and the monopole effect of the tensor force on the evolutions of the spin-orbit and the pseudospin-orbit splittings is discussed. The results provide interesting insight of neutron rich systems and can form an important guide for future density functionals.
