We investigate the decay of $a^+_1(1260) \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ with the assumption that the $a_1(1260)$ is dynamically generated from the coupled channel $\rho \pi$ and $\bar{K}K^*$ interactions. Only the dominant tree level diagram that proceed via $a^+_1(1260) \to \rho^0 \pi^+ \to \pi^+\pi^+ \pi^-$ is considered. We calculate the invariant $\pi^+ \pi^-$ mass distribution and also the total decay width of $a^+_1(1260) \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^-$ as a function of the mass of $a_1(1260)$. The calculated $\pi^+ \pi^-$ mass distribution is significantly different from the phase space and tied to the dynamical nature of the $a_1(1260)$ resonance. The future experimental observations could test of model calculations and would provide vary valuable information on the relevance of the $\rho \pi$ component in the $a_1(1260)$ wave function.
