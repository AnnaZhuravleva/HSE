Simple one-parameter nearest neighbor-spacing distribution (NNSD) is suggested for statistical analysis of nuclear spectra. This distribution is derived within the Wigner-Dyson approach in the linear approximation for the level repulsion density of quantum states. The obtained NNSD gives the individual information on the Wigner and Poisson contributions in agreement with that of the statistical experimental distributions of collective states in deformed nuclei. Using this NNSD, one finds that the symmetry breaking owing to the fixing of projections of the angular momentum of collective states enhances a chaos as a shift of the NNSD from the Poisson to Wigner distribution behavior.
