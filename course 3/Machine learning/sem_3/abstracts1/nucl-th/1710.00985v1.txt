Strangeness production in high multiplicity events gives indications on the transverse size fluctuactions in nucleus-nucleus ($AA$), proton-nucleus ($pA$) and proton-proton ($pp$) collisions. In particular the behavior of strange particle hadronization in "small" ($pp,pA$) and "large" ($AA$) initial configurations of the collision can be tested for the specific particle species, for different centralities and for large fluctuations of the transverse size in $pA$ and $pp$ by using the recent ALICE data. A universality of strange hadron production emerges by introducing a dynamical variable proportional to the initial parton density in the transverse plane.
