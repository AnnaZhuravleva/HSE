We consider a set of three-cluster systems ($^{4}$He, $^{7}$Li, $^{7}$Be, $^{8}$Be, $^{10}$Be) within a microscopic model which involves the hyperspherical harmonics to represent intercluster motion. We selected such three-cluster systems which have at least one binary channel. Our aim is to study whether the hyperspherical harmonics are able and under what conditions to describe two-body channel(s) (nondemocratic motion) or they are suitable for describing three-cluster continuum only (democratic motion). It is demonstrated that a rather restricted number of the hyperspherical harmonics allows us to describe bound states and scattering states in two-body continuum for a three-cluster system.
