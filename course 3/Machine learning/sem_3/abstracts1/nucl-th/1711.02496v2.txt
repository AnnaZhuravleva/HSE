Chiral anomaly is a fundamental aspect of quantum theories with chiral fermions. How such microscopic anomaly manifests itself in a macroscopic many-body system with chiral fermions, is a highly nontrivial question that has recently attracted significant interest. As it turns out, unusual transport currents can be induced by chiral anomaly under suitable conditions in such systems, with the notable example of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) where a vector current (e.g. electric current) is generated along an external magnetic field. A lot of efforts have been made to search for CME in heavy ion collisions, by measuring the charge separation effect induced by the CME transport. A crucial challenge in such effort, is the quantitative prediction for the CME signal. In this paper, we develop the Anomalous-Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework, which implements the anomalous fluid dynamics to describe the evolution of fermion currents in QGP, on top of the neutral bulk background described by the VISH2+1 hydrodynamic simulations for heavy ion collisions. With this new tool, we quantitatively and systematically investigate the dependence of the CME signal to a series of theoretical inputs and associated uncertainties. With realistic estimates of initial conditions and magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively consistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV Au-Au collisions. Based on analysis of Au-Au collisions, we further make predictions for the CME observable to be measured in the planned isobaric (Ru-Ru v.s. Zr-Zr ) collision experiment, which could provide a most decisive test of the CME in heavy ion collisions.
