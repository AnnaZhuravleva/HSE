We introduce a symplectic no-core configuration interaction (SpNCCI) framework for ab initio nuclear structure calculations, in a correlated many-body basis which encodes an approximate Sp(3,R) symmetry of the nucleus. Such a scheme potentially provides a means of restricting the many-body space to include only those highly-excited configurations which dominantly contribute to the nuclear wave function. We examine the symplectic symmetry structure arising in an illustrative ab initio SpNCCI calculation for 6Li. We observe both the dominance of symplectic symmetry in individual wave functions and the emergence of families of states related by symplectic symmetry.
