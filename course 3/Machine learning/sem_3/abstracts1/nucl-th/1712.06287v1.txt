The relativistic kinetic theory approach has been employed to study four well-known transport coefficients that characterize heat flow and diffusion for the case of a hot mixture constituting of nucleons and pions. Medium effects on the cross-section for binary collisions ($N\pi$,$\pi\pi$) have been taken into consideration by incorporating self-energy corrections to modify the propagator of the exchanged $\Delta$ baryon in $N\pi$ interaction and the $\rho$ and $\sigma$ meson propagators for the case of $\pi\pi$ interaction. The temperature dependence of the four coefficients have been investigated for several values of the baryon chemical potential.
