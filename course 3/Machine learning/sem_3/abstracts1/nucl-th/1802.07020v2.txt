The phenomenon of liquid-gas phase transition occurring in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies is a subject of contemporary interest. Phase transition is usually characterized by the specific behaviour of state variables like pressure, density, energy etc. In heavy ion collisions there is no direct way of accessing these state variables and hence unambiguous detection of phase transition becomes difficult. This work establishes that signatures of phase transition can be extracted from the observables which are easily accessible in experiments and these have similar behaviour as the state variables. The temperature dependence of the first order derivative of the order parameters related to the largest and second largest cluster size (produced in heavy ion collisions) exhibit similar behavior as that of the variation of specific heat at constant volume Cv which is an established signature of first order phase transition. This motivates us to propose these derivatives as confirmatory signals of liquid-gas phase transition. The measurement of these signals in easily feasible in most experiments as compared to the other signatures like specific heat, caloric curve or bimodality. This temperature where the peak appears is designated to be the transition temperature and the effect of certain parameters on this has also been examined.
