A renewed version of the computer code GAMOW ~\cite{[Ve82]} is given in which the difficulties in calculating broad neutron resonances are amended. New types of phenomenological neutron potentials with strict finite range are built in. Landscape of the S-matrix can be generated on a given domain of the complex wave number plane and S-matrix poles in the domain are localized. Normalized Gamow wave functions and trajectories of given poles can be calculated optionally.
