We discuss recent \emph{ab initio} calculations based on self-consistent Green's function theory. It is found that a simple extension of the formalism to account for two-nucleon scattering outside the model space allows to calculate non-soft interactions. With this, it is possible to make predictions for Lattice QCD potentials, obtained so far at pion masses of $m_\pi = 0.47$GeV/c$^2$. More traditional calculations that use saturating chiral EFT forces yield a good description of nuclear responses and nucleon knockout spectroscopy.
