The theoretical procedure of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is adopted to generate the resonance state wave functions of the unbound nucleus $^{15}$Be. In this framework, we used a density dependent M3Y microscopic potential and arrived at the energy and width of the 1.8 MeV (5/2$^+$) resonance state. We did not find any other nearby resonances for $^{15}$Be. It becomes apparent that the present framework is a powerful tool to theoretically complement the increasingly important accelerator based experiments with unbound nuclei.
