The dimensionless universal coefficient $\xi$ defines the ratio of the unitary fermions energy density to that for the ideal non-interacting ones in the non-relativistic limit with T=0. The classical Thomson Problem is taken as a nonperturbative quantum many-body arm to address the ground state energy including the low energy nonlinear quantum fluctuation/correlation effects. With the relativistic Dirac continuum field theory formalism, the concise expression for the energy density functional of the strongly interacting limit fermions at both finite temperature and density is obtained. Analytically, the universal factor is calculated to be $\xi={4/9}$. The energy gap is $\Delta=\frac{{5}{18}{k_f^2}/(2m)$.
