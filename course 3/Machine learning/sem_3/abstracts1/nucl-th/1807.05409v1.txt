We present a novel formulation of the IP-Glasma initial state model in 3+1D in which the 2+1D boost invariant IP-Glasma is generalized through JIMWLK rapidity evolution of the pre-collision Wilson lines \cite{Schenke:2016ksl}. In order to consistently accommodate a non-boost-invariant system, the initial conditions are generalized to 3+1D. By breaking boost invariance, the 3+1D model no longer trivially satisfies Gauss' law at the initial time, and we now enforce it locally. We compare the time evolution of the chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields as well as the transverse and longitudinal pressures in the 3+1D case with the boost invariant result.
