Correlation femtoscopy allows one to measure the space-time characteristics of particle production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to the effects of quantum statistics (QS) and final state interactions (FSI). The main features of the femtoscopy measurements at top RHIC and LHC energies are considered as a manifestation of strong collective flow and are well interpreted within hydrodynamic models employing equation of state (EoS) with a crossover type transition between Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and hadron gas phases. The femtoscopy at lower energies was intensively studied at AGS and SPS accelerators and is being studied now in the Beam Energy Scan program (BES) at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in the context of exploration of the QCD phase diagram. In this article we present femtoscopic observables calculated for Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 - 62.4$ GeV in a viscous hydro + cascade model vHLLE+UrQMD and their dependence on the EoS of thermalized matter.
