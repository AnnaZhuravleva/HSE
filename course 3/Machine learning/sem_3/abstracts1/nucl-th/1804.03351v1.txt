The restriction of $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ on the protoneutron star (PNS) PSR J0348+0432 is described by the relativistic mean field theory (RMFT) through choosing the effective coupling constants. We use an entropy per baryon S=1 to describe thermal effect on PSR J0348+0432 in this work and compare the differences between PNS PSR J0348+0432 with $\sigma^{*}$,$\phi$ and without $\sigma^{*}$,$\phi$. These effects include the particle number distribution, the mass-radius relation, the moment of inertia and the surface gravitational redshift. The PNS PSR J0348+0432 with $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ has more nucleons and will pushed forward the threshold for the appearance of the hyperons. The mass-radius relations are ($2.010M_{\odot}$,12.6520km) with $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ and ($2.010M_{\odot}$,12.6170km) without $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ respectively. The moment of inertia corresponding PNS PSR J0348+0432 are ($2.010M_{\odot}$,1.510$\times 10^{45}$g.cm$^{2}$) and ($2.010M_{\odot}$,1.559$\times 10^{45}$g.cm$^{2}$) respectively, the surface gravitational redshift corresponding PNS PSR J0348+0432 are ($2.010M_{\odot}$,0.3747) and ($2.010M_{\odot}$,0.3701) respectively. With the help of these calculations, we study the restriction of $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ on the interactions between baryons in PNS core.
