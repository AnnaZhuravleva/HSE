Within a Boltzmann transport model, we demonstrate correlation between stopping observables and shear viscosity in central nuclear collisions at intermediate energies (on the order of 10 to 1000 MeV/nucleon). The correlation allows us to assess the viscosity of nuclear matter, by tuning the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section in our transport model to agree with nuclear stopping data. We also calculate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density to determine how close the system is to the universal quantum lower limit proposed in the context of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.
