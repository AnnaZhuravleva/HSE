Our dynamical energy loss formalism, allows generating state-of-the-art suppression predictions in finite size QCD medium. The formalism uses a sophisticated model of high-$p_\perp$ parton interactions with QGP, but simple medium model with constant temperature was assumed. We here present a newly developed DREENA-B framework, which abolishes the constant temperature assumption, instead using an evolving medium modeled by Bjorken ("B") expansion. We use this framework to provide joint $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ predictions, for the first time within the dynamical energy loss formalism in evolving QCD medium. The predictions are generated for both $Pb+Pb$ and $Xe+Xe$ at the LHC, and for both light and heavy flavor probes, at different centrality regions. For $Pb+Pb$, where experimental data are available, DREENA-B framework leads to a good joint agreement with $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data. This being significant, as previous energy loss models faced difficulties in jointly explaining these data (even with free parameters), without introduction new phenomena, known as $v_2$ puzzle. For $Xe+Xe$ collisions, we provide predictions to be compared with upcoming experimental data, and also show that introduction of the evolving medium leads to visible difference in predictions, compared to constant temperature framework (DREENA-C). Overall, the results presented here provide confidence that the dynamical energy loss formalism provides a reliable tool for QGP tomography.
