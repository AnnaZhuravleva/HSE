A novel formulation of second-order relativistic viscous fluid dynamics based on the effective Boltzmann equation for quasi-particles with medium-dependent masses is briefly reviewed.~The evolution equations for the shear and bulk dissipative corrections, and the corresponding transport coefficients, are presented. Resulting approach allows for thermodynamically-consistent incorporation of lattice QCD equation of state in the fluid dynamical framework.
