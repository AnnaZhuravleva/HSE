A novel approach to obtain the excitation spectrum of nuclei is presented as well as its proof-of-principle. The Monte Carlo Shell Model is extended so that the excitation spectrum can be calculated from its ground state with full of correlations. This new methodology is sketched with the example of E1 excitations from the nucleus 88Sr in comparison to experiment. From the B(E1; 0+1 -> 1- ) value, the photoabsorption cross section is calculated, with the Giant Dipole and Pygmy Dipole Resonances in agreement with experiment. Applications to 90Sr and 90,93Zr are shown with similar characteristics. The possible relevance to the transmutation of long-lived fission products is discussed
