The energy dependence of light (anti)nuclei and (anti)hypertriton production are investigated in central Au-Au collisions from AGS up to LHC energies at midrapidity, using the parton and hadron cascade model (PACIAE) together with the dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence model(DCPC). We find that the yields, yield ratios of the antiparticles to their corresponding particles, the coalescence parameters $B_A$ and the strangeness population factor $s_3$ of light (anti)nuclei and (anti)hypertriton strongly depend on the energy. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the strangeness population factor $s_3$ and the coalescence parameters $B_A$, and find a transition point near by 20 GeV. These results thus suggest the potential usefulness of the $s_3$ and $B_A$ of light nuclei production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a direct probe of the transition point associated with the QCD critical phenomena. The results from PACIAE+DCPC model are well consistent with experimental data.
