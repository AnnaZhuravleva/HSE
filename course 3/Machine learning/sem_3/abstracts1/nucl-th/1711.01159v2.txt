In nuclear reactions of high energy one can simultaneously produce a lot of hypernuclei after the capture of hyperons by nuclear residues. We consider statistical disintegration of such hypernuclear systems and the connection of fragment production with the binding energies of hyperons. It is demonstrated that the hyperon binding energies can be effectively evaluated from the yields of different isotopes of hypernuclei. The double ratio method is suggested for this purpose. The advantage of this procedure is its universality and the possibility to involve many different isotopes. This method can also be applied for multi-strange nuclei, which binding energies were very difficult to measure in previous hypernuclear experiments.
