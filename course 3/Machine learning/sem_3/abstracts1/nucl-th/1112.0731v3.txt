The effect of quark mass on the Regge trajectory is analysed. Modifications in the equations of Regge trajectories are shown for mesonic as well as baryonic systems. For mesonic systems, the Regge trajectories get modified, but still remain linear. Contrary to the mesonic case, the Regge trajectories for baryonic systems indicate non-linearity. It is shown that in low mass and angular momentum region two hadrons with different quark compositions can have same mass and angular momentum.
