The $\pi^- + {^2{\rm H}} \rightarrow \gamma + n + n$, $\pi^- + {^3{\rm He}} \rightarrow \gamma + {^3{\rm H}}$, $\pi^- + {^3{\rm He}} \rightarrow \gamma + n + d$, $\pi^- + {^3{\rm He}} \rightarrow \gamma + n + n + p$ and $\pi^- + {^3{\rm H}} \rightarrow \gamma + n + n + n$ capture reactions are studied with the AV18 two-nucleon potential and the Urbana~IX three-nucleon potential. We provide for the first time realistic predictions for the differential and total capture rates for all these processes, treating consistently the initial and final nuclear states. Our results are based on the single nucleon Kroll-Ruderman-type transition operator and concentrate on the full treatment of the nuclear final state interactions. They are compared with older theoretical predictions and experimental data.
