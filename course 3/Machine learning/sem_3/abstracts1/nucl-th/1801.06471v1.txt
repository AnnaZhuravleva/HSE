The goal of this paper is to investigate properties of clusterized nuclear matter which is believed to be present in crusts of neutron stars at subnuclear densities. It is assumed that the whole system can be represented by the set of Wigner-Seitz cells, each containing a nucleus and an electron background under the condition of electroneutrality. The nuclear structure calculations are performed within the relativistic mean-field model with the NL3 parametrization. The first set of calculations is performed assuming the constant electron background. The evolution of neutron and proton density distributions was systematically studied along isotopic chains until very neutron-rich system beyond the neutron dripline. Then we have replaced the uniform electron background with the realistic electron distributions, obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation in a self-consistent way with the proton distributions. Finally, we have investigated the evolution of the $\beta$-stability valley as well as neutron and proton driplines with the electron density.
