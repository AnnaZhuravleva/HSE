[Background] Proton-induced knockout reactions of the form $(p,pN)$ have experienced a renewed interest in recent years due to the possibility of performing these measurements with rare isotopes, using inverse kinematics. Several theoretical models are being used for the interpretation of these new data, such as the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA), the transition amplitude formulation of the Faddeev equations due to Alt, Grassberger and Sandhas (FAGS) and, more recently, a coupled-channels method here referred to as transfer-to-the-continuum (TC).   [Purpose] Our goal is to compare the momentum distributions calculated with the DWIA and TC models for the same reactions, using whenever possible the same inputs (e.g. distorting potential). A comparison with already published results for the FAGS formalism is performed as well.   [Method] We choose the $^{15}$C($p$,$pn$)$^{14}$C reaction at an incident energy of 420 MeV/u, which has been previously studied with the FAGS formalism. The knocked-out neutron is assumed to be in a $2s$ single-particle orbital. Longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions are calculated for different assumed separation energies.   [Results] For all cases considered, we find a very good agreement between DWIA and TC results. The energy dependence of the distorting optical potentials is found to affect in a modest way the shape and magnitude of the momentum distributions. Moreover, when relativistic kinematics corrections are omitted, our calculations reproduce remarkably well the FAGS result.   [Conclusions] The results found in this work provide confidence on the consistency and accuracy of the DWIA and TC models for analyzing momentum distributions for $(p,pn)$ reactions at intermediate energies.
