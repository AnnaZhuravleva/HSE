We investigate the possibility that some nuclei show density distributions with a depletion in the center, a semi-bubble structure, by using a Hartree-Fock plus Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach. We separately study the proton, neutron and matter distributions in 37 spherical nuclei mainly in the $s - d$ shell region. We found a relation between the semi-bubble structure and the energy splitting of spin-orbit partner single particle levels. The presence of semi-bubble structure reduces this splitting, and we study its consequences on the excitation spectrum of the nuclei under investigation by using a quasi-particle random-phase-approximation approach. The excitation energies of the low-lying $4^+$ states can be related to the presence of semi-bubble structure in nuclei.
