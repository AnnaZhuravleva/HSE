We revisit the study published in [1], related to the behavior of 34 relativistic mean-field models, previously selected because they satisfy bulk nuclear matter properties, here used to compute the critical parameters of the symmetric nuclear matter. We evaluate their critical temperature, pressure, and density and compare with some values encountered in the literature. We also show that these parameters are correlated with the incompressibility calculated at the zero temperature regime.
