Some properties of the polarized neutron matter at finite temperature has been studied using the lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) method with the $AV_{18}$ potential. Our results indicate that spontaneous transition to the ferromagnetic phase does not occur. Effective mass, free energy, magnetic susceptibility, entropy and the equation of state of the polarized neutron matter at finite temperature are also calculated. A comparison is also made between our results and those of other many-body techniques.
