A correlation is established between the neutron multiplicity and the neutrons number in the fission state of Curium and Californium isotopes within a microscopic study using relativistic mean field formalism. The study includes the isotopes of Cm and Cf nuclei near the valley of stability, and hence is likely to play an important role in the artificial synthesis of superheavy nuclei. The static fission path, the neutron$-$proton asymmetry, the evolution of the neck and their composition in terms of nucleon numbers are also estimated. We find a maximum ratio for average neutron to proton density, which is about $1.6$ in the breakdown of the liquid$-$drop picture for $^{248}$Cm and $^{252}$Cf. A strong dependence of the neutron$-$proton asymmetry on the neutron multiplicity in an isotopic chain is also observed.
