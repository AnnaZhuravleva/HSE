We present a fully three-dimensional model providing initial conditions for energy and conserved charge density distributions in heavy ion collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) collision energies. The model includes the dynamical deceleration of participating nucleons or valence quarks. It provides a realistic estimation of the initial baryon stopping during the early stage of collisions. We also present the implementation of the model with 3+1 dimensional hydrodynamics, which involves the addition of source terms that deposit energy and net-baryon densities produced by the initial state model at proper times greater than the initial time for the hydrodynamic simulation. The importance of this dynamical initialization stage on hadronic flow observables at the RHIC BES is quantified.
