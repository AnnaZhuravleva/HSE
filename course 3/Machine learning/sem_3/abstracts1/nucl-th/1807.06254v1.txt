We discuss rapidity decorrelation caused by hydrodynamic fluctuations in high-energy nuclear collisions at the LHC energy. We employ an integrated dynamical model which is a combination of the Monte Carlo version of Glauber model with extension to longitudinal direction for initial conditions, full three-dimensional relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics for the space-time evolution of created matter in the intermediate stage and a hadronic cascade model in the late stage. We switch on and off the hydrodynamic fluctuations in the hydrodynamic stage to understand the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on factorisation ratios $r_{n}(\eta^a_p, \eta^b_p)$. To understand the rapidity gap dependence of the factorisation ratio comprehensively, we analyse Legendre coefficients $A^k_2$ and $B^k_2$.
