In this contribution, I present a short overview of the theory of direct nuclear reactions, with special emphasis on the case of reactions induced by weakly-bound nuclei. After introducing some general results of quantum scattering theory, I present specific applications to elastic, inelastic, transfer and breakup reactions. For each of them, I first introduce the most standard framework, followed by some alternative models or extensions suitable for the case of weakly bound nuclei. A short discussion on semiclassical theory of Coulomb excitation and its application to breakup of halo nuclei is also provided.
