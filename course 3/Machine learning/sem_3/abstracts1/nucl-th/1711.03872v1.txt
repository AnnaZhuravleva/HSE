Anisotropic-hydrodynamics framework is used to describe a mixture of quark and gluon fluids. The effects of quantum statistics, finite quark mass, and finite baryon number density are taken into account. The results of anisotropic hydrodynamics are compared with exact solutions of the coupled kinetic equations for quarks and gluons in the relaxation time approximation. The overall very good agreement between the hydrodynamic and kinetic-theory results is found.
