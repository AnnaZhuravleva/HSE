Tensor force is identified in each meson-nucleon coupling in the relativistic Hartree-Fock theory. It is found that all the meson-nucleon couplings, except the $\sigma$-scalar one, give rise to the tensor force. The effects of tensor force on various nuclear properties can now be investigated quantitatively, which allows fair and direct comparisons with the corresponding results in the non-relativistic framework. The tensor effects on nuclear binding energies and the evolutions of the $Z,\,N = 8,\,20$, and $28$ magic gaps are studied. The tensor contributions to the binding energies are shown to be tiny in general. The $Z,\,N = 8$ and $20$ gaps are sensitive to the tensor force, but the $Z,\,N = 28$ gaps are not.
