The medium modifications of the open charm mesons ($D$ and $\bar D$) are studied in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields, using a chiral effective model. The mass modifications of these mesons in the effective hadronic model, arise due to their interactions with the protons, neutrons and the scalar mesons (non-strange isoscalar $\sigma$, strange isoscalar, $\zeta$ and non-strange isovector, $\delta$), in the magnetized nuclear matter. In the presence of magnetic field, for the charged baryon, i.e., the proton, the number density as well as the scalar density have contributions due to the summation over the Landau energy levels. For a given value of the baryon density, $\rho_B$, and isospin asymmetry, the scalar fields are solved self consistently from their coupled equations of motion. The modifications of the masses of the $D$ and $\bar D$ mesons are calculated, from the medium modifications of the scalar fields and the nucleons. The effects of the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons on the masses of the open charm mesons are also investigated in the present work. The effects of isospin asymmetry as well as of the anomalous magnetic moments are observed to be prominent at high densities for large values of magnetic fields.
