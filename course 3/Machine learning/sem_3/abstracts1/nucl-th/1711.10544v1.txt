We present a fully three-dimensional initial state model for relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) collision energies. The initial energy and net baryon density profiles are produced based on a classical string deceleration model. The baryon stopping and fluctuations during this early stage of the collision are investigated by studying the net baryon rapidity distribution and longitudinal decorrelation of the transverse geometry.
