The application of Riemannian geometry to the analysis of the equilibrium thermodynamics in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and baryon density gives a new method to evaluate the transition temperature from the quark-gluon phase to the hadron phase. The results are in good agreement with the freeze-out temperature evaluated by the statistical hadronization model and with the estimates based on QCD lattice simulations.
