Unpolarized 1.047 GeV proton inelastic scatterings from Ni isotopes, $^{62}$Ni and $^{64}$Ni are analyzed phenomenologically employing an optical potential model and the first order collective model in the relativistic Dirac coupled channel formalism. The Dirac equations are reduced to the Schr\"{o}dinger-like second-order differential equations and the effective central and spin-orbit optical potentials are analyzed by considering mass number dependence. The multistep excitation via $2^+$ state is found to be important for the $4^+$ state excitation in the ground state rotational band at the proton inelastic scatterings from the Ni isotopes. The calculated deformation parameters for the 2$^+$, the 4$^+$ states of the ground state rotational band and the first 3$^-$ state are found to agree pretty well with those obtained in the nonrelativistic calculations.
