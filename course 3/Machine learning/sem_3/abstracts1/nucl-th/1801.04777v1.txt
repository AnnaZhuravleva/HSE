The MAID project is a collection of theoretical models for pseudoscalar meson photo- and electroproduction from nucleons. It is online available and produces results in real time calculations. In addition to kinematical variables also model parameters, especially for baryon resonances, can be online changed and investigated. Over 20 years MAID has become quite popular and the MAID web pages have been called more than 7.7 million times.
