Microscopic investigations for the observed properties of the recently reported five unstable new isotopes are carried out. The ground state properties are calculated in the relativistic mean field (RMF) framework and the results reproduce the experiment well as expected. The {\alpha} - decay lifetimes are calculated in the double folding model using WKB approximation which requires the relevant Q values of {\alpha} - decay and the {\alpha} - daughter potential. The latter is obtained by folding the effective M3Y nucleon nucleon potential with the RMF nucleon density distributions for the daughter nucleus and that of the {\alpha} particle which is assumed to be of Gaussian shape. the corresponding decay half - lives obtained by using available phenomenological expression are also presented, discussed and compared. It is observed that the Q values calculated in the RMF framework , though reasonably agree with the experiment, are not accurate enough for the reliable WKB calculation of decay half- lives. We therefore, advocate that the use of accurate (e.g. experimental) Q values is crucial for the reliable description of the experimental {\alpha} - decay half-lives.
