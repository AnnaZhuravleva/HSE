We calculate the decay rates lambda_(beta^-_c) and lambda_(beta^-_b) of the continuum- and bound-state beta^- decays for bare 205Hg80+ and 207Tl81+ ions. For the ratio of the decay rates R_(b/c) = lambda_(beta^-_b)/lambda_(beta^-_c) we obtain the values R_(b/c) = 0.161 and R_(b/c) = 0.190 for bare 205Hg80+ and 207Tl81+ ions, respectively. The theoretical value of the ratio R_(b/c) = 0.190 for the decays of 207Tl81+ agrees within 1% of accuracy with the experimental data R^exp_(b/c) = 0.188(18), obtained at GSI. The theoretical ratio R_(b/c) = 0.161 for 205Hg80+ is about 20% smaller than the experimental value R^exp_(b/c) = 0.20(2), measured recently at GSI.
