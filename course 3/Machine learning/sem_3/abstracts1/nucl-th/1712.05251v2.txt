We use a sequential $R$-matrix model to describe the breakup of the Hoyle state into three $\alpha$ particles via the ground state of $^8\mathrm{Be}$. It is shown that even in a sequential picture, features resembling a direct breakup branch appear in the phase-space distribution of the $\alpha$ particles. We construct a toy model to describe the Coulomb interaction in the three-body final state and its effects on the decay spectrum are investigated. The framework is also used to predict the phase-space distribution of the $\alpha$ particles emitted in a direct breakup of the Hoyle state and the possibility of interference between a direct and sequential branch is discussed. Our numerical results are compared to the current upper limit on the direct decay branch determined in recent experiments.
