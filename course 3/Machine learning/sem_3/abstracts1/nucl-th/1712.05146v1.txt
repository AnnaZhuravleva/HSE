A description of the spreading width of the Isobaric Analog Resonances in medium-heavy mass spherical nuclei is proposed within a combined approach. This latter consists in incorporating the "Coulomb description" of isospin-forbidden processes into the newly developed particle-hole dispersive optical model. Within this approach, the observed spreading width of the resonances based on the 208,209Pb parent-nuclei ground state is quantitatively estimated without the use of specific adjustable parameters.
