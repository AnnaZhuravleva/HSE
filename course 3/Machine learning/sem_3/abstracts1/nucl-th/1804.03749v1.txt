The decay process of the schematic one-dimensional three-body system is considered. A time-dependent approach is used in combination with a one-dimensional three-body model, which is composed of a heavier core nucleus and two nucleons, with the aim of describing its evolution in two-nucleon emission. The process is calculated from the initial state, in which the three ingredient particles are confined. In this process, two different types of emission can be found: the earlier process includes the emission of spatially correlated two-nucleon pair, like a dinucleon, whereas, at a subsequent time, all the particles are separated from each other. The time-dependent method can be a suitable option to investigate the meta-stable and/or open-quantum systems, where the complicated many-body dynamics should necessarily be taken into account.
