We have recently applied the generalized seniority approach successfully to explain the B(E1)/B(E2)/B(E3) properties of semi-magic nuclei. In the present paper, we extend this approach to the Schmidt model as Generalized Seniority Schmidt Model and calculate the g-factors in semi-magic nuclei. We find that the magnetic moments and the g-factors do show a particle number independent behavior in multi-j configurations, as expected in the seniority scheme. The calculated trend explains the experimental data quite well. We find that the g-factors of all the seniority states arising from a given multi-j configuration for identical nucleons is equal to the g-factor of the seniority v=1 state from that configuration. Also, the g-factors are found to be a sensitive probe for fixing the multi-j configuration, which are found to be consistent with the configurations assigned to explain the B(EL) properties in our previous works. We are also able to make definite predictions for many cases. We suggest that a new way to design effective interactions, which is diagonal in generalized seniority scheme, must be pursued.
