We present a theoretical study of the Maris polarization effect and its application in quasi-free reactions to assess information on the structure of exotic nuclei. We discuss the uncertainties in the calculations of triple differential cross sections and of analyzing powers due the choices of various nucleon-nucleon interactions the optical potentials and limitations of the method. Our calculations explore a large number of choices for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions and the optical potential for nucleon-nucleus scattering. Our study implies that polarization variables in (p,2p) reactions in inverse kinematics can be an effective probe of single-particle structure of nuclei in radioactive-beam facilities.
