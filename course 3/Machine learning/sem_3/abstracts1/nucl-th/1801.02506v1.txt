We study Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation (IMME) within the extended nuclear Density Functional Theory (DFT) that includes isospin-symmetry-breaking (ISB) contact terms and proton-neutron mixing in the particle-hole channel. We focus on isobaric triplets in light nuclei and we delineate contributions to isovector and isotensor IMME coefficients coming from the electromagnetic, isoscalar, and ISB terms of the functional. We compare the DFT results to the available ab initio calculations, so as to evaluate and quantify the role of many-body ISB contributions. The aim is to elucidate the origins of the ISB effects in finite nuclei and to attempt disentangling effects of the strong and Coulomb forces.
