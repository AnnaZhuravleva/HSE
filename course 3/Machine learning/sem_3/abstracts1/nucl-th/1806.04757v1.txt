In this work, new recursion relations for the number of spin-J states for identical particles in a single-j shell are presented. Such relations are obtained using the generating-function technique, which enables one to exhibit an odd-even staggering in the spin distribution of an even number of fermions in a single-j shell: the number of states with an even value of J is larger than the number of states with an odd value of J. An analytical expression of the excess of states with an even value of J is provided, and its asymptotic behavior for large values of j is discussed.
