We present a complete calculation of nucleon-deuteron scattering as well as ground and low-lying excited states of light nuclei in the mass range A=3-16 up through next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory using semilocal coordinate-space regularized two- and three-nucleon forces. It is shown that both of the low-energy constants entering the three-nucleon force at this order can be reliably determined from the triton binding energy and the differential cross section minimum in elastic nucleon-deuteron scattering. The inclusion of the three-nucleon force is found to improve the agreement with the data for most of the considered observables.
