We highlight some of the interesting properties of a new and finite, exact family of solutions of 1 + 1 dimensional perfect fluid relativistic hydrodynamics. After reviewing the main properties of this family of solutions, we present the formulas that connect it to the measured rapidity and pseudo-rapidity densities and illustrate the results with fits to p+p collisions at 8 TeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02 $ TeV.
