The four-neutron system is studied using exact continuum equations for transition operators and solving them in the momentum-space framework. A resonant behavior is found for strongly enhanced interaction but not a the physical strength, indicating the absence of an observable tetraneutron resonance, in contrast to a number of earlier works. As the transition operators acquire large values at low energies, it is conjectured that this behavior may explain peaks in many-body reactions even without a resonance.
