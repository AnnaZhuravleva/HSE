We investigate the binding energy parameters that should be used in modeling electron and neutrino scattering from nucleons bound in a nucleus within the framework of the impulse approximation. We discuss the relation between binding energy, removal energy, interaction energy, spectral functions and shell model energy levels and extract updated interaction energy parameters from modern ee$^{\prime}$p spectral function data. We address the difference in parameters for scattering from bound protons and neutrons, and the difference between the parameters for modeling the {\it peak} (most probable value) versus the {\it mean} of distributions. We show that different MC generators use different definitions of what is referred to as nuclear interaction energy parameters. For example, for neutrino scattering from neutrons bound in $_8^{16}$O the Smith-Moniz interaction energy $ \langle \epsilon_{SM}^{\prime N} \rangle$ = 43.0$\pm$3 MeV should be used in NEUT, the excitation energy $\langle E^N_x \rangle$= 10.2$\pm$3 MeV should be used in GENIE, and the interaction energy $\langle \epsilon_R^N\rangle$ = 27.0$\pm$3 should be used to calculate the neutrino energy from muon variables only. At present the uncertainty in the value of the interaction energy ($\pm 15$ MeV) is the largest source of systematic error in the extraction of the neutrino oscillation parameter $\Delta{m}^2$. We reduce this uncertainty by a factor of 5.
