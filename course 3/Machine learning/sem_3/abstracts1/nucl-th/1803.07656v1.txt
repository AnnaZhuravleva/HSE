Two-proton (2$p$) radioactivity is a rare decay mode found in a few proton-unbound nuclei. The $2p$-decay lifetime and properties of emitted protons carry invaluable information on nuclear structure in the presence of low-lying proton continuum. The recently measured $2p$ decay of $^{67}$Kr [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 162501 (2016)] turned out to be unexpectedly fast. Since $^{67}$Kr is expected to be a deformed system, we investigate the impact of deformation effects on the $2p$ radioactivity. We apply the recently developed Gamow coupled-channel framework, which allows for a precise description of three-body systems in the presence of rotational and vibrational couplings. This is the first application of a three-body approach to a two-nucleon decay from a deformed nucleus. We show that deformation couplings significantly increase the $2p$ decay width of $^{67}$Kr; this finding explains the puzzling experimental data. The calculated angular proton-proton correlations reflect a competition between $1p$ and $2p$ decay modes in this nucleus.
