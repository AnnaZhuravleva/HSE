In this paper, we try a method to extract the image of pion-emitting source function in the center-of-mass frame of source (CMFS). We choose the identical pion pairs according to the difference of their energy and use these pion pairs to build the correlation function. The purpose is to reduce the effect of $\triangle E \triangle t$, thus the corresponding imaging result can tend to the real source function. We examine the effect of this method by comparing its results with real source functions extracted from models directly.
