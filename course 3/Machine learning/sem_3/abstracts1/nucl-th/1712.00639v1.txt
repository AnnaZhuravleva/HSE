Experimental data on Coulomb breakup and neutron removal indicate that 31Ne is one of the heaviest halo nuclei discovered so far. The possible ground state of 31Ne is either 3/2- coming from p-wave halo or 1/2+ from s-wave halo. In this work, we develop a treatable model to include deformed wave functions and a dynamical knockout formalism which includes the dependence on the nuclear orientation to study the neutron removal from 31Ne projectiles at energies around E=200 MeV/nucleon. A detailed account of the effects of deformation on cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions is made. Our numerical analysis indicates a preference for the 31Ne ground state with spin parity 3/2-.
