Recent STAR data on the bulk observables in the energy range of the Beam-Energy Scan Program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider are analyzed within the model of the three-fluid dynamics (3FD). The simulations are performed with different equations of state (EoS). The purely hadronic EoS fails to reproduce the data. A good, though imperfect, overall reproduction of the data is found within the deconfinement scenarios. The crossover EoS turns out to be slightly preferable. For this reproduction a fairly strong baryon stopping in the quark-gluon phase is required. The 3FD model does not need two separate freeze-outs (i.e. kinetic and chemical ones) to describe the STAR data. A unified freeze-out is applied at all energies.
