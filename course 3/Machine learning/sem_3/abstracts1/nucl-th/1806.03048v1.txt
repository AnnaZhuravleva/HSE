We present the 'running' contact couplings of pionless EFT in uncoupled channels, namely, $^1S_0$ and $P$ channels, truncated at the order $\mathcal{O}(Q^4)$ through exploring the tight constraints imposed by the closed-form $T$-matrices as rigorous solutions to the Lippmann-Schwinger equations. Some unexpected relations are found and exploited in the pursuit of nonperturbative 'running' solutions of contact couplings. A number of important issues related to EFT constructed with various truncations are interpreted or discussed from the underlying theory perspective.
