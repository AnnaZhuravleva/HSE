The projected shell model with configuration mixing for nuclear chirality is developed and applied to the observed rotational bands in the chiral nucleus $^{130}$Cs. For the chiral bands, the energy spectra and electromagnetic transition probabilities are well reproduced. The chiral geometry illustrated in the $K~plot$ and the $azithumal~plot$ is confirmed to be stable against the configuration mixing. The other rotational bands are also described in the same framework.
