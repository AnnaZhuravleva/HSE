In this paper, we shall maximise the binding energy per nucleon function in the semi-empirical mass formula of the liquid drop model of the atomic nuclei to analytically prove that the mean binding energy per nucleon curve has local extrema at A = 58.6960, Z = 26.3908 and at A = 62.0178, Z = 27.7506. The Lagrange method of multipliers is used to arrive at these results, while we have let the values of A and Z take continuous fractional values. The shell model that shows why 62Ni is the most tightly bound nucleus is outlined. A brief account on stellar nucleosynthesis is presented to show why 56Fe is more abundant than 62Ni and 58Fe. We believe that the analytical proof presented in this paper can be a useful tool to the instructors to introduce the nucleus with the highest mean binding energy per nucleon.
