We study nonlinear waves in a nonrelativistic ideal and cold quark gluon plasma immersed in a strong uniform magnetic field. In the context of nonrelativistic hydrodynamics with an external magnetic field we derive a nonlinear wave equation for baryon density perturbations, which can be written as a reduced Ostrovsky equation. We find analytical solutions and identify the effects of the magnetic field.
