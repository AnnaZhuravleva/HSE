Event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations in nucleus-nucleus collisions are studied within the relativistic transport models: EPOS, PHSD, and UrQMD. As measures of particle number fluctuations we consider the scaled variances $\omega[X]$ for positive, negative, and all charged hadrons, and the strongly intensive quantities $\Delta[K^+,\pi^+],$ $\Sigma[K^+,\pi^+]$ for $K^+$ and $\pi^+$ yields. At the SPS energy range the fluctuation measures are calculated for proton-proton, Ar+Sc, and Pb+Pb collisions. Comparison with recent NA61/SHINE and older NA49 measurements of the multiplicity fluctuations is done. The validity of the model of independent sources, and the role of experimental acceptance are studied.
