We describe fireballs that rehadronize from a perfect fluid of quark matter, characterized by the lattice QCD equation of state, to a chemically frozen, multi-component mixture, that contains various kinds of observable hadrons. For simplicity and clarity, we apply a non-relativistic approximation to describe the kinematics of this expansion. Unexpectedly, we identify a secondary explosion that may characterize fireball hydrodynamics at the QCD critical point. After rehadronization, the multi-component mixture of hadrons keeps on rotating and expanding together, similarly to a single component fluid. After kinetic freeze-out, the effective temperature $T_{i}$ of the single-particle spectra of hadron type $h_i$ is found to be a sum of the kinetic freeze-out temperature $T_f$ (that is independent of the hadron type $h_i$) and a term proportional to the mass $m_i$ of hadron type $h_i$. The coefficient of proportionality to $m_i$ is also found to be independent of the hadron type $h_i$ but be dependent on the radial flow and vorticity of collective dynamics.
