Nuclear isomer is a current research focus. To describe isomers, we present a method based on the Projected Shell Model. Two kinds of isomers, K-isomers and shape isomers, are discussed. For the K-isomer treatment, K-mixing is properly implemented in the model. It is found however that in order to describe the strong K-violation more efficiently, it may be necessary to further introduce triaxiality into the shell model basis. To treat shape isomers, a scheme is outlined which allows mixing those configurations belonging to different shapes.
