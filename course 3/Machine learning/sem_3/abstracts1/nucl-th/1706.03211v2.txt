Unconstrained partial-wave amplitudes obtained at discrete energies from fits to complete sets of experimental data may not vary smoothly with energy, and are in principle non-unique. We demonstrate how this behavior can be ascribed to the continuum ambiguity. Starting from the spinless scattering case, we demonstrate how an unknown overall phase depending on energy and angle mixes the structures seen in the associated partial-wave amplitudes making the partial wave decomposition non-unique, and illustrate it on a simple toy model. We then apply these principles to pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction and show that the non-uniqueness effect can be removed through a phase rotation, allowing a consistent comparison with model amplitudes. The effect of this phase ambiguity is also considered for Legendre expansions of experimental observables. 5 pages,
