The idea of treating the trinucleon systems as elementary entities in the elementary particle model (EPM) as an Effective Field Theory, has been a success in explaining the weak charge-changing processes in nuclei. The EPM results are found to be as good as those obtained from nuclear microscopic models using two- and three-body forces. We extend this concept to investigate the validity of the elemental nature of A=3 nuclei through studies of nuclear structure of neutron rich nuclei. By treating neutron rich nuclei as primarily made up of tritons as its building blocks, we extract one-triton and two-triton separation energies of these nuclei. Calculations have been performed within relativistic mean field (RMF) models with latest interactions. Clear evidence of a new shell structure with well defined predictions of new magic nuclei arise. The most significant and an unambiguous prediction of our model, is the existence of a superheavy nucleus $_{\:\:92}^{276}{\rm U}_{184}$, which due to its small charge Z=92, should be easily accessible to experimental confirmation.
