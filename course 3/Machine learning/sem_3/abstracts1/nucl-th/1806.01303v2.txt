Estimation of the freeze-out parameters as the function of rapidity in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=72$~GeV in the AFTER@LHC project is performed. The conventional hadron resonance gas model is used for the analysis of the events generated by the UrQMD model. The results indicate that one may obtain at least $2.5$ times increase of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ in the forward rapidity range as compared to the mid-rapidity. The $\mu_B$ values in the rapidity range of $0 < y < 4.5$ for AFTER@LHC are comparable to that covered by the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program. Thus, a rapidity scan in the AFTER@LHC project provides a complementary approach to study the QCD phase diagram.
