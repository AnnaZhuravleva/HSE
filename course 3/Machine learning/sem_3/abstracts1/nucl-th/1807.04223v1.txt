A new formulation of (3+1)-dimensional anisotropic hydrodynamics is presented that accounts nonperturbatively for the large longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy and bulk viscous pressure in heavy-ion collisions. The initialization of the anisotropic hydrodynamic stage is discussed, and a comparison to standard viscous hydrodynamics for (0+1)- dimensional Bjorken expansion is presented.
