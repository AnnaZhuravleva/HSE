Since the prediction of nuclear chirality in 1997, tremendous progresses both theoretically and experimentally have been achieved. Experimentally, 59 chiral doublet bands in 47 chiral nuclei (including 8 nuclei with multiple chiral doublets) have been reported in $A\sim80,~100,~130$,~and~190 mass regions. The spins, parities, energies, ratios of the magnetic dipole transition strengths to the electric quadrupole transition strengths, and related references for these nuclei are compiled and listed in Table 1. For these nuclei with the magnetic dipole transition strengths and the electric quadrupole transition strengths measured, the corresponding results are given in Table 2. A brief discussion is provided after the presentation of energy $E$, energy difference $\Delta E$, energy staggering parameter $S(I)$, rotational frequency $\omega$, kinematic moment of inertia $\mathcal{J}^{(1)}$, dynamic moment of inertia $\mathcal{J}^{(2)}$, and ratio of the magnetic dipole transition strength to the electric quadrupole transition strength $B(M1)/B(E2)$ versus spin $I$ in each mass region.
