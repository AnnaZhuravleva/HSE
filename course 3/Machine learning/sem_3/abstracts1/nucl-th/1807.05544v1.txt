We obtain general analytical solutions of third-order viscous hydrodynamic equations for Bjorken and Gubser flows in systems with vanishing bulk viscosity and chemical potential, and having a constant shear relaxation time. We also analytically characterize and determine the hydrodynamic attractors for such systems by studying the universal behavior of these solutions at both early and late times. Finally we study the properties of these hydrodynamic attractors for transport coefficients obtained from relativistic kinetic theory in the relaxation-time approximation.
