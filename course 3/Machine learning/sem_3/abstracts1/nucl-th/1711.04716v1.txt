The first ever numerical solution of five-body Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations is presented in this work. Modern realistic Nucleon-Nucleon Hamiltonians have been tested when describing low energy elastic neutron scattering on $^4$He nucleus. Obtained results have been compared with those available in the literature and based on solution of the Schr\"odinger equation.
