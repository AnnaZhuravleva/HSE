In the present work we use the large-$N_c$ approximation to investigate quark matter described by the SU(2) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model subject to a strong magnetic field. The Landau levels are filled in such a way that usual kinks appear in the effective mass and other related quantities. $\beta$-equilibrium is also considered and the macroscopic properties of a magnetar described by this quark matter is obtained. Our study shows that the magnetar masses and radii are larger if the magnetic field increases but only very large fields ($\ge 10^{18}$ G) affect the EoS in a non negligible way.
