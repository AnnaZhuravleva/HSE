A recent suggestion [PLB 774 (2017) 522] that purely-Lambda*(1405) nuclei provide the absolute minimum energy in charge-neutral baryon matter for baryon-number about or greater than A=8, is tested within RMF calculations. A broad range of Lambda* interaction strengths, commensurate with Kbar-Kbar-N-N (I=0) binding energy assumed to be of order 100 MeV, is scanned. It is found that the binding energy per Lambda*, B/A, saturates for values about or greater than A=120, with values of B/A considerably below 100 MeV, implying that Lambda*(1405) matter is highly unstable against strong decay to Lambda and Sigma hyperon aggregates. The central density of Lambda* matter is found to saturate as well, at roughly twice nuclear matter density. Moreover, it is shown that the very strong Kbar-N potentials, which for isospin I=0 are fitted in some related works to the position and width of Lambda*(1405), fail to reproduce values of single-nucleon absorption fractions deduced across the periodic table from negative antikaon capture-at-rest bubble chamber experiments.
