We have decomposed to symmetric and asymmetric modes mass-TKE fission fragment distributions calculated by 4-dimensional Langevin equation recently developed by the authors and observed how the dominant fission mode and symmetric mode change as functions of $Z^2/\sqrt[3]{A}$ of the fissioning system in actinides and trans-actinide region. As a result, we found that the symmetric mode makes a sudden transition from super-long to super short fission mode around $^{254}$Es. The dominant fission modes on the other hand, are persistently asymmetric except for $^{258}$Fm, $^{259}$Fm and $^{260}$Md when the dominant fission mode suddenly becomes symmetric although it returns to the asymmetric mode around $^{256}$No. These "twin transitions" has been known empirically, but for the first time, we have given a clear explanation in terms of a dynamical model of nuclear fission. More specifically, since we kept the shape model parameters unchanged over the entire mass region, we conclude that the-twin transition emerges naturally from the dynamics in 4-D potential energy surface.
