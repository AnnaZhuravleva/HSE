We perform ab initio self-consistent Green's function calculations of the closed shell nuclei $^{\rm 4}$He, $^{\rm 16}$O and $^{\rm 40}$Ca, based on two-nucleon potentials derived from Lattice QCD simulations, in the flavor SU(3) limit and at the pseudo-scalar meson mass of 469~MeV/c$^{\rm 2}$. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is obtained using the HAL QCD method and its short-distance repulsion is treated by means of ladder resummations outside the model space. Our results show that this approach diagonalises ultraviolet degrees of freedom correctly. Therefore, ground state energies can be obtained from infrared extrapolations even for the relatively hard potentials of HAL QCD. Comparing to previous Brueckner Hartree-Fock calculations, the total binding energies are sensibly improved by the full account of many-body correlations. The results suggest an interesting possible behaviour in which nuclei are unbound at very large pion masses and islands of stability appear at first around the traditional doubly-magic numbers when the pion mass is lowered toward its physical value. The calculated one-nucleon spectral distributions are qualitatively close to those of real nuclei even for the pseudo-scalar meson mass considered here.
