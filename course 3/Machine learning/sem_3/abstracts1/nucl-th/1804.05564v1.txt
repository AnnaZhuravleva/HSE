Centrality and system geometry dependence of azimuthal anisotropy of charged hadrons measured in terms of the elliptic flow parameter are investigated using Au+Au event samples at incident beam energy $20$A GeV and $40$A GeV generated by Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics and A Multiphase Transport models. The Monte Carlo Glauber model is employed to estimate the eccentricity of the overlapping zone at an early stage of the collisions. Anisotropies present both in the particle multiplicity distribution and in the kinetic radial expansion are examined by using standard statistical and phenomenological methods. In the context of upcoming Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment to be held at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, the present set of simulated results provide us not only with an opportunity to examine the expected collective behavior of hadronic matter at high baryon density and moderate temperature environment, but when compared with similar results obtained from Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, they also allow us to investigate how anisotropy of hadronic matter may differ or agree with its low baryon density and high temperature counterpart.
