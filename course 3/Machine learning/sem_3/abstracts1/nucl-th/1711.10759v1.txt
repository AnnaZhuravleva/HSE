We formulate a general theory of thermal fluctuations within causal second-order viscous hydrodynamic evolution of matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The fluctuation is treated perturbatively on top of a boost-invariant longitudinal expansion. Numerical simulation of thermal noise is performed for a lattice QCD equation of state and for various second-order dissipative evolution equations. Phenomenological effects of thermal fluctuations on the two-particle rapidity correlations are studied.
