Recently, scattering of a Klein-Gordon particle in the presence of mixed scalar-vector generalized symmetric Woods-Saxon potential was investigated for the spin symmetric and the pseudo-spin symmetric cases in one spatial dimension. In this manuscript, the bound state's solutions are being investigated analytically. It is proved that the spin symmetric solutions exist while the pseudo-spin symmetric solutions do not. Beside the theoretical proof, the Newton-Raphson numerical methods are used to calculate the bound state energy spectra of a neutral Kaon particle confined in a generalized symmetric Woods-Saxon potential energy well that is constituted with repulsive or attractive surface interactions, for the spin and pseudo-spin symmetric cases, respectively. Numerical results are consistent with the non-existence of the bound state energy spectrum in the pseudo-spin symmetric case.
