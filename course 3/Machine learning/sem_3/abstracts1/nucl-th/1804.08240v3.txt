We have investigated the single-pole nature of the detectable Lambda(1405) in detail, by employing a chiral model having double poles of a KbarN-piSigma coupled channel T-matrix. The effects of the 1st pole and the 2nd pole on the observed piSigma mass spectrum in the Lambda(1405) region were analyzed separately by means of the Generalized Optical Potential. It is concluded that the 1st pole is responsible for both peak structures seen in the T(piSigma leftarrow KbarN)(T(21)) and T(piSigma leftarrow piSigma)(T(22)) invariant-mass spectra, and the 2nd pole due to an energy-dependent chiral interaction provides continuum amplitudes affecting the shape of peak structures in experimentally observable spectrum of the Lambda(1405).
