The hadron-quark combustion front is a system that couples various processes, such as chemical reactions, hydrodynamics, diffusion, and neutrino transport. Previous numerical work has shown that this system is very nonlinear, and can be very sensitive to some of these processes. In these proceedings, we contextualize the hadron-quark combustion as a nonlinear system, subject to dramatic feedback triggered by leptonic weak decays and neutrino transport.
