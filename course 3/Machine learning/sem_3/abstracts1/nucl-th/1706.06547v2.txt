The pairing energy density functionals (EDFs) that include the spatial derivative and kinetic terms of the pair densities are discussed. The coupling constants of the pairing EDF are adjusted to reproduce the experimental pairing rotational moment of inertia, and the pair-density derivative terms are shown to systematically improve the values of the pairing rotational moments of inertia in Sn and Pb isotopes. It is pointed out that the conventional average pairing gaps overestimate the experimental odd-even mass staggering in the presence of the pair-density derivative terms.
