We develop a theoretical framework to quantify the structure of unstable hadron resonances. With the help of the corresponding system in a finite volume, we define the compositeness of resonance states which can be interpreted as a probability. This framework is used to study the structure of the scalar mesons f_0(980) and a_{0}(980). In both mesons, the Kbar K component dominates about a half of the wavefunction. The method is also applied to the Lambda(1405) resonance. We argue that a single energy level in finite volume represents the two eigenstates in infinite volume. The Kbar N component of Lambda(1405), including contributions from both eigenstates, is found to be 58%, and the rest is composed of the pi Sigma and other channels.
