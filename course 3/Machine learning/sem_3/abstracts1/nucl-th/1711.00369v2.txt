For the overlap matrix element between Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states, there are two analytically different formulae: one with the square root of the determinant (the Onishi formula) and the other with the Pfaffian (Robledo's Pfaffian formula). The former formula is two-valued as a complex function, hence it leaves the sign of the norm overlap undetermined (i.e., the so-called sign problem of the Onishi formula). On the other hand, the latter formula does not suffer from the sign problem. The derivations for these two formulae are so different that the reasons are obscured why the resultant formulae possess different analytical properties. In this paper, we discuss the reason why the difference occurs by means of the consistent framework, which is based on the linked cluster theorem and the product-sum identity for the Pfaffian. Through this discussion, we elucidate the source of the sign problem in the Onishi formula. We also point out that different summation methods of series expansions may result in analytically different formulae.
