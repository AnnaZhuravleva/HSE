Alpha-decay energies for several chains of super-heavy nuclei are calculated within the self-consistent mean-field approach by using the Fayans functional FaNDF$^0$. They are compared to the experimental data and predictions of two Skyrme functionals, SLy4 and SkM*, and of the macro-micro method as well. The corresponding lifetimes are calculated with the use of the semi-phenomenological formulas by Parkhomenko and Sobiczewski and by Royer and Zhang.
