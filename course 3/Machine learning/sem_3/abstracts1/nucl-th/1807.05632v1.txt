The IP-Glasma model of CGC combined with the Lund model of PYTHIA provides a very successful description of hadron production from gluon dominated non-equilibrium matter in various small collision systems. This new CGC+PYTHIA framework, naturally reproduces several characteristic features of the hadronic observables such as the mass ordering of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ and $\langle p_{T}\rangle$, often ascribed to collectivity driven by hydrodynamics at the LHC. In this contribution we extend our work to provide a systematic comparison of particle spectra and multiplicity distributions in p+p and d+Au collisions at the RHIC.
