We calculate the cross section of the electron scattering from a bound nucleon within light-front approximation. The advantage of this approximation is the possibility of systematic account for the off-shell effects which become essential in high energy electro-nuclear processes aimed at probing the nuclear structure at small distances. We derive a new dynamical parameter which allows to control the extent of the "off-shellness" of electron - bound-nucleon electromagnetic current for different regions of momentum transfer and initial light-cone momenta of the bound nucleon. The derived cross section is compared with the results of other approaches in treating the off-shell effects in electron-nucleon scattering.
