We discuss a decay of unbound nuclei beyond the neutron drip-line using a three-body model with a core nucleus and two valence neutrons. We particularly discuss the role of dineutron correlation between the valence neutrons in the two-neutron emission from the ground state of $^{26}$O and $^{10}$He nuclei. Our calculations clearly indicate that the emission of the two neutrons in the back-to-back direction is enhanced due to the dineutron correlation.
