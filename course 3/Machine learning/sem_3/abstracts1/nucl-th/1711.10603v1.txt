Experimental and theoretical results of the $P_{\mathrm{CN}}$ fusion probability of reactants in the entrance channel and the $W_{\mathrm{sur}}$ survival probability against fission at deexcitation of the compound nucleus formed in heavy-ion collisions are discussed. The theoretical results for a set of nuclear reactions leading to formation of compound nuclei (CNs) with the charge number $Z=102\text{--}122$ reveal a strong sensitivity of $P_{\mathrm{CN}}$ to the characteristics of colliding nuclei in the entrance channel, dynamics of the reaction mechanism, and excitation energy of the system. We discuss the validity of assumptions and procedures for analysis of experimental data, and also the limits of validity of theoretical results obtained by the use of phenomenological models. The comparison of results obtained in many investigated reactions reveals serious limits of validity of the data analysis and calculation procedures.
