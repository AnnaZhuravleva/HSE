In this work, we study the centrality as well as transverse momentum dependence of the dihadron correlation for Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV. The numerical simulations are carried out by using a hydrodynamical code NeXSPheRIO, where the initial conditions are obtained from a Regge-Gribov based microscopic model, NeXuS. In our calculations, the centrality windows are evaluated regarding multiplicity. The final correlations are obtained by the background subtraction via ZYAM methods, where higher harmonics are also considered explicitly. The correlations are evaluated for the 0 - 20\%, 20\%-40\% and 60\%-92\% centrality windows. Also, the transverse momentum dependence of the dihadron correlations is investigated. The obtained results are compared with experimental data. It is observed that the centrality dependence of the "ridge" and "double shoulder" structures is in consistency with the data. Based on specific set of parameters employed in the present study, it is found that different ZYAM subtraction schemes might lead to different features in the resultant correlations.
