In order to study the properties of the $N^*$(1535) and $N^*$(1650) we calculate the mass distributions of $M B$ in the $\Lambda_c \rightarrow \bar{K}^0 M B$ decay, with $MB=\pi N(I=1/2),\eta p$ and $K\Sigma(I=1/2)$. We do this by calculating the tree-level and loop contributions, mixing pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon channels using the local hidden gauge formalism. The loop contributions for each channel are calculated using the chiral unitary approach. We observe that for the $\eta N$ mass distribution only the $N^*$(1535) is seen, with the $N^*$(1650) contributing to the width of the curve, but for the $\pi N$ mass distribution both resonances are clearly visible. In the case of $MB=K\Sigma$, we found that the strength of the $K\Sigma$ mass distribution is smaller than that of the mass distributions of the $\pi N$ and $\eta p$ in the $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow\bar{K}^0\pi N$ and $\Lambda_c^+\rightarrow\bar{K}^0\eta p$ processes, in spite of this channel having a large coupling to the $N^*(1650)$. This is because the $K\Sigma$ pair production is suppressed in the primary production from the $\Lambda_c$ decay.
