The spin magnetic dipole transitions and the neutron-proton spin-spin correlations in $sd-$shell even-even nuclei with $N=Z$ are investigated using shell model wave functions taking into accout enhanced isoscalar (IS) spin-triplet pairing as well as the effective spin operators. It was shown that the IS pairing and the effective spin operators gives a large quenching effect on the IV spin transitions to be consistent with observed data by $(p,p')$ experiments. On the other hand, the observed IS spin strength show much smaller quenching effect than expected by the calculated results. The IS pairing gives a substantial quenching effect on the spin magnetic dipole transitions, especially on the isovector (IV) ones. Consequently, an enhanced isoscalar spin-triplet pairing interaction enlarges the proton-neutron spin-spin correlation deduced from the difference between the isoscalar (IS) and the IV sum rule strengths. The beta-decay rates and the IS magnetic moments of $sd-$shell are also examined in terms of the IS pairing as well as the effective spin operators.
