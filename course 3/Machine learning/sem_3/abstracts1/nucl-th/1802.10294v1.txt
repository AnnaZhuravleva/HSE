Recent progress of the quantum molecular dynamics model for describing the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions is viewed, in particular the nuclear fragmentation, isospin physics, particle production and in-medium effect, hadron-induced nuclear reactions, hypernucleus etc. The neck fragmentation in Fermi-energy heavy-ion collisions is investigated for extracting the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities. The isospin effects, in-medium properties and the behavior of high-density symmetry energy in medium and high energy heavy-ion collisions are thoroughly discussed. The hypernuclide dynamics formed in heavy-ion collisions and in hadron induced reactions is analyzed and addressed in the future experiments at the High-Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF).
