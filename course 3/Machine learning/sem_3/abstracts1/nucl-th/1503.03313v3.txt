A Linear Boltzmann Transport model within perturbative QCD is developed for the study of parton propagation inside the quark-gluon plasma. Both leading partons and thermal recoil partons are tracked so that one can also study jet-induced medium excitations. In this study, we implement the complete set of elastic parton scattering processes and investigate elastic parton energy loss, transverse momentum broadening and their nontrivial energy and length dependence. We further investigate medium modifications of the jet shape and fragmentation functions of reconstructed jets. Contributions from thermal recoil partons are found to have significant influences on jet shape, fragmentation functions and angular distribution of reconstructed jets.
