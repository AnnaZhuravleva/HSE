In this theoretical study, we establish an interrelationship between the nucleon-nucleon interaction potential and the nuclear fusion reaction cross-sections at low energies. The axially deformed self-consistent relativistic mean field with non-linear NL3$^*$ force is used to calculate the density distribution of the projectile and target nuclei for fusion. The Wong formula is used to estimate the fusion cross-section and barrier distribution from the nucleus-nucleus optical potential for Ni-based systems, which are known for fusion hindrance phenomena. The results of the application of the so obtained nucleus-nucleus optical potential for the fusion cross-section from the recently developed relativistic $NN-$interaction (R3Y) are compared with the well-known, phenomenological M3Y effective $NN$ potential. We found a relatively good results from R3Y interactions below the barrier energies as compare to the M3Y potential concerning the experimental data. We also observe the density dependence on the nuclear interaction potential in terms of nucleon-nucleon optical potentials.
