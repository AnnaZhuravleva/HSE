It is generally believed that the $\rho^0 - \omega$ interference is the dominant mechanism underlying the violation of the isospin invariance in the $N N$ system. Assessed in this paper is the role which the mechanism might play in a potential departure from the isospin symmetry in the two $\pi^\pm p$ elastic-scattering reactions.
