Statistical reaction theories such as Hauser-Feshbach assume that branching ratios follow Bohr's compound nucleus hypothesis by factorizing into independent probabilities for different channels. Corrections to the factorization hypothesis are known in both nuclear theory and quantum transport theory, particularly an enhanced memory of the entrance channel. We apply the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble to study a complementary suppression of exit channel branching ratios. The effect can be large enough to provide information on the number of exit channels. The effect is demonstrated for the branching ratios of neutron-induced reactions on a $^{235}$U target.
