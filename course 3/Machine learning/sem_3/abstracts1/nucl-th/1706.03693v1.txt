The centrality dependence of pseudorapidity distributions for charged particles produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=130$ GeV and 200 GeV at RHIC, and in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV at LHC are investigated in the fireball model, assuming that the rapidity axis is populated with fireballs following one distribution function. We assume that the particles in the fireball fulfill the Tsallis distribution. The theoretical results are compared with the experimental measurements and a good agreement is found. Using these results, the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles produced in Pb+Pb central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV and 10 TeV are predicted.
