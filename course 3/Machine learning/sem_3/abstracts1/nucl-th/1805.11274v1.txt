The bulk viscosity coefficient of hadronic matter has been estimated in this present work, where the thermodynamical equilibrium quantity like speed of sound in the medium has been obtained by using standard hadron resonance gas model. Whereas, the non-equilibrium quantity like thermal widths of medium constituents have been calculated in the framework field theory at finite temperature. Our values of bulk viscosity coefficient are in agreement with some earlier estimations.
