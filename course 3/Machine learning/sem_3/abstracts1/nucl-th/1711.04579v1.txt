We present a study of the nonmesonic weak decay (NMWD) of charmed hypernuclei using a relativistic formalism. We work within the framework of the independent particle shell model and employ a ($\pi$,$K$) one-meson-exchange model for the decay dynamics. We implement a fully relativistic treatment of nuclear recoil. Numerical results are obtained for the one-neutron-induced transition NMWD rates of the $_{\Lambda^{+}_{c}}^{12}$N. The effect of nuclear recoil is sizable and goes in the direction to decrease the nuclear decay rate. We found that the NMWD decay rate of $_{\Lambda^{+}_{c}}^{12}$N is of the same order of magnitude as the partial decay rate for the corresponding mesonic decay $\Lambda^+_c \rightarrow \Lambda + \pi^+$, suggesting the feasibility of experimental detection of such heavy-flavor nuclear processes.
