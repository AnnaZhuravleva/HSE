The electron screening strong effect on the electron energy and threshold energy of the beta decay reaction. in this paper, we study the $\beta^-$ decay rates of some iron isotopes. The electron screening beta decay rates increase by about two orders of magnitude. The strong screening beta decay rates due to Q-value correction are by more than one order of magnitude higher than those of without Q-value correction.
