A mixture of superconducting and superfluid nuclear liquids of protons coupled to ultrarelativistic electron gas, and neutrons is considered. In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, the energy-momentum (stress) tensor is derived, and dependence on the nucleon velocity lag is given in the explicit form. The explicit form is useful for consideration of basic magnetic properties of superconducting lower-dimensional nuclear lattices. Forces acting on a single rigidly fixed slab immersed in uniform magnetic field are evaluated by the order of magnitude. It is shown that the coexistence of the magnetic field, and of a superfluid counterflow of nucleons leads to appearance of a volume-distributed neutron magnetic force and the surface force that originate from the entrainment. The resulting entrainment force in a one-dimensional lattice is studied. Links between the entrainment force and the magnetar starquake triggering mechanism, and some open problems are discussed.
