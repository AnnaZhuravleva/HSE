The properties of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is calculated in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing the suitable hyperon coupling constants. It is found that the central energy density $\epsilon_{c}$ and the central pressure $p_{c}$ of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 respectively are 1.5 times larger and 3.6 times larger than those of the canonical mass neutron star. It is also found that in the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 there are five kinds of baryons appearing: n, p, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ but in the canonical mass neutron star there are only three kinds of particles appearing: n, p and $\Lambda$. In our models, the positive well depth $U_{\Sigma}^{(N)}$ will restrict the production of the hyperons $\Sigma^{-}$, $\Sigma^{0}$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ and therefore either in the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 or in the canonical mass neutron star the hyperons $\Sigma^{-}$, $\Sigma^{0}$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ all do not appear. In addition, our results also show that the radius $R$ of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is less than that of the canonical mass neutron star while the gravitational redshift of the former is larger than that of the latter.
