In this work we investigate the finite-size effects on the phase structure of Walecka model within the framework of generalized Zeta-function, focusing on the influence of temperature as well as the number and length of compactified spatial dimensions. Here we concentrate on the situation of larger values of the coupling between the scalar and fermion fields, in which a phase transition of first order takes place. The phase transitions are analyzed and compared with the system in the situations of one, two and three compactified spatial dimensions. Our findings suggest that the thermodynamic behavior of the system depends on the length and number of spatial dimensions, with the symmetric phase being favored as the size of the system diminishes.
