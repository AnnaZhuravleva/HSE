In attempting to match QCD with Nature, it is necessary to confront the many complexities of strong, nonlinear dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory, e.g. the loss of particle number conservation, the frame and scale dependence of the explanations and interpretations of observable processes, and the evolving character of the relevant degrees-of-freedom. The peculiarities of QCD ensure that it is also the only known fundamental theory with the capacity to sustain massless elementary degrees-of-freedom, gluons and quarks; and yet gluons and quarks are predicted to acquire mass dynamically so that the only massless systems in QCD are its composite Nambu-Goldstone bosons. All other everyday bound states possess nuclear-size masses, far in excess of anything that can directly be tied to the Higgs boson. These observations highlight fundamental questions within the Standard Model: what is the source of the mass for the vast bulk of visible matter in the Universe, how is its appearance connected with confinement; how is this mass distributed within hadrons and does the distribution differ from one hadron to another? This contribution sketches insights drawn using modern methods for the continuum bound-state problem in QCD, and how they have been informed by empirical information on the hadron spectrum and nucleon-to-resonance transition form factors.
