Some results for two distinct but complementary exactly solvable algebraic models for pairing in atomic nuclei are presented: 1) binding energy predictions for isotopic chains of nuclei based on an extended pairing model that includes multi-pair excitations; and 2) fine structure effects among excited $0^+$ states in $N \approx Z$ nuclei that track with the proton-neutron ($pn$) and like-particle isovector pairing interactions as realized within an algebraic $sp(4)$ shell model. The results show that these models can be used to reproduce significant ranges of known experimental data, and in so doing, confirm their power to predict pairing-dominated phenomena in domains where data is unavailable.
