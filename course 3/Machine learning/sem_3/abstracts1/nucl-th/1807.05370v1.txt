We estimate the transport coefficients, viz., shear and bulk viscosities as well as thermal and elec- trical conductivities, of hot pionic matter using relativistic Boltzmann equation in relaxation time approximation. We use K-matrix parametrization of pion-pion cross sections to estimate the trans- port coefficients which incorporate multiple heavy resonances while simultaneously preserving the unitarity of S-matrix. We compare transport coefficients estimated using K-matrix parametriza- tion with existing literature on pionic transport coefficients. We find that the K-matrix scheme estimations are in reasonable agreement with previous results.
