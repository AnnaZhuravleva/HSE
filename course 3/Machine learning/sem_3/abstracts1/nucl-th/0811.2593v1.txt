We formulate a statistical model for description of nuclear composition and equation of state of stellar matter at subnuclear densities and temperature up to 20 MeV, which are expected during the collapse and explosion of massive stars. The model includes nuclear, electromagnetic and weak interactions between all kinds of particles, under condition of statistical equilibrium. We emphasize importance of realistic description of the nuclear composition for understanding stellar dynamics and nucleosynthesis. It is demonstrated that the experience accumulated in studies of nuclear multifragmentation reactions can be used for better modelling properties of stellar medium.
