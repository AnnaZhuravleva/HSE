Within the framework of the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism, we investigate the universal behavior of the non-equilibrium critical fluctuations, using the Langevin dynamics of model A. With properly located typical time, length and angle scales, $\tau_{\mbox{KZ}}$, $l_{\mbox{KZ}}$, and $\theta_{\mbox{KZ}}$, the constructed functions $\bar{f}_n((\tau-\tau_c)/\tau_{\mbox{KZ}},\theta_{\mbox{KZ}})$ (n=1...4) for the cumulants of the sigma field show universal behavior near the critical point, which are independent from some non-universal factors, such as the relaxation time or the evolution trajectory.
