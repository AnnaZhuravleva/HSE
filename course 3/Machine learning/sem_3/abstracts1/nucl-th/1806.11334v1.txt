The half-lives of proton radioactivity of proton emitters are investigated theoretically by using KDE0v1 Skyrme interaction. The total barrier potential in the proton radioactive nuclei is calculated as the sum of the nuclear, Coulomb and centrifugal contributions. The Hartree-Fock nuclear density distributions is used in calculating the nuclear as well as the Coulomb interaction potentials. The quantum mechanical tunneling probability is calculated within the WKB approximation. These calculations provide reasonable estimates for the observed proton radioactivity lifetimes.
