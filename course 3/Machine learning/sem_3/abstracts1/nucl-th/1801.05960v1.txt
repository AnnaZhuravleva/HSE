The isospin dependent in-medium $NN\rightarrow N\Delta$ cross sections in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated within the framework of the one boson exchange model with the $\delta$ meson taken into account. The influence of the coupling constant of $\Delta$ to $\delta$ meson ($g_{\delta\Delta\Delta}$ or $\kappa=g_{\delta\Delta\Delta}/g_{\delta NN}$) on the in-medium $NN\rightarrow N\Delta$ cross sections is analyzed. Our results show that the strength of the coupling constant $g_{\delta\Delta\Delta}$ largely influences the in-medium cross section and the medium correction factor, R=$\sigma^*_{NN\rightarrow N\Delta}/\sigma^{free}_{NN\rightarrow N\Delta}$, near the threshold energy. In the case of $\kappa$=1, the $\sigma^*_{pp\rightarrow n\Delta^{++}}$ ($\sigma^*_{nn\rightarrow p\Delta^{-}}$) is enhanced (suppressed) relative to its cross section in free space due to the shift of the spectral function of $\Delta$ resonance in medium. For $\kappa$=3, the medium correction has opposite effects, where the $\sigma^*_{pp\rightarrow n\Delta^{++}}$ ($\sigma^*_{nn\rightarrow p\Delta^{-}}$) is suppressed (enhanced) relative to its cross section in free space. It could influence the prediction on the multiplicity of pion and the $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio in the transport model simulations, and this uncertainty should be well understood in the transport models simulations before obtaining the accurate conclusion on the symmetry energy at suprasaturation density through the comparison with the pion data.
