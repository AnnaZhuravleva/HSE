The characteristic physical properties of rotating neutron stars under the r-mode oscillation are evaluated using the finite-range simple effective interaction. Emphasis is given on examining the influence of the stiffness of both the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the nuclear equation of state on these properties. The amplitude of the r-mode at saturation is calculated using the data of particular neutron stars from the considerations of "spin equilibrium" and "thermal equilibrium". The upper limit of the r-mode saturation amplitude is found to lie in the range 10^{-8}-10^{-6}, in agreement with the predictions of earlier work.
