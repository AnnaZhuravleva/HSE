Testing the constancy of the gravitational constant G has been a longstanding fundamental question in natural science. As first suggested by Jofr\'{e}, Reisenegger and Fern\'{a}ndez [1], Dirac's hypothesis of a decreasing gravitational constant $G$ with time due to the expansion of the Universe would induce changes in the composition of neutron stars, causing dissipation and internal heating. Eventually, neutron stars reach their quasi-stationary states where cooling due to neutrino and photon emissions balances the internal heating. The correlation of surface temperatures and radii of some old neutron stars may thus carry useful information about the changing rate of G. Using the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy constrained by recent terrestrial laboratory data on isospin diffusion in heavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies and the size of neutron skin in $^{208}Pb$ within the gravitochemical heating formalism, we obtain an upper limit of the relative changing rate of $|\dot{G}/G|\le4\times 10^{-12}yr^{-1}$ consistent with the best available estimates in the literature.
