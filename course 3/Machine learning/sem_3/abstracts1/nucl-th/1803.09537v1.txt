The Gamow-Teller strength in nuclei can be strongly affected by the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon. It is demonstrated that this feature is unique to the Gamow-Teller. Excitation modes that involve spatial degrees of freedom are much less influenced by the internal excitation of nucleons. The fact that the observed Gamow-Teller strength is quenched by 30-40 percent in all nuclei suggests that indeed this is due to the nucleon excitation in nuclei.
