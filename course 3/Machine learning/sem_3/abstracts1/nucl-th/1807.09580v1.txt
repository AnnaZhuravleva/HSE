Results for the zero-sound excitations in the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter are presented for the different parameters of asymmetry $-1\leq\beta\leq 1$. The polarization operator is constructed within the random phase approximation. We use the Landau-Migdal quasiparticle interaction with the special isospin dependence of the phase volume in the normalization factor $C_0$. In the paper we present zero-sound branches of the dispersion equation solutions in the symmetric, asymmetric and neutron matter. The branches correspond to the different channels of decay of the zero-sound excitation in the nuclear matter or nuclei. In the asymmetric nuclear matter we obtain three branches of solutions on the physical and unphysical sheets of the complex frequency plane, $\omega_{s\,\tau}(k,\beta)$, $\tau=p,n,np$. We demonstrate how three branches turn into two branches in symmetric nuclear matter ($\beta=0$) and into one branch in the neutron matter ($\beta=1$). The solutions are applied to calculation of a strength function of the giant dipole resonance in ${}^{48}$Ca.
