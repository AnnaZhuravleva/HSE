The hindrance phenomenon of heavy-ion fusion cross sections at deep subbarrier energies often accompanies a maximum of an astrophysical $S$ factor at a threshold energy for fusion hindrance. We argue that this phenomenon can naturally be explained when the fusion excitation function is fitted with two potentials, with a larger (smaller) logarithmic slope at energies lower (higher) than the threshold energy. This analysis clearly suggests that the astrophysical $S$ factor provides a convenient tool to analyze the deep subbarrier hindrance phenomenon, even though the $S$ factor may have a strong energy dependence for heavy-ion systems unlike that for astrophysical reactions.
