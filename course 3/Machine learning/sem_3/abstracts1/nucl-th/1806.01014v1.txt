We present a simplified method to generate the Hartree-Fock Gamow basis from realistic nuclear forces. The Hartree-Fock iteration in the harmonic-oscillator basis is first performed, and then the obtained HF potential is analytically continued to the complex-k plane, finally by solving the Schr\"odinger equation in the complex-k plane the Gamow basis is obtained. As examples, the method is applied to 4He and 22O with the renormalized chiral N3LO potential. The basis obtained which includes bound, resonant and scattering states can be further used in many-body calculations to study weakly bound nuclei.
