We examine the autocorrelation function of the $^{235}$U(n,f) reaction with a view to quantify the presence of intermediate structure in the cross section. Fluctuations due to compound nucleus resonances on the eV energy scale are clearly visible up to $\sim100$ keV neutron energies. Structure on the one-keV energy scale is not present as a systematic feature of the correlation function, although it is present in the data covering the region around 20 keV.
