The nuclear response theory for isospin-transfer modes in the relativistic particle-vibration coupling framework is extended to include coupling of single nucleons to isospin-flip (charge-exchange) phonons, in addition to the usual neutral vibrations. This new coupling introduces dynamical pion and rho-meson exchange, beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation, up to infinite order. We investigate the impact of this new mechanism on the Gamow-Teller response of a few doubly-magic neutron-rich nuclei, namely $^{48}$Ca, $^{78}$Ni, $^{132}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb. It is found that the coupling to isospin-flip vibrations can have a non negligible impact on the strength distribution and quenching of the Gamow-Teller resonance, globally improving the agreement with the experimental data. The corresponding beta-decay half-lives of $^{78}$Ni and $^{132}$Sn are also calculated, and found to be decreased by the inclusion of the new phonons. Overall the lifetimes are very close to the experimental data using unquenched value of the weak axial coupling constant $g_A$.
