A recent paper [S. Ohkubo, Phys. Rev. C 95, 044002 (2017)] found that the measured 1S0 phase shifts can be reproduced using a deeply attractive nucleon-nucleon potential. We find that the deuteron would decay strongly via pion emission to the deeply bound state arising in this potential. There- fore the success of a deeply attractive potential in describing phase shifts must be regarded only as an interesting curiosity.
