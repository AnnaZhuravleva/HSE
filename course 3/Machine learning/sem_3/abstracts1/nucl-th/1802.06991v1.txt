In the sequel of the present study, we have investigated the rotational motion of triaxially deformed nucleus by using the microscopic framework of angular-momentum projection. The Woods-Saxon potential and the schematic separable-type interaction are employed as a microscopic Hamiltonian. As the first example nuclear wobbling motion was studied in detail in the part~I of the series. This second part reports on another interesting rotational mode, chiral doublet bands: two prototype examples, $^{128}$Cs and $^{104}$Rh, are investigated. It is demonstrated that the doublet bands naturally appear as a result of the calculation in this fully microscopic framework without any kind of core, and they have the characteristic properties of the $B(E2)$ and $B(M1)$ transition probabilities, which are expected from the phenomenological triaxial particle-rotor coupling model.
