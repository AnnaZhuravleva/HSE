We employ a variety of ab initio methods including Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations, No-Core Configuration Interaction Approach, Coupled-Cluster Theory and In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group to perform a comprehensive analysis of the nucleon-deuteron elastic and breakup reactions and selected properties of light and medium-mass nuclei up to 48Ca using the recently constructed semilocal coordinate-space regularized chiral nucleon-nucleon potentials. We compare the results with those based on selected phenomenological and chiral EFT two-nucleon potentials, discuss the convergence pattern of the chiral expansion and estimate the achievable theoretical accuracy at various chiral orders using the novel approach to quantify truncation errors of the chiral expansion without relying on cutoff variation. We also address the robustness of this method and explore alternative ways to estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the chiral expansion.
