The goal of this contribution is to analyze the connection between shape coexistence and quantum phase transition, two seemingly unrelated phenomena that share common aspects, namely, the rapid change in the ground state structure along an isotope chain or the presence of several minima at the mean-field level. To illustrate the similarities and differences between both phenomena, we will focus in the Pb region, in particular in Pt and Hg isotopes, as well as in Zr isotopes.
