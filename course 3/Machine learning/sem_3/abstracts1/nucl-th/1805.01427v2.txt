We present new, exact, finite solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics for longitudinally expanding fireballs for arbitrary constant value of the speed of sound. These new solutions generalize earlier, longitudinally finite, exact solutions, from an unrealistic to a reasonable equation of state, characterized by a temperature independent (average) value of the speed of sound. Observables like the rapidity density and the pseudorapidity density are evaluated analytically, resulting in simple and easy to fit formulae that can be matched to the high energy proton-proton and heavy ion collision data at RHIC and LHC. In the longitudinally boost-invariant limit, these new solutions approach the Hwa-Bjorken solution and the corresponding rapidity distributions approach a rapidity plateaux.
