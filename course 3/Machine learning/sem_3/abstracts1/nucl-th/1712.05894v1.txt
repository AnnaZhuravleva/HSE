The difference of the moment of inertia of the neutron star PSR J0348 + 0432 and that of its proto neutron star is studied in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory considering baryon octet. The temperature of the proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is chosen as T=5 MeV. The calculations show that the central baryon number density of the proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range 0.623$\sim$0.813 fm$^{-3}$, decreased by 2$\sim$7\% compared to that of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432. The radius of the proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range 13.101$\sim$12.419 km, increased by 1$\sim$2\% compared to that of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432. The moment of inertia of the proto neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range 1.939$\times$10$^{45}$$\sim$1.638$\times$10$^{45}$ g.cm$^{2}$, increased by about 2$\sim$7\% compared to that of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432.
