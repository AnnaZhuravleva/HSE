Solutions of hydrodynamical equations are presented for the equation of state of the Var der Waals type allowing for the first order phase transition. Attention is focused on description of the hadron-quark phase transition in heavy ion collisions. It is shown that fluctuations dissolve and grow as if the fluid is effectively very viscous. Even in spinodal region germs are growing slowly due to viscosity and critical slowing down. This prevents enhancement of fluctuations in the near-critical region, which is frequently considered as a signal of the critical point in heavy ion collisions.
