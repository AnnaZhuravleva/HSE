In the framework of the two-group configuration model we obtain formulas for the reduced transition rates for beta- and gamma-transitions in even-even, odd-odd, even-odd, and odd-even nuclei. We explored dependencies of the transition rates on the occupancies of the involved subshells, as well as on the spin values of the initial and final states. The obtained formulas are useful for the qualitative spectroscopic analysis of experimental data, particulary in the regions of magicity, including the regions of the "remote" nuclei.
