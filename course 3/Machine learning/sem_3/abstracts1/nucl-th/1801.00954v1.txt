We study the nuclear properties of even-even superheavy $Z$=120 isotopes and $N$=184 isotones with the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)approach. Within this model we examine the deformation energy surfaces and two paths to fission: a reflection-symmetric path with elongated fission fragments (sEF) and a reflection-asymmetric path corresponding to elongated fission fragments (aEF). Furthermore, we explore the energy surfaces in the region of very large oblate deformations with toroidal nuclear density distributions. While the energy surfaces of toroidal $Z$=120 isotopes and $N$=184 isotones do not possess energy minima without angular momenta,local energy minima (toroidal high spin isomeric states) appear for many of these superheavy nuclei with specific angular momenta about the symmetry axis. We have theoretically located the toroidal high spin isomers (THSIs) of $^{302}$Og$_{184}$,$^{302}120_{182}$, $^{306}120_{186}$, and $^{306}122_{184}$.
