The cross sections for the deep sub-barrier fusion reaction of light nuclei are calculated within the theoretical framework of the selective resonant tunneling model. In this model, assumption of a complex square-well nuclear potential is invoked to describe the absorption inside the nuclear well. The theoretical estimates for these cross sections agree well with the experimentally measured values. The features of the astrophysical S-factor are derived in terms of this model. Present formalism appears to be particularly useful for the low energy resonant reactions between two charged nuclei.
