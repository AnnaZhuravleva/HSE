In the framework of Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory (EFT), we calculate two-gluon rapidity correlations in the leading and sub-leading orders of $p_\perp/Q_s$. In the leading order, both short- and long-range rapidity correlations are enhanced. In contrast, the contribution of sub-leading order is mainly short range quantum correlations. It is much smaller than that of the leading one, but is not negligible. Transverse momentum dependence of rapidity correlation shows that the leading order is sensitive to the saturation momentum of two incident particles, but the sub-leading one is not.
