We propose the use of pure spin-3/2 propagator in the $(3/2,0) \oplus (0,3/2)$ representation in particle and nuclear physics. To formulate the propagator in a covariant form we use the antisymmetric tensor spinor representation and we consider the $\Delta$ resonance contribution to the elastic $\pi N$ scattering as an example. We find that the use of conventional gauge invariant interaction Lagrangian leads to a problem; the obtained scattering amplitude does not exhibit the resonance behavior. To overcome this problem we modify the interaction by adding a momentum dependence. As in the case of Rarita-Schwinger we find that a perfect resonance description could be obtained in the pure spin-3/2 formulation only if hadronic form factors were considered in the interactions.
