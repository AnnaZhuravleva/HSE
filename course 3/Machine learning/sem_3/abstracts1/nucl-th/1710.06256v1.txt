Electromagnetic radiation is emitted during the whole course of a heavy-ion collision and can escape from the collision zone without further interactions. This makes it an ideal tool to study the properties of hot and dense QCD matter. To model the space-time evolution of the collision at SIS energies a coarse-graining approach is used to convert transport simulations into meaningful temperatures and densities. These parameters serve as input for the determination of the pertinent radiation of thermal dileptons based on an in-medium $\rho$ spectral function that describes available spectra at ultrarelativistic collision energies. The resulting excitation function of the thermal excess radiation provides a baseline for future measurements by the HADES and CBM experiments at GSI/FAIR, and experiments proposed at NICA and J-PARC.
