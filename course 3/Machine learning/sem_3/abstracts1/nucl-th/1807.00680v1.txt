A systematic study of alpha and cluster decay from Pt isotopes had been done with the help of a microscopic theory called Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Different Skyrme interactions are used to analyse how it affect the decay half-life of the cluster emissions. Half-lives are calculated with the help of Universal Decay Law(UDL). Phenomenological Effective Liquid Drop model is used for the comparison of the calculated results. The use of harmonic oscillator(HO) and transformed harmonic oscillator(THO) basis does not produce any significant difference in the observed results. The role of shell closure in cluster decay is withal analysed.
