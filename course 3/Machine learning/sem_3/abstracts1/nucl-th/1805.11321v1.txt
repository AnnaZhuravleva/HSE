We present a method for extracting an energy density functional (EDF) for nuclei starting from a given immutable equation of state (EoS) of homogeneous matter. The scheme takes advantage of a natural Ansatz for homogeneous nuclear matter and basic EDF theory tenets. We apply it to closed-(sub)shell nuclei to show that a good-quality Skyrme force model can easily be reverse-engineered from a good-quality EoS without refinement or extensive fitting. Then the bulk and static nuclear properties are found practically to be independent of the assumed value for the effective mass, which is a unique result in bridging EDF for finite and homogeneous systems. Our methodology can be applied to study the effect of the EoS parameters and of the effective mass on nuclear observables including excitations without inducing artificial correlations amongst the EoS parameters and the effective mass, thanks to the freedom to vary them independently.
