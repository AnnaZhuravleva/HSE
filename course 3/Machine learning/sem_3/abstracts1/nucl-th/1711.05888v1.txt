Using a new approximate analytic parameter-free proxy-SU(3) scheme, simple predictions for the global feature of prolate dominance and for the locus of the prolate-oblate shape transition have been made and compared with empirical data. Emphasis is placed on the mechanism leading to the breaking of the particle-hole symmetry, which is instrumental in shaping up these predictions. It turns out that this mechanism is based on the SU(3) symmetry and the Pauli principle alone, without reference to any specific Hamiltonian.
