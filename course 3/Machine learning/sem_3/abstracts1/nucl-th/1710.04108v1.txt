The emergent phenomenon of collective neutrino oscillations arises from neutrino-neutrino interactions in environments with very large number of neutrinos. Since such environments are likely sites of the heavy-element synthesis, understanding all aspects of collective neutrino oscillations seems to be necessary for a complete accounting of nucleosynthesis. I briefly summarize some of the salient features along with recent work on the properties and astrophysical applications of the collective neutrino oscillations.
