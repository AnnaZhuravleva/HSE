Recently it has been discovered that the elliptic flow, v2, of composite charged particles emitted at midrapidity in Heavy-Ion collisions at intermediate energies shows the strongest sensitivity to the Nuclear Equation of State (EoS) which has been observed up to now within a microscopic model. This dependence on the nuclear EoS is predicted by Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) calculations [1] which show as well that the absorption or rescattering of in-plane emitted particles by the spectator matter is not the main reason for the EoS dependence of the elliptic flow at mid-rapidity but different density gradients (and therefore different forces) in the direction of the impact parameter (x-direction) as compared to the direction perpendicular to the reaction plan (y-direction), caused by the presence of the spectator matter. The stronger density gradient in y-direction accelerates the particles more and creates therefore a negative v2. When using a soft momentum dependent EoS, the QMD calculations reproduce the experimental results.
