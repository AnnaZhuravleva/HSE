An effective relativistic kinetic theory has been constructed for an interacting system of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons within a quasi-particle description of hot QCD medium at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential, where the interactions are encoded in the gluon and quark effective fugacities with non-trivial energy dispersions. The local conservations of stress-energy tensor and number current require the introduction of a mean field term in the transport equation which produces non-vanishing contribution to the first order transport coefficients. Such contribution has been observed to be significant for the temperatures which are closer to the QCD transition tem- perature, however, induces negligible contributions beyond a few times the transition temperature. As an implication, impact of the mean field contribution on the the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and thermal conductivity of a hot QCD medium in the presence of binary, elastic collisions among the constituents, has been investigated. Visible effects have been observed for the temperature regime closer to the QCD transition temperature.
