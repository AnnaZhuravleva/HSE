Using a new approximate analytic parameter-free proxy-SU(3) scheme, we make predictions of shape observables for deformed nuclei, namely beta and gamma deformation variables, and compare them with empirical data and with predictions by relativistic and non-relativistic mean-field theories. Furthermore, analytic expressions are derived for B(E2) ratios within the proxy-SU(3) model, free of any free parameters, and/or scaling factors. The predicted B(E2) ratios are in good agreement with the experimental data for deformed rare earth nuclides.
