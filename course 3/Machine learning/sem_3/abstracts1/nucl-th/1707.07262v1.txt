We have investigated the different spin polarizations of baryons and antibaryons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, based on an extended multiphase transport model with the partonic evolution described by a 3-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) transport model. Incorporating the spin-orbit coupling induced by the vector potentials from the NJL interaction and from the electromagnetic field, we observe different spin polarizations for various quarks species as a result of their different baryon and electric charges. Consequently, antiquarks (quarks) have a positive (negative) spin polarizations on average, and this presumedly leads to a stronger polarization for antibaryons than for baryons at midrapidities once the coupling to the vorticity field is further incorporated.
