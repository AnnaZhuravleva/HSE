We propose a new approach to initialize the hydrodynamic fields such as energy density distributions and four flow velocity fields in hydrodynamic modeling of high-energy nuclear collisions at the collider energies. Instead of matching the energy-momentum tensor or putting the initial conditions of quark-gluon fluids at a fixed initial time, we utilize a framework of relativistic hydrodynamic equations with source terms to describe the initial stage. Putting the energy and momentum loss rate of the initial partons into the source terms, we obtain hydrodynamic initial conditions dynamically. The resultant initial profile of the quark-gluon fluid looks highly bumpy as seen in the conventional event-by-event initial conditions. In addition, initial random flow velocity fields also are generated as a consequence of momentum deposition from the initial partons. We regard the partons that survive after the dynamical initialization process as the mini-jets and find sizable effects of both mini-jet propagation in the quark-gluon fluids and initial random transverse flow on the final momentum spectra and anisotropic flow observables. We perform event-by-event $(3+1)$-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic simulations with this new framework that enables us to describe the hydrodynamic bulk collectivity, parton energy loss, and interplay among them in a unified manner.
