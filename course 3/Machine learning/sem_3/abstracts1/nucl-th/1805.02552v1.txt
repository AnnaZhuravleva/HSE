Our earlier work on Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS energies, performed in the framework of the "fire-streak" model, is now extended to inelastic p+p reactions. With no tuning nor adjustment to the experimental data, the rapidity distribution of pions produced by a single fire-streak which we obtained from Pb+Pb collisions reproduces the shape of the experimental pion rapidity distribution in p+p interactions, measured by the NA49 Collaboration at the same energy. The observed difference in the absolute normalization of this distribution can be explained by the difference in the overall energy balance, induced by baryon stopping and strangeness enhancement phenomena occurring in heavy ion collisions. We estimate the latter effect using a collection of SPS experimental data on $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, net $p$, and $n$ production. We discuss the implications of the above findings for our understanding of the role of energy and momentum conservation in both reactions, and of the similarities and differences between pion production in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions.
