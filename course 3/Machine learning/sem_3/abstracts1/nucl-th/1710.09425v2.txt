Recent studies based on non-perturbative lattice Monte-Carlo solutions of Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory of strong interactions, demonstrated that at high temperature there is a phase change from confined hadronic matter to a deconfined quark-gluon plasma where quarks and gluons can travel distances largely exceeding the size of hadrons. The phase structure of such strongly interacting matter can be decoded via analysis of particle abundances in high energy nuclear collisions within the framework of the statistical hadronization approach. The results imply quark-hadron duality at and experimental delineation of the location of the phase boundary of strongly interacting matter.
