A particle number conserving BCS approach (FBCS) is formulated in the relativistic mean field (RMF) model. It is shown that the so-obtained RMF+FBCS model can describe the weak pairing limit. We calculate the ground-state properties of the calcium isotopes $^{32-74}$Ca and compare the results with those obtained from the usual RMF+BCS model. Although the results are quite similar to each other, we observe an interesting phenomenon, i.e., for $^{54}$Ca, the FBCS approach can enhance the occupation probability of the $2p_{1/2}$ single particle level and slightly increases its radius, compared with the RMF+BCS model. This leads to an unusual scenario that although $^{54}$Ca is more bound with a spherical configuration but the corresponding size is not the most compact one. We anticipate that such a phenomenon might happen for other neutron rich nuclei and should be checked by further more systematic studies.
