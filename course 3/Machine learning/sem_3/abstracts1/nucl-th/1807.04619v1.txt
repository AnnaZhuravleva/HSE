The field of heavy ion physics is at a crossroads in understanding experimental signatures of collectivity in small collision systems, p + p and p(d/3He) + A, at RHIC and the LHC. A wealth of data obtained in the latter class of asymmetric systems indicate the existence of particle emission patterns similar to those observed in larger A+A collisions [1], raising the question of whether the same physics is at play in both cases, lest the cruelty of nature be somehow exposed. In this talk, we present an extension of earlier studies using the quasiparticle transport model AMPT to predict particle emission patterns in the smallest of collision systems, namely p + p and e+e-. The e+e- results have been previously published [2] and we thus focus here on an extended set of calculations, as shown at the Quark Matter 2018 Conference.
