The correlation of the tidal polarizabilities $\Lambda_1$-$\Lambda_2$ for GW170817 is analyzed by combining dense matter equations of state (EOS) that satisfy nuclear physics constraints and the posteriors of the LIGO-Virgo (LV) gravitational wave data analysis. Two EOS models are explored: a minimal model (MM) relies on an extrapolation of a parametrized nuclear EOS, and a second model, labelled CSM, is a general parametrization of the speed of sound that also allows for phase transitions at high densities. Both models are constrained by calculations of the neutron matter EOS using chiral effective field theory (EFT) Hamiltonians up to a given density $n_{\text{tr}}$, and by requiring that the neutron star maximum mass $M_{\text max} \ge 1.9~M_\odot$. We find that the CSM model, which subsumes the predictions of MM, is constrained by the gravitational wave observation from GW170817 if $n_{\text{tr}}=n_{\text{sat}}$ where $n_{\text{sat}}=0.16$ fm$^{-3}$. However, if the EFT remains valid up to $n_{\text{tr}}=2 n_{\text{sat}}$ we predict the combined tidal polarizability of the NSs in GW170817 to be $80\le \tilde{\Lambda}\le 570$ ($280\le \tilde{\Lambda}\le 480$ for the minimal model), which is compatible but smaller than the range suggested by LV data analysis. Our analysis also shows that GW170817 requires a neutron star with $M=1.4M_\odot$ to have a radius $R_{1.4}<13.6$~km.
