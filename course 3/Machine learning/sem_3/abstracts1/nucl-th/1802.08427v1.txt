It was recently suggested that the discrepancy between two methods of measuring the lifetime of the neutron may be a result of an unseen decay mode into a dark matter particle which is almost degenerate with the neutron. We explore the consequences of this for the properties of neutron stars, finding that their known properties are in conflict with the existence of such a particle.
