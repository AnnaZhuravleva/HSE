We present a discussion of models of nuclear effects used to describe an inclusive electron-nucleus scattering in the quasielastic (QE) peak region, aiming to compare them and draw conclusion of their reliability when applied in neutrino-nucleus interactions. A basic motivation is to reduce systematic errors in neutrino oscillation experiments. We concentrate on the neutrino energy profile of the T2K experiment, which provides us a region of the greatest importance in terms of the highest contribution to the charge-current quasielastic (CCQE) cross section. We choose only electron-nucleus data that overlaps with this region. In order to clearify the analysis, we split the data sets into three groups and draw conclusion separately from each one of them.   We selected six models for this comparison: Benhar's spectral function with and without final state interaction (Benhar's SF+FSI), Valencia spectral function (Valencia SF), for higher energy transfer only with the hole spectral function; GiBUU and also the local and global Fermi gas models. The latter two are included as a benchmark to quantify the effect of various nuclear effects. All the six models are often used in neutrino scattering studies. A short theoretical description of each model is given. Although in the selected data sets the QE mechanism dominates, we also briefly discuss a possible impact of $2p2h$ and $\Delta$ contributions.
