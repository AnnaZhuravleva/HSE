We derive the constitutive equations of causal relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics ($d$-hydrodynamics) from perfect nonextensive hydrodynamics ($q$-hydrodynamics) using the nonextensive/dissipative correspondence (NexDC) proposed by us recently. The $q$-hydrodynamics can be thus regarded as a possible model for the $d$-hydrodynamics facilitating its application to high energy multiparticle production processes. As an example we have shown that applying the NexDC to the perfect 1+1 $q$-hydrodynamics, one obtains a proper time evolution of the bulk pressure and the Reynolds number.
