In previous works we examined the systematics of magnetic dipole transitions in a single j shell. We here extend the study to large space calculations. We consider Ti and Cr isotopes.. In this work we focus on the B(M1) strength as a function of excitation of energy. The initial state is the lowest J= state. T=1 state in a specified nucleus. The final states are J=0 T=2 , all in one plot, and J=2 T=2 in another. The initial figures have points all over the map although there is a suggestion of an exponential trend. To reduce clutter we perform binning operations in which the summed strength in a given energy interval is represented by a single point. The new binning curves show more clearly the exponential fall of B(M1)'s with energy.
