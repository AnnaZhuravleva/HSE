We examine how the effect of hollowness in pp scattering at the LHC (minimum of the inelasticity profile at zero impact parameter) depends on modeling of the phase of the elastic scattering amplitude as a function of the momentum transfer. We study the cases of the constant phase, the Bailly, and the so called standard parameterizations. It is found that the 2D hollowness holds in the first two cases, whereas the 3D hollowness is a robust effect, holding for all explored cases.
