We compare the results of the SuSAv2 model including meson-exchange currents (MEC) with the recent measurement of the quasielastic-like double differential antineutrino cross section on hydrocarbon performed by the MINERvA Collaboration. The relativistic nature of the model makes it suitable to describe these data, which correspond to a mean beam energy of 3.5 GeV. The model predictions agree well with the data without need of tuning any parameter. The role of longitudinal MEC is non-negligible and improves the agreement with the data.
