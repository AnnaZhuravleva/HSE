It has recently been proven that the invariance of observables with respect to angle dependent phase rotations of reaction amplitudes mixes multipoles changing also their relative strength [1]. All contemporary partial wave analyses (PWA) in $\eta$ photoproduction on protons, either energy dependent (ED) [2-5] or single energy (SE) [6] do not take this effect into consideration. It is commonly accepted that there exist quite some similarity in the $E0+$ multipole for all PWA, but notable differences in this, but also in remaining partial waves still remain. In this paper we demonstrate that once this phase rotations are properly taken into account, all contemporary ED and SE partial wave analysis become almost identical for the dominant $E0+$ multipole, and the agreement among all other multipoles becomes much better. We also show that the the measured observables are almost equally well reproduced for all PWA, and the remaining differences among multipoles can be attributed solely to the difference of predictions for unmeasured observables. So, new measurements are needed.
