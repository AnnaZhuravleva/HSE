These lectures are intended for graduate students who want to acquire a working knowledge of path integral methods in a wide variety of fields in physics. In general the presentation is elementary and path integrals are developed in the usual heuristic, non-mathematical way for application in many diverse problems in quantum physics. Three main parts deal with path integrals in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, many-body physics and field theory and contain standard examples (quadratic Lagrangians, tunneling, description of bosons and fermions, quantization of gauge theories etc.) as well as specialized topics (scattering, dissipative systems, spin \& color in the path integral, lattice methods etc.). In each part simple Fortran programs which can be run on a PC, illustrate the numerical evaluation of (Euclidean) path integrals by Monte-Carlo or variational methods. Also included are the set of problems which accompanied the lectures and their solutions.
