We study the local structure of the vorticity field and the $\Lambda$ polarization in Au+Au collisions in the energy range $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 7.7-200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 2760 GeV using A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. We focus on the vorticity field arising from the non-uniform expansion of the fireball, which gives the circular structure of the transverse vorticity $\omega_{\perp}=(\omega_{x},\omega_{y})$ around the $z$-direction as well as the quadrupole pattern of the longitudinal vorticity $\omega_{z}$ in the transverse plane. As a consequence, the three components of the polarization vector $\mathbf{P}=(P_{x},P_{y},P_{z})$ for $\Lambda$ hyperons show harmonic behaviors as $\mathrm{sign}(Y)\sin\phi_{p}$, $-\mathrm{sign}(Y)\cos\phi_{p}$ and $-\sin(2\phi_{p})$, where $\phi_{p}$ and $Y$ are the azimuthal angle and rapidity in momentum space. These patterns of the local $\Lambda$ polarization are expected to be tested in future experiments.
