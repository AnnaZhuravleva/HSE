We investigate the electromagnetic contribution to the charge symmetry breaking in the $\Xi_{cc}$ baryon masses using a subtracted dispersion relation based on the Cottingham formula, following the formalism developed in an analysis of the octet baryon mass differences. In the absence of experimental information on the structure of charmed baryons, we use parameters for the electromagnetic structure of the $\Xi_{cc}$ and the difference in its charge states obtained from lattice QCD and estimates of SU(4) symmetry breaking. We report a conservative estimate for the mass splitting of the doubly charmed cascades to be 8 $\pm$ 9 MeV. While a smaller isospin splitting is compatible with this result, surprisingly it does not preclude the large splitting reported by the SELEX Collaboration. We identify those quantities which could be determined from lattice QCD and which would reduce the quoted theoretical uncertainty.
