The ratios of the in-medium to free nucleon structure functions for the unpolarized and polarized cases are obtained using the MIT bag model for the free case, along with the QMC model to incorporate the in-medium modifications of the structure functions. As discussed in earlier work, the observed nuclear EMC effect is reasonably well described. This gives us confidence to investigate the predictions of the model for the polarized EMC effect, the ratio $g_1^*(x)/g_1(x)$ for a bound proton to that of a free proton. This ratio is found to be substantially different from unity and very similar in shape and size to that found in the unpolarized case. This prediction of such a fundamental change in the valence structure of a bound nucleon needs to be tested experimentally at the earliest opportunity.
