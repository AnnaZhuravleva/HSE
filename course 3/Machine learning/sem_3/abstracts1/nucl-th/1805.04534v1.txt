We perform a simultaneous analysis of s- and p-waves of the $S=-1$ meson-baryon scattering amplitude using all low-energy experimental data. For the first time, differential cross section data are included for chiral unitary coupled-channel models. From this model s- and p-wave amplitudes are extracted and both well-known $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$ s-wave states as well as a new state in the p-wave are observed. While the latter passed multiple statistical and phenomenological robustness tests, its existence is at odds with Quark Model predictions and recent Lattice results. Possible explanations are discussed in this work.
