In this paper we use 1D quantum mechanical systems with Higgs-like interaction potential to study the emergence of topological objects at finite temperature. Two different model systems are studied, the standard double-well potential model and a newly introduced discrete kink model. Using Monte-Carlo simulations as well as analytic methods, we demonstrate how kinks become abundant at low temperatures. These results may shed useful insights on how topological phenomena may occur in QCD.
