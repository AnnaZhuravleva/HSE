A convenient framework for dealing with hadron structure and hadronic physics in the few-GeV energy range is relativistic quantum mechanics. Unlike relativistic quantum field theory, one deals with a fixed, or at least restricted number of degrees of freedom while maintaining relativistic invariance. For systems of interacting particles this is achieved by means of the, so called, "Bakamjian-Thomas construction", which is a systematic procedure for implementing interaction terms in the generators of the Poincare group such that their algebra is preserved. Doing relativistic quantum mechanics in this way one, however, faces a problem connected with the physical requirement of cluster separability as soon as one has more than two interacting particles. Cluster separability, or sometimes also termed "macroscopic causality", is the property that if a system is subdivided into subsystems which are then separated by a sufficiently large spacelike distance, these subsystems should behave independently. In the present contribution we discuss the problem of cluster separability and sketch the procedure to resolve it.
