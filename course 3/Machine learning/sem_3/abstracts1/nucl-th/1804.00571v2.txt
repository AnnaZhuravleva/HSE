Rapidity-dependent transverse momentum spectra of negatively charged pions measured at different rapidities in proton-proton collisions at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at various energies within its Beam Energy Scan (BES) program are investigated by using one- and two-component standard distributions where the chemical potential and spin property of particles are implemented. The rapidity spectra are described by a double-Gaussian distribution. At the stage of kinetic freeze-out, the event patterns are structured by the scatter plots in the three-dimensional subspaces of velocity, momentum and rapidity. The results of the studies of the rapidity-independent transverse mass spectra measured at mid-rapidity in proton-proton collisions are compared with those based on the similar transverse mass spectra measured in the most central beryllium-beryllium, argon-scandium and lead-lead collisions from the SPS at its BES energies.
