We treat the tensor correlation in antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) including large-relative-momentum components among nucleon pairs for finite nuclei. The tensor correlation is described by using large imaginary centroid vectors of Gaussian wave packets for nucleon pairs with opposite directions, which makes a large relative momentum. We superpose the AMD basis states, in which one nucleon pair has various relative momenta for all directions; this new method is called "high-momentum AMD" (HM-AMD). We show the results for $^4$He using the effective interaction having a strong tensor force. It is found that HM-AMD provides a large tensor matrix element comparable to the case of the tensor-optimized shell model (TOSM), in which the two-particle-two-hole (2p-2h) excitations are fully included to describe the tensor correlation. The results of two methods agree with each other at the level of the Hamiltonian components of $^4$He. This indicates that in HM-AMD the high-momentum components described by the imaginary centroid vectors of the nucleon pair provide the equivalent effect of the 2p-2h excitations for the tensor correlation.
