In this work, we study in detail the deconfinement phase transition that takes place in hot/dense nuclear matter in the context of neutron stars and proto-neutron stars (in which lepton fraction is fixed). The possibility of different mixtures of phases with different locally and globally conserved quantities is considered in each case. For this purpose, the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, an effective relativistic model that includes self-consistent chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement to quark matter, is employed. Finally, we compare our results with data provided by PQCD for different temperatures and conditions.
