We discuss the properties of baryons within the framework of the in-medium modified SU(3) Skyrme model. The modification is performed by a minimal way, the medium functionals in the SU(2) sector being introduced. These functionals are then related to nuclear matter properties near the saturation point. The modifications in the SU(3) sector are performed with the additional changes of kaon properties in nuclear matter. The results show that the properties of baryons in the strange sector are sensitive to the in-medium modifications of the kaon properties. The consistency of the in-medium modifications of hadron properties in the present approach with other model approaches and phenomenological indications is also discussed.
