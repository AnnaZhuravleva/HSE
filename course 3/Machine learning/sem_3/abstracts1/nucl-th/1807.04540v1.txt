This paper scrutinizes the dynamical QCD effects influence on mesons, namely, the mean-square root radius of a pion in the holographic light-front wave function setup, in the context of the AdS/QCD. The nuclear configurational entropy, associated to mesonic holographic light-front wave functions, is shown to have a critical point that optimizes the two parameters of the spin-improved light-front wave function. The mean-square root pion radius and its cross-section, computed upon these derived values, match the exact existing experimental data to the precision of 0.14\%, below the experimental error at the PDG.
