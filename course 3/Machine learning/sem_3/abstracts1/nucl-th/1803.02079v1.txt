The present work is a continuations of our previous paper [J.-G. Deng, et al., Chin. Phys. C, {\bf41}: 124109 (2017)]. In present work, the $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay half-life of unknown nucleus $^{296}$Og is predicted within the two-potential approach and the hindrance factors of all 20 even-even nuclei in the same region with $^{296}$Og, i.e. proton number $82<Z<126$ and neutron number $152<N<184$, from $^{250}$Cm to $^{294}$Og are extracted. The prediction is 1.09 ms within a factor of 5.12. In addition, based on the latest experimental data, a new set of parameters of $\mathcal{\alpha}$ decay hindrance factors for the even-even nuclei in this region considering the shell effect and proton-neutron interaction are obtained.
