Using a new approximate analytic parameter-free proxy-SU(3) scheme, we make predictions of shape observables for actinides and superheavy elements, namely beta and gamma deformation variables, and compare these with predictions by relativistic and non-relativistic mean-field theories. Furthermore, we make predictions for B(E2) transition rates of deformed nuclei and compare these with existing data and predictions of other theoretical approaches.
