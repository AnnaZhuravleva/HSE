Medium modification of the magnetic moments of octet baryons in the isospin asymmetric nuclear medium at finite temperature has been calculated using medium modified quark and baryon masses derived in chiral SU(3) quark mean field model. The magnetic moments of baryons are found to vary significantly as a function of density of nuclear medium as well as with the increase in isospin asymmetry of the medium. The rise of temperature is found to decrease the effect of isospin asymmetry on masses and magnetic moments of baryons. The results of present investigation may be helpful to understand the experimentally observed values of octet baryon magnetic moments at different experimental facilities. % for example, BASE at CERN and TAPS at MAMI etc. %At given temperature and density of medium, the magnetic moments are found to increase with the rise of isospin asymmetry of the medium, with exception of magnetic moments of $\Sigma^+$ and $\Sigma^0$. However, the magnetic moments are found to decrease in pure neutron matter as compared to the case of highly asymmetric matter. This is due to increased compressibility of pure neutron matter as compared to asymmetric nuclear matter.
