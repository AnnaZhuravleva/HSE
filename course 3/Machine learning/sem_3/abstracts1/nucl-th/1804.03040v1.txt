The zero-temperature limit in perturbative statistical mechanics for many-fermion systems is investigated. It is shown that this leads to the consideration of a different reference Hamiltonian, or more precisely, a different self-consistent mean-field, at each order in many-body perturbation theory. The corresponding perturbation series satisfies at each order and for all temperatures the thermodynamical relations associated with Landau Fermi-liquid theory. The associated reference single-particle energy spectra however are in general inconsistent with the dynamical aspects of Fermi-liquid theory. Nevertheless, it may be argued that this particular perturbation series is, in a sense, the proper one for numerical calculations of thermodynamic potentials.
