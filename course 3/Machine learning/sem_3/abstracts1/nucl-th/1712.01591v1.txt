The mixture of quark and gluon fluids is studied in a one-dimensional boost-invariant setup using the set of relativistic kinetic equations treated in the relaxation time approximation. Effects of a finite quark mass, non-zero baryon number density, and quantum statistics are discussed. Comparisons between the exact kinetic-theory results and anisotropic hydrodynamics predictions are performed and a very good agreement between the two are found.
