Theoretical investigation of two-proton halo-nucleus 17Ne has revealed that the valence protons are more likely to be positioned in the d-state than the s-state. In this study, this finding is clarified by calculation of the binding energy, it is found that the theoretical values for the d-state are closer to the experimental values, in contrast with those obtained for the s-state. The three-body model and MATLAB software are utilised to obtain theoretical values for the three-body-model 17Ne binding energy and matter radius. 17Ne has halo properties of a weakly bound valence proton, a binding energy of less than 1 MeV, and a large matter radius. The core deformation parameter has zero and negative values; thus, the 17Ne core exhibits both spherical and oblate shapes depending on the binding energy of the three-body system. This suggests 17Ne has two-proton halo.
