The $S_{E1}$-factor of radiative $\alpha$-capture on $^{12}$C is studied in effective field theory. We discuss a modification of the counting rules for the radiative capture amplitudes and find two unfixed parameters remained in the amplitudes. Those two parameters are fitted to the experimental $S_{E1}$ data, and an $S_{E1}$ factor is obtained at the Gamow-peak energy as $S_{E1}=86\pm 4$~keV$\cdot$b. We find that our result is in good agreement with previous estimates reported recently. We also discuss the uncertainty of the estimate in the present approach.
