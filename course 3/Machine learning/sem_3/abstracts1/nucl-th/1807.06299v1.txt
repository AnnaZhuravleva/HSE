We carry out simulations using A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model to describe the observed flow signatures in the $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions. Especially, we calculate the flow fluctuations of $v_2$ in terms of cumulant ratios and the standardized skewness. Based on event-by-event AMPT simulations, we study the linear and cubic response relation between $v_2$ and $\varepsilon_2$. We found that the observed response relation is compatible to what has been noticed in hydrodynamic modelings, with similar dependence on shear viscosity. Besides, this response relation is not sensitive to non-flow effect.
