The spatial structure of $^{14}$N nucleus is studied within a five-particle model (three $\alpha$-particles plus two nucleons). Using the variational approach with Gaussian bases, the ground-state energy and wave function are calculated for this five-particle system. Two spatial configurations in the ground-state wave function are revealed. The density distributions, pair correlation functions, and the momentum distributions of particles are analyzed and compared with those of the mirror nuclei $^{14}$C and $^{14}$O.
