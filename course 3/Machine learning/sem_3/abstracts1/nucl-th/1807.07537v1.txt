We analyze the breakup of the one-neutron halo nucleus $^{11}$Be measured at 520 MeV/nucleon at GSI on Pb and C targets within an eikonal description of the reaction including a proper treatment of special relativity. The Coulomb term of the projectile-target interaction is corrected at first order, while its nuclear part is described at the optical limit approximation. Excellent agreement with the data is obtained using a description of $^{11}$Be, which fits the breakup data of RIKEN. This solves the apparent discrepancy between the $dB({\rm E1})/dE$ estimations from GSI and RIKEN for this nucleus.
