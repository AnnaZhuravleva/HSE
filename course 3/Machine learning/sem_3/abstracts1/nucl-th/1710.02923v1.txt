Single-particle resonances are crucial for exotic nuclei near and beyond the drip lines. Since the majority of nuclei are deformed, the interplay between deformation and orbital structure near threshold becomes very important and can lead to improved descriptions of exotic nuclei. In this work, the Green's function (GF) method that can treat the single-particle bound and resonant states on the same footing is applied to solve the coupled-channel Dirac equation with a quadrupole-deformed Woods-Saxon potential for the first time. Detailed formalism for the partial-wave expansion of Green's function is presented. Numerical checks are carried out by comparing with our previous implementation of spherical GF method and the results from the deformed analytical continuation of the coupling constant (ACCC) and scattering phase shift (SPS) methods. Finally, Nilsson levels for bound and resonant orbitals in a halo candidate nucleus $^{37}$Mg from the deformed GF method are calculated over a wide range of deformations and show some decisive hints of $p$-wave halo formation in this nucleus, namely, crossing between the configurations $1/2[321]$ and $5/2[312]$ at deformation parameter $\beta>0.5$ may enhance the probability to occupy the $1/2[321]$ orbital coming from $2p_{3/2}$.
