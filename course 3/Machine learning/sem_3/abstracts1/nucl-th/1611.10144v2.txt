We use an improved version of the SU(3) flavour parity-doublet quark-hadron model to investigate the higher order baryon number susceptibilities near the chiral and the nuclear liquid-gas transitions. The parity-doublet model has been improved by adding higher-order interaction terms of the scalar fields in the effective mean field Lagrangian, resulting in a much-improved description of nuclear ground-state properties, in particular the nuclear compressibility. The resulting phase diagram of the model agrees qualitatively with expectations from lattice QCD, i.e., it shows a crossover at zero net baryo-chemical potential and a critical point at finite density. Using this model, we investigate the dependence of the higher-order baryon number susceptibilities as function of temperature and chemical potential. We observe a strong interplay between the chiral and liquid-gas transition at intermediate baryo chemical potentials. Due to this interplay between the chiral and the nuclear liquid-gas transitions, the experimentally measured cumulants of the net baryon number may show very different beam energy dependence, subject to the actual freeze-out temperature.
