Within the framework of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model along with the GEMINI model, the reaction of $^{86}$Kr+$^{181}$Ta at 80,120 and 160 MeV/nucleon and the reaction of $^{78}$Kr+$^{181}$Ta at 160 MeV/nucleon are studied, and the production cross sections of the generated fragments are calculated. More intermediate and large mass fragments can be produced in the reaction with a large range of impact parameter. The production cross sections of nuclei such as the isotopes of Si and P generally decrease with the increasing incident energy. The isotopes near the neutron drip line are produced more in the neutron-rich system $^{86}$Kr+$^{181}$Ta.
