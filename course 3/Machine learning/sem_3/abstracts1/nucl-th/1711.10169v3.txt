Finite size consideration of matter significantly affects transport coefficients like shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, electrical conductivity, which we have investigated here in the framework of the Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Owing to the basic quantum mechanics, a non-zero lower momentum cut-off is implemented in momentum integrations, used in the expressions of constituent quark masses and transport coefficients. When the system size decreases, the values of these trans- port coefficients are enhanced in low temperature range. At high temperature domain, shear viscos- ity and electrical conductivity become independent of system sizes. Whereas, bulk viscosity, which is associated with scale violating quantities of the system, faces some non-trivial size dependence in this regime. In the phenomenological direction, our microscopic estimations can also be linked with the macroscopic outcome, based on dissipative hydrodynamical simulation.
