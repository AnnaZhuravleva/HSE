In this study, we reveal the difference between Woods-Saxon (WS) and Generalized Symmetric Woods-Saxon (GSWS) potentials in order to describe the physical properties of a nucleon, by means of solving Schr\"odinger eq. for the two potentials. The additional term squeezes the WS potential well, which leads an upward shift in the spectrum, resulting in a more realistic picture. The resulting GSWS potential does not merely accommodate extra quasi bound states, but also has modified bound state spectrum. As an application, we apply the formalism to a real problem, an $\alpha$ particle confined in Bohrium-$270$ nucleus. The thermodynamic functions Helmholtz energy, entropy, internal energy, specific heat of the system are calculated and compared for both wells. The internal energy and the specific heat capacity increase as a result of upward shift in the spectrum. The shift of the Helmholtz free energy is a direct consequence of the shift of the spectrum. The entropy decreases because of a decrement in the number of available states.
