Pairing plays an essential role in describing nuclear spectra and attempts to describe it has a long history in nuclear physics. Many theoretical tools were developed to treat the pairing problem either exactly or at various levels of approximation. In this contribution to the proceedings of a conference honoring the career of Taka Otsuka, recent developments in the exact solutions of the pairing problem are described.
