We show that the commonly used criterion for beta equilibrium in neutrino-transparent nuclear matter becomes invalid as temperatures rise above 1 MeV. Such temperatures are attained in neutron star mergers. By numerically computing the relevant weak interaction rates we find that the correct criterion for beta equilibrium requires an isospin chemical potential that can be as large as 30 MeV.
