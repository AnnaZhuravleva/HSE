We study the mechanism of the weak decay process of Xi_b^0 into D^0 with a meson-baryon pair. It is shown that the dominant component of the prompt weak decay produces the meson-baryon pair with the spectator strange quark being transferred to the baryon, so that the Kbar N channel is absent. Subsequent final state interaction then reflects the pi Sigma originated Lambda(1405) formation amplitude, which has been difficult to access in previous experimental studies. We predict the lineshapes of the pi Sigma invariant mass distribution using a realistic chiral meson-baryon amplitude for the final state interaction. It is shown that the interference between the direct and the rescattering contributions can strongly distort the peak structure of the Lambda(1405) in the mass distribution. This indicates the necessity of a detailed investigation of the reaction mechanism in order to extract the Lambda(1405) property in the pi Sigma mass distribution.
