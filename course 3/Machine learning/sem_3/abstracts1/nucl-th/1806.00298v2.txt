Using adiabatic distorted-wave approximation (ADWA) with nonlocal optical potentials (NLOP) for $(d,p)$ transfer reactions [G.W. Bailey, N.K. Timofeyuk, and J.A. Tostevin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 162502 (2016)] reported strong sensitivity to the $n$-$p$ force model. This sensitivity disappears in rigorous three-body Faddeev-type results. Some shortcomings of ADWA with NLOP are pointed out.
