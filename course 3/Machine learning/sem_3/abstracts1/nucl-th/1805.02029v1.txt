We study systems of bosons and fermions in finite periodic boxes and show how the existence and properties of few-body resonances can be extracted from studying the volume dependence of the calculated energy spectra. Using a plane-wave-based discrete variable representation to conveniently implement periodic boundary conditions, we establish that avoided level crossings occur in the spectra of up to four particles and can be linked to the existence of multi-body resonances. To benchmark our method we use two-body calculations, where resonance properties can be determined with other methods, as well as a three-boson model interaction known to generate a three-boson resonance state. Finding good agreement for these cases, we then predict three-body and four-body resonances for models using a shifted Gaussian potential. Our results establish few-body finite-volume calculations as a new tool to study few-body resonances. In particular, the approach can be used to study few-neutron systems, where such states have been conjectured to exist.
