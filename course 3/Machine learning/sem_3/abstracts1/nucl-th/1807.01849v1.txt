Isospin relaxation times characterizing isospin transport processes between the projectile and the target with different $N/Z$ ratios and that between the neck and the spectator with different isospin asymmetries and densities in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions are studied within an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model using the lattice Hamiltonian approach. The respective roles and time scales of the isospin diffusion and drift as the major mechanisms of isospin transport in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions are discussed. Effects of nuclear symmetry energy and neutron-proton effective mass splitting on the isospin relaxation times are examined.
