Quasielastic neutrino scattering is an important aspect of the experimental program to study fundamental neutrino properties including neutrino masses, mixing angles, the mass hierarchy and CP-violating phase. Proper interpretation of the experiments requires reliable theoretical calculations of neutrino-nucleus scattering. In this paper we present calculations of response functions and cross sections by neutral-current scattering of neutrinos off $^{12}$C. These calculations are based on realistic treatments of nuclear interactions and currents, the latter including the axial-, vector-, and vector-axial interference terms crucial for determining the difference between neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering and the CP-violating phase. We find that the strength and energy-dependence of two-nucleon processes induced by correlation effects and interaction currents are crucial in providing the most accurate description of neutrino-nucleus scattering in the quasielastic regime.
