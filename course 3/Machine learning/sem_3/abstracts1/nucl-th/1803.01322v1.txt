The present paper is written in response to the comment of M. R. Hadizadeh et. al on our original paper "Solution of the Specific Model of Five-body Problem to Investigate the Effective Alpha-Nucleon Interaction in a Partial-Wave analysis" [Acta Physica Polonica B, 48, 1279 (2017)]. In this paper we present our clarifications and statements on the authors of the comment arguments about of the accuracy of the procedure in solution of simple five- and four-body problems. In this regard our arguments turn out to be very efficient mainly discussed from the authors misunderstanding of the issues discussed in the original paper. In fact, the authors of the comment aims to exaggeratedly show that our paper is entirely incorrect, but our following statements prove that the authors of the comment statements are inimical and often inconsequential.
