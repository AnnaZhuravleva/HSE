A hybrid (hydrodynamics + hadronic transport) theoretical framework is assembled to model the bulk dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at energies accessible in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN. The system's energy-momentum tensor and net baryon current are evolved according to relativistic hydrodynamics with finite shear viscosity and non-zero net baryon diffusion. Our hydrodynamic description is matched to a hadronic transport model in the dilute region. With this fully integrated theoretical framework, we present a pilot study of the hadronic chemistry, particle spectra, and anisotropic flow. Phenomenological effects of a non-zero net-baryon current and its diffusion on hadronic observables are presented for the first time. The importance of the hadronic transport phase is also investigated.
