Relativistic non-ideal fluid dynamics is formulated in 3+1 space--time dimensions. The equations governing dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics are given in terms of the time and the 3-space quantities which correspond to those familiar from non-relativistic physics. Dissipation is accounted for by applying the causal theory of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. As a special case we consider a fluid without viscous/heat couplings in the causal system of transport/relaxation equations. For the study of physical systems we consider pure (1+1)-dimensional expansion in planar geometry, (1+1)-dimensional spherically symmetric ({\em fireball}) expansion, (1+1)-dimensional cylindrically symmetric expansion and a (2+1)-dimensional expansion with cylindrical symmetry in the transverse plane ({\em firebarell} expansion). The transport/relaxation equations are given in terms of the spatial components of the dissipative fluxes, since these are not independent. The choice for the independent components is analogous to the non-relativistic equations.
