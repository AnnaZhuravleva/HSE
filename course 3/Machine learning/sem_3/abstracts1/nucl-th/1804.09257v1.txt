We investigate the production of direct photons in heavy ion collisions within the modified bottom-up thermalization scenario, which we show to be related to the thermalizing Glasma framework. The dynamics of the parton system up to thermalization/equilibration can be described by two momentum scales, by means of which we express the photon invariant yield excluding the prompt pQCD contribution. We derive an analytic formula, which provides an estimate of photon production from thermalizing matter for a wide range of collision systems and energies. We compare the yield with that measured in the PHENIX Au+Au run04 and the combined run07+run10 data sets at root-s = 200GeV. We also make theory-data comparisons for Pb+Pb at 2760 GeV and d+Au at 200 GeV collision energies. Finally, we make predictions for the direct photon invariant yield from collisions of U+U, Cu+Au, $^3$He+Au at 200 GeV and Pb+Pb at 5020 GeV.
