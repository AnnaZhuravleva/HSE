We review recent results for electromagnetic reactions and related sum rules in light and medium-mass nuclei obtained from coupled-cluster theory. In particular, we highlight our recent computations of the photodisintegration cross section of 40Ca and of the electric dipole polarizability for oxygen and calcium isotopes. We also provide new results for the Coulomb sum rule for 4He and 16O. For 4He we perform a thorough comparison of coupled-cluster theory with exact hyperspherical harmonics.
