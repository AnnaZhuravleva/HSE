Two-proton radioactivity with 2p halo is reported theoretically in light mass nuclei A $=$ 18-34. We predict $^{19}$Mg, $^{22}$Si, $^{26}$S, $^{30}$Ar and $^{34}$Ca as promising candidates of ground state 2p-radioactivity with S$_{2p}$ $<$ 0 and S$_{p}$ $>$ 0. Observation of extended tail of spatial charge density distribution, larger charge radius and study of proton single particle states, Fermi energy and the wave functions indicate 2p halo like structure which supports direct 2p emission. The Coulomb and centrifugal barriers in experimentally identified 2p unbound $^{22}$Si show a quasi-bound state that ensures enough life time for such experimental probes. Our predictions are in good accord with experimental and other theoretical data available so far.
