The Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) can provide important information concerning nuclear shapes. This is in keeping with the fact that the centroid of the GDR can be parametrized as $\hbar \omega_{GDR} \approx 100 \textrm{MeV}/(R_0)_{\textrm{fm}}$, where $R_0$ is the nuclear radius $R_0 = 1.2 A^{1/3}$ fm, while $(R_0)_{\textrm{fm}}$ is the dimensionless quantity $1.2 A^{1/3}$. For prolate nuclei, $R_{\parallel} = R_0(1+0.28 \beta_2)$ and $R_{\bot}=R_0 (1-0.14 \beta_2)$ are the radii along the symmetry axis and in a plane perpendicular to it, at the equator, $\beta_2$ being the quadrupole deformation parameter. As a consequence, the line shape of the GDR displays, in these nuclei, two peaks. An unexpected mode characterized by the same spin and parity but much lower in energy ($\lesssim 1$ MeV) has been observed in light halo nuclei displaying large neutron excess and parity inversion. It clearly constitutes a new elementary mode of excitation rightly deserving a specific name. Possibly that of dipole pygmy resonance, testifying to the pervasive interplay between the antenna--like collective modes in nuclei and nuclear shapes, this last word broadly understood to also encompass (extremely large) "isotropic radial deformations" which e.g. in the case of $^{11}$Li and parametrizing $R=R_0 (1 + \beta_0 Y_{00})$ leads to $\beta_0 = 2.5$. Pygmy resonances like that observed in $^{11}$Li can, in principle, also exist on top of excited (halo) states. Their systematic investigation will likely open a new chapter in the probing of the Axel--Brink hypothesis: its state dependence.
