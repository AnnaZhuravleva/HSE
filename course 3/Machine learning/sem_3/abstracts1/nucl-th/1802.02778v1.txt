The deuteron wave function can be presented as the table through the respective massifs of numerically values of radial wave functions. In calculations such arrays of numbers in the texts of programs to operate quite difficult. Therefore a used simpler analytical forms is expedient. In the received analytical forms of deuteron wave function in coordinate representation it is necessary to calculate density distribution in the deuteron and transition density and compare them among themselves. On the received coefficients of the four analytical forms for deuteron wave function for the nucleon-nucleon potential Reid93 are calculated density distribution and transition density. For comparison, similar results are given for Moscow potential. Such calculations help to evaluate the correctness of the choice of the analytical form for approximation of the wave function, and also to obtain information about such characteristics of the deuteron as charge form factor, tensor polarization and momentum distribution.
