Halo nuclei projectiles can undergo into a fragmentation process when scattered by a nucleus target. The corresponding core from exotic nuclei is usually observed while the others fragments of the reaction are not. We use the recently proposed theory by [Phys. Lett. B767, 53 (2017)] with a four-body description of the inclusive breakup reaction where the projectile is 20C described like a two-neutron halo nucleus. The momentum of both neutrons are integrated out giving a generic description of the core angular distribution. In this preliminary study we perform an analysis of the inclusive inelastic breakup cross-section using the eikonal approximation for the distorted wave function of the projectile. A study of the inclusive inelastic cross-sections of 20C from the collision with different targets are presented.
