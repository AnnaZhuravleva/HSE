A separable form of the Gogny pairing force is implemented in tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theory for the description of rotational bands in open shell nuclei. The developed method is used to investigate the yrast sequence of 109Ag for an example. The experimental energy spectrum, angular momenta, and electromagnetic transition probabilities are well reproduced by taking into account pairing correlations with the separable pairing force. An abrupt transition of the rotational axis from the long-intermediate plane to the long-short one is obtained and discussed in detail.
