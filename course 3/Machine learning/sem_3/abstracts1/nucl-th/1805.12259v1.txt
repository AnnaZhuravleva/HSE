We study the dominant forbidden transitions in the antineutrino spectra of the fission actinides from 4 MeV onwards using the nuclear shell model. Through explicit calculation of the shape factor, taking into account Coulomb corrections, we show the expected changes on cumulative electron and antineutrino spectra. Compared to the usual allowed approximation this results in a minor decrease of electron spectra from 4 MeV and onwards, whereas an increase of several percent is observed in antineutrino spectra. We show that, despite their limited number, forbidden transitions dominate the spectral flux for most of the experimentally accessible range. Based on the shell model calculations we attempt a parametrization of forbidden transitions and propose a spectral correction from all forbidden transitions. When compared against modern reactor neutrino experiments, the resultant spectral change is observed to be of similar magnitude and shape as the reported spectral shoulder, drastically decreasing its statistical significance. Compared to the Huber-Mueller approach, changes are much more severe in both electron and antineutrino spectra. The change in the theoretically predicted integrated count rate of the latter is a decrease of the order of 5%, i.e. of similar magnitude as the observed reactor anomaly. Forbidden transitions are thus shown to be an essential ingredient in both the reactor anomaly and spectral shoulder.
