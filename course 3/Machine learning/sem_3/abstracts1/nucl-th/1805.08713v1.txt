We investigate meson and nucleon dynamics at finite baryon density and temperature by coupling the nucleon field and the omega meson to the three-flavor linear sigma model and calculate hadronic properties around the nuclear liquid-gas transition. We apply the Functional Renormalization Group method, and find that mesonic fluctuations increase the strength of the coefficient of the $U_A(1)$ breaking determinant operator as a function of the chiral condensate. As a consequence, we find that the actual value of the anomaly increases discontinuously at the first order nuclear liquid-gas transition. We calculate how mesonic masses and partial restoration of chiral symmetry are modified due to such an effect.
