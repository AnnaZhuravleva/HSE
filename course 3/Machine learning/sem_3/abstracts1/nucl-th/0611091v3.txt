In the causal theory of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics, there are conditions on the equation of state and other thermodynamic properties such as the second-order coefficients of a fluid that need to be satisfied to guarantee that the fluid perturbations propagate causally and obey hyperbolic equations. The second-order coefficients in the causal theory, which are the relaxation times for the dissipative degrees of freedom and coupling constants between different forms of dissipation (relaxation lengths), are presented for partonic and hadronic systems. These coefficients involves relativistic thermodynamic integrals. The integrals are presented for general case and also for different regimes in the temperature--chemical potential plane. It is shown that for a given equation of state these second-order coefficients are not additional parameters but they are determined by the equation of state. We also present the prescription on the calculation of the freeze-out particle spectra from the dynamics of relativistic non-ideal fluids.
