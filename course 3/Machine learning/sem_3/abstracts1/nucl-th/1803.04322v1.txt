The medium modifications of the masses of the charmonium states (J/$\psi$, $\psi$(3686) and $\psi$(3770)) in asymmetric nuclear matter in the presence of strong magnetic fields are studied using an effective chiral model. The mass modifications arise due to medium modifications of the scalar dilaton field, which simulates the gluon condensates of QCD within the effective hadronic model. The effects due to the magnetic field as well as isospin asymmetry are observed to be appreciable at high densities for the charmonium states, which can have consequences, e,g, in the production of the open charm mesons and the charmonium states, in the asymmetric heavy ion collisions at the compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiments at the future facility at GSI. The presence of magnetic field leads to Landau quantization of the energy levels of the proton in the asymmetric nuclear matter. The effects of the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and neutron on the masses of the charmonium states are studied and are observed to lead to larger masses of the charmonium states, as compared to when these effects are not taken into account.
