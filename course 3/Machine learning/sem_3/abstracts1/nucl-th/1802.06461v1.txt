Octupole deformed shapes in neutron-rich actinides and superheavy nuclei as well as extremely deformed shapes of the N~Z light nuclei have been investigated within the framework of covariant density functional theory. We confirmed the presence of new region of octupole deformation in neutron-rich actinides with the center around Z~96, N~196 but our calculations do not predict octupole deformation in the ground states of superheavy Z~108 nuclei. As exemplified by the study of 36Ar, the nodal structure of the wavefunction of occupied single-particle orbitals in extremely deformed structures allows to understand the formation of the alpha-clusters in very light nuclei, the suppression of the alpha-clusterization with the increase of mass number, the formation of ellipsoidal mean-field type structures and nuclear molecules.
