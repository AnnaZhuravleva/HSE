Apart from the $pd$ reaction also the scattering of antiprotons with transversal polarization $p_y^p$ on deuterons with tensor polarization $P_{xz}$ provides a null-test signal for time-reversal-invariance violating but parity conserving effects. Assuming that the time-reversal-invariance violating $\bar NN$ interaction contains the same operator structure as the $NN$ interaction, we discuss the energy dependence of the null-test signal in $\bar pd$ scattering on the basis of a calculation within the spin-dependent Glauber theory at beam energies of 50-300 MeV.
