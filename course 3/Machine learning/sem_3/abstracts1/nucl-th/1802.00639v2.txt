Electron scattering methods, involving nucleus which have little or no intrinsic deformation suggest nucleon distribution to be of Fermi type. This distribution is further parameterised as Wood Saxon (WS) distribution, where an uniform charge density with smoothed-out surface have been implemented. Incorporating shape modification in WS, earlier attempts were made to explain observables in deformed nuclear collisions, such as charged particle multiplicity. In this work, we use an alternate approach known as Nilsson model or Modified Harmonic Oscillator (MHO), to explain charged particle multiplicity in U+U collisions at top RHIC energy. We have implemented the formalism in HIJING model and we found that the model describes the experimental data to an extent.
