A wealth of data on charmonium production in Pb-Pb collisions from the LHC experiments has provided strong evidence for (re-)generation as a dominant production mechanism at low transverse momentum. We present an important extension of the statistical hadronisation model to describe $\rm{J}/\psi$ transverse momentum distributions based on input parameters from hydrodynamical simulations. Comparison to the data allows the testing of the degree of thermalisation of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma. To this end we will report analyses of the $\rm{J}/\psi$ transverse momentum spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ and $5.02$ TeV.
