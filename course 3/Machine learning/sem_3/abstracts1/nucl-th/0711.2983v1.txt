We discuss correlations in azimuthal angle as well as correlations in two-dimensional space of transverse momenta of two jets as well as photon and jet. Some $k_t$-factorization subprocesses are included for the first time in the literature. Different unintegrated gluon/parton distributions are used in the $k_t$-factorization approach. The results depend on UGDF/UPDF used. The collinear NLO $2 \to 3$ contributions dominate over $k_t$-factorization cross section at small relative azimuthal angles as well as for asymmetric transverse momentum configurations.
