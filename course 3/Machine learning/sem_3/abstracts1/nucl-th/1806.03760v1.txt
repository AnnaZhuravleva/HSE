We examine the effects of the isovector-vector coupling and hypercharge-vector coupling in quark matter on hadron-quark coexistence in neutron star matter. The relativistic mean field theory with the TM1 parameter set and an extended TM1 parameter set are used to describe hadronic matter, and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with scalar, isoscalar-vector, isovector-vector and hypercharge- vector couplings is used to describe deconfined quark matter. The hadron-quark phase transition is constructed via the Gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium. The isovector-vector and hypercharge- vector couplings in quark matter enhance the symmetry energy and hypercharge symmetry energy in neutron star matter, while their effects are found to be suppressed at high densities by the strange quarks. As a result, the hadron-quark mixed phase shrinks with only isovector-vector coupling and moves to higher density with isovector-vector and hypercharge-vector couplings. The maximum mass of neutron star increases slightly with isovector-vector and hypercharge-vector couplings.
