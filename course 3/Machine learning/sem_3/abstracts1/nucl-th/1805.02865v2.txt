The low-lying structure of neutron-rich odd-mass Kr isotopes is studied within the interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM) based on the Gogny-D1M energy density functional (EDF). The $(\beta,\gamma)$-deformation energy surfaces, spherical single-particle energies and occupation probabilities of the odd-mass systems are obtained using the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. Those quantities are used as a microscopic input to determine most of the parameters of the IBFM Hamiltonian. The remaining parameters are specifically tailored to the experimental spectrum for each of the studied odd-mass nuclei. A gradual structural evolution is predicted for the odd-mass isotopes $^{87-95}$Kr as a function of the nucleon number which, agrees well with the gradual growth of collectivity observed experimentally in the neighboring even-even isotopes.
