We analyzed the total kinetic energy (TKE) of fission fragments with three-dimensional Langevin calculations for a series of actinides and Fm isotopes at various excitation energies. This allowed us to establish systematic trends of TKE with $Z^2/A^{1/3}$ of the fissioning system and as a function of excitation energy. In the mass-energy distributions of fission fragments we see the contributions from the standard, super-long, and super-short (in the case of $^{258}$Fm) fission modes. For the fission fragments mass distribution of $^{258}$Fm we obtained a single peak mass distribution. The decomposition of TKE into the prescission kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion showed that decrease of TKE with growing excitation energy is accompanied by a decrease of prescission kinetic energy. It was also found that transport coefficients (friction and inertia tensors) calculated by a microscopic model and by macroscopic models give drastically different behavior of TKE as a function of excitation energy. The results obtained with microscopic transport coefficients are much closer to experimental data than those calculated with macroscopic ones.
