The challenging nuclear many-body problem is discussed along with classifications and qualitative descriptions of existing methods and models. We present detailed derivations of a new method where cluster correlations co-exist with an underlying mean-field described core-structure. The variation of an antisymmetrized product of cluster and core wave functions and a given nuclear interaction, provide sets of self-consistent equations of motion.   After the applications on dripline nuclei we discuss perspectives with improvements and applications. In the conclusion we summarize while emphasizing the merits of consistently treating both short- and large-distance properties, few- and many-body correlations, ordinary nuclear structure, and concepts of halos and Efimov states.
