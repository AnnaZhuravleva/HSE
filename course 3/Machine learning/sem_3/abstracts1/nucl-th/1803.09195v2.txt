In this work, with restored isospin symmetry, we evaluated the neutrinoless double beta decay nuclear matrix elements for $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, $^{136}$Xe and $^{150}$Nd for both the light and heavy neutrino mass mechanisms using the deformed QRPA approach with realistic forces. We give detailed decompositions of the nuclear matrix elements over different intermediate states and nucleon pairs, and discuss how these decompositions are affected by the model space truncations. Compared to the spherical calculations, our results show reductions from $30\%$ to about $60\%$ of the nuclear matrix elements for the calculated isotopes mainly due to the presence of BCS overlap factor between the initial and final ground states. The comparison between different nucleon-nucleon forces with corresponding Short-Range-Correlations (src) shows, that the choice of the NN force gives roughly $20\%$ deviations for light exchange neutrino mechanism and much larger deviations for the heavy neutrino exchange mechanism.
