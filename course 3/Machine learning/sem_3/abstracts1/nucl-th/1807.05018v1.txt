We introduce the quantum-field-theory (QFT) derivation of chiral kinetic theory (CKT) from the Wigner-function approach, which manifests side jumps and non-scalar distribution functions associated with Lorentz covariance and incorporates both background fields and collisions. The formalism is utilized to investigate second-order responses of chiral fluids near local equilibrium. Such non-equilibrium anomalous transport is dissipative and affected by interactions. Contributions from both quantum corrections in anomalous hydrodynamic equations (EOM) of motion and those from the CKT and Wigner functions (WF) are considered in a relaxation-time approximation (RTA). Anomalous charged Hall currents engendered by background electric fields and temperature/chemical-potential gradients are obtained. Furthermore, chiral magnetic/vortical effects (CME/CVE) receive viscous corrections as non-equilibrium modifications stemming from the interplay between side jumps, magnetic-moment coupling, and chiral anomaly.
