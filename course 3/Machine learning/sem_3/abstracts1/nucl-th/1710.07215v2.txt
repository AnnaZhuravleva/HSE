The nuclear force is the heart of nuclear physics and, thus, the significance of this force for all of nuclear physics can hardly be overstated. Research on this crucial force has by now spanned eight decades and we are still not done.   I will first review the rich history of hope and desperation, which had spin-off far beyond just nuclear physics. Next, I will present the current status in the field which is charcterized by the application of an effective field theory (EFT) that is believed to represent QCD in the low energy regime typical for nuclear physics. During the past two decades, this EFT has become the favorite vehicle to derive nuclear two- and many-body forces. Finally, I will take a look into the future: What developments can we expect from the next decades? Will the 30-year cycles of new and "better" ideas for efficiently describing nuclear forces go on for ever, or is there hope for closure?
