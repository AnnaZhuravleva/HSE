The Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas N-body theory is used to study interaction of eta-mesons with d, 3He, and 4He. Separable expansion of the subamplitudes is adopted to convert the integral equations into the quasi-two-body form. The resulting formalism is applied to fit the existing data for low-energy eta production on few-nucleon targets. On the basis of this fitting procedure the scattering lengths a_{eta d}, a_{eta 3He}, a_{eta 4He} as well as the subthreshold behaviour of the elementary eta-N scattering amplitude are obtained.
