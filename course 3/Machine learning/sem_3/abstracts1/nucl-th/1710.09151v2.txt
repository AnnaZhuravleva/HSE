The long standing problem of neutron-proton pairing correlations is revisited by employing the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov formalism with neutron-proton mixing in both the particle-hole and particle-hole channels. We compare numerical calculations performed within this method with an exact pairing model based on the $SO(8)$ algebra. The neutron-proton mixing is included in our calculations by performing rotations in the isospin space using the isocranking technique.
