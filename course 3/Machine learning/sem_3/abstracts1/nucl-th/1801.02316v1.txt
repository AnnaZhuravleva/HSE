At the early stage of heavy ion collisions, non-trivial topologies of the gauge fields can be created resulting in an imbalance of axial charge density and eventually separation of electric charges along the direction of the magnetic field produced in such collisions. This process is called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). In this work we implement such a charge separation at the partonic level in AMPT for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt s=200$ GeV to study its consequence on experimental observables. We present the effects on the pion elliptic flow ($v_2$) and the charged particle Balance Function (BF) for varying strengths of initial charge separation. We find that the shape of the balance function is sensitive to the increasing charge separation. The $v_2$ of pion shows a strong decreasing trend at higher transverse momentum($p_T$) with increasing charge separation.
