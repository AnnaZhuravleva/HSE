Five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian based on the covariant density functional theory has been applied to study the the low-lying states of even-even $^{148-162}$Gd isotopes. The shape evolution from $^{148}$Gd to $^{162}$Gd is presented. The experimental energy spectra and intraband $B(E2)$ transition probabilities for the $^{148-162}$Gd isotopes are reproduced by the present calculations. The relative $B(E2)$ ratios in present calculations are also compared with the available interacting boson model results and experimental data. It is found that the occupations of neutron $1i_{13/2}$ orbital result in the well-deformed prolate shape, and are essential for Gd isotopes.
