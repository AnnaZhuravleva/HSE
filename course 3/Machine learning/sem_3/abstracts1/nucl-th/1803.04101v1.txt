Nuclear structure and reaction theory is undergoing a major renaissance with advances in many-body methods, strong interactions with greatly improved links to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the advent of high performance computing, and improved computational algorithms. Predictive power, with well-quantified uncertainty, is emerging from non-perturbative approaches along with the potential for guiding experiments to new discoveries. We present an overview of some of our recent developments and discuss challenges that lie ahead. Our foci include: (1) strong interactions derived from chiral effective field theory; (2) advances in solving the large sparse matrix eigenvalue problem on leadership-class supercomputers; (3) selected observables in light nuclei with the JISP16 interaction; (4) effective electroweak operators consistent with the Hamiltonian; and, (5) discussion of A=48 system as an opportunity for the no-core approach with the reintroduction of the core.
