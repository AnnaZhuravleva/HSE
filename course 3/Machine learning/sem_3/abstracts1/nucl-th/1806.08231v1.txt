The pre-scission particle multiplicities suggest a lifetime of 10 20 s for the nuclear fission to occur which is in contrast to the fission lifetime 10 18 s as predicted by atomic probe. This long standing ambiguity, arising due to the orders of magnitude differences among the fission lifetime measured from the nuclear and atomic probes, has been addressed within a dynamical model which includes the contributions from the nuclear shell effects. We show that, at lower excitation energies, these two probes decouples as the fissioning system survives for a long time without any particle evaporation. We also consider a wide range of reactions to study the impact of the excitation energy of compound nucleus on the fission dynamics in general. Our model predicts the average fission life time of superheavy nucleus 302 120, to be more than 10 18 s which is in reasonable agreement with the recent experiments.
