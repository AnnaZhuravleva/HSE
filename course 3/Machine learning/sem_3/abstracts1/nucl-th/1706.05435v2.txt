This writeup is a review of current hot topics on solar neutrinos. It is based on a talk at the conference "Neutrinos: the quest for a new physics scale", held at the CERN on March 2017, where the Organizers entrusted me with a discussion of the provocative question "whether solar neutrino physics is over". Rather than providing a straight (negative) answer, in view of an audience consisting mostly of colleagues working in theoretical particle physics, I deemed it more useful providing a description of what is the current activity of the physicists working in solar neutrinos, leaving the listener free of forming his/her own opinion apropos.
