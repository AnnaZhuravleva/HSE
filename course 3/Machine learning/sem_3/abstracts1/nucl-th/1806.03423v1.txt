We investigate resonance states in three-cluster continuum of some light nuclei $^{9}$Be, $^{9}$B, $^{10}$B, $^{11}$B and $^{11}$C. These nuclei are considered to have a three-cluster configuration consisting of two alpha-particles and neutron, proton, deuteron, triton and nucleus $^{3}$He. In this study, we make use two different microscopic three-cluster models. The first model employs the Hyperspherical Harmonics basis to numerate channels and describe three-cluster continuum. The second model is the well-known complex scaling method. The nucleon-nucleon interaction is modeled by the semi-realistic Minnesota and Hasegawa-Nagata potentials. Our main aim is to find the Hoyle-analog states in these nuclei or, in other words, whether it is possible to synthesize these nuclei in a triple collision of clusters. We formulate the criteria for selecting such states and apply them to resonance states, emerged from our calculations. We found that there are resonance states obeying the formulated criteria which make possible syntheses of these nuclei in a stellar environment.
