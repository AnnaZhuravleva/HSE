A known exact and accelerating solution of relativistic hydrodynamics for perfect fluids is utilized to describe pseudorapidity densities of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb$+$Pb and $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV $p$$+$$p$ collisions at LHC. We evaluate a conjectured initial energy densities $\epsilon_{\rm corr}$ in these collisions, and compare them to Bjorken's initial energy density estimates, and to results for Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ and 8 TeV.
