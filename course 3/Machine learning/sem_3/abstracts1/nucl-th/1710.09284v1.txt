Minimization of the number of numerically calculated coefficients for new analytical forms as a product of exponential function r1 by the sum of the exponential terms Ai*exp(-ai*r2) have been done. The optimum is N=10. Calculations have been done for realistic phenomenological Reid93 potential. Spherical S0 and quadrupole S2 form factors is parameterized by the coefficients for deuteron wave function in coordinate representation. The result t20(p) in wide area of momentas for Reid93 potential agreed well with the literature results for other potential nucleon-nucleon models, and with experimental datas of world collaborations and reviews. The obtained results will allow studying the deuteron electromagnetic structure, its form-factors, differential cross section of double scattering in more detail in future, and also for calculations the theoretical values of spin observables in dp- scattering.
