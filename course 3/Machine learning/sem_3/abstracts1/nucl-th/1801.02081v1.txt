The nuclear structure of even-even and odd lead isotopes (178-236 Pb) is investigated within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Calculations are performed for a wide range of neutron numbers, starting from the proton-rich side up to the neutron-rich side, by using the SLy4 Skyrme interaction and a new proposed formula for the pairing strength which is more precise for this region of nuclei as we did in previous works in the regions of Neodymium (Nd, Z=60) [Int. J. Mod. Phys. E 24, 1550073 (2015)] and Molybdenum (Mo, Z=42) [Nuc. Phys. A 957 22-32 (2017)]. Such a new pairing strength formula allows reaching exotic nuclei region where the experimental data are not available. Calculated values of various physical quantities such as binding energy, two-neutron separation energy, quadrupole deformation, and rms-radii for protons and neutrons are discussed and compared with experimental data and some estimates of other nuclear models like Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM), Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with NL3 functional (NL3), Density-Dependent Meson-Exchange Relativistic Energy Functional (DD-ME2) and results of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations based on the D1S Gogny effective nucleon-nucleon interaction (Gogny D1S).
