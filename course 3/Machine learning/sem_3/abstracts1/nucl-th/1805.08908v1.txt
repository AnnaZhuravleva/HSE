We outline an extension of the classical Langevin equation to a quantum formulation of the treatment of dissipation and fluctuations of all collective degrees of freedom and with an unitary evolution of a many-fermion system within a time-dependent density functional theory. We illustrate the method by computing the distribution of fission fragment yields for $^{258}$Fm in a hydrodynamic approach.
