The effect of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state (EoS) for compact stars described with density-dependent relativistic hadronic models is studied. A comparison with other mean-field relativistic models is done. It is shown that the largest differences between models occur for low densities, and that the magnetic field affects the crust properties of a star, namely its extension.
