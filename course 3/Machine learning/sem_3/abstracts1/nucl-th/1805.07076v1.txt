High-K isomers are well known in the rare-earth region and provide unique access to the high spin structures of the nuclei. With the current interest in the study of neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei at Radioactive Ion Beam facilities, we present here theoretical results of the band structures of neutron-rich Gd and Dy nuclei, including the high K isomers. Apart from those already known we obtain some more K-isomers and these are suggested for future studies at RIB facilities. Self-consistent Deformed Hartree-Fock and Angular Momentum Projection theories are used to get the intrinsic structures, spectra, and electromagnetic transitions.
