Fully constrained bubble chamber data on the pp -> pi+ pn and pp -> pi+ d reactions are used to investigate the ratio of the counting rates for the two processes as function of the pn excitation energy Q. Though it is important to include effects associated with the p-wave nature of pion production, the data are insufficient to establish unambiguously the dependence on Q. The angular distributions show the presence of higher partial waves which seem to be anomalously large at small Q. The dispersion relation method to determine scattering lengths is extended to encompass cases where, as for the pp -> pi+ pn reaction, there is a bound state and, in a test example, it is shown that the values deduced for the low energy neutron-proton scattering parameters are significantly influenced by the pion p-wave behavior.
