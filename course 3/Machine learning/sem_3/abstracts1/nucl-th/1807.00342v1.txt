Cluster radioactivity is an exotic nuclear decay observed in actinides where a light nucleus is emitted while the remaining heavy mass residue is the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb or a nucleus in its neighborhood. We have investigated this type of decay in heavier nuclei up to Lv $(Z=116)$ within a microscopic theory. It has been found that super asymmetric fission with $^{208}$Pb as heavy fragment may be dominant decay channel in some super heavy nuclei. This reaction is closely related with cluster radioactivity.
