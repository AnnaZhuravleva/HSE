In a transient magnetic field, heavy quarkonium bound states evolve non adiabatically. In presence of a strong magnetic field, $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$ become more tightly bound than we expected earlier for a pure thermal medium. We have shown that in a time varying magnetic field, there is a possibility of moderate suppression of $J/\Psi$ through the non adiabatic transition to continuum where as the $\Upsilon(1S)$ is so tightly bound that can not be dissociated through this process. We have calculated the dissociation probabilities up to the first order in the time dependent perturbation theory for different values of initial magnetic field intensity.
