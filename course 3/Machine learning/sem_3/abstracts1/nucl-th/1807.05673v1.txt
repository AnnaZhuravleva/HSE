We present a new framework to treat the dissipation and fluctuation dynamics associated with nucleon-nucleon scattering in heavy-ion collisions. The two-body collision processes are effectively described in terms of the diffusion of nucleons in viscous nuclear media, governed by a set of Langevin equations in momentum space. The new framework combined with the usual mean field dynamics can be used to simulate heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies. As a proof of principle, we simulate Au + Au reactions and obtain results consistent with other existing codes under the same constrained conditions. We also study the formation of fragments in Sn + Sn reactions at 50 MeV/nucleon, and results are discussed and compared with two other models commonly employed for collisions.
