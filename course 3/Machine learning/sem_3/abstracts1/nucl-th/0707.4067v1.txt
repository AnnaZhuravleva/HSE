The Equation of State (EoS) of dense matter represents a central issue in the study of compact astrophysical objects and heavy ion reactions at intermediate and relativistic energies. We have derived a nuclear EoS with nucleons and hyperons within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approach, and joined it with quark matter EoS. For that, we have employed the MIT bag model, as well as the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) and the Color Dielectric (CD) models, and found that the NS maximum masses are not larger than 1.7 solar masses. A comparison with available data supports the idea that dense matter EoS should be soft at low density and quite stiff at high density.
