Excited band structures recently observed in $^{156}$Dy are investigated using the microscopic triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach and the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) based on the rotating mean-field. It is demonstrated that new observed excited bands, tracking the ground-state band, are the $\gamma$-bands based on the excited two-quasineutron configurations as conjectured in the experimental work.
