The electric dipole moment is a very sensitive probe of CP violation beyond the standard model. Light nuclei are particularly interesting since the CP violation may be enhanced by nuclear many-body effects. In this proceeding, we present the current status of the theoretical evaluations of the electric dipole moment of light nuclei in the ab initio approach and in the cluster model. We add the preliminary result of the evaluation of the electric dipole moment of $^7$Li which is treated in a cluster model with a triton.
