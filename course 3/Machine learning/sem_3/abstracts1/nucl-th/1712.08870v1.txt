Whether the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 can change into a hyperon star is studied in the framework of the relative mean field theory by choosing the suitable hyperon coupling constants. We find that whether the mesons $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ being considered or not, the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 all can change into a hyperon star and the hyperon star transition density are the same for the two cases. We also find that the canonical mass neutron star also can change into a hyperon star in a minor hyperon star transition density as the mesons $\sigma^{*}$ and $\phi$ are not considered. Our results confirms some of recent conclusions.
