We investigate the squeezed back-to-back correlation (BBC) of $D^0\!{\bar D}^0$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, using the in-medium mass modification calculated with a self-energy in hot pion gas and the source space-time distributions provided by the viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. It is found that the BBC of $D^0\!{\bar D}^0$ is significant in peripheral Au+Au collisions at the RHIC energy. A possible way to detect the BBC in experiment is presented.
