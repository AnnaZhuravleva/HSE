We investigate the high-temperature effect on the nuclear matter that consists of mixture of nucleons and all nuclei in the dense and hot stellar environment. The individual nuclei are described within the compressible liquid-drop model that is based on Skyrme interactions for bulk energies and that takes into account modifications of the surface and Coulomb energies at finite temperatures and densities. The free-energy density is minimized with respect to the individual equilibrium densities of all heavy nuclei and the nuclear composition. We find that their optimized equilibrium densities become smaller and smaller at high temperatures because of the increase of thermal contributions to bulk free energies and the reduction of surface energies. The neutron-rich nuclei become unstable and disappear one after another at some temperatures. The calculations are performed for two sets of model parameters leading to different values of the slope parameter in the nuclear symmetry energy. It is found that the larger slope parameter reduces the equilibrium densities and the melting temperatures. We also compare the new model with some other approaches and find that the mass fractions of heavy nuclei in the previous calculations that omit vaporization are underestimated at $T \lesssim 10$MeV and overestimated at $T\gtrsim10$~MeV. The further sophistication of calculations of nuclear vaporization and of light clusters would be required to construct the equation of state for explosive astrophysical phenomena.
