From general Fermi liquid theory arguments, we derive correlations among the symmetry energy (J), its slope parameter (L), and curvature (K_sym) at nuclear matter saturation density. We argue that certain properties of these correlations do not depend on details of the nuclear forces used in the calculation. We derive as well a global parametrization of the density dependence of the symmetry energy that we show is more reliable, especially at low densities, than the usual Taylor series expansion around saturation density. We then benchmark these predictions against explicit results from chiral effective field theory.
