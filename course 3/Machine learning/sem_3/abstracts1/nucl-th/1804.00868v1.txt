The observed shears bands in 198Pb and 199Pb are investigated within the framework of tilted axis cranking covariant density functional theory, and the separable pairing force is adopted to consider the pairing correlations. The energy spectra, total angular momenta, and transition probabilities agree well with the experimental data. The bandhead energy differences are reproduced satisfactorily without any ad hoc renormalizations when the pairing correlations are taken into account. The angular momentum vectors are discussed in detail to analyze the pairing effects on magnetic rotations.
