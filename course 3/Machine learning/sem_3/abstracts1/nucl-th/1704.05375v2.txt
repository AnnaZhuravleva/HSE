We employ a 3+1D anomalous hydrodynamics with initial condition generated by HIJING to simulate the chiral vortical effect and the chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions. This allows us to calculate the charge-dependent two-particle correlations with respect to the reaction plane at different collision energies and centralities. We then compare the computed results with the experimental data and give discussions on the possible background effects.
