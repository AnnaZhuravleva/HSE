We study the medium-induced gluon emission from a hard quark jet traversing the dense nuclear matter within the framework of deep inelastic scattering off a large nucleus. We extend the previous work and compute the single gluon emission spectrum including both transverse and longitudinal momentum exchanges between the hard jet parton and the medium constituents. On the other hand, with only transverse scattering and using static scattering centers for the traversed medium, our induced gluon emission spectrum in the soft gluon limit reduces to the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev one-rescattering-one-emission formula.
