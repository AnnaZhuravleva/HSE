By incorporating hidden scale symmetry and hidden local symmetry in nuclear effective field theory, combined with double soft-pion theorem, we predict that the Gamow-Teller operator coming from the space component of the axial current should remain unaffected by the QCD vacuum change caused by baryonic density whereas the first forbidden beta transition operator coming from the time component should be strongly enhanced. While the latter has been confirmed since some time, the former is given a support by a powerful recent {\it ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo calculation in light nuclei, also confirming the old "chiral filter hypothesis." Formulated in terms of Fermi-liquid fixed point structure of strong-coupled nuclear interactions, we offer an extremely simple resolution to the long-standing puzzle of "quenched $g_A$", $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$~\cite{quenched}, in nuclear Gamow-Teller beta transitions, giant Gamow-Teller resonances and double beta decays.
