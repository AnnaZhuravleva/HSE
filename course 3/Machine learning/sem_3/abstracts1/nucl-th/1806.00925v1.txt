We revisit the $KN$ scattering amplitude in order to investigate the possibility for the existence of a broad resonance in the $I=0$ $KN$ channel around the energy of 1620 MeV with 310 MeV width. We use the chiral unitary model to describe the $K^{+}N$ scattering amplitudes and determine the model parameters so as to reproduce the differential cross sections of the $K^{+}N$ scatterings and the $I=0$ total cross section up to $p_{\rm lab} = 800$ MeV/c, where inelastic contributions are significant. Performing analytic continuation of the determined amplitude to the complex energy plane, we find a pole for a broad resonance state.We point out that the rapid increase appearing in the $I=0$ total cross section at $p_{\rm lab}=500$ MeV/c is a hint of the possible broad resonance of strangeness $S=+1$.
