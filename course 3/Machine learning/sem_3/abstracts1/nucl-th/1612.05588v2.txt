We discuss collective excitations (both fundamental and solitonic excitations) of quantized superfluid vortices in neutron $^3P_2$ superfluids, which likely exist in high density neutron matter such as neutron stars. Besides the well-known Kelvin modes (translational zero modes), we find a gapfull mode whose low-energy description takes the simple form of a double sine-Gordon model. The associated kink solution and its effects on spontaneous magnetization inside the vortex core are analyzed in detail.
