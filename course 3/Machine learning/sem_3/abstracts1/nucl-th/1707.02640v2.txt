The dependence of multi-proton correlation functions and cumulants on the acceptance in rapidity and transverse momentum is studied. We find that the preliminary data of various cumulant ratios are consistent, within errors, with rapidity and transverse momentum independent correlation functions. However, rapidity correlations which moderately increase with rapidity separation between protons are slightly favored. We propose to further explore the rapidity dependence of multi-particle correlation functions by measuring the dependence of the integrated reduced correlation functions as a function of the size of the rapidity window.
