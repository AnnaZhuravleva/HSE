Experimental data on the n-alpha and dt collisions in the quantum state J^pi=3/2+ near the dt-threshold are fitted using the semi-analytic multi-channel Jost matrix with proper analytic structure and some adjustable parameters. Then the spectral points are sought as zeros of the Jost matrix determinant (which correspond to the S-matrix poles) at complex energies. The correct analytic structure makes it possible to calculate the fitted Jost matrix on any sheet of the Riemann surface whose topology involves not only the square-root but also the logarithmic branching caused by the Coulomb interaction. Within a distance of 100,keV above the dt-threshold, three 3/2+ resonances are found on the non-physical sheet of the Riemann surface. Several S-matrix (shadow) poles on the other sheets of this surface are located as well.
