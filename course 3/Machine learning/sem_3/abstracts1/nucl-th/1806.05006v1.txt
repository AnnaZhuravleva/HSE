A non-iterative solution for scattering wavefunctions of protons off a nonlocal potential is presented. The approach is based on a Coulomb Green's function in coordinate space whose kernel involves any nonlocal optical potential superposed to the Coulomb-screened interaction. The scattering wavefunctions, exact solution the integro-differential Schr\"odinger's equation, can be obtained for any type of nonlocality of the interaction with no restrictions on the beam energy. The method presented here, also valid for chargeless projectiles, constitutes a direct and reliable alternative to others based on iterative procedures and/or localization ansatz of nonlocal potentials.
