We present a new method to interpolate between two matter phases that allows for a description of mixed phases and can be used, e.g., for mimicking transitions between pasta structures occuring in the crust as well as in the inner core of compact stars. This interpolation method is based on assuming switch functions that are used to define a mixture of subphases while fulfilling constraints of thermodynamic stability. The width of the transition depends on a free parameter, the pressure increment relative to the critical pressure of a Maxwell construction. As an example we present a trigonometric function ansatz for the switch function together with a pressure increment during the transition. We note that the resulting mixed phase equation of state bears similarities with the appearance of substitutional compounds in neutron star crusts and with the sequence of transitions between different pasta phases in the hadron-to-quark matter transition. We apply this method to the case of a hadron-to-quark matter transition and test the robustness of the compact star mass twin phenomenon against the appearance of pasta phases modeled in this way.
