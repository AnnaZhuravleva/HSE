$\alpha$--cluster states in $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr are investigated in the double-folding model. This study complements a recent similar work of Souza and Miyake \cite{Sou17} which was based on a specially shaped potential. Excitation energies, reduced widths, intercluster separations, and intra-band transition strengths are calculated and compared to experimental values for the ground state bands in $^{46}$Cr and $^{54}$Cr. The $\alpha$-cluster potential is also applied to elastic scattering at low and intermediate energies. Here, as a byproduct, a larger radial extent of the neutron density in $^{50}$Ti is found.
