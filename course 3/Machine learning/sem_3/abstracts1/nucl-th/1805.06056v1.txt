We analyze two-derivative two-nucleon interactions in a combined pionless effective field theory and large-$N_c$ expansion. At leading order in the large-$N_c$ expansion, relationships among low-energy constants emerge. We find these to be consistent with experiment. However, it is critical to correctly address the $\mu$ dependence of the low-energy constants. These results provide additional confidence that the dual-expansion procedure is useful for analyzing low-energy few-body observables.
