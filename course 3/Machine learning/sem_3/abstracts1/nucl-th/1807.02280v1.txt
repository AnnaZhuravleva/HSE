It is known that the Dyson-Schwinger Equations(DSEs) describe the relations of different points Green functions. It has been an important tool in strong correlation physics but it's truncation scheme is still not perfect. With the generally used truncation schemes to the DSEs of QCD, we find that a correction factor suppressing the gluon self-energy is needed to keep the stability of the coupled DSEs of the quark and gluon propagators. Following calculation reveals the origin of this factor and the results could give important constraints and inspirations on more sensibly truncating the DSEs and fabricating more sophisticated model of full quark-gluon vertex.
