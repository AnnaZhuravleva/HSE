A quark model, which reproduces the ground-state mesons and baryons, i.e., the threshold energies, is applied to the $qqqc\bar c$ configurations, where $q$ is a light quark and~$c$ the charmed quark. In the calculation, several open channels are explicitly included such as $\Jpsi +N$, $\eta_c+N$, $\Lambda_c +D$, etc. To distinguish genuine resonances and estimate their width, we employ Gaussian Expansion Method supplemented by the real scaling method (stabilization).   No resonance is found at the energies of the $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ pentaquarks. On the other hand, there is a sharp resonant state at 4690\,MeV with $J=1/2^-$ state and another one at 4920\,MeV with $J=3/2^-$ state, which have a compact structure.
