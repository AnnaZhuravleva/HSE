We delineate the properties of dense QCD matter through equations of state constrained by the neutron star observations. The two solar mass constraint, the radius constraint of 11-13 km, and the causality constraint on the speed of sound, are used to develop the picture of hadron-quark continuity in which hadronic matter continuously transforms into quark matter. A unified equation of state at zero temperature and beta-equilibrium is constructed by a phenomenological interpolation between nuclear and quark matter equations of state. For applications to supernovae and neutron star mergers, the unified equation of state is perturbed by temperature corrections.
