Short-range correlations (SRC) in asymmetric nuclei with an unusual neutron-to-proton ratio can be studied with quasi-free two-nucleon knockout processes following the collision between accelerated ions and a proton target. We derive an approximate factorized cross section for those SRC-driven $p(A,p^{\prime} N_1 N_2)$ reactions. Our reaction model hinges on the factorization properties of SRC-driven $A(e, e^\prime N_1 N_2)$ reactions for which strong indications are found in theory-experiment comparisons. In order to put our model to the test we compare its predictions with results of $^{12}\text{C}(p,p^{\prime} pn)$ measurements conducted at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and find a fair agreement. The model can also reproduce characteristic features of SRC-driven two-nucleon knockout reactions, like back-to-back emission of the correlated nucleons. We study the asymmetry dependence of nuclear SRC by providing predictions for the ratio of proton-proton to proton-neutron knockout cross sections for the carbon isotopes $^{9-15}$C thereby covering neutron excess values $(N-Z)/Z$ between -0.5 and +0.5.
