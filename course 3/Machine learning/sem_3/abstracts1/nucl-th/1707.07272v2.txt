With the parameters fitted by the particle multiplicity, the energy density at chemical freeze-out, and the charged particle elliptic flow, we have studied the effects of the hadronic mean-field potentials on the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) correlation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a multiphase transport model. The hadronic mean-field potentials are found to delay the emission time of the system and lead to large HBT radii extracted from the correlation function. Effects on the energy dependence of $R_o^2-R_s^2$ and $R_{o}/ R_{s}$ as well as the eccentricity of the emission source are discussed. The HBT correlations can also be useful in understanding the mean-field potentials of protons, kaons, and antiprotons as well as baryon-antibaryon annihilations.
