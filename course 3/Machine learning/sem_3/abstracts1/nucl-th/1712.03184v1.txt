On the base of potential theory of light nuclei cluster photodisintegration the characteristics of Lithium nuclei cluster photodisintegration reactions are considered in the range of low and intermediate energies. For the inverse reaction the interference has an opposite character: in forward semisphere it is deconstructive, and in backward semisphere it is constructive. In the energy range above several MeV the E2-multipole becomes dominating. The effect of appearance of the node structure of the wave function of relative motion has been considered in the characteristics of Li cluster photodisintegration reaction with polarized and non-polarized photons.
