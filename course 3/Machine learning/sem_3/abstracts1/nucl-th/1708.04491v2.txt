Charm particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS energies is considered within a statistical approach. Namely, the Statistical Model of the Early Stage is used to calculate mean multiplicity of charm particles in central Pb+Pb collisions. A small number of produced charm particles necessitates the use of the exact charm conservation law. The model predicts a rapid increase of mean charm multiplicity as a function of collision energy. The mean multiplicity calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at the center of mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV exceeds significantly the experimental upper limit. Thus, in order to describe open charm production model parameters and/or assumptions should be revised.
