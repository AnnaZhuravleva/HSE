The model of multiple Dirac eikonal scattering of incident proton by target-nucleus nucleons is developed, in which new expressions for the elastic $pA$-scattering amplitudes are obtained from the multiple scattering Watson series with employing the eikonal approximation for the Dirac propagators of the free proton motion between successive scattering acts on nucleons. Basing on this model, calculations for the complete set of observables of the elastic $p+^{40}$Ca and $p+^{208}$Pb at 800 MeV have been performed with using proton-nucleon amplitudes determined from the phase analysis and the nucleon densities obtained from describing the target-nucleus structure in the relativistic mean-field approximation. A comparison has been made of the results of these calculations with analogous calculations on the basis of the Glauber multiple diffraction theory.
