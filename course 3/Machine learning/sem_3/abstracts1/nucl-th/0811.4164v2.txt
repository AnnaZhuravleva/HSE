It is possible that a system composed of up, down and strange quarks consists the true ground state of nuclear matter at high densities and low temperatures. This exotic plasma, called strange quark matter (SQM), seems to be even more favorable energetically if quarks are in a superconducting state, the so-called color-flavor locked state. Here are presented calculations made on the basis of the MIT bag model considering the influence of finite temperature on the allowed parameters characterizing the system for stability of bulk SQM (the so-called stability windows) and also for strangelets, small lumps of SQM, both in the color-flavor locking scenario. We compare these results with the unpaired SQM and also briefly discuss some astrophysical implications of them. Also, the issue of strangelet's electric charge is discussed. The effects of dynamical screening, though important for non-paired SQM strangelets, are not relevant when considering pairing among all three flavor and colors of quarks.
