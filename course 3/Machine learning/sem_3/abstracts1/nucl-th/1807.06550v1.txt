Jet energy transported to quark-gluon plasma during jet-medium interaction excites the QGP medium and creates energetic thermal partons -- recoil particles or recoils. Modification of the jet structure in heavy ion collisions is studied using \textsc{martini}, in which recoil simulation is enabled. In large systems such as central Pb-Pb collisions, the recoil effect is expected to be critical due to strong jet-medium interaction. We show the results of the jet mass function and jet shape function are improved when the recoil particles are included in the reconstructed jets. We conclude that the energy carried by the recoil particles are regarded as a part of reconstructed jets and are necessary in studying jet modification in heavy ion collisions.
