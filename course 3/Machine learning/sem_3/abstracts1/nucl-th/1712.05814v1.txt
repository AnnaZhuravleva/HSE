The light-quark flavor dependence of the proton sea has been of great interest for many years because of its close connection with non-perturbative effects. One hypothesis is that the sea arises from the pion cloud of the proton. We make precise predictions based on the pion cloud idea for an anticipated future measurement. This is achieved by applying light cone perturbation theory and experimental constraints to a chiral Lagrangian so that the relevant Fock-space components of the nucleon wave function are computed with reasonable accuracy. Existing experimental information regarding the light flavor sea is studied, and predictions, including uncertainties, for future experimental results are provided. Future experiments will either confirm or rule out the idea that the pion cloud provides the flavor dependence of the proton's sea quark distribution, and have profound implications for understanding the nucleon-nucleon force.
