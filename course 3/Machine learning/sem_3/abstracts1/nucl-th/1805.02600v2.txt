Alpha and cluster decay half lives for W isotopes in the range between 2p drip line and beta stability line are studied. The sensitivity of different Skyrme parametrizations in predicting the alpha decay and probable cluster decay modes from W isotopes have been analysed. The half lives are calculated using UDL. Predicted half lives are compared with ELDM and also with available experimental values. The study also revealed the role of neutron shell closure in cluster decay process.
