We present the predictions of the SuSAv2-MEC model for the double differential charged-current muonic neutrino (antineutrino) cross section on water for the T2K neutrino (antineutrino) beam. We validate our model by comparing with the available inclusive electron scattering data on oxygen and compare our predictions with the recent T2K $\nu_\mu$-$^{16}$O data, finding good agreement at all kinematics. We show that the results are very similar to those obtained for $\nu_\mu-^{12}$C scattering, except at low energies, and we comment on the origin of this difference. A factorized spectral function model of $^{16}$O is also included for purposes of comparison.
