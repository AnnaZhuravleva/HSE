Recent experimental observations of the charged hadron properties in $U+U$ collisions at $193$ GeV contradict many of the theoretical models of particle production including two-component Monte Carlo Glauber model. The experimental results show a small correlation between the charged hadron properties and the initial geometrical configurations (e.g. body-body, tip-tip etc.) of $U+U$ collisions. In this article, we have modified the Monte Carlo HYDJET++ model to study the charged hadron production in $U+U$ collisions at $193$ GeV center-of-mass energy in tip-tip and body-body initial configurations. We have modified the hard as well as soft production processes to make this model suitable for $U+U$ collisions. We have calculated the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum distribution and elliptic flow distribution of charged hadrons with different control parameters in various geometrical configurations possible for $U+U$ collision. We find that HYDJET++ model supports a small correlation between the various properties of charged hadrons and the initial geometrical configurations of $U+U$ collision. Further, the results obtained in modified HYDJET++ model regarding $dn_{ch}/d\eta$ and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) suitably matches with the experimental data of $U+U$ collisions in minimum bias configuration.
