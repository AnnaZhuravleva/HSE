We use an improved version of the semiclassical method described in Refs. [1,2,3] to evaluate fusion cross sections in collisions of weakly bound nuclei. This version takes into account the static effects of the low breakup threshold, uses better bin states in the discretization of the continuum and avoids the excitation of closed channels. The population of these channels is a consequence of the violation of energy conservation, which is inherent in the semiclassical method. The method is employed to evaluate complete fusion and total fusion cross section in collisions of the weakly bound 6,7Li projectiles with 159Tb and 197Au targets, for which data is available. The overall agreement between theory and experiment is fairly good.
