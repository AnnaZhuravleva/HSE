Understanding hydrodynamization in microscopic models of heavy-ion collisions has been an important topic in current research. Many lessons obtained within the strongly-coupled (holographic) models originate from the properties of transient excitations of equilibrium encapsulated by short-lived quasinormal modes of black holes. This paper aims to develop similar intuition for expanding plasma systems described by a simple model from the weakly-coupled domain, the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation. We show that in this kinetic theory setup there are infinitely many transient modes carrying information about the initial distribution function. They all have the same exponential damping set by the relaxation time but are distinguished by different power-law suppressions and different frequencies of oscillations, logarithmic in proper time. We also analyze the resurgent interplay between the hydrodynamics and transients in this setup.
