Large orbital angular momentum can be generated in non-central heavy-ion collisions, and part of it is expected to be converted into final particle's polarization due to the spin-orbit coupling. Within the framework of A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we studied the vorticity-induced polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons at the midrapidity region $|\eta|<1$ in Au-Au collisions at energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7\sim200$ GeV. Our results show that the global polarization decreases with the collisional energies and is consistent with the recent STAR measurements. This behavior can be understood by less asymmetry of participant matter in the midrapidity region due to faster expansion of fireball at higher energies. As another evidence, we discuss how much the angular momentum is deposited in different rapidity region. The result supports our asymmetry argument.
