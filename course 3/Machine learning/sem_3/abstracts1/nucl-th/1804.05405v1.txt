We study, within the Monte-Carlo Glauber model, centrality dependence of the midrapidity charged multiplicity density $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ and of the anisotropy coefficients $\varepsilon_{2,3}$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and in Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.44$ TeV. Calculations are performed for versions with and without nucleon meson cloud. The fraction of the binary collisions, $\alpha$, has been fitted to the data on $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ in Pb+Pb collisions. We obtain $\alpha\approx 0.09(0.13)$ with (without) meson cloud. The effect of meson cloud on the $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ is relatively small. For Xe+Xe collisions for $0$-$5$\% centrality bin we obtain $dN_{ch}/d\eta\approx 1149$ and $1134$ with and without meson cloud, respectively. We obtain $\varepsilon_2(\mbox{Xe})/\varepsilon_2(\mbox{Pb})\sim 1.45$ for most central collisions, and $\varepsilon_2(\mbox{Xe})/\varepsilon_2(\mbox{Pb})$ close to unity at $c\gtrsim 20$\%. We find a noticeable increase of the eccentricity in Xe+Xe collisions at small centralities due to the prolate shape of the Xe nucleus. The triangularity in Xe+Xe collisions is bigger than in Pb+Pb collisions at $c\lesssim 70$\%. We obtain $\varepsilon_3(\mbox{Xe})/\varepsilon_3(\mbox{Pb})\sim 1.3$ at $c\lesssim 1$\%.
