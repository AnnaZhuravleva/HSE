We perform a coupled-channels calculation of the masses of light mesons with the quantum numbers $IJ^{P=-}$, $(I,J)=0,1$, by including $q\bar{q}$ and $(q\bar{q})^2$ components in a nonrelativistic chiral quark model. The coupling between two- and four-quark configurations is realized through a $^3P_0$ quark-pair creation model. With the usual form of this operator, the mass shifts are large and negative, an outcome which raises serious issues of validity for the quenched quark model. Herein, therefore, we introduce some improvements of the $^3P_0$ operator in order to reduce the size of the mass shifts. By introducing two simple factors, physically well motivated, the coupling between $q\bar{q}$ and $(q\bar{q})^2$ components is weakened, producing mass shifts that are around 10-20% of hadron bare masses.
