The two-point correlation functions of kaonic viscous stress tensors and electro-magnetic currents have been calculated respectively to estimate the contributions of the strange sector in the shear viscosity and electrical conductivity of hadronic medium. In the one-loop correlators, kaon propagators contain a non-zero thermal width that leads to non-divergent values of transport coefficients. With the help of effective Lagrangian densities of strange hadrons, we have calculated in-medium self-energy of kaon for different possible mesonic loops, whose imaginary part provide the estimation of kaon thermal width. It is observed that near the quark-hadron transition temperature, the contribution of kaons to shear viscosity is larger and increases faster with temperature than pionic contribution. In case of electrical conductivity the trend due kaon component appears to be opposite in nature with respect to pion component.
