The SU(3) symmetry realized by J. P. Elliott in the sd nuclear shell is destroyed in heavier shells by the strong spin-orbit interaction. On the other hand, the SU(3) symmetry has been used for the description of heavy nuclei in terms of bosons in the framework of the Interacting Boson Approximation, as well as in terms of fermions using the pseudo-SU(3) approximation. A new fermionic approximation, called the proxy-SU(3), has been recently introduced and applied to the even rare earths. We show that the applicability of proxy-SU(3) can be extended to even nuclei in the 28-50 proton shell, to even superheavy elements, as well as to odd-odd and odd rare earths. Parameter free predictions for the beta and gamma deformation parameters are presented and compared to alternative theoretical predictions and to existing data.
