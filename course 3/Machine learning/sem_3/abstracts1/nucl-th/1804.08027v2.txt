We present quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the single- and two-nucleon momentum distributions in selected nuclei for $A\le16$. We employ local chiral interactions at next-to-next-to-leading order. We find good agreement at low momentum with the single-nucleon momentum distributions derived for phenomenological potentials. The same agreement is found for the integrated two-nucleon momentum distributions at low relative momentum $q$ and low center-of-mass momentum $Q$. We provide results for the two-nucleon momentum distributions as a function of both $q$ and $Q$. The large ratio of $pn$ to $pp$ pairs around $q=2\,\rm fm^{-1}$ for back-to-back $(Q=0)$ pairs is confirmed up to $^{16}$O, and results are compatible with those extracted from available experimental data.
