For the first time an analytic expression for inelastic neutron scattering law for isotropic neutron source considering moderating medium temperature as a parameter was obtained in the present paper within gas model. The obtained scattering law is based on solution of kinematic problem of inelastic scattering of a neutron at a nucleus in laboratory coordinate system ($L$-system) in general case. I.e. in case not only a neutron but also a nucleus have arbitrary velocity vector in $L$-system. Analytic expression for neutron flux density and neutron moderation spectrum in reactor fission medium are found for elastic scattering law obtained by the authors before and for new law of inelastic scattering. They consider elastic and inelastic scattering and depend on medium temperature. The obtained expressions for neutron moderation spectra enable reinerpretation of physical nature of processes that determine the shape of neutron spectrum in thermal neutron energy range.
