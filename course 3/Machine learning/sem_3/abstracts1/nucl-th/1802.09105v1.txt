In the present work the electroproduction for diffractive $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons by considering AdS/QCD correspondence and Color Glass Condensate (CGC) approximation are studied with respect to the associated dipole cross section, whose parameters are studied and analysed in the framework of the configurational entropy. Our results suggest different quantum states of the nuclear matter, showing that the extremal points of the nuclear configurational entropy is able to reflect a true description of the $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons production, using current data concerning light quark masses. During the computations parameters, obtained in fitting procedure, coincide to the experimental within 0.1 %.
