The 2$\alpha+t$ cluster structure in $^{11}$B is investigated by the microscopic generator coordinate method (GCM) with the Brink cluster wave functions. With a proper choice of the parameters of the effective interaction, the calculated energy spectrum shows reasonable agreement with the observed low-lying spectra of both parities. On the basis of the calculated radii, monopole and $B(E2)$ transition strengths, several developed cluster states of $^{11}$B are suggested. For the negative-parity states, in addition to the well-known $3/2_3^-$ cluster state, the $1/2_2^-$ and $5/2_3^-$ states are also proposed as the well-developed cluster states. For the positive-parity states, it is found that many states around the 2$\alpha+t$ threshold show the feature of developed clusters. In particular, the $1/2_2^+$ state is found to have a linear-chain-like structure, which is consistent with the previous antisymmetrized molecular dynamics calculation, but contradicts to the orthogonality condition model calculation. It is also found that many of these positive-parity cluster candidates have the non-negligible isoscalar dipole transition strengths, which require the experimental confirmation.
