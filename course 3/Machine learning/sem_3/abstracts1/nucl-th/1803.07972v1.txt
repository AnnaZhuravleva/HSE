Photon-nuclear reaction in a transport model frame, namely an Extended Quantum Molecular Dynamics (EQMD) model, has been realised at the photon energy of 70-140 MeV in the quasi-deuteron (QD) regime. For an important application, we pay a special focus on photonuclear reactions of $^{12}$C($\gamma$,np)$^{10}$B where $^{12}$C is considered as different configurations including $\alpha$-clustering. Obvious differences for some observables have been observed among different configurations, which can be attributed to spatial-momentum correlation of a neutron-proton pair inside nucleus, and therefore it gives us a sensitive probe to distinguish the different configurations including $\alpha$ clustering with the help of the photonuclear reaction mechanism.
