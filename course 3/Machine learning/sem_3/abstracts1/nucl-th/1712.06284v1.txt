Drawing largely from my work with co--workers, I present arguments that strangeness does not play an {\it explicit} role in compact-star matter. They are based on the skyrmion description of dense matter combined with Wilsoninan renormalization group approach to kaon nuclear interactions. The key idea is that quark degrees of freedom, carrying strangeness, can be traded in by topology for hadron degrees of freedom.
