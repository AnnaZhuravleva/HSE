The experimental measures of the multiplicity derivatives, the moment parameters, the bimodal parameter, the fluctuation of maximum fragment charge number (NVZ), the Fisher exponent ($\tau$) and Zipf's law parameter ($\xi$), are examined to search for the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear multifragmention processes within the framework of the statistical multifragmentation model (SMM). The sensitivities of these measures are studied. All these measures predict a critical signature at or near to the critical point both for the primary and secondary fragments. Among these measures, the total multiplicity derivative and the NVZ provide accurate measures for the critical point from the final cold fragments as well as the primary fragments. The present study will provide a guide for future experiments and analyses in the study of nuclear liquid-gas phase transition.
