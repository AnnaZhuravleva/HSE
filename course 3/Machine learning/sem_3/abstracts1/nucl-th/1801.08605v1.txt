In this contributions we discuss the novel version of hadron resonance gas model which is based on the induced surface tension concept. Also we present new arguments in favor of a hypothesis that the chiral symmetry restoration transition in central nuclear collisions may occur at the center of mass energies 4.3-4.9 GeV and that the deconfinement phase transition may occur at the center of mass energies 8.8-9.2 GeV. These arguments are based on the unique thermostatic properties of the mixed phase and the ones of an exponential mass spectrum of hadrons.
