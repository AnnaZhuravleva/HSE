We show the feasibility of calculating the decay energy spectrum of neutron emitting nuclei within the Gamow-state description of resonances by obtaining the decay energy spectrum of $^{25}$O. We model this nucleus as a valence neutron interacting with an $^{24}$O inert core, and we obtain the resulting resonant energies, widths and decay energy spectra for the ground and first excited states. We also discuss the similarities and differences between the decay energy spectrum of a Gamow state and the Breit-Wigner distribution with energy-dependent width.
