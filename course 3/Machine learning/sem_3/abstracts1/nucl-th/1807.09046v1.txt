The multi-nucleon exchange mechanism in ${}^{58} \text{Ni}+{}^{60} \text{Ni}$ and ${}^{60} \text{Ni}+{}^{60}\text{Ni}$ collisions is analyzed in the framework of the stochastic mean-field approach. The results of calculations are compared with the TDRPA calculations and the recent data of ${}^{58} \text{Ni}+{}^{60} \text{Ni}$. A good description of the data and a relatively good agreement with the TDRPA calculations are found.
