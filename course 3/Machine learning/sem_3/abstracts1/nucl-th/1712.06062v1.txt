We study chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement beyond mean field approximation in a magnetized PNJL model. The feedback from mesons to quarks modifies the quark coupling constant and Polyakov potential. As a result, the separate critical temperatures for the two phase transitions at mean field level coincide and the magnetic catalysis becomes inverse magnetic catalysis, when the meson contribution is included.
