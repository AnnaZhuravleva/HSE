The kinetic freeze-out temperatures $T_0$ and transverse flow velocities $\beta_T$ in small collision systems at high energy are extracted by four variants of the fitting function. The first two variants are the Blast-Wave model with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and Tsallis statistics respectively, in which non-zero transverse flow velocity of produced particles is considered. The last two variants are an alternative method which uses the Boltzmann and Tsallis distributions to extract the effective temperatures respectively. Then $T_0$ and $\beta_T$ are regarded as the intercept and slope in some linear relations. It is found that the values of $T_0$ ($\beta_T$) obtained by the four variants are similar, and in some cases the four results are in agreement with each other within errors. In particular, comparing with central nucleus-nucleus collisions, proton-proton collisions are found to be closer to peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions in terms of $T_0$ and $\beta_T$.
