We discuss the electroproduction of scalar ($0^{++}$) or pseudoscalar ($0^{-+}$) meson production off the scalar target. The most general formulation of the differential cross section for the $0^{-+}$ or $0^{++}$ meson production process involves only one or two hadronic form factors, respectively, on a scalar target. The Rosenbluth type separation of the differential cross section provides the explicit relation between the hadronic form factors and the different parts of the differential cross section in a completely model-independent manner. The absence of the single spin asymmetry for the pseudoscalar meson production provides the benchmark for the experimental data analysis. The measurement of the single spin asymmetry for the scalar meson production may provide a clear criterion whether the leading-twist formulation of the generalized parton distribution is in agreement with the most general formulation of the hadronic tensor.
