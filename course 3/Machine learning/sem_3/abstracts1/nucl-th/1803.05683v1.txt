The effective field theory (EFT) for triaxially deformed even-even nuclei is generalized to include the vibrational degrees of freedom. The pertinent Hamiltonian is constructed up to next-to-leading order. The leading order part describes the vibrational motion, and the NLO part couples rotations to vibrations. The applicability of the EFT Hamiltonian is examined through the description of the energy spectra of the ground state bands, $\gamma$-bands, and $K=4$ bands in the $^{108, 110, 112}$Ru isotopes. It is found that by taking into account the vibrational degrees of freedom, the deviations for high-spin states in the $\gamma$-band observed in the EFT with only rotational degrees of freedom disappear. This supports the importance of including vibrational degrees of freedom in the EFT formulation for the collective motion of triaxially deformed nuclei.
