We study the in-medium propagation of low-lying charmonium states: $J/\Psi$, $\Psi$(3686), and $\Psi$(3770) in a $\bar p$ Au $10$ GeV collision. This energy regime will be available for the PANDA experiment. The time evolution of the spectral functions of the charmonium states is studied with a BUU type transport model. We observe a substantial effect of the medium in the dilepton spectrum.
