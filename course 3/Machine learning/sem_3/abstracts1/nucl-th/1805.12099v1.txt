Recent experiments showed that approximately 20% of the nucleons in medium and heavy nuclei ($A \ge 12$) are part of short-range correlated mainly neutron-proton (np) (SRC) pairs. We find that including the effects of np-SRC pairs in the wave function can increase the computed nuclear charge radius in neutron rich nuclei. For neutrons outside a closed shell the increase is consistent with the typical difference between measured charge radii and ab initio calculations that truncate the effects of SRC pairs.
