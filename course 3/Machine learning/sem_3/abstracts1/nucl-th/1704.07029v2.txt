We develop a reaction model for $\eta$ photoproduction off the deuteron ($\gamma d\to\eta pn$), and study the reaction at a special kinematics, where the photon beam energy is $\sim 0.94$ GeV and the scattered proton is detected at $\sim 0^\circ$, for the purpose of determining the $\eta$-nucleon scattering length ($a_{\eta N}$) and effective range ($r_{\eta N}$). In this kinematics, the $\eta$-nucleon elastic rescattering is significantly enhanced while other background mechanisms being suppressed. We show that a ratio $R$, the $\gamma d\to\eta pn$ cross section divided by the $\gamma p\to\eta p$ cross section convoluted with the proton momentum distribution in the deuteron, has a very good resolving power of $a_{\eta N}$ and $r_{\eta N}$. We conclude that the $R$ data with 5% error, binned in 1 MeV width of the $\eta$-neutron invariant mass, can determine ${\rm Re}[a_{\eta N}]$ (${\rm Re}[r_{\eta N}]$) at the precision of $\sim\pm$0.1 fm ($\sim\pm$0.5 fm), significantly narrowing down the previously estimated ranges of the parameters. To arrive at the conclusion, it is essential to use the $\gamma d\to\eta pn$ reaction model equipped with elementary amplitudes that are well constrained by $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ reaction data through a sophisticated coupled-channels analysis. This result strongly motivates the Research Center for Electron Photon Science (ELPH) at Tohoku University to measure $R$.
