We consider a Bargmann-type rational parametrization of the nucleon scattering phase shifts. Applying Marchenko's method of quantum inverse scattering we show that the scattering data suggest a singular repulsive core of the potential of the form $2/r^2$ and $6/r^2$ in natural units, for the 3S1 and 1S0 channels respectively. The simplest solution in the 3S1 channel contains three parameters only but reproduces all features of the potential and bound state wave function within one percent error. We also consider the 3SD1 coupled channel problem with the coupled channel Marchenko inversion method.
