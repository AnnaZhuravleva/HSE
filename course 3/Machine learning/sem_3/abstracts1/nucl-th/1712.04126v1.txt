The SU(3) symmetry realized by J. P. Elliott in the sd nuclear shell is destroyed in heavier shells by the strong spin-orbit interaction. However, the SU(3) symmetry has been used for the description of heavy nuclei in terms of bosons in the framework of the Interacting Boson Approximation, as well as in terms of fermions using the pseudo-SU(3) approximation. We introduce a new fermionic approximation, called the proxy-SU(3), and we discuss how some of its novel predictions come out as a consequence of the short range of the nucleon-nucleon interaction and the Pauli principle.
