The properties of the low-lying states, especially the relevant shape coexistence in $^{80}$Ge close to one of most neutron-rich doubly magic nuclei at $N=50$ and $Z=28$ have been investigated within the framework of the proton-neutron interacting model (IBM-2). Based on the fact that the relative energy of the $d$ neutron boson is different from proton bosons', the calculated energy levels of low-lying states, $E2$ transition strengths can reproduce the experimental data very well. Particularly, the first excited state 0$^+_2$ is reproduced quite nicely, which is intimately related with the shape coexistence phenomenon. And the $\rho^2(E0, 0^+_2\rightarrow0^+_1)$ transition strength has been predicted. The experimental data and theoretical results indicate that both collective spherical and $\gamma$-soft vibration structures coexist in $^{80}$Ge. Key words: $^{80}$Ge, low-lying states, $E0$ transition strengths, shape coexistence, IBM-2.
