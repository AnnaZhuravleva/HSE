The isoscalar neutron-proton pairing is thought to be important for nuclei with equal number of protons and neutrons but its manifestation in structure properties remains to be understood. We investigate the Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions for the f7/2-shell nuclei in large-scale shell-model calculations with the realistic Hamiltonian. We show that the isoscalar T=0, J=1+ neutron-proton pairing interaction plays a decisive role for the concentration of GT strengths at the first-excited 1+ state in 42Sc, and that the suppression of these strengths in 46V, 50Mn, and 54Co is mainly caused by the spin-orbit force supplemented by the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction. Based on the good reproduction of the charge-exchange reaction data, we further analyze the interplay between the isoscalar and isovector pairing correlations. We conclude that even for the most promising A=42 nuclei where the SU(4) isoscalar-isovector-pairing symmetry is less broken, the probability of forming an isoscalar neutron-proton pairing condensation is less than 60% as compared to the expectation at the SU(4)-symmetry limit.
