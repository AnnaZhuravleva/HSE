A formalism to study the mode-by-mode response to the energy deposition of external hard partons propagating in a relativistic fluid is developed, based on a semi-analytical solution of conformal fluid-dynamics. The soft particle production resulting from the jet-medium interaction is calculated and the recoil of the viscous medium is studied for different orientations of the relativistic jets, and for different values of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$.
