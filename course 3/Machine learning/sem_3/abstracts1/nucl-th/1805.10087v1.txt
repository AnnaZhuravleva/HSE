In this paper, we extend the framework of improved version of simplified method to take into account the tensor contribution ($i$SMT) and propose AQCM-T, tensor version of antisymmetrized quasi cluster model (AQCM). Although AQCM-T is phenomenological, we can treat the $^3S$-$^3D$ coupling in the deuteron-like $T=0$ $NN$-pair induced by the tensor interaction in a very simplified way, which allows us to proceed to heavier nuclei. Also we propose a new effective interaction, V2m, where the triplet-even channel of the Volkov No.2 interaction is weakened to 60% so as to reproduce the binding energy of $^4$He after including the tensor term of a realistic interaction. Using AQCM-T and the new interaction, the significant tensor contribution in $^4$He is shown, which is almost comparable the central interaction, where $D$-state mixes by 8% to the major $S$-state. The AQCM-T model with the new interaction is also applied to $^8$Be. It is found that the tensor suppression gives significant contribution to the short-range repulsion between two {\alpha} clusters.
