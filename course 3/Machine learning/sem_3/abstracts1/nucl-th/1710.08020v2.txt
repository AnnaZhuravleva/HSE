In this proceeding, we investigate the dynamical evolution of the $\sigma$ field with a trajectory across the 1st order phase transition boundary, using Langevin dynamics from the linear sigma model. We find the high order cumulants of the $\sigma$ field are largely enhanced during the dynamical evolution, compared with the equilibrium values, due to the supercooling effect of the first order phase transition.
