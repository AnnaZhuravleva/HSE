The moment of inertia of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is studied in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing suitable hyperon coupling constants. By this method, we find that the suggested radius of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range $R=12.957\sim12.246$ km by the observation $M$=1.97$\sim$2.05 M$_\odot$. We also find that the suggested moment of inertia $I$ of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range $I$=1.9073$\times$10$^{45}\sim$1.5940$\times10^{45}$ g.cm$^{2}$ by the observation $M$=1.97$\sim$2.05 M$_\odot$. Massive pulsars hint that the interaction inside them should be very "strong". Though hyperons considered will reduce the maximum mass, but in principle we may have models predicting maximum masses higher than 2 M${_\odot}$ by choosing suitable parameters, in a degree of freedom of hadron. Our calculations have proved the above and perfectly agree with the results both of Aaron W et al and P\'etri J et al.
