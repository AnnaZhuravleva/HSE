We establish a set of equations for moments of the distribution function. In the relaxation time approximations, these moments obey a coupled set of equations that can be truncated order-by-order. Solving the equations of moments, we are able to identify an attractor solution that controls a transition from a free streaming fixed point to a hydrodynamic fixed point. In particular, this attractor solution provides a renormalization of the effective value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, taking into account off-equilibrium effects.
