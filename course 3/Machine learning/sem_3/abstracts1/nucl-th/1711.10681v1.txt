The goal of this paper is to better understand the structure of fission fragment distributions by investigating the competition between the static structure of the collective manifold and stochastic dynamics. In particular, we study the characteristics of the tails of yield distributions, which correspond to very asymmetric fission. We use the stochastic Langevin framework to simulate the nuclear evolution after the system tunnels through the multi-dimensional potential barrier. For a representative sample of different initial configurations along the outer turning-point line, we define effective fission paths by computing a large number of Langevin trajectories. We extract the relative contribution of each such path to the fragment distribution. We then use nucleon localization functions along effective fission pathways to analyze the characteristics of prefragments at pre-scission configurations. We find that non-Newtonian Langevin trajectories, strongly impacted by the random force, produce the tails of the fission fragment distribution. The prefragments deduced from nucleon localizations are formed early and change little as the nucleus evolves towards scission. On the other hand, the system contains many nucleons that are not localized in the prefragments, even near the scission point. Such nucleons are rapidly distributed at scission to form the final fragments. Our study shows that only theoretical models of fission that account for some form of dissipative/stochastic dynamics can give an accurate description of the structure of fragment distributions. In particular, it should be nearly impossible to predict the tails of these distributions within the standard formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. At the same time, the large number of non-localized nucleons during fission suggests that adiabatic approaches are ill-suited to describe fission fragment properties.
