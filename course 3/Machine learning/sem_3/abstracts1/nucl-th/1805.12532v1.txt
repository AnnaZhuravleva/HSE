We analyze the data on the total cross sections for the {\mbox{$dd \to \eta{}^4{\rm He}$}} reaction close to threshold and look for possible $\eta ^4 {\rm He}$ bound states. We develop a framework in which the $\eta ^4{\rm He}$ optical potential is the key ingredient, rather than parameterizing the scattering matrix, as is usually done. The strength of this potential, together with some production parameters, are fitted to the available experimental data. The relationship of the scattering matrix to the optical potential is established using the Bethe-Salpeter equation and the $\eta ^4{\rm He}$ loop function incorporates the range of the interaction given by the experimental $^4 {\rm He}$ density. We find a bump structure in $|T|^2$ of the $\eta ^4$He amplitude $T$ below threshold. However, when we look for poles of the scattering matrix, with the fits of high precision, we get poles in the bound region, poles in the positive energy region or no poles at all. We can quantize the probability to find poles in the bound region in $62\%$.
