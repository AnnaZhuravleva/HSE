Event patterns extracted from anisotropic spectra of charged particles produced in lead-lead collisions at 2.76 TeV are investigated. We use an inverse power-law resulted from the QCD calculus to describe the transverse momentum spectrum in the hard scattering process, and a revised Erlang distribution resulted from a multisource thermal model to describe the transverse momentum spectrum and anisotropic flow in the soft excitation process. The pseudorapidity distribution is described by a three-Gaussian function which is a revision of the Landau hydrodynamic model. Thus, the event patterns at the kinetic freeze-out are displayed by the scatter plots of the considered particles in the three-dimensional velocity, momentum, and rapidity spaces.
