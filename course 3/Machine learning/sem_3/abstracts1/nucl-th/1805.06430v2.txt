It is thought that strong interactions within the Standard Model can generate bound-states in which non-Abelian gauge-bosons play a dual role, serving both as force and matter fields. In this context we introduce a novel approach to the hybrid-meson (valence-gluon+quark+antiquark) bound-state problem in relativistic quantum field theory. Exploiting the existence of strong two-body correlations in the gluon-quark, $q_g=[gq]$, and gluon-antiquark, $\bar q_g=[g\bar q]$ channels, we argue that a sound description of hybrid properties can be obtained by solving a coupled-pair of effectively two-body equations; and, consequently, that hybrids may be viewed as highly-correlated $q_g \bar q \leftrightarrow q \bar q_g$ bound-states. Analogies may be drawn between this picture of hybrid structure and that of baryons, in which quark+quark (diquark) correlations play a key role. The potential of this formulation is illustrated by calculating the spectrum of light-quark isovector hybrid mesons.
