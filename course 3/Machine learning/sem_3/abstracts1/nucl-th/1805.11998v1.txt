In this note we discuss the rapidity dependence of the initial and final conditions for hydrodynamic evolution as well as the resulting basic hadronic observables in heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=72$ GeV in the framework of a viscous hydro+cascade model vHLLE+UrQMD. The resulting rapidity dependences are driven to a big extent by the initial state, which is simulated with the UrQMD cascade. The results can serve as a prediction for future experiments such as the AFTER@LHC or the BES-II program at STAR.
