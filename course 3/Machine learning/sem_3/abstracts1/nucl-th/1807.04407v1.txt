A perturbative scheme in the framework of chiral effective field theory, in which neither pion exchanges nor contact terms are iterated to all orders, is developed for $NN$ scattering in partial waves where one-pion exchange is expected to be suppressed by the centrifugal barrier. The primary goal is to identify the lowest angular momenta at which perturbative treatment of chiral forces can apply. The difference from previous studies on peripheral waves will be explained. Calculations are carried out up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. The results show that perturbation theory applies to all partial waves but ${}^1S_0$, ${}^3S_1 - {}^3D_1$, and ${}^3P_0$, producing good agreement with the empirical phase shifts up to $k_\text{cm} = 300$ MeV.
