We have identified a mechanism of collective nuclear de-excitation in a Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{135}$Cs atoms in their isomeric states, $^{135m}$Cs, suitable for the generation of coherent gamma photons. The process described here does not correspond to single-pass amplification, which cannot occur in atomic systems due to the large shift between absorption and emission lines, nor does it require the large densities associated to standard Dicke super-radiance. It thus overcome the limitations that have been hindering the generation of coherent gamma rays in many systems. Therefore, we propose an approach for generation of coherent gamma rays, which relies on a combination of well established techniques of nuclear and atomic physics, and can be realized with currently available technology.
