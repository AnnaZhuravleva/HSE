The self-consistent model, developed previously to describe phonon coupling (PC) effects in magnetic moments of odd magic and semi-magic nuclei, is extended to quadrupole moments. It is based on the theory of finite Fermi systems with the use of the perturbation theory in $g_L^2$, where $g_L$ is the vertex creating the $L$-phonon. Accounting for the phonon tadpole diagrams is an important ingredient of this model. The calculation scheme is based on the Fayans energy density functional DF3-a and does not contain any adjusted parameters. The odd In and Sb isotopes are considered, which are the proton-odd neighbors of even tin nuclei. The $2^+_1$ phonon is taken into account which quadrupole moment is one ingredient of the calculation scheme. The corresponding values were found by us previously. Two main PC corrections, due to the phonon $Z$-factor and due to the phonon-induced interaction, have opposite signs and cancel strongly each other, leaving room for other `small' corrections, so that the resulting PC correction is much lower than the absolute values of each of two main ones. However, it remains noticeable, making the overall agreement with the data significantly better.
