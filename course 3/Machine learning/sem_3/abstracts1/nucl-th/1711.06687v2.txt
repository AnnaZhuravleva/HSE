Dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics is not always causal and can favor superluminal signal propagation under certain circumstances. On the other hand, high-energy nuclear collisions have a microscopic description in terms of QCD and are expected to follow the causality principle of special relativity. We discuss under which conditions the fluid evolutions for a radial expansion are hyperbolic and how the properties of the solutions are encoded in the associated characteristic curves. The expansion dynamics is causal in relativistic sense if the characteristic velocities are smaller than the speed of light. We obtain a concrete inequality from this constraint and discuss how it can be violated for certain initial conditions. We argue that causality poses a bound to the applicability of relativistic fluid dynamics. }
