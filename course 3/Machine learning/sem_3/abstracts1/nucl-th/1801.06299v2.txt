The elastic electromagnetic form factors in the space-like region and valence quark distribution functions for the K+ meson are calculated using the confining Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the help of the proper-time regularization scheme, which simulates quark confinement. In this model framework, the dynamics information on the nonperturbative aspects is obtained from quark propagators and bound state amplitudes via Bethe-Salpeter equations. We found that the results on the kaon form factors and valence quark distribution functions are qualitatively in excellent agreement with the existing kaon data as well as the perturbation QCD prediction at higher $Q^2$.
