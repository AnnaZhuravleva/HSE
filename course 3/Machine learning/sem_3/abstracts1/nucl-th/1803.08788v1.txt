In this contribution, dedicated to the memory of Walter Greiner, we discuss the structure and width of the recently established d*(2380) dibaryon, confronting the consequences of our Pion Assisted Dibaryons hadronic model with those of quark motivated calculations. In particular, its relatively small width of about 70 MeV favors hadronic structure for the d*(2380) dibaryon rather than a six-quark structure.
