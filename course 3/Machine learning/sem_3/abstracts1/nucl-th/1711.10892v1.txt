We calculate the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions of the Bohrs collective Hamiltonian with the help of the modified Poschl-Teller potential model within -unstable structure. Our numerical results for the ground state beta and gamma band heads together with the electric quadrupole B(E2) transition rates are displayed and compared with those available experimental data.
