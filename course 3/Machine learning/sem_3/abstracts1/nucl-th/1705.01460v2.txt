A significant excess of J/$\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_T < 0.3$ GeV/c) was observed by the ALICE and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions, which points to evidence of coherent photoproduction of J/$\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions. Theoretically, the photoproduction of J$/\psi$ in hadronic collisions raises questions about how spectator and non-spectator nucleons participate in the coherent reaction. For the first time, we argue that the strong interactions in the overlapping region of incoming nuclei may disturb the coherent production, leaving room for different coupling assumptions. Furthermore, first considerations of the destructive interference between photoproduction on ions moving in opposite directions in hadronic heavy-ion collisions are included.   This letter presents calculations of J$/\psi$ production from coherent photon-nucleus ($\gamma + A \rightarrow \text{J}/\psi + A$) interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC energies with both nucleus and spectator coupling hypotheses. The coherent J/$\psi$ yield as a function of centrality and differential distributions as a function of transverse momentum, azimuthal angle and rapidity in different centrality bins are shown and found to be significantly different for different coupling scenarios, calling for future experimental measurements.
