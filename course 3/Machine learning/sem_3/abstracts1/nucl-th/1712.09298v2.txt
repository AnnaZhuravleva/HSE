Charge fluctuations for a baryon-neutral quark-gluon plasma have been calculated in lattice gauge theory. These fluctuations provide a well-posed rigorous representation of the quark chemistry of the vacuum for temperatures above T_c >~ 155 MeV. Due to the finite lifetime and spatial extent of the fireball created in relativistic heavy ion collisions, charge-charge correlations can only equilibrate for small volumes due to the finite time required to transport charge. This constraint leads to charge correlations at finite relative position that evolve with time. The source and evolution of such correlations is determined by the evolution of the charge fluctuation and the diffusion constant for light quarks. Here, calculations are presented for the evolution of such correlations superimposed onto hydrodynamic simulations. Results are similar to preliminary measurements from STAR, but significant discrepancies remain.
