The inclusive spectra of secondaries produced in soft (minimum-bias) p+Pb collisions at LHC energy are calculated in the frame of the Quark-Gluon String Model, by including the inelastic screening corrections (percolation effects). These effects are expected to be quite large at the very high energies, and they should drive down the spectra in the midrapidity region more than 2 times, at sqrt(sNN)=5 TeV.
