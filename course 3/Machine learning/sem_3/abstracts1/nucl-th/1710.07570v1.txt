The pairing interaction is one of the most important contribution of the residual interaction and then, it is of major importance for the study of many-body systems. One can get solutions of the pairing Hamiltonian throught the Bardeen-Cooper-Schieffer (BCS) or the Lipkin-Nogami (LN) approximations but, the pairing Hamiltonian admit exact solution worked out by Richardson. Nuclei far away from the stability line have important correlations with the continuum part of the energy spectrum, due that the Fermi level is very close to the contiuum thershold. The correlations with the continuum can be included in the many-body description through the complex energy states, called Gamow states. In this work we compare the approximates and exact solutions of the pairing Hamiltonian in real and complex-energy representations. In the application of this formulation to the symmetric Lipkin model, we found that the LN solution is in a good agreement with the exact one; besides, the extension of the BCS solution to the complex energy plane gives solution even for strength below the critical one, which is purely imaginary.
