The general idea of information entropy provided by C.E. Shannon "hangs over everything we do" and can be applied to a great variety of problems once the connection between a distribution and the quantities of interest is found. The Shannon information entropy essentially quantify the information of a quantity with its specific distribution, for which the information entropy based methods have been deeply developed in many scientific areas including physics. The dynamical properties of heavy-ion collisions (HICs) process make it difficult and complex to study the nuclear matter and its evolution, for which Shannon information entropy theory can provide new methods and observables to understand the physical phenomena both theoretically and experimentally. To better understand the processes of HICs, the main characteristics of typical models, including the quantum molecular dynamics models, thermodynamics models, and statistical models, etc, are briefly introduced. The typical applications of Shannon information theory in HICs are collected, which cover the chaotic behavior in branching process of hadron collisions, the liquid-gas phase transition in HICs, and the isobaric difference scaling phenomenon for intermediate mass fragments produced in HICs of neutron-rich systems. Even though the present applications in heavy-ion collision physics are still relatively simple, it would shed light on key questions we are seeking for. It is suggested to further develop the information entropy methods in nuclear reactions models, as well as to develop new analysis methods to study the properties of nuclear matters in HICs, especially the evolution of dynamics system.
