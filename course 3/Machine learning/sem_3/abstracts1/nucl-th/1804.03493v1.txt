In an era of high-precision determinations of QGP properties a full incorporation of fluid dynamical fluctuations into our models has become crucial, in particular, when describing the dynamics of small systems or near the conjectured QCD critical point. In this talk we discuss some effects of the propagation of these fluctuations. For LHC physics we focus on fluctuations in the energy-momentum tensor, while the impact of fluctuations in the diffusive net-baryon density is studied to improve our knowledge on the formation of critical fluctuations being searched in current and future BES programs.
