A novel shape evolution in the Sn isotopes by the state-of-the-art application of the Monte Carlo Shell Model calculations is presented in a unified way for the 100-138Sn isotopes. A large model space consisting of eight single-particle orbits for protons and neutrons is taken with the fixed Hamiltonian and effective charges, where protons in the 1g9/2 orbital are fully activated. While the significant increase of the B(E2; 0+1 -> 2+1) value, seen around 110Sn as a function of neutron number (N), has remained a major puzzle over decades, it is explained as a consequence of the shape evolution driven by proton excitations from the 1g9/2 orbital. A second-order quantum phase transition is found around N=66, connecting the phase of such deformed shapes to the spherical pairing phase. The shape and shell evolutions are thus described, covering topics from the Gamow-Teller decay of 100Sn to the enhanced double magicity of 132Sn.
