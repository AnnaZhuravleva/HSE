The final state hadronic composition of proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV as a function of charged particle multiplicity density is studied. The thermal model is adjusted to match the experimental conditions in order to understand the effect of the experimental cuts on rapidity and multiplicity. This study indicates that the measured hadronic composition under a simultaneous cut on rapidity and multiplicity does not coincide with the fireball hadronic composition. Excluding proton to pion ratio, the adjusted model can explain the measured particle ratios. Therefore, the observed strangeness enhancement as a function of charged particle multiplicity density could be an effect of the experimental cuts.
