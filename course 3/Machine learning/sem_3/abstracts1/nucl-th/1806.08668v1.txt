We compute the spin excess for the neutrinos radiated in the process of electron capture beta decay of partially polarized nuclei. The results of computation are presented for the $^{119}$Sb nuclei polarized by the strong hyperfine field in a ferromagnetic substance. This system was suggested as a possible source of directed neutrino radiation. We directly compute the spin excess of radiated neutrinos and show that it is greater than that estimated previously under simplifying assumptions.
