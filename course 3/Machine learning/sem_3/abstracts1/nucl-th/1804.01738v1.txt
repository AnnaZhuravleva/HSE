Tensor force is an important component in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, nevertheless, the role of the tensor force in the spin properties in finite nuclei is much less clear. In this report, we mainly focus on our recent progress on this topic about the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory and the corresponding tensor effects on the spin-orbit splittings in neutron drops. This will serve as an important guide for future microscopic derivations of the relativistic and non-relativistic nuclear energy density functionals.
