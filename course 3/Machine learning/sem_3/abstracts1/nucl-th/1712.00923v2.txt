Using our developed new relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code, we investigate the temperature dependence of shear and bulk viscosities from comparison with the ALICE data; single particle spectra and collective flows at Pb+Pb $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We find that from the comprehensive analyses of centrality dependence of single particle spectra and collective flows, we can extract the detailed information of the QGP bulk property, without being smeared by the final state interactions.
