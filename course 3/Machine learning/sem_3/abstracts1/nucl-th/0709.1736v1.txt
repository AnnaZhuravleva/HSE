This paper presents part of an internal LANL Progress Report on LAQGSM03.03, an upgrade of the Los Alamos version of the Quark-Gluon String Model event generator for MCNPX/6 and MARS15 transport codes and on its validation and testing against a large variety of recent measurements. We present here an analysis with LAQGSM03.03 of the recent PHENIX mid-rapidity spectra of pi+, pi-, K+, K-, p, and p-bar produced in ultra-relativistic p + p interactions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV; GSI cross sections for the fragmentation of Pb208 at 1 GeV/nucleon on Be9; fragmentation cross sections of Si28 on H, C, Al, Cu, Sn, and Pb at energies from 290 to 1200 MeV/nucleon measred recently at HIMAC and BNL; recent HIMAC data on B, Be, Li, and He production cross sections from fragmentation of C12 on H, C, Al, Cu, Sn, and Pb at 290 and 400 MeV/nucleon; BNL data on fragmentation cross sections of Fe56 on H, C, Al, Cu, and Pb targets at 1.05 GeV/nucleon; recent pi+ and pi- spectra from 6.4, 12.3, and 17.5 GeV/c p + Be9 from the E910 BNL measurements; and fragmentation cross sections of Ca40, Ca48, Ni58, and Ni64 on Be9 and Ta181 at 140 MeV/nucleon, and of Kr86 at 64 MeV/nucleon on the same targets measured recently at NSCL-MSU and RARF-RIKEN, respectively.
