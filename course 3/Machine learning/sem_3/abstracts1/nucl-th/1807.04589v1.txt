The possibility of quantum entanglement leading to a seemingly thermal distribution of the initial partonic state that maps to the final hadronic state in the evolution of the deconfined phase generated in relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed in the context of early thermalization and final state particle distributions obtained in experiments at RHIC and the LHC.
