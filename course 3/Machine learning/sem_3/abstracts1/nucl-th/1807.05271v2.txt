We present the microscopic model for collective effects, built on string-string interactions (string shoving and rope hadronization), recently implemented in the PYTHIA 8 and DIPSY event generators. Rope hadronization is shown to give a good description of strangeness enhancement across pp, pA and AA collisions systems, while string shoving qualitatively describes the ridge observed in pp collisions.
