In this work, the self energies of $\pi^0$ and $\pi^{\pm}$ up to one loop order have been calculated in the limit of weak external magnetic field. The effective masses are explicitly dependent on the magnetic field which are modified significantly for the pseudoscalar coupling due to weak field approximation of the external field. On the other hand, for the pseudovector coupling, there is a modest increment in the effective masses of the pions. These theoretical developments are relevant for the study of the phenomenological aspect of mesons in the context of neutron stars as well as heavy ion collisions.
