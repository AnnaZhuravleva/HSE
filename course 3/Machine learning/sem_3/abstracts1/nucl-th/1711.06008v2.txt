A non-relativistic quark coalescence model is formulated for polarized vector mesons and baryons of spin-1/2 octet and spin-3/2 decuplet. With the spin density matrix, one can compute in a uniform way the polarizations of vector mesons and baryons from those of quarks and antiquarks with explicit momentum dependence. The results are compared to that obtained from kinetic and statistical models for hadrons.
