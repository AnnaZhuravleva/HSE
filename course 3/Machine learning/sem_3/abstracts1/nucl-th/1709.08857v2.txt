We present a multi-polytrope approach to describe high-mass twins fulfilling chiral effective field theory estimations of the neutron star equation state and test it against the appearance of mixed phases at the hadron-quark interface. In addition, we discuss astrophysical applications of this method and expected future measurements that shall further constrain neutron star matter and the understanding of the QCD phase diagram.
