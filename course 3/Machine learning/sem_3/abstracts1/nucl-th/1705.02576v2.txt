We calculate the high energy photon production from the Pb+Pb collisions for different centrality classes at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energy. The jet energy loss in the jet fragmentation, jet-photon conversion and jet bremsstrahlung is considered by using the Wang-Huang-Sarcevic (WHS) and Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff (BDMPS) models. We use the (1+1)-dimensional ideal relativistic hydrodynamics to study the collective transverse flow and space-time evolution of the quark gluon plasma (QGP). The numerical results agree well with the ALICE data of the direct photons from the Pb+Pb collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV) for 0-20\%, 20-40\% and 40-80\% centrality classes.
