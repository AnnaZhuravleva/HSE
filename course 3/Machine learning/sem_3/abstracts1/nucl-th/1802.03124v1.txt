Using a theory of large amplitude collective motion, the adiabatic self-consistent collective coordinate method, we derive reaction path for the fusion process at sub-barrier energies. The collective Hamiltonian to describe the fusion process is constructed, based on the obtained reaction path and canonical variables. We study the reaction of N=Z stable nuclei, alpha+16O, 16O+16O, and alpha+12C. The results suggest that, after two nuclei touch, the reaction path is significantly deviated from the simple relative motion, which may affect the deep sub-barrier fusion cross section.
