$0s$-orbit $\Lambda$ states in $p$-shell double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei ($^{\ \,A}_{\Lambda\Lambda}Z$), $^{\ \,8}_{\Lambda\Lambda}\textrm{Li}$, $^{\ \,9}_{\Lambda\Lambda}\textrm{Li}$, $^{10,11,12}_{\ \ \ \ \ \Lambda\Lambda}\textrm{Be}$, $^{12,13}_{\ \ \Lambda\Lambda}\textrm{B}$, and $^{\,14}_{\Lambda\Lambda}\textrm{C}$ are investigated. Microscopic cluster models are applied to core nuclear part and a potential model is adopted for $\Lambda$ particles. The $\Lambda$-core potential is a folding potential obtained with effective $G$-matrix $\Lambda$-$N$ interactions, which reasonably reproduce energy spectra of $^{A-1}_{\,\Lambda}Z$. System dependence of the $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ binding energies is understood by the core polarization energy from nuclear size reduction. Reductions of nuclear sizes and $E2$ transition strengths by $\Lambda$ particles are also discussed.
