A novel higher order theory of relaxation of heat and viscosity is proposed based on corrections to the traditional treatment of the relativistic energy density. In the framework of generalized Bjorken scaling solution to accelerating longitudinal flow we point out that the energy flux can be consequently set to zero in the stationary case, independently of the choice of a specific local rest frame, like the Landau-Lifshitz or Eckart one. We investigate and compare several cooling and re-heating scenarios for the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) within this approach.
