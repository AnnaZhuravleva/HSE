By employing a recently constructed hyperon-nucleon potential the equation of state of \beta-equilibrated and charge neutral nucleonic matter is calculated. The hyperon-nucleon potential is a low-momentum potential which is obtained within a renormalization group framework. Based on the Hartree-Fock approximation at zero temperature the densities at which hyperons appear in neutron stars are estimated. For several different bare hyperon-nucleon potentials and a wide range of nuclear matter parameters it is found that hyperons in neutron stars are always present. These findings have profound consequences for the mass and radius of neutron stars.
