The approximate solution of Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian in rigid deformed nucleus case for Hulthen potential with minimal length effect was investigated using Asymptotic Iteration Method. Asymptotic Iteration Method was used to solve approximately the Bohr-Mottelson Hamiltonian to obtain energy spectrum and un-normalized wave function. The energy spectrum was calculated numerically using the Matlab software. The un-normalized wave function was expressed in the hypergeometric term. The results showed that the energy spectrum increased due to the increasing minimal length parameter. The energy spectrum also increased by the increasing range of potential.
