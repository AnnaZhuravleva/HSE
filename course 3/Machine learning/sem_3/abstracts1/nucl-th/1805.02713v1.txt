We have implemented spherical harmonics in default Wood Saxon distribution of the HIJING model and calculated various physical observables such as transverse momentum, charged particle multiplicity, nuclear modification factor and particle ratios for charged particles at top RHIC energy with collisions of Uranium (U) nuclei. Results have been compared with available experimental data. We observe that, a particular type of collision configuration can produce significant magnitude change in observables. We have noticed that the tip-tip configuration shows higher magnitude of particle yield in central collisions, while the body-body configuration shows higher value in the cases of peripheral collisions, with the flip in the trend occurring for the mid-central U+U collisions.
