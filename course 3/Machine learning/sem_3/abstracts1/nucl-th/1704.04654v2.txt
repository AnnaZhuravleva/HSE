Combining event-by-event hydrodynamics with heavy quark energy loss we compute correlations between the heavy and soft sectors for elliptic and triangular flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$ of D$^0$ mesons in PbPb collisions at $2.76$ TeV and $5.02$ TeV. Our results indicate that $v_3$ is strongly influenced by the fragmentation temperature and that it builds up later than $v_2$ during the evolution of the system.
