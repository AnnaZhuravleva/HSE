We study the charmonium suppression in different evolutions of quark gluon plasma (QGP) based on the transport model. In the colliding energies of Large Hadron Collider, charmonium final yields are dominated by the recombination of charm and anti-charm quarks in the deconfined phase. Heavy quark diffusions depend less on the shear viscosity of the bulk medium, which makes the J/psi nuclear modification factor in the entire pT bin shows weak dependence on the shear viscosity of QGP. However, charmonium with high transverse momentum pT, can only be produced in the early stage of nuclear collisions, and is sensitive to the initial energy density (or temperature) of QGP, and can be a probe of the initial dynamical evolutions of quark gluon plasma.
