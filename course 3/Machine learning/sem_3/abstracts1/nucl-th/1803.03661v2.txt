The $\Delta$-isobar degrees of freedom are included in the covariant   density functional (CDF) theory to study the equation of state (EoS)   and composition of dense matter in compact stars. In addition to   $\Delta$'s we include the full octet of baryons, which allows us to   study the interplay between the onset of delta isobars and hyperonic   degrees of freedom. Using both the Hartree and Hartree-Fock   approximation we find that $\Delta$'s appear already at densities   slightly above the saturation density of nuclear matter for a wide   range of the meson-$\Delta$ coupling constants. This delays the   appearance of hyperons and significantly affects the gross   properties of compact stars. Specifically, $\Delta$'s soften the   EoS at low densities but stiffen it at high densities. This   softening reduces the radius of a canonical $1.4 M_\odot$ star by up   to 2~km for a reasonably attractive $\Delta$ potential in matter,   while the stiffening results in larger maximum masses of compact   stars. We conclude that the hypernuclear CDF parametrizations that   satisfy the 2$M_\odot$ maximum mass constraint remain valid when   $\Delta$ isobars are included, with the important consequence that   the resulting stellar radii are shifted toward lower values, which   is in agreement with the analysis of neutron star radii.
