The prompt neutron averaged number and the dependence of prompt neutron yield on fragment mass {\nu}(A) of photofission of actinide nuclei 235U and 238U in the giant dipole resonance energy range has been parameterized. This allows us to describe the observed changes of saw-tooth behavior of neutron yield from the light and heavy fragments using few energy and nucleon composition dependent free parameters and to predict {\nu}(A) for other actinide isotopes.
