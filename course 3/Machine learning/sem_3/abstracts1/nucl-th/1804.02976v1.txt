The description of dynamical fluctuations near the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding the existing and upcoming experimental data from the beam energy scan programs. In this talk we discuss the evolution of fluctuations of the net-baryon density as given by a stochastic diffusion equation. We study equilibrium as well as dynamical systems for which we can show the impact of nonequilibrium effects on the second-order moment.
