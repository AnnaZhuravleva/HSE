We study the energy dependence of global polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in peripheral $Au-Au$ collisions. We combine the calculation of vorticity and strange chemical potential in the framework of kinetic Quark-Gluon String Model with the anomalous mechanism related to axial vortical effect. The earlier found effect of helicity separation implies the quadrupole structure of longitudinal vorticity. We pay special attention to the temperature dependent contribution related to gravitational anomaly and found that the preliminary RHIC data are compatible with its suppression discovered earlier in lattice calculations. The antihyperons polarization is excessing that of hyperons and the difference is more pronounced at smaller energies.
