We review recent experimental and theoretical progress in understanding the microscopic details of clustering in light nuclei. We discuss recent experimental results on $\alpha$-conjugate systems, molecular structures in neutron-rich nuclei, and constraints for ab initio theory. We then examine nuclear clustering in a wide range of theoretical methods, including the resonating group and generator coordinate methods, antisymmetrized molecular dynamics, Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\"opke wave function and container model, no-core shell model methods, continuum quantum Monte Carlo, and lattice effective field theory.
