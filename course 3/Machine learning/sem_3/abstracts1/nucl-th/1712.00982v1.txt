Recent results of the description of quadrupole moments of odd semi-magic nuclei are briefly reviewed. They are based on the self-consistent theory of finite Fermi systems with account for the phonon-particle coupling (PC) effects. The self-consistent model for describing the PC effects was developed previously for magnetic moments. Account for the non-pole diagrams is an important ingredient of this model. In addition to previously reported results for the odd In and Sb isotopes, which are the proton-odd neighbors of even tin nuclei, we present new results for odd Bi isotopes, the odd neighbors of even lead isotopes. In general, account for the PC corrections makes the agreement with the experimental data significantly better.
