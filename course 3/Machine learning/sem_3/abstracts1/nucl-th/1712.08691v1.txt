Searches of neutrinoless double-beta decay require information on the value of the nuclear matrix elements that rule the process to plan and interpret experiments. At present, however, even the matrix elements obtained with the most reliable many-body approaches do not agree to each other better than a factor two or three. A usual test of the many-body calculations is the comparison to several nuclear observables, but so far no nuclear structure property has been found to show a good correlation to neutrinoless double-beta decay. Here we propose that double charge-exchange experiments can offer a very valuable tool to provide insights on neutrinoless double-beta decay. Double charge-exchange reactions are being currently performed in various laboratories worldwide and aim to find the novel nuclear collectivity given by double Gamow-Teller excitations. Our results suggest a good linear correlation between double Gamow-Teller transitions to the ground state of the final nucleus and neutrinoless double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements. The correlation seems robust across $pf$-shell nuclei.
