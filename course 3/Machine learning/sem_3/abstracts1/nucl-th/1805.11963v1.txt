Constraints set on key parameters of the nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) by the values of the tidal deformability, inferred from GW170817, are examined by using a diverse set of relativistic and non-relativistic mean field models. These models are consistent with bulk properties of finite nuclei as well as with the observed lower bound on the maximum mass of neutron star $\sim 2 ~ {\rm M}_\odot$. The tidal deformability shows a strong correlation with specific linear combinations of the isoscalar and isovector nuclear matter parameters associated with the EoS. Such correlations suggest that a precise value of the tidal deformability can put tight bounds on several EoS parameters, in particular, on the slope of the incompressibility and the curvature of the symmetry energy. The tidal deformability obtained from the GW170817 and its UV/optical/infrared counterpart sets the radius of a canonical $1.4~ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ neutron star to be $11.82\leqslant R_{1.4}\leqslant13.72$ km.
