In order to study the correlation between clusters and nucleons in light nuclei, we formulate a new superposed THSR wave function which describes both spatial large spreading and cluster-correlated dynamics of valence nucleons. By using the new THSR wave function, the binding energy of 9B is essentially improved comparing with our previous studies. We calculate the excited states of 9B and obtain the energy spectrum of 9B which is consistent with the experimental results, including prediction of the 1/2+ excited state of 9B which is not fixed yet experimentally. We study the proton dynamics in 9B and find that the cluster-proton correlation plays an essential role for the proton dynamics in the ground state of 9B. Further more, we discuss the density distribution of the valence proton with special attention to its tail structure. Finally, the resonance nature of excited states of 9B is illustrated by comparing root-mean-square radii between the ground and excited states.
