Using a recent parametrization of the fully antisymmetric three-nucleon wave function, based on the Paris and CD-Bonn potentials, we analyze the momentum distributions of constituents in 3He, as well as the spin-dependent observables for (3He,d) and (3He,p) breakup reactions. Special attention is paid to the region of small relative momenta of the 3He constituents, where the single parameter, D_2, has determining role for the spin-dependent observables in the d+p channel. This fact results in some useful relations between experimental observables.
