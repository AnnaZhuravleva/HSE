The incomplete fusion dynamics of $^6$Li + $^{209}$Bi collisions at energies above the Coulomb barrier is investigated. The classical dynamical model implemented in the {\sc platypus} code is used to understand and quantify the impact of both $^6$Li resonance states and transfer-triggered breakup modes (involving short-lived projectile-like nuclei such as $^8$Be and $^5$Li) on the formation of incomplete fusion products. Model calculations explain the experimental incomplete-fusion excitation function fairly well, indicating that (i) delayed direct breakup of $^6$Li reduces the incomplete fusion cross-sections, and (ii) the neutron-stripping channel practically determines those cross-sections.
