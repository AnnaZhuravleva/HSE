A unitary description for wobbling motion in even-even and even-odd nuclei is presented. In both cases compact formulas for wobbling frequencies are derived. The accuracy of the harmonic approximation is studied for the yrast as well as for the excited bands in the even-even case. Important results for the structure of the wave function and its behavior inside the two wells of the potential energy function corresponding to the Bargmann representation are pointed out. Applications to $^{158}$Er and $^{163}$Lu reveal a very good agreement with available data. Indeed, the yrast energy levels in the even-even case and the first four triaxial super-deformed bands, TSD1,TSD2,TSD3 and TSD4, are realistically described. Also, the results agree with the data for the E2 and M1 intra- as well as inter-band transitions. Perspectives for the formalism development and an extensive application to several nuclei from various regions of the nuclides chart are presented.
