In this paper, we have investigated the structural properties of rotating neutron stars using the numerical RNS code and the equation of states which have been calculated within the lowest order constrained variational approach. In order to calculate the equation of state of nuclear matter, we have used UV$_{14}$ $+$TNI and AV$_{18}$ potentials. Here, we have computed the maximum mass of the neutron star and the corresponding equatorial radius at different angular velocity. We have also computed the structural properties of Keplerian rotating neutron star for maximum mass configuration, $M_{K}$, $R_{K}$, $f_{K}$ and $j_{max}$.
