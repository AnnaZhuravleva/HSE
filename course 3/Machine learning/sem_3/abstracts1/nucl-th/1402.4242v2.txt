Within the nonlinear relativistic mean field (NL-RMF) model, we show that both the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities and the maximum mass of neutron stars are sensitive to the skewness coefficient $J_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter. Using experimental constraints on the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter at supra-saturation densities from flow data in heavy ion collisions and the astrophysical observation of a large mass neutron star PSR J0348+0432, with the former favoring a smaller $J_0$ while the latter a larger $J_0$, we extract a constraint of $-494 \mathrm{MeV}\leq J_0\leq -10 \mathrm{MeV}$ based on the NL-RMF model. This constraint is compared with the results obtained in other analyses.
