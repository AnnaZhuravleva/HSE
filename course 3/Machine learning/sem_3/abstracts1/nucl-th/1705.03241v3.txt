Pion production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at intermediate energies was modeled in the framework of the Isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model. The effects of nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations in initialization and mean-field potential, isospin-dependent in-medium baryon-baryon elastic and inelastic cross sections and pion in-medium effect are all considered in this model. It is found that the ratio and yields of $\pi^{-}$and $\pi^{+}$ in Au+Au reaction at 400 MeV/nucleon reproduce the FOPI/GSI data very well especially with a soft symmetry energy in the present transport model. Predictions on the single and double $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio are made for the isotope reaction systems $^{132}\rm {Sn}+^{124}\rm {Sn}$ and $^{108}\rm {Sn}+^{112}\rm {Sn}$ at 300 MeV/nucleon since related experiments are being carried out at RIKEN/Japan.
