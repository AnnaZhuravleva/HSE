Current precision big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) studies motivate us to revisit the neutron lifespan in the plasma medium of the early universe. The mechanism we explore is the Fermi-blocking of decay electrons and neutrinos by plasma. As result, neutrons live longer and we find a significant 6.4\% modification of neutron abundance in the BBN era arising from in plasma modification of the neutron lifetime. This effect can influence the final abundances of the light elements in BBN.
