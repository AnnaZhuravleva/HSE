Producing kaon mesons in heavy-ion collisions at beam energies below their threshold energy is an important way to investigate the properties of dense nuclear matter. In this study, based on the newly updated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model, we introduce the kaon-nucleon (KN) potential, including both the scalar and vector (also dubbed Lorentz-like) aspects. We revisit the influence of the KN potential on the collective flow of K$^{+}$ mesons produced in Au+Au collisions at $E_{lab}$ = 1.5 GeV/nucleon and find that the contribution of the newly included Lorentz-like force is very important, particulary for describing the directed flow of K$^{+}$. Finally, the corresponding KaoS data of both directed and elliptic flows can be simultaneously reproduced well.
