The magnetic field plays a major role in the searching of the chiral magnetic effect in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. If the lifetime of the magnetic field is too short, as expected by simulations of the field in the vacuum, the chiral magnetic effect will be largely suppressed. However, the lifetime of the magnetic field will become longer when the QGP medium response is considered. We give an estimate of the effect, especially considering the magnetic field response of the QGP medium, and compare it with the experimental results of background-subtracted correlator $H$ at RHIC and LHC energies. The results show that our method explains better for the experimental results at the top RHIC energy than that of the LHC energy.
