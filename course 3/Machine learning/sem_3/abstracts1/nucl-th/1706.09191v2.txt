The Quark-Hadron Chiral Parity-Doublet model (Q$\chi$P) is applied to calculate compact star properties in the presence of a deconfinement phase transition. Within this model, a consistent description of nuclear matter properties, chiral symmetry restoration, and a transition from hadronic to quark and gluonic degrees of freedom is possible within one unified approach. We find that the equation of state obtained is consistent with recent perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results and is able to accommodate observational constraints of massive and small neutron stars. Furthermore, we show that important features of the equation of state, such as the symmetry energy and its slope, are well within their observational constraints.
