We discuss differences between the IP-Glasma model and typical wounded-nucleon model like initial conditions. We point out that the IP-Glasma initial state is more compact in the transverse plane and produces a significant initial flow, both of which contribute to an increased radial flow in the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution. A larger bulk viscosity, compared to calculations that use other initial state models, is required to compensate for these effects and find agreement with experimental data. We further demonstrate the importance of the initial momentum anisotropy of the glasma for anisotropy measures in small collision systems such as p+Pb.
