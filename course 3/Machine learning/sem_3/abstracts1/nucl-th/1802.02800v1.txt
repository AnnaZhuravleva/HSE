The basic analytical forms of the deuteron wave function (DWF) in a coordinate representation have been reviewed. The asymptotic behaviour of DWF near the origin of coordinates has been analyzed. New analytical forms of DWF as a product of the exponential function r^n and the sum of the exponential terms Ai*exp(-ai*r3) are applied for the calculation of the polarization characteristics of the deuteron. Numerical calculations have been done for realistic phenomenological potential of Nijmegen groups, Reid93. In the paper, the results of the angular asymmetry for deuteron vector t10, t11 and tensor t20, t21, t22 polarizations are described. Along with the angular asymmetry, the momentum asymmetry for deuteron vector t1i polarizations is described too. The influence of DWF approximation in a coordinate representation on the subsequent results of the calculations of the tensor polarization t20 is investigated. A comparison of values t20 is made at 70 degree if to apply four different DWF approximations to the same NN-potential Reid93. When the received theoretical values t20 are compared with the experimental data of world collaborations and reviews, a good coordination for the area of values momentum p=1-4fm-1 is observed. Using the method of invariant amplitude, spin observables in backward elastic dp-scattering-tensor analyzing power T20 and polarization transfer K0 have been calculated. The values of K0 and correlation K0-T20 are compared with experimental data. In a wide range of momentums p and scattering angles, the asymmetry for the tensor analyzing power T20 and T22 has been presented, which characterizes the photoproduction of negative pi- meson from deuteron in reaction g(d, pi-)pp. A symmetry of values T20 and T22 concerning a 90 angle is observed. The ratio R for the vector Px and tensor Pxz polarizations is characterized by angular asymmetry....
