The transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and thermal conductivity of a magnetized hot QCD matter have been estimated in the strong field limit. To model the hot QCD matter in the presence of magnetic field, a quasi-particle description of the hot QCD equation of state has been adopted. The temperature dependence of viscous coefficients (bulk and shear viscosities) and thermal conductivity have been obtained by considering, $1\rightarrow2$ processes ($g\rightarrow q\bar{q}$) and 2 $\rightarrow$ 2 quark-antiquark scattering processes in the presence of the strong magnetic field. All this has been done by setting up a $1+1$-dimensional effective covariant kinetic theory for the lowest Landau level quarks in the strong field limit. This enables one to include the mean-field contributions in terms of non-trivial quasi-particle energy dispersions to the transport coefficients. Such contributions have significant impact at temperature regions which are not very far away from the QCD transition point. To realize the significance of various processes in the medium, relative behavior of the transport coefficients in the thermal medium has been investigated through their respective ratios.
