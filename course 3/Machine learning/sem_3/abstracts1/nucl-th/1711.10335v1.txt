Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for two neutrino double beta decays are discussed in terms of the Fermi Surface Quasi-Particle (FSQP) Model. The evaluated NMEs agree with the observed NMEs . The new NMEs for two neutrino double beta decays from Kr78, Cd106, Ba130, and Pd110 were evaluated by FSQP. The NMEs show shell configuration dependence. Impacts of the FSQP NMEs for two neutrino double beta decays on the NMEs for neutrino less double beta decays are discussed.
