The contribution of collective or reaction channels to a local optical model potential, OMP, can now be readily calculated as a dynamical polarization potential, DPP. The resulting local DPPs commonly have undulatory (`wavy') features, including local regions of emissivity in the imaginary component. This can be attributed to $l$-dependence of the underlying formal non-local and $l$-dependent DPP. Here we show that the $l$-independent proton OMPs, that have the same $S$-matrix $S_{lj}$ as phenomenological $l$-dependent potentials, exhibit undulations that are qualitatively similar to undulations of local DPPs generated by channel coupling. The $l$-dependent phenomenological potentials which we study give the best existing fits to the relevant elastic scattering data. The same therefore applies to the undulatory potentials presented here, which give exactly the same scattering. In addition, we show that $l$-dependent potentials based, unlike the phenomenological potentials, on smooth Woods-Saxon forms, also have undulatory $l$-independent equivalents, including emissive regions. This suggests that undularity (`waviness') is a generic property of potentials that are $l$-independent equivalents of $l$-dependent potentials. Implications for the validity of folding models based on a local density model are noted.
