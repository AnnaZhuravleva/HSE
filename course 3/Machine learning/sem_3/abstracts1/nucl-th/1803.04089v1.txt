Energy spectra of $0s$-orbit $\Lambda$ states in $p$-shell $\Lambda$ hypernuclei ($^{A}_\Lambda Z$) and those in $^{19}_{\Lambda}\textrm{F}$ are studied with the microscopic cluster model and antisymmetrized molecular dynamics using the $G$-matrix effective $\Lambda N$ ($\Lambda NG$) interactions. Spin-dependent terms of the ESC08a version of the $\Lambda NG$ interactions are tested and phenomenologically tuned to reproduce observed energy spectra in $p$-shell $^{A}_\Lambda Z$. Spin-dependent contributions of the $\Lambda N$ interactions to spin-doublet splitting and excitation energies are discussed. Energy spectra for unobserved excited states in $p$-shell $^{A}_\Lambda Z$ and $^{19}_{\Lambda}\textrm{F}$ are predicted with the modified $\Lambda NG$ interactions.
