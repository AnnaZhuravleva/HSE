In this work we show the modifications of nucleon mass and nucleon radius with the help of the extended Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model. We argue that even small departures above nuclear equilibrium density with constant nucleon mass require an energy transfer from the repulsive mean field to the quarks forming nucleon massive bags in Nuclear Matter (NM), together with the decrease in the nucleon volume. The transfer, which is proportional to pressure and absent in a standard RMF approach, provides good values for nuclear compressibility, symmetry energy and its slope. Different courses of the Equation of State (EOS), which depend on the energy transfer, are considered.
