In this manuscript, we analyze the structural properties of $Z=119$ superheavy nuclei in the mass range of 284 $\le$ A $\le$ 375 within the framework of deformed relativistic mean field theory (RMF) and calculate the binding energy, radii, quadrupole deformation parameter, separation energies and density profile. Further, a competition between possible decay modes such as $\alpha-$decay, $\beta-$decay and spontaneous fission (SF) of the isotopic chain of $Z=119$ superheavy nuclei under study is systematically analyzed within self-consistent relativistic mean field model. Moreover, our analysis confirmed that $\alpha-$decay is restricted within the mass range 284 $\leq$ A $\leq$ 296 and thus being the dominant decay channel in this mass range. However, for the mass range 297 $\leq$ A $\leq$ 375 the nuclei are unable to survive fission and hence SF is the principal mode of decay for these isotopes. There is no possibility of $\beta-$decay for the considered isotopic chain. In addition, we forecasted the mode of decay $^{284-296}$119 as one $\alpha$ chain from $^{284}$119 and $^{296}$119, two consistent $\alpha$ chains from $^{285}$119 and $^{295}$119, three consistent $\alpha$ chains from $^{286}$119 and $^{294}$119, four consistent alpha chains from $^{287}$119, six consistent alpha chains from $^{288-293}$119. Also from our analysis we inferred that for the isotopes $^{264-266,269}$Bh both $\alpha$ decay and SF are equally competent and can decay via either of these two modes. Thus, such studies can be of great significance to the experimentalists in very near future for synthesizing $Z=119$ superheavy nuclei.
