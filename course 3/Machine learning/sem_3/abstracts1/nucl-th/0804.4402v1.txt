Microscopic calculations show a strong parity dependence of the nuclear level density at low excitation energy of a nucleus. Previously, this dependence has either been neglected or only implemented in the initial and final channels of Hauser-Feshbach calculations. We present an indirect way to account for a full parity dependence in all steps of a reaction, including the one of the compound nucleus formed in a reaction. To illustrate the impact on astrophysical reaction rates, we present rates for neutron captures in isotopic chains of Ni and Sn. Comparing with the standard assumption of equipartition of both parities, we find noticeable differences in the energy regime of astrophysical interest caused by the parity dependence of the nuclear level density found in the compound nucleus even at sizeable excitation energies.
