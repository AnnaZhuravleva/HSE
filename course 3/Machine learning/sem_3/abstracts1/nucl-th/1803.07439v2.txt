We present the first successful functional renormalization group(FRG)-aided density-functional (DFT) calculation of the equation of state (EOS) of an infinite nuclear matter (NM) in (1+1)-dimensions composed of spinless nucleons. The resultant EOS of the NM coincides with that obtained by the Monte-Carlo method within a few percent for the available range of density. Our result demonstrates that the properly formulated FRG-aided DFT can be as powerful as any other methods in quantum many-body theory.
