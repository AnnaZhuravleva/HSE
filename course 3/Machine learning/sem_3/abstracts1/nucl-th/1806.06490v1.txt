Contributions of degenerate families of periodic orbits to the semiclassical level density in truncated spherical hard-wall potentials are considered. In addition to the portion of the continuous periodic-orbit family contribution which persists after truncation, end-point correction to the truncated family should be taken into account. We propose a formula to evaluate this end-point correction as separate contributions of what we call marginal orbits. Applications to the two-dimensional billiard and three-dimensional cavity systems with the three-quadratic-surfaces shape parametrization, initiated to describe the nuclear fission processes, reveal unexpectedly large effects of the marginal orbits.
