Under the approximate chiral symmetry restoration, quark interactions with topological gluon fields in quantum chromodynamics can induce chirality imbalance and parity violation in local domains. An electric charge separation ({\sc cs}) could be generated along the direction of a strong magnetic field ({\bf B}), a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect ({\sc cme}). {\sc cs} measurements by azimuthal correlators are contaminated by a major background from elliptic flow anisotropy ($v_2$). Isobaric $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr collisions have been proposed to identify the {\sc cme} (expected to differ between the two systems) out of the background (expected to be almost the same). We show, by using the density-functional calculated proton and neutron distributions, that these expectations may not hold as originally anticipated, because the two systems may have sizable differences in eccentricity and $v_2$ and because their difference in {\bf B} may suffer from large uncertainties.
