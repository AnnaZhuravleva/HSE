Based on the Isospin-dependent transport model Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU), effects of the difference of the high momentum tails (HMTs) of nucleon momentum distribution in colliding nuclei on some isospin-sensitive observables are studied in the $^{197}\rm {Au}+^{197}\rm {Au}$ reactions at incident beam energy of 400 MeV/nucleon. It is found that the nucleon transverse and elliptic flows, the free neutron to proton ratio at low momenta are all less sensitive to the specific form of the HMT, while the free neutron to proton ratio at high momenta and the yields of $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{+}$ as well as the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio around the Coulomb peak are sensitive to the specific form of the HMT. Combining the present studies with the experimental measurements at rare-isotope reaction facilities worldwide, one may get more insights into the nuclear short-range correlations in heavy nuclei or nuclear matter.
