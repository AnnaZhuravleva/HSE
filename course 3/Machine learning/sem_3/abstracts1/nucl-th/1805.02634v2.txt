Observation of neutrinoless double beta decay, a lepton number violating process that has been proposed to clarify the nature of neutrino masses, has spawned an enormous world-wide experimental effort. Relating nuclear decay rates to high-energy, beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics requires detailed knowledge of non-perturbative QCD effects. Using lattice QCD and taking advantage of effective field theory methods, we compute the model-independent leading-order matrix elements of short-range operators, which arise due to heavy BSM mediators, that contribute to this decay. Contributions from short-range operators may prove to be equally important to or even more important than those from long-range Majorana neutrino exchange.
