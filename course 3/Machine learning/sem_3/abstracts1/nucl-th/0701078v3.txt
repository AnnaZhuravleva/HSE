We examine manifestations of neutron electromagnetic polarizabilities in coherent Compton scattering from the Helium-3 nucleus. We calculate $\gamma ^3$He elastic scattering observables using chiral perturbation theory to next-to-leading order (${\mathcal O}(e^2 Q)$). We find that the unpolarized differential cross section can be used to measure neutron electric and magnetic polarizabilities, while two double-polarization observables are sensitive to different linear combinations of the four neutron spin polarizabilities.
