Carbon-carbon burning plays an important role in many stellar environments. The relevant astrophysical energies for the ${}^{12}{\rm C}+{}^{12}{\rm C}$ fusion in SN-type Ia and super AGB stars are $1.5-3.3$ MeV. The most accurate recent experimental direct data for carbon-carbon fusion are available down to $E=2.68$ MeV. Direct measurements at lower energies are obtained with much higher uncertainties. Recently, the indirect Trojan horse method (THM) was applied to measure the $S$-factor of the carbon-carbon fusion down to $0.8$ MeV [A. Tumino {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 557}, 687 (2018)]. These indirect data demonstrated a very steep rise of the astrophysical factor with energy decreasing with the highest peak at energies around $0.9$ MeV. This rise completely contradicts to all the previous extrapolations of the direct data down to lower energies and would have profound consequences on the ${}^{12}{\rm C}+{}^{12}{\rm C}$ fusion reaction rate. However, to analyze the THM data a simple plane-wave theory developed in [R. E. Tribble {\it et al.} Rep. Prog. Phys. {\bf 77}, 106901 (2014)] was used, which is not valid for reactions where the Coulomb interactions are important. In particular, in the indirect THM reaction used to determine the $S$-factor of the carbon-carbon fusion the Coulomb interactions play a crucial role. In this paper, we demonstrate that inclusion of the Coulomb effects including the three-body final-state interactions eliminates the rise of the $S$-factor. The peaks at energies around $0.9$ MeV remain but the THM astrophysical factors for different channels drop by almost four orders of magnitude compared to the ones presented in [A. Tumino {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 557}, 687 (2018)].
