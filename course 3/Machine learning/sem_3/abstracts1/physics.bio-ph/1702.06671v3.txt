From a point of view of classical electrodynamics, the performance of two-dimensional shape-simplified antennae is discussed based upon the shape of naturally designed systems to harvest light. We explain the reason that the function of the notch at the complex, the function of the PufX presented at the notch, the function of the special pair, the bacteriochlorophylls are dielectric instead of conductor, and a mechanism to prevent damages from excess sunlight. The non-heme iron at the reaction center, the toroidal shape of the light harvestor, the functional role played by the long-lasting spectrometric signal observed, and the photon anti-bunching observed suggest non-reciprocity. Our model has the required structural information automatically built in. We further comment about how our prediction might be verified experimentally.
