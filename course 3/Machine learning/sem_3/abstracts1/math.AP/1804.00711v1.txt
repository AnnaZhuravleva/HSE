We study for the first time the Cauchy problem for semilinear fractional elliptic equation. This paper is concerned with the Gaussian white noise model for the initial Cauchy data. We establish the ill-posedness of the problem. Then, under some assumption on the exact solution, we propose the Fourier truncation method for stabilizing the ill-posed problem. Some convergence rates between the exact solution and the regularized solution is established in $L^2$ and $H^q$ norms.
