Let $H$ be a self-adjoint isotropic elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order $2$. Denote by $u(t)$ the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation $(i\partial_t - H)u = 0$ with initial data $u(0) = u_0$. If $u_0$ is compactly supported the solution $u(t)$ is smooth for small $t > 0$, but not for all $t$. We determine the wavefront set of $u(t)$ in terms of the wavefront set of $u_0$ and the principal and subprincipal symbol of $H$.
