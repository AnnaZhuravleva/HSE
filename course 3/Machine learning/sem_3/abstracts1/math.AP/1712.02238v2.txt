The theory of quasi-Lie systems, i.e. systems of first order ordinary differential equations which can be related via a generalised flow to Lie systems, is extended to systems of partial differential equations and its applications to obtaining $t$-dependent superposition rules and integrability conditions are analysed. We develop a procedure of constructing quasi-Lie systems through a generalisation to PDEs of the so-called theory of quasi-Lie schemes. Our techniques are illustrated with the analysis of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, generalised Abel differential equations, Baecklund transformations, as well as other differential equations of physical and mathematical relevance.
