We establish the mean-field convergence for systems of points evolving along the gradient-flow of their interaction energy when the interaction is the Coulomb potential or a super-coulombic Riesz potential, for the first time in arbitrary dimension. The proof is based on a modulated energy method using a Coulomb or Riesz distance, assumes that the solutions of the limiting equation are regular enough and exploits a weak-strong stability property for them. The method applies as well to conservative and mixed flows.
