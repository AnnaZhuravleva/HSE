In this paper, we give the mathematical construction of novel core-shell plasmonic structures that can induce anomalous localized resonance and invisibility cloaking at certain finite frequencies beyond the quasistatic limit. The crucial ingredient in our study is that the plasmon constant and the loss parameter are constructed in a delicate way that are correlated and depend on the source and the size of the plasmonic structure. As a significant byproduct of this study, we also derive the complete spectrum of the Neumann-Poinc\'are operator associated to the Helmholtz equation with finite frequencies in the radial geometry. The spectral result is the first one in its type and is of significant mathematical interest for its own sake.
