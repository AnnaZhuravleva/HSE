We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with nonlocal anisotropic diffusion and a linear combination of local and nonlocal monostable-type reactions in a space of bounded functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Using the properties of the corresponding semiflow, we prove the existence of monotone traveling waves along those directions where the diffusion kernel is exponentially integrable. Among other properties, we prove continuity, strict monotonicity and exponential integrability of the traveling wave profiles.
