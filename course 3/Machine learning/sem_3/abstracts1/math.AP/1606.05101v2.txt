The Einstein-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system describes the kinetic diffusion dynamics of self-gravitating particles within the Einstein theory of general relativity. We study the Cauchy problem for spatially homogeneous and isotropic solutions and prove the existence of both global solutions and solutions that blow-up in finite time depending on the size of certain functions of the initial data. We also derive information on the large-time behavior of global solutions and toward the singularity for solutions which blow-up in fine time. Our results entail the existence of a phase of decelerated expansion followed by a phase of accelerated expansion, in accordance with the physical expectations in cosmology.
