We consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation describing an attractive Bose gas trapped to a quasi 2D layer by means of a purely harmonic potential, and which rotates at a fixed speed of rotation $\Omega$. First we study the behavior of the ground state when the coupling constant approaches $a\_*$ , the critical strength of the cubic nonlinearity for the focusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. We prove that blow-up always happens at the center of the trap, with the blow-up profile given by the Gagliardo-Nirenberg solution. In particular, the blow-up scenario is independent of $\Omega$, to leading order. This generalizes results obtained by Guo and Seiringer (Lett. Math. Phys., 2014, vol. 104, p. 141--156) in the non-rotating case. In a second part we consider the many-particle Hamiltonian for $N$ bosons, interacting with a potential rescaled in the mean-field manner $--a\_N N^{2\beta--1} w(N^{\beta} x), with $w$ a positive function such that $\int\_{\mathbb{R}^2} w(x) dx = 1$. Assuming that $\beta < 1/2$ and that $a\_N \to a\_*$ sufficiently slowly, we prove that the many-body system is fully condensed on the Gross-Pitaevskii ground state in the limit $N \to \infty$.
