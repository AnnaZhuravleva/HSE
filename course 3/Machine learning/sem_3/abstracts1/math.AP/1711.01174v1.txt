This survey is a short version of a chapter written by the first two authors in the book [A. Henrot, editor. Shape optimization and spectral theory. Berlin: De Gruyter, 2017] (where more details and references are given) but we have decided here to put more emphasis on the role of the Aharonov-Bohm operators which appear to be a useful tool coming from physics for understanding a problem motivated either by spectral geometry or dynamics of population. Similar questions appear also in Bose-Einstein theory. Finally some open problems which might be of interest are mentioned.
