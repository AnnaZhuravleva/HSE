We introduce a novel systematic construction for integrable (3+1)-dimensional dispersionless systems using nonisospectral Lax pairs that involve contact vector fields.   In particular, we present new large classes of (3+1)-dimensional integrable dispersionless systems associated to the Lax pairs which are polynomial and rational in the spectral parameter.
