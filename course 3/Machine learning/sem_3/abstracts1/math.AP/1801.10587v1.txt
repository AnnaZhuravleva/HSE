We study a non-local hydrodynamic system with control. First we characterize the control dynamics as a sub-optimal approximation to the optimal control problem constrained to the evolution of the pressureless Euler alignment system. We then discuss the critical thresholds that leading to global regularity or finite-time blow-up of strong solutions in one and two dimensions. Finally we propose a finite volume scheme for numerical solutions of the controlled system. Several numerical simulations are shown to validate the theoretical and computational results of the paper.
