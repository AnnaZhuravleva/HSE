For a an arbitrary periodic Borel measure $\mu$, we prove order $O(\varepsilon)$ operator-norm resolvent estimates for the solutions to scalar elliptic problems in $L^2({\mathbb R}^d, d\mu^\varepsilon)$ with $\varepsilon$-periodic coefficients, $\varepsilon>0.$ Here $\mu^\varepsilon$ is the measure obtained by $\varepsilon$-scaling of $\mu.$ Our analysis includes both the case of a measure absolutely continuous with respect to the standard Lebesgue measure and the case of "singular" periodic structures (or "multistructures"), when $\mu$ is supported by lower-dimensional manifolds.
