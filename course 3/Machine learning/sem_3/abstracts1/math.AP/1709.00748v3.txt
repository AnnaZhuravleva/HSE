We prove that in dimension $n\ge 2$ the main singularities of a complex potential $q$ having a certain a priori regularity are contained in the Born approximation $q_B$ constructed from backscattering data. This is archived using a new explicit formula for the multiple dispersion operators in the Fourier transform side. We also show that ${q-q_B}$ can be up to one derivative more regular than $q$ in the Sobolev scale. On the other hand, we construct counterexamples showing that in general it is not possible to have more than one derivative gain, sometimes even strictly less, depending on the a priori regularity of $q$.
