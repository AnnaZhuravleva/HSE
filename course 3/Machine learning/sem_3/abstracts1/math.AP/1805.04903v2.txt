We investigate the fractional diffusion approximation of a kinetic equation in the upper-half plane with diffusive reflection conditions at the boundary. In an appropriate singular limit corresponding to small Knudsen number and long time asymptotic, we derive a fractional diffusion equation with a nonlocal Neumann boundary condition for the density of particles. Interestingly, this asymptotic equation is different from the one derived by L. Cesbron in [7] in the case of specular reflection conditions at the boundary and does not seem to have receive a lot of attention previously.
