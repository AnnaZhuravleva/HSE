Third order nonlinear evolution equations, that is the Korteweg-deVries (KdV), modified Korteweg-deVries (mKdV) equation and other ones are considered: they all are connected via Baecklund transformations. These links can be depicted in a wide Baecklund Chart} which further extends the previous one constructed in [22]. In particular, the Baecklund transformation which links the mKdV equation to the KdV singularity manifold equation is reconsidered and the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunction is shown to be linked to all the equations in the previously constructed Baecklund Chart. That is, such a Baecklund Chart is expanded to encompass the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunctions [30], which finds its origin in the early days of the study of Inverse scattering Transform method, when the Lax pair for the KdV equation was constructed. The nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunctions is proved to enjoy a nontrivial invariance property. Furthermore, the hereditary recursion operator it admits [30 is recovered via a different method. Then, the results are extended to the whole hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations it generates. Notably, the established links allow to show that also the nonlinear equation for the KdV eigenfunction is connected to the Dym equation since both such equations appear in the same Baecklund chart.
