We consider stochastic and deterministic three-wave semi-linear systems of KP type (Kadomtsev-Petviashvili), set on large periodic domains. We assume that the non-linearity is small and acting only on a bounded set of frequencies, and that the noise is small or void and acting only in the angles of the Fourier modes (random phase forcing). We consider random initial data and show that these systems possess natural invariant distributions corresponding to some Rayleigh-Jeans stationary solutions of the wave kinetic equation appearing in wave turbulence theory. We consider random initial modes drawn with probability laws that are perturbations of theses invariant distributions. In the sto-chastic case, we prove that in the asymptotic limit (small nonlinearity, continuous set of frequency and small noise), the renormalized fluctuations of the amplitudes of the Fourier modes converge in a weak sense towards the solution of the linearized wave kinetic equation around these Rayleigh-Jeans spectra. Moreover, we show that in absence of noise, the de-terministic equation with the same random initial satisfies a generic Birkhoff reduction in a probabilistic sense, without kinetic description at least in some regime of parameters.
