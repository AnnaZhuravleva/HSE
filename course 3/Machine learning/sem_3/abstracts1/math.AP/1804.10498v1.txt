We consider the Stokes system in R 3 , deprived of N spheres of radius 1/N, completed by constant boundary conditions on the spheres. We assume that the centers of the spheres and the boundary conditions are given randomly and we compute the asymptotic behavior of solutions when the parameter N diverges. Under the assumption that the distribution of spheres/centers is chaotic, we prove convergence in mean to the solution of a Stokes-Brinkman problem.
