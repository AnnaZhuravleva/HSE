We show that an incoming null-geodesic belonging to a plane passing through the origin and starting outside the outer horizon crosses the outer and the inner horizons. Then it turns at some point inside the inner horizon and approaches the inner horizon when the time tends to the infinity. We also construct a geometric optics solution of the Reissner-Nordstrom equation that has support in a neighborhood of the null-geodesic.
