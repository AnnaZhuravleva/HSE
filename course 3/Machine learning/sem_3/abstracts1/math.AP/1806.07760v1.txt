We develop a quantitative theory of stochastic homogenization in the more general framework of differential forms. Inspired by recent progress in the uniformly elliptic setting, the analysis relies on the study of certain subadditive quantities. We establish an algebraic rate of convergence from these quantities and deduce from this an algebraic error estimate for the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem. Most of the ideas needed in this article comes from two distinct theory, the theory of quantitative stochastic homogenization, and the generalization of the main results of functional analysis and of the regularity theory of second-order elliptic equations to the setting of differential forms.
