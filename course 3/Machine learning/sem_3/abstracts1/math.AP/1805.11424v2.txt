This paper is devoted to studying the inflow problem for an ideal polytropic model with non-viscous gas in one-dimensional half space. We showed the existence of the boundary layer in different areas. By employing the energy method, we also proved the unique global-in-time solution existed and the asymptotic stability of both the boundary layer and the superposition with the 3-rarefaction wave under some smallness conditions.
