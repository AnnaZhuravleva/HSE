We present a general method of solving the Cauchy problem for multidimensional parabolic (diffusion type) equation with variable coefficients which depend on spatial variable but do not change over time. We assume the existence of the $C_0$-semigroup (this is a standard assumption in the evolution equations theory, which guarantees the existence of the solution) and then find the representation of the solution in terms of coefficients of the equation and initial condition.   Our main technical tool is the Chernoff theorem on $C_0$-semigroups. We recall theorem's statement, provide it's elementary version to show the core idea, explain how the theorem helps in obtaining solutions of evolution equations. Then we apply the Chernoff theorem to a specially constructed family of translation operators and obtain a sequence of functions that converge uniformly to the exact solution of the equation studied. We also represent the solution as a Feynman formula (i.e. as a limit of a multiple integral with multiplicity tending to infinity) with generalized functions appearing in the integral kernel. The paper is written to be self-contained and understandable to a wide mathematical audience.
