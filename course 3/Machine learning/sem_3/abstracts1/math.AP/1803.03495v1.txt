We prove a priori bounds for all derivatives of non-relativistic Coulombic eigenfunctions, involving negative powers of the distance to the singularities of the many-body potential. We use these to derive bounds for all derivatives of the corresponding one-electron densities, involving negative powers of the distance from the nuclei. The results are both natural and optimal, as seen from the ground state of Hydrogen.
