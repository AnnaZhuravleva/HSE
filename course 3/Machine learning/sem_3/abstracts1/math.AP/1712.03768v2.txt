We study the the nonlinear Klein-Gordon (NLKG) equation on a manifold $M$ in the nonrelativistic limit, namely as the speed of light $c$ tends to infinity. In particular, we consider an order-$r$ normalized approximation of NLKG (which corresponds to the NLS at order $r=1$), and prove that when $M=\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \geq 2$, small radiation solutions of the order-$r$ normalized equation approximate solutions of the nonlinear NLKG up to times of order $\mathcal{O}(c^{2(r-1)})$.
