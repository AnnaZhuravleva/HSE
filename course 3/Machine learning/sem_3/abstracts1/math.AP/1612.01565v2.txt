We present a new vector field approach to almost-sharp decay for the wave equation on spherically symmetric, stationary and asymptotically flat spacetimes. Specifically, we derive a new hierarchy of higher-order weighted energy estimates by employing appropriate commutator vector fields. In cases where an integrated local energy decay estimate holds, like in the case of sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, this hierarchy leads to almost-sharp global energy and pointwise time-decay estimates with decay rates that go beyond those obtained by the traditional vector field method. Our estimates play a fundamental role in our companion paper where precise late-time asymptotics are obtained for linear scalar fields on such backgrounds.
