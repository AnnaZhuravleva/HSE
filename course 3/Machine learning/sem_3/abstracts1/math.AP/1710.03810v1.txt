We study the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS). equation for general initial conditions in weighted Sobolev spaces that can support bright solitons (but exclude spectral singularities corresponding to algebraic solitons). We show that the set of such initial data is open and dense in a weighted Sobolev space, and includes data of arbitrarily large $L^2$-norm. We prove global well-posedness on this open and dense set. In a subsequent paper, we will use these results and a steepest descent analysis to prove the soliton resolution conjecture for the DNLS equation with the initial data considered here and asymptotic stability of $N-$soliton solutions.
