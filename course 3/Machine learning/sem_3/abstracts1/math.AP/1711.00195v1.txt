We first give a new proof of the non-linear stability of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime as a solution of the Einstein vacuum equation. We then show that the metric admits a full asymptotic expansion at infinity, more precisely at the boundary hypersurfaces (corresponding to spacelike, null, and timelike infinity) of a suitable compactification of $\mathbb{R}^4$ adapted to the bending of outgoing light cones. We work in a wave map/DeTurck gauge closely related to the standard wave coordinate gauge. Similarly to our previous work on the stability of cosmological black holes, we construct the solution of the non-linear equation using an iteration scheme in which we solve a linearized equation globally at each step; to fix the geometry of null infinity throughout the iteration scheme, we devise a hyperbolic formulation of Einstein's equation which ensures constraint damping. The weak null condition of Lindblad and Rodnianski arises naturally as a nilpotent coupling of certain metric components in a linear model operator at null infinity. Furthermore, we relate the Bondi mass to a logarithmic term in the expansion of the metric at null infinity and prove the Bondi mass loss formula.
