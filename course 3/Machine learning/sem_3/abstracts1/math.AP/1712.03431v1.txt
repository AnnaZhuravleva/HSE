In this paper, we introduce a new notion of convergence for the Laplace eigenfunctions in the semiclassical limit, the local weak convergence. This allows us to give a rigorous statement of Berry's random wave conjecture. Using recent results of Bourgain, Buckley and Wigman, we will prove that some deterministic families of eigenfunctions on $\mathbb{T}^2$ satisfy the conclusions of the random wave conjecture. We also show that on an arbitrary domain, a sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions always admits local weak limits. We explain why these local weak limits can be a powerful tool to study the asymptotic number of nodal domains.
