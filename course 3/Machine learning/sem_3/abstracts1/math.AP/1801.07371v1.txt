We consider the problem of asymptotic stability and linear inviscid damping for perturbations of a point vortex and similar degenerate circular flows. Here, key challenges include the lack of strict monotonicity and the necessity of working in weighted Sobolev spaces whose weights degenerate as the radius tends to zero or infinity. Prototypical examples are given by circular flows with power law singularities or zeros as $r\downarrow 0$ or $r \uparrow \infty$.
