This paper is devoted to the variational study of an effective model for the electron transport in a graphene sample. We prove the existence of infinitely many stationary solutions for a nonlin-ear Dirac equation which appears in the WKB limit for the Schr{\"o}dinger equation describing the semi-classical electron dynamics. The interaction term is given by a mean field, self-consistent potential which is the trace of the 3D Coulomb potential. Despite the nonlinearity being 4-homogeneous, compactness issues related to the limiting Sobolev embedding $H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\Omega,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow L^{4} (\Omega,\mathbb{C})$ are avoided thanks to the regular-ization property of the operator $(-\Delta)^{-\frac{1}{2}$. This also allows us to prove smoothness of the solutions. Our proof follows by direct arguments.
