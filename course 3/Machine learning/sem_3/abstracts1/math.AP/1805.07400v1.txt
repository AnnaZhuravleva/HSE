We extend Vasy's results on semiclassical high energy estimates for the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds to metrics that are not necessarily even. Vasy's method gives the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent and high energy estimates in strips, assuming that the geodesic flow is non-trapping, without having to construct a parametrix. We prove that the size of the strip to which the resolvent can be extended meromorphically is the same obtained by Guillarmou.
