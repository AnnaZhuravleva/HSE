Complementary polynomials of Legendre polynomials are briefly presented, as well as those for the confluent and hypergeometric functions, relativistic Hermite polynomials and corresponding new pre-Laguerre polynomials. The generating functions are all given in closed form and are much simpler than the standard ones. Some are simply polynomials in two variables. New recursions and addition formulas are derived.
