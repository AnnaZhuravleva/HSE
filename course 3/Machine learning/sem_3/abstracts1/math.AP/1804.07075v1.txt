We consider the quartic focusing Half Wave equation (HW) in one space dimension. We show first that that there exist traveling wave solutions with arbitrary small $H^{\frac 12}(\R)$ norm. This fact shows that small data scattering is not possible for (HW) equation and that below the ground state energy there are solutions whose energy travels as a localised packet and which preserve this localisation in time. This behaviour for (HW) is in sharp contrast with classical NLS in any dimension and with fractional NLS with radial data. The second result addressed is the non existence of traveling waves moving at the speed of light. The main ingredients of the proof are commutator estimates and a careful study of spatial decay of traveling waves profile using the harmonic extension to the upper half space.
