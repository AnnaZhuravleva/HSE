We develop a method for generating solutions to large classes of evolutionary partial differential systems with nonlocal nonlinearities. For arbitrary initial data, the solutions are generated from the corresponding linearized equations. The key is a Fredholm integral equation relating the linearized flow to an auxiliary linear flow. It is analogous to the Marchenko integral equation in integrable systems. We show explicitly how this can be achieved through several examples including reaction-diffusion systems with nonlocal quadratic nonlinearities and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a nonlocal cubic nonlinearity. In each case we demonstrate our approach with numerical simulations. We discuss the effectiveness of our approach and how it might be extended.
