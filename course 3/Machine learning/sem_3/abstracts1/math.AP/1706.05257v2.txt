In this paper we consider Dirac operators in $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq2$, with a potential $V$. Under mild decay and continuity assumptions on $V$ and some spectral assumptions on the operator, we prove a limiting absorption principle for the resolvent, which implies a family of Strichartz estimates for the linear Dirac equation. For large potentials the dynamical estimates are not an immediate corollary of the free case since the resolvent of the free Dirac operator does not decay in operator norm on weighted $L^2$ spaces as the frequency goes to infinity.
