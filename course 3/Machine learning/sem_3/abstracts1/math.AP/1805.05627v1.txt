In this paper, we investigate the anisotropic Calder{\'o}n problem on cylindrical Riemannian manifolds with boundary having two ends and equipped with singular metrics of (simple or double) warped product type, that is whose warping factors only depend on the horizontal direction of the cylinder. By singular, we mean that these factors are only assumed to be positive almost everywhere and to belong to some L p space with 0 < p $\le$ $\infty$. Using recent developments on the Weyl-Titchmarsh theory for singular Sturm-Liouville operators, we prove that the local Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps at each end are well defined and determine the metric uniquely if: 1. (Doubly warped product case) the coefficients of the metric are L $\infty$ and bounded from below by a positive constant. 2. (Warped product case) the coefficients of the metrics belong to a critical L p space where p < $\infty$ depends on the dimension of the compact fibers of the cylinder. Finally, we show (in the warped product case and for zero frequency) that these uniqueness results are sharp by giving simple counterexamples for a class of singular metrics whose coefficients do not belong to the critical L p space. All these counterexamples lead to a region of space that is invisible to boundary measurements.
