In atmospheric science, slice models (SM) are frequently used to study the behaviour of weather, and specifically the formation of atmospheric fronts, whose prediction is fundamental in meteorology. In 2013, Cotter and Holm introduced a new slice model, which they formulated using Hamilton's variational principle, modified for this purpose. In this paper, we study local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of the related ISM (incompressible slice model). ISM is a modified version of the Cotter-Holm slice model (CHSM) that we have obtained by adapting the Lagrangian function in Hamilton's principle for CHSM to the Euler-Boussinesq Eady incompressible case. Besides proving local existence and uniqueness, in this paper we also construct a blow-up criterion for ISM. These results establish the potential applicability of the ISM equations in physically meaningful situations.
