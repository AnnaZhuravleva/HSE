We study spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations which model an idealized relativistic neutron star surrounded by vacuum. These are barotropic fluids with a free boundary, governed by an equation of state which sets the speed of sound equal to the speed of light. We demonstrate the existence of a 1-parameter family of static solutions, or "hard stars," and describe their properties. In particular, we show that small stars are a local minimum of the mass energy functional under variations which preserve the total number of particles. Moreover, we prove that the second variation of the mass energy functional controls the "mass aspect function."
