On the three dimensional Euclidean space, for data with finite energy, it is well-known that the Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations admit global solutions. However, the asymptotic behaviours of the solutions for the data with non-vanishing charge and arbitrary large size are unknown. It is conjectured that the solutions disperse as linear waves and enjoy the so-called peeling properties for pointwise estimates. We provide a gauge independent proof of the conjecture.
