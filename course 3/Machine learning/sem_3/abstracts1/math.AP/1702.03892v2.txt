The wave turbulence equation is an effective kinetic equation that describes the dynamics of wave spectrum in weakly nonlinear and dispersive media. Such a kinetic model has been derived by physicists in the sixties, though the well-posedness theory remains open, due to the complexity of resonant interaction kernels. In this paper, we provide a global unique radial strong solution, the first such a result, to the wave turbulence equation for capillary waves.
