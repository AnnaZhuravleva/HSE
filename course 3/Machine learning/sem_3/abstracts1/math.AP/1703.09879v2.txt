Let $Q(x,y)= 4 \frac{y^2-x^2+3}{ (x^2+y^2+3)^2}$ be the lump solution of the KP-I equation $$ \partial_x^2 (\partial_x^2 u-u + 3 u^2)-\partial_y^2 u=0.$$ We show that this solution is rigid in the following senses: the only decaying solutions to the linearized operator $$ \partial_x^2 (\partial_x^2 \phi -\phi + 6 Q \phi)-\partial_y^2 \phi=0$$ consist of the linear combinations of $ \partial_x Q$ and $ \partial_y Q$. Furthermore we show that the Morse index is exactly one and that it is orbital stable.
