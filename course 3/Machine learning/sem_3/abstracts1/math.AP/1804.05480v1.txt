This paper is concerned with the analysis of surface polariton resonance for nanoparticles in linear elasticity. With the presence of nanoparticles, we first derive the perturbed displacement field associated to a given elastic source field. It is shown that the leading-order term of the perturbed elastic wave field is determined by the Neumann-Poinc\'are operator associated to the Lam\'e system. By analyzing the spectral properties of the aforesaid Neumann-Poinc\'are operator, we study the polariton resonance for the elastic system. The results may find applications in elastic wave imaging.
