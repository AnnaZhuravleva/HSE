The Boussinesq equations are fundamental in meteorology. Among other aspects, they aim to model the process of front formation. We use the approach presented in [Hol15] to introduce stochasticity into the incompressible Boussinesq equations. This is, we introduce cylindrical transport noise in a way that the geometric properties in the Euler-Poincar\'{e} formulation are preserved. One of our main results establishes the local well-posedness of regular solutions for these new stochastic Boussinesq equations. We also construct a blow-up criterion and derive some general estimates, which are crucial for showing well-posedness of a wide range of similar SPDEs.
