We study a so-called non-local Cahn-Hilliard model obtained as a constrained Wasserstein gradient flow of some Ginzburg-Landau energy. When compared to the more classical local degenerate Cahn-Hilliard model studied in [C. M. Elliott and H. Garcke, {\em SIAM J. Math. Anal.}, 27(2):404--423, {\bf 1996}], the non-local model appears to take advantage of a larger flexibility on the phase fluxes to dissipate faster the energy, as confirmed by numerical simulations. We prove the existence of a solution to non-local problem by proving the convergence of the JKO minimizing movement scheme.
