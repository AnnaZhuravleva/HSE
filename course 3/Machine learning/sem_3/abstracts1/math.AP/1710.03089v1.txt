The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate the nonlinear stability of viscous shock waves and rarefaction wave for bipolar Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann (VPB) system. To this end, motivated by the micro-macro decomposition to the Boltzmann equation in [21, 23], we first set up a new micro-macro decomposition around the local Maxwellian related to the bipolar VPB system and give a unified framework to study the nonlinear stability of the basic wave patterns to the system. Then, as the applications of this new decomposition, the time-asymptotic stability of the two typical nonlinear wave patterns, viscous shock waves and rarefaction wave, are proved for the 1D bipolar Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system. More precisely, it is first proved that the linear superposition of two Boltzmann shock profiles in the first and third characteristic fields is nonlinearly stable to the 1D bipolar VPB system up to some suitable shifts without the zero macroscopic mass conditions on the initial perturbations. Then the time-asymptotic stability of rarefaction wave fan to compressible Euler equations is proved to 1D bipolar VPB system. These two results are concerned with the nonlinear stability of wave patterns for Boltzmann equation coupled with additional (electric) forces, which together with spectral analysis made in [18] sheds light on understanding the complicated dynamic behaviors around the wave patterns in the transportation of charged particles under the binary collisions, mutual interactions, and the effect of the electrostatic potential forces.
