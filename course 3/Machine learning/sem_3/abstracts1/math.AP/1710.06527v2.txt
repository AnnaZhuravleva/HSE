In this work, we study the stability of the expanding configurations for radiation gaseous stars. Such expanding configurations exist for the isentropic model and the thermodynamic model. In particular, we focus on the effect of the monatomic gas viscosity tensor on the expanding configurations. With respect to small perturbation, it is shown the self-similarly expanding homogeneous solutions of the isentropic model is unstable, while the linearly expanding homogeneous solutions of the isentropic model and the thermodynamic model are stable. This is an extensive study of the result in arXiv:1605.08083 by Hadzic and Jang.
