We investigate transport equations associated to a Lipschitz field on some subspace of $\mathbb{R}^N$ endowedwith a general measure $\mu$ in $L^{p}$-spaces $1 < p <\infty$, extending the results obtained in two previous contributions of the author in the $L^{1}$-context. We notably prove the well-posedness of boundary-value transport problems with a large variety of boundary conditions. New explicit formula for the transport semigroup are in particular given.
