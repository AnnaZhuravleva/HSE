The finite time blow-up of solutions for 1-D NLS with oscillating nonlinearities is shown in two domains: (1) the whole real line where the nonlinear source is acting in the interior of the domain and (2) the right half-line where the nonlinear source is placed at the boundary point. The distinctive feature of this work is that the the initial energy is allowed to be non-negative and the momentum is allowed to be infinite in contrast to the previous literature on the blow-up of solutions with time dependent nonlinearities. The common finite momentum assumption is removed by using a compactly supported or rapidly decaying weight function in virial identities - an idea borrowed from Ogawa-Tsutsumi (1991). At the end of the paper, a numerical example satisfying the theory is provided.
