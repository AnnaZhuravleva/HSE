We study the existence and stability of stationary solutions of Poisson-Nernst- Planck equations with steric effects (PNP-steric equations) with two counter-charged species. These equations describe steady current through open ionic channels quite well. The current levels in open ionic channels are known to switch between `open' or `closed' states in a spontaneous stochastic process called gating, suggesting that their governing equations should give rise to multiple stationary solutions that enable such multi-stable behavior. We show that within a range of parameters, steric effects give rise to multiple stationary solutions that are smooth. These solutions, however, are all unstable under PNP-steric dynamics. Following these findings, we introduce a novel PNP-Cahn-Hilliard model, and show that it admits multiple stationary solutions that are smooth and stable. The various branches of stationary solutions and their stability are mapped utilizing bifurcation analysis and numerical continuation methods.
