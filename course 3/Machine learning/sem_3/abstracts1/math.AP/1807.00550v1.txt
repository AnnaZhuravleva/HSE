In mathematical physics, the pressure function is determined by the equation of state. There are two existing state equations: the state equation (S+) for polytropic gas with adiabatic index greater than 1 and the state equation (S-) for generalized Chaplygin gas in cosmology. In this paper, we provide some mathematical foundations for the sign-changing pressure (S*) by establishing a global existence result for the one-dimensional Euler equations with time-dependent damping. It is found that the newly introduced sign-changing pressure shares many mathematical properties such as reduction to a symmetric hyperbolic system and finite propagation speed property with the classical positive pressure S+ and the negative pressure S-. Moreover, S+ and S- are unified and generalized in our proposition which includes a global existence result for S+, S- and S*.
