In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an inhomogeneous media with a conductive boundary. First, we discuss the inverse conductivity problem of reconstructing the conductivity parameter from scattering data. Next, we consider the corresponding interior transmission eigenvalue problem. This is a new class of eigenvalue problem that is not elliptic, not self-adjoint, and non-linear, which gives the possibility of complex eigenvalues. We investigate the convergence of the eigenvalues as the conductivity parameter tends to zero as well as prove existence and discreteness for the case of an absorbing media. Lastly, several numerical and analytical results support the theory and we show that the inside-outside duality method can be used to reconstruct the interior conductive eigenvalues.
