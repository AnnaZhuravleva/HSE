This paper is concerned with the impermeable wall problem for an ideal polytropic model of non-viscous and heat-conductive gas in one-dimensional half space. It is shown that the 3-rarefaction wave is stable under some smallness conditions. The proof is given by an elementary energy method and the key point is to control the boundary terms due to the less dissipativity of the system.
