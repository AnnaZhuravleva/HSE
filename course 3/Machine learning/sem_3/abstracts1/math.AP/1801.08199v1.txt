In this paper for all $p>1$ we prove that the pull-in voltage of the $p$-MEMS (micro-electro mechanical systems) problems in a smooth bounded domain of $\mathbb R^{d}, d\geq1,$ is minimized by symmetrizing the domain and the permittivity profile. The singular nonlinearities belong to a very general class and the obtained results are new even for $p=2$. Main ingredient of our proof is based on Talenti's comparison principle. Although there is no physical applications for the cases when $d\ge 3$, we nevertheless demonstrate our method to the multidimensional MEMS problems in the whole space $\mathbb R^{d}, d\geq3,$ and the Dirichlet boundary value problems of second order uniformly elliptic differential operators.
