We prove uniqueness in inverse acoustic scattering in the case the density of the medium has an unbounded gradient across $\Sigma\subseteq\Gamma=\partial\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is a bounded open subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with a Lipschitz boundary. This follows from a uniqueness result in inverse scattering for Schr\"odinger operators with singular $\delta$-type potential supported on the surface $\Gamma$ and of strength $\alpha\in L^{p}(\Gamma)$, $p>2$.
