When the temperature of a trapped Bose gas is below the Bose-Einstein transition temperature and above absolute zero, the gas is composed of two distinct components: the Bose-Einstein condensate and the cloud of thermal excitations. The dynamics of the excitations can be described by quantum Boltzmann models. We prove that the discrete differential equations for these quantum Boltzmann models converge to an equilibrium point. Moreover, this point is unique for all initial conditions that satisfy the same conservation laws. In the proof, we establish a connection between quantum Boltzmann models and chemical reaction networks, and we show that the question about the convergence to equilibrium of quantum kinetic equations is analogous to the global attractor conjecture for chemical reaction networks. We then employ a toric dynamical system approach, similar to the one used to prove the global attractor conjecture, to study the convergence to equilibrium of several types of quantum kinetic equations. These convergence results also apply to the weak turbulence Boltzmann equation for phonon interactions in anharmonic crystals.
