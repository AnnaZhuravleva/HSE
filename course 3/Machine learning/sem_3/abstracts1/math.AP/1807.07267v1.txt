This paper is concerned with the boundary-value problem on the Boltzmann equation in bounded domains with diffuse-reflection boundary where the boundary temperature is time-periodic. We establish the existence of time-periodic solutions with the same period for both hard and soft potentials, provided that the time-periodic boundary temperature is sufficiently close to a stationary one which has small variations around a positive constant. The dynamical stability of time-periodic profiles is also proved under small perturbations, and this in turn yields the non-negativity of the profile. For the proof, we develop new estimates in the time-periodic setting.
