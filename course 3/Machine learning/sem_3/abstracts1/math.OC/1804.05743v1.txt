We investigate one-dimensional periodic chains of alternate type of particles interacting through mirror symmetric potentials. The optimality of the equidistant configuration -- also called crystallization -- is shown in various settings, at any scale and at high density. In particular, we prove the crystallization at any scale for neutral and non-neutral systems with inverse power laws interactions, including the three-dimensional Coulomb potential. We also prove the crystallization at high density for Lennard-Jones type interactions and ionic screened potentials involving inverse power laws and Yukawa potentials. These high density results are derived from a general sufficient condition based on a convexity argument. Furthermore, we derive a necessary condition for crystallization at high density based on the positivity of the Fourier transform of the interaction potentials sum.
