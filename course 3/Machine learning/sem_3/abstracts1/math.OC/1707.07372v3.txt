In this article, we propose a Lyapunov stability approach to analyze the convergence of the density operator of a quantum system. In contrast to many previously studied convergence analysis methods for invariant density operators which use weak convergence, in this article we analyze the convergence of density operators by considering the set of density operators as a subset of Banach space. We show that the set of invariant density operators is both closed and convex, which implies the impossibility of having multiple isolated invariant density operators. We then show how to analyze the stability of this set via a candidate Lyapunov operator.
