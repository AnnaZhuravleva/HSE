The Helmholtz conditions are necessary and sufficient conditions for a system of second order differential equations to be variational, that is, equivalent to a system of Euler-Lagrange equations for a regular Lagrangian. On the other hand, matching conditions are sufficient conditions for a class of controlled systems to be variational for a Lagrangian function of a prescribed type, known as the controlled Lagrangian. Using the Helmholtz conditions we are able to recover the matching conditions from [8]. Furthermore we can derive new matching conditions for a particular class of mechanical systems. It turns out that for this class of systems we obtain feedback controls that only depend on the configuration variables. We test this new strategy for the inverted pendulum on a cart and for the inverted pendulum on an incline.
