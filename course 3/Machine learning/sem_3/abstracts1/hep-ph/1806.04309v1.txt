We collect the yields of negatively and positively charged pions ($\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$), negatively and positively charged kaons ($K^-$ and $K^+$), as well as anti-protons ($\bar p$) and protons ($p$) produced in mid-rapidity interval (in most cases) in central gold-gold (Au-Au), central lead-lead (Pb-Pb), and inelastic or non-single-diffractive proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at different collision energies. The chemical potentials of light particles and quarks are extracted from the yield ratios, $\pi^-/\pi^+$, $K^-/K^+$, and $\bar p/p$, of negative to positive particles over an energy range from a few GeV to more than 10 TeV. At a few GeV ($\sim4$ GeV), the chemical potentials show and the yield ratios do not show different behaviors comparing with those at other energies, though the limiting values of the chemical potentials and the yield ratios at very high energy are zero and one respectively.
