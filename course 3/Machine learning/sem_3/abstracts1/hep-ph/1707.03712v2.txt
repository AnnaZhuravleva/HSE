We use the method of QCD sum rules to study the $D$-wave charmed and bottom baryons of the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{6}_F$, and calculate their masses up to the order $\mathcal{O}(1/m_Q)$ with $m_Q$ the heavy quark mass. Our results suggest that the $\Xi_c(3123)$ can be well interpreted as a $D$-wave $\Xi_c^\prime(\mathbf{6}_F)$ state, and it probably has a partner state close to it. Our results also suggest that there may exist as many as four $D$-wave $\Omega_c$ states in the energy region $3.3\sim3.5$ GeV, and we propose to search for them in the further LHCb and BelleII experiments.
