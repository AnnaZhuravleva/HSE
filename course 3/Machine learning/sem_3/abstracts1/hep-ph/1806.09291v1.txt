Quark-hadron continuity was proposed as crossover between hadronic matter and quark matter without a phase transition, based on matching of symmetry and excitations in both phases. In the limit of light strange quark mass, it connects hyperon matter and color-flavor locked (CFL) phase exhibiting color superconductivity. Recently, this conjecture was proposed to be generalized in the presence of superfluid vortices penetrating the both phases in arXiv:1803.05115 [hep-ph], in which they suggested that one hadronic superfluid vortex in hyperon matter could be connected to one non-Abelian vortex (color magnetic flux tube) in the CFL phase. Here, we argue that their proposal is consistent only at large distances: Instead, we show that three hadronic superfluid vortices must join together to three non-Abelian vortices with different colors with the total color magnetic fluxes canceled out, where the junction was called a colorful boojum. We rigorously prove this both in a macroscopic theory based on the Ginzburg-Landau description, in which symmetry and excitations match including vortex cores, and a microscopic theory based on the Bogoliubov de-Gennes equation, in which the Aharanov-Bohm phase of quarks around vortices match.
