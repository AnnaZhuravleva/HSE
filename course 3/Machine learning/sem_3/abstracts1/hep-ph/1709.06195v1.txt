These are lecture notes presented at the 2017 CTEQ Summer School at the University of Pittsburgh. The title is a reference to hep-th/0309149 and introduces perturbative QCD and its application to jet substructure from a bottom-up perspective based on the approximation of QCD as a weakly-coupled, conformal field theory. Using this approach, a simple derivation of the Sudakov form factor with soft gluon emission modeled as a Poisson process is presented. Applications to the identification and discrimination of quark- versus gluon-initiated jets is also discussed.
