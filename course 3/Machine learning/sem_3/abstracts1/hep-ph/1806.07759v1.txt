We revisit the question of hadronic decays of a GeV-mass Higgs-like scalar. A number of extensions of the Standard Model predict Higgs sector with additional light scalars. Currently operating and planned Intensity Frontier experiments will probe for the existence of such particles, while theoretical computations are plagued by uncer- tainties. The goal of this paper is to bring the results in a consolidated form that can be readily used by experimental groups. To this end we provide a physically motivated fitting ansatz for the decay width that reproduces the previous non-perturbative nu- merical analysis. We describe systematic uncertainties of the non-perturbative method and provide explicit examples of the influence of extra resonances above 1.4 GeV onto the total decay width.
