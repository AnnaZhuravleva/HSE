Even though the chaotic inflation is one of the most popular inflation models for its simple dynamics and compelling resolutions to the initial condition problems, its realization in supergravity has been considered a challenging task. We discuss how the chaotic inflation dominated by the D-term can be induced in supergravity, which would give a new perspective on the inflation model building in supergravity.
