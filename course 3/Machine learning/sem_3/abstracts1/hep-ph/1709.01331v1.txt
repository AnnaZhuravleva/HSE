We revisit earlier calculations of leptonic decay constants of vector charmonia and present and illustrate our decomposition of the corresponding covariant Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes in terms of orbital angular momentum as interpreted in the meson's rest frame. Our results confirm our previous conclusions drawn from the magnitudes of vector-meson leptonic decay constants, identifying the Psi(3770) and Psi(4160) as D-wave states in our setup.
