The overall transverse momentum balance and the redistribution of the lost energy from hard jets for asymmetric dijet events in PbPb collisions at 2.76~ATeV at the LHC is studied within A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. A detailed analysis is performed for the projected transverse momentum $\langle \slashed{p}_{T}^{||} \rangle$ contributed from the final charged hadrons carrying different transverse momenta and emitted from different angular directions. We find that the transverse momentum projection $\langle \slashed{p}_{T}^{||} \rangle $ in the leading jet direction is mainly contributed by hard hadrons ($p_T > 8.0$~GeV/$c$) in both peripheral and central PbPb collisions, while the opposite direction in central collisions is dominated by soft hadrons ($p_T = 0.5$-$2.0$~GeV/$c$). The study of in-cone and out-of-cone contributions to $\langle \slashed{p}_{T}^{||} \rangle$ shows that these soft hadrons are mostly emitted at large angles away from the dijet axis. Our AMPT calculation is in qualitative agreement with the CMS measurements and the primary mechanism for the energy transported to large angles in the AMPT model is the elastic scattering at the partonic stage. Future studies including also inelastic processes should be helpful in understanding the overestimation of the magnitudes of in-cone and out-of-cone imbalances from our AMPT calculations, and shed light on different roles played by radiative and collisional processes in the redistribution of the lost energy from hard jets.
