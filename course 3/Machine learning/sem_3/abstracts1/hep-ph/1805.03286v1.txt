Stimulated by the new experimental LHCb findings associated with the $\Omega_c$ states, some of which we have described in a previous work as being dynamically generated through meson-baryon interaction, we have extended this approach to make predictions for new $\Xi_{cc}$ molecular states in the $C=2$, $S=0$ and $I=1/2$ sector. These states manifest themselves as poles in the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in coupled channels. The kernels of this equation were obtained using the Lagrangians coming from the hidden local gauge symmetry, where the interactions are dominated by the exchange of light vector mesons. The extension of this approach to the heavy sector stems from the realization that the dominant interaction corresponds to having the heavy quarks as spectators, which implies the preservation of the heavy quark symmetry. As a result, we get several states: two states from the pseudoscalar meson-baryon interaction with $J^P=1/2^-$, and masses around $4080$ and $4090$ MeV, and one at $4150$ MeV for $J^P=3/2^-$. Furthermore, from the vector meson-baryon interaction we get three states degenerate with $J^P=1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ from $4220$ MeV to $4330$ MeV, and two more states around $4280$ MeV and $4410$ MeV, degenerate with $J^P=1/2^-,\, 3/2^-$ and $5/2^-$.
