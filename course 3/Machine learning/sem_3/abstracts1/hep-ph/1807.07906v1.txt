The discrepancy between the neutron lifetimes measured in the beam and trap experiments can be explained via the neutron $n$ conversion into mirror neutron $n'$, its dark partner from parallel mirror sector, provided that $n$ and $n'$ have a tiny mass splitting order $10^{-7}$ eV. In large magnetic fields used in beam experiments $n-n'$ transition is resonantly enhanced and can transform of about a per cent fraction of neutrons into mirror neutrons which decay in invisible mode. Thus less protons will be produced and the measured value $\tau_{\rm beam}$ appears larger than $\beta$-decay time $\tau_{\beta} = \tau_{\rm trap}$. Some phenomenological and astrophysical consequences of this scenario are also briefly discussed.
