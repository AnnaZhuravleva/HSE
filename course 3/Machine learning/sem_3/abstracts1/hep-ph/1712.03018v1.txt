The QCD axion was originally predicted as a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem. Axion like particles (ALPs) are also a generic prediction of many high energy physics models including string theory. Theoretical models for axions are reviewed, giving a generic multi-axion action with couplings to the standard model. The couplings and masses of these axions can span many orders of magnitude, and cosmology leads us to consider several distinct populations of axions behaving as coherent condensates, or relativistic particles. Light, stable axions are a mainstay dark matter candidate. Axion cosmology and calculation of the relic density are reviewed. A very brief survey is given of the phenomenology of axions arising from their direct couplings to the standard model, and their distinctive gravitational interactions.
