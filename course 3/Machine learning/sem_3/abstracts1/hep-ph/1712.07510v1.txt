Scattering amplitudes computed at a fixed loop order, along with any other object computed in perturbative quantum field theory, can be expressed as a linear combination of a finite basis of loop integrals. To compute loop amplitudes in practice, such a basis of integrals must be determined. We discuss Azurite (A ZURich-bred method for finding master InTEgrals), a publicly available package for finding bases of loop integrals. We also discuss Cristal (Complete Reduction of IntegralS Through All Loops), a future package that produces the complete integration-by-parts reductions.
