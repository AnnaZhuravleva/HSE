We briefly review observables that were recently proposed in inclusive 3 jet production at hadronic colliders. They are based on azimuthal angle correlations between the final state jets and can be seen as a generalisation of the usual Mueller-Navelet setup. We discuss the stability of the observables once higher order corrections beyond the leading logarithmic accuracy are taken into account. Finally, we give a status report on a related project in which we examine azimuthal angle correlations for Mueller-Navelet jets after imposing a rapidity veto which forbids subsequent minijet emissions to be very close in rapidity.
