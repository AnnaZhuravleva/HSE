$SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification is formulated in the six-dimensional hybrid warped space in which the fifth and sixth dimensions play as the electroweak and grand-unification dimensions. Fermions are introduced in ${\bf 32}$, ${\bf 11}$ and ${\bf 1}$ of $SO(11)$. Small neutrino masses naturally emerge as a result of a new seesaw mechanism in the gauge-Higgs unification which is characterized by a $3 \times 3$ mass matrix.
