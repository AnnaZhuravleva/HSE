We extend our previous analysis of $t\bar t H, t\bar t Z, t\bar b W$ production in $e^+e^-$ collisions within the CSM (Composite Standard Model) concept of Higgs boson and top quark compositeness to the case of gluon-gluon and photon-photon collisions. We show that remarkable differences may indeed appear between the effects generated by CSM conserving and by CSM violating sets of form factors.
