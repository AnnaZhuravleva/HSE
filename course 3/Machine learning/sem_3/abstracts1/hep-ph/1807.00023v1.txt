Motivated by the latest neutrino oscillation data which is consistent with maximal atmospheric mixing and maximal leptonic CP violation, we review various results in $\mu\tau$ symmetry, then include several new observations and clarifications, including identifying a new general form of neutrino mass matrix with $\mu\tau$ symmetry. We then apply the new results to the neutrino mass matrix associated with the Littlest Seesaw model, and show that it approximately satisfies the new general form with $\mu\tau$ symmetry, and that this is responsible for its approximate predictions of maximal atmospheric mixing and maximal CP violation in the lepton sector.
