Heavy quarkonium production will provide for novel opportunities to study the gluonic structure of the nucleon in the near future. Near threshold quarkonium production allows for direct experimental access of the dynamic origin of the nucleon mass as well as the nature of the color Van der Waals force, while quarkonium production at high energies can be used to create a full three-dimensional tomographic image of the gluons inside the nucleon, constraining the gluonic radius of the nucleon.
