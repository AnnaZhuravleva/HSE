We present analytical expressions for the 31 five-particle phase-space master integrals in massless QCD as an $\epsilon$-series with coefficients being multiple zeta values of weight up to 12. In addition, we provide computer code for the Monte-Carlo integration in higher dimensions, based on the RAMBO algorithm, that has been used to numerically cross-check the obtained results in 4, 6, and 8 dimensions.
