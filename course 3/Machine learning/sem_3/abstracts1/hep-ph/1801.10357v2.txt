Novel PDFs taking into account resummation-improved matrix elements, albeit only in the fit of a reduced data set, allow for consistent NLO+NLL calculations of slepton pair production at the LHC. We apply a factorisation method to this process that minimises the effect of the data set reduction, avoids the problem of outlier replicas in the NNPDF method for PDF uncertainties and preserves the reduction of the scale uncertainty. For Run II of the LHC, left-handed selectron/smuon, right-handed and maximally mixed stau production, we confirm that the consistent use of threshold-improved PDFs partially compensates the resummation contributions in the matrix elements. Together with the reduction of the scale uncertainty at NLO+NLL, the described method further increases the reliability of slepton pair production cross sections at the LHC.
