We propose a model with the left-handed and right-handed continuous Abelian gauge symmetry; $U(1)_L\times U(1)_R$. Then three right-handed neutrinos are naturally required to achieve $U(1)_R$ anomaly cancellations, while several mirror fermions are also needed to do $U(1)_L$ anomaly cancellations. Then we formulate the model, and discuss its testability of the new gauge interactions at collider physics such as the large hadron collider (LHC) and the international linear collider (ILC). In particular, we can investigate chiral structure of the interactions by the analysis of forward-backward asymmetry based on polarized beam at the ILC.
