The current status of the LHC experiments has imposed serious constraints on the prominent proposals for the electroweak hierarchy problem. Therefore, recently, theoretically different approaches which are called relaxation have been explored. In the present paper, we formulate other relaxation scenarios for the electroweak hierarchy by involving the gravitational extension. We assume that the frames of the fundamental (UV) theory or the extended gravity theory are essentially different from the frame of the Standard Model. By rescaling the metric via the conformal transformation, the dimensional parameters as the Higgs boson mass or the cosmological constant can be sufficiently suppressed against the UV cut-off scale in the rescaled (physical) frame. The electroweak scale depends on the dynamical and running behavior of the dilatonic scalar field or the unknown scaling parameter. In these scenarios, the electroweak hierarchy problem can be naturally relaxed with the modification of the gravitational sector.
