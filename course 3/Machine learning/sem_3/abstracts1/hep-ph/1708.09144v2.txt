Given the Dirac neutrino mass term, we explore the constraint conditions which allow the corresponding mass matrix to be invariant under the \mu-\tau reflection transformation, leading us to the phenomenologically favored predictions \theta_{23} = \pi/4 and \delta = 3\pi/2 in the standard parametrization of the 3\times 3 lepton flavor mixing matrix. If such a flavor symmetry is realized at a superhigh energy scale \Lambda_{\mu\tau}, we investigate how it is spontaneously broken via the one-loop renormalization-group equations (RGEs) running from \Lambda_{\mu\tau} down to the Fermi scale \Lambda_{\rm F}. Such quantum corrections to the neutrino masses and flavor mixing parameters are derived, and an analytical link is established between the Jarlskog invariants of CP violation at \Lambda_{\mu\tau} and \Lambda_{\rm F}. Some numerical examples are also presented in both the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model, to illustrate how the octant of \theta_{23}, the quadrant of \delta and the neutrino mass ordering are correlated with one another as a result of the RGE-induced \mu-\tau reflection symmetry breaking effects.
