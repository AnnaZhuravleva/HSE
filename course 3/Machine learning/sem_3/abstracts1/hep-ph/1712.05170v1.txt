Early decoupling of thermally produced dark matter particles due to feeble interactions with the surrounding plasma typically results in their excessive abundance. In this work we propose a simple mechanism for dark matter depopulation. It relies on a specific cosmological evolution under which dark matter particles become temporarily unstable and hence decay away reducing the overall abundance. The instability phase is typically followed by an incomplete regeneration phase until the final abundance is established. We explicitly demonstrate this mechanism within a simple toy model of fermionic dark matter and discuss how it can be implemented in theoretically well motivated theories, such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and for fermionic dark matter in the scotogenic model.
