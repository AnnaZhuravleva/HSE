In the recent years experiments have established the existence of neutrino oscillations and most of the oscillation parameters have been measured with a good accuracy. The search for New Physics in neutrino oscillation will be an experimental concrete possibility in the next future. In this paper we investigate the ability of the DUNE facility to search for Non Standard Interaction (NSI) in neutrino propagation in matter, emphasizing the role of different assumptions on the shape and absolute normalization errors of both $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ signals. We also study in detail the effects of NSI and systematics in the extraction of standard oscillation parameters.
