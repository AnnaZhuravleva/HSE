Naively, the LHC Higgs boson looks like a Standard Model Higgs boson, with no guidance to physics beyond the Standard Model, as has often been remarked. The data show that what was discovered is the true Higgs boson. If one includes the full information available, experimental and theoretical, there are actually four significant clues implied by data. They point toward a supersymmetric two-doublet decoupling theory, and a hierarchy problem solution via TeV scale supersymmetry. That in turn suggests an underlying compactified string/M theory with a de Sitter vacuum, so we can be confident that the low scale model has an ultraviolet completion.
