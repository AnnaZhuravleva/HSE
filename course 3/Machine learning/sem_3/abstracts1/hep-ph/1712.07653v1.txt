We propose an observable which involves measuring the properties (transverse momentum $p_{h\perp}$ and energy fraction $z_h$) of an identified hadron inside a groomed jet. The jet is identified with an anti-kT/CA algorithm and is groomed by implementing the modified mass drop procedure with an energy cut-off parameter $z_{cut}$. The transverse momentum of the hadron inside the jet is measured with respect to the groomed jet axis. We obtain a factorization theorem in the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), to define a Transverse Momentum Dependent Fragmenting Jet Function (TMDFJF). The TMDFJF is factorized into collinear and collinear soft modes by matching onto SCET$_+$. We resum large logarithms in $E_J/p_{h\perp}$, where $E_J$ is the ungroomed jet energy, to NLL accuracy and apply this formalism for computing the shape of the $p_{h\perp}$ distribution of a pion produced in an $e^+ +e^-$ collision. We observe that the introduction of grooming makes this observable insensitive to non-global logarithms and particularly sensitive to non-perturbative physics of the transverse momentum dependent evolution at low values of $p_{h\perp}$, which can be probed in the variation of the cut-off parameter $z_{cut}$ of the groomer. We discuss how this observable can be used to distinguish between non-perturbative models that describe universal TMD evolution and provide a window into the three dimensional structure of hadrons.
