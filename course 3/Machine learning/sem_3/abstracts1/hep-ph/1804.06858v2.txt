We examine Higgs boson production and decay in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and future colliders. Owing to the long lifetime of the Higgs boson, its hadronic decays may experience little or no screening from the hot and dense quark-gluon plasma whereas jets from hard scattering processes and from decays of the electro-weak gauge bosons and the top-quark suffer significant energy loss. This distinction can lead to enhanced sensitivity in hadronic decay channels and thus, for example, to the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to the bottom quark.
