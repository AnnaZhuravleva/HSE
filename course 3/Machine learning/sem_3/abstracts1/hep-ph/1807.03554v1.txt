We revisit a Dark Matter model with an extension of the Standard Model with two real singlets $\chi$ and $\eta$ obeying a $Z_2 \otimes Z_2'$ symmetry, where $Z_2'$ is broken spontaneously. In particular we study the viability of this model with respect to the requirement of dark matter self-interactions. While $\chi$ serves as a stable Dark Matter candidate, the real $\eta$ field plays the role of a light mediator. Moreover, the Standard Model Higgs which has a tiny mixing with the $\eta$ field appears to be consistent with LHC data. We find in this rather minimal extension of the Standard Model a natural explanation of the cusp-core anomaly in the density profile of dwarf galaxies. Besides, we shall demonstrate that the mediator $\eta$ decays naturally into Majorana neutrinos not disturbing standard big bang nucleosynthesis.
