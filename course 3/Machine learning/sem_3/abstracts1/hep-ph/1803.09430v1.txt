We propose an alternative method of constructing two Higgs-doublet models free from scalar mediated FCNC couplings at the tree-level. In a toy scenario, we have presented semi realistic textures for the Yukawa matrices, which can reproduce the approximate flavor structure in the quark sector. Presence of flavor diagonal but nonuniversal Yukawa couplings emerges as a distinguishing feature of such models.
