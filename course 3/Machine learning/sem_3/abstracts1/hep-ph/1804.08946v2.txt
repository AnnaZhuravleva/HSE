Experimental and lattice data have accumulated a vast amount of material on the properties of confinement in QCD. We enumerate all these properties, 1)-7),and discuss three existing approaches:1/Field Correlator Method(FCM), 2/monopole based Dual Ginzburg-Landau(DGL)theory and 3/the Gribov-Zwanziger model,from this point of view.   It is shown,that the FCM is the only method which satisfies all required criteria. We also formulate the physical consequences of confinement,such as string breaking,Regge trajectories,the role of confinement in the perturbation theory,chiral symmetry breaking,confinement in the boosted systems etc.It is demonstrated that the FCM is a suitable tool for the solution of these problems.
