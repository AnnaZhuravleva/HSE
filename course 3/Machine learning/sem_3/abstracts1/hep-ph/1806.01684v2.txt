We formulate the on-shell effective field theory (OSEFT) in an arbitrary frame and study its reparametrization invariance (RI), which ensures that it is respectful of Lorentz symmetry. In this formulation the OSEFT Lagrangian looks formally equivalent to the sum over light-like velocities of soft collinear effective field theory in the Abelian limit, differences remain in the scale of the gauge fields involved in the two effective theories. We then use the OSEFT Lagrangian expanded in powers of the on-shell energy to derive how the classical transport equations for charged massless fermions are corrected by quantum effects, as derived from quantum field theory. We provide a formulation in a full covariant way, and explain how the consistent form of the chiral anomaly equation can be recovered from our results. We also show how the side jump transformation of the distribution function associated with massless charged fermions can be derived from the RI transformation rules of the OSEFT quantum fields. Finally, we discuss differences in our results with others found in the literature.
