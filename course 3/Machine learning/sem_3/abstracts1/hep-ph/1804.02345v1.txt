In this contribution, we study the inclusive and diffractive $\eta_{c}$ photoproduction in $pp$ and $pPb$ ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC's) at the LHC Run 2 energies. The quarkonium production is studied using nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics (NRQCD) formalism. We present predictions for rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the $\eta_c$ photoproduction and present our estimate for the total cross sections at the Run 2 energies.
