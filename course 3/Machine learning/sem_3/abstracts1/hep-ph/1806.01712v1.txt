We consider the factorized groomed jet mass distribution in inclusive jet processes using modified mass drop tagger (mMDT), corresponding to soft drop with the angular exponent $\beta =0$. A grooming procedure is implemented rather than tagging in the sense that grooming always returns a groomed jet, while tagging dose not return a jet when a single particle remains after tagging. We find that the grooming procedure makes the jet mass distribution infrared safe and only ultraviolet divergences appear in each factorized part. The groomed jet mass distributions are investigated in a wide range of the jet mass considering various limits on the jet mass variable $\rho = M_J^2/(p_T^JR)^2$ and the grooming cut $y_c$. Appropriate effective theories in different kinematic regions are employed to resum large logarithms, in which the analysis in the region $\rho \sim y_c \ll 1$ is included due to the different type of factorization. The analytic computation of the factorized groomed jet mass distribution is presented by resumming the large logarithms in the jet mass, and $y_c$. Numerically, the effect of the resummation is notably enhanced, compared with the calculation at next-to-leading order, and nonglobal logarithms are estimated to be small.
