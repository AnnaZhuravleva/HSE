The possibility of a bound state of the phi-meson and psi(2S)-charmonium is explored. With rather general assumptions about energy-momentum tensor densities in the phi-meson it is shown that such state can exist, and a relation between its mass and width is obtained. Such a bound state is a good candidate for a tetraquark with hidden charm and strangeness.
