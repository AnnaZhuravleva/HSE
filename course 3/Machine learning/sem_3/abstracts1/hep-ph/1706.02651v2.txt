We study a 5D bottom-up holographic model that is expected to describe the dynamics of the minimal composite Higgs model characterized by a $SO(5)\to SO(4)$ global symmetry breaking pattern. We assume that the fundamental degrees of freedom are scalars transforming under some representation of $SO(5)$ and subject to some unspecified strong interactions. The holographic description presented here is inspired by previous studies performed in the context of QCD and it allows for the consideration of spin one and spin zero resonances. The resulting spectrum leads in a natural way to a variety of resonances. Namely, those transforming under the unbroken $SO(4)$ subgroup exhibit an exact degeneracy between the two Regge trajectories of vector and scalar channels, while the resonances with quantum numbers in the $SO(5)/ SO(4)$ coset lie on a trajectory of (heavier) spin one states and a non-degenerated one of scalar resonances where the four lowest lying ones are massless. These correspond to the four Goldstone bosons in 4D associated to the global symmetry breaking pattern. Restrictions derived from the experimental constraints (Higgs couplings, $S$ parameter, etc.) are then implemented and we conclude that the model is able to accommodate vector and scalar resonances with masses in the range 1 TeV to 2 TeV without encountering phenomenological difficulties. Extension to generic models characterized by the breaking pattern $SO(N)\to SO(N^\prime<N)$ is straightforward.
