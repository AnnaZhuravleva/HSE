In this paper we present the mass matrices and mass eigenstates for the CP-even neutral scalars in the minimal 331 model (m331) and its self-interactions, showing that the m331 automatically reproduces the Higgs potential of the Standard Model. We also present a method to generate numerical solutions for the quarks and leptons masses and their mixings, which we apply to study FCNC processes, being to calculate the contributions of all exotic neutral particles of the m331 to the mass differences in meson oscillations.
