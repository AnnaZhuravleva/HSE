If new physics would locate above a TeV scale, as hinted from the LHC results so far, the ultra high energy (UHE) cosmic ray would play nonreplaceable roles in uncovering the new physics beyond the standard model. In particular, if the new physics interactions would induce high multiplicities at the primary collision of UHE cosmic ray and nucleons in the atmosphere, as in the evident cases e.g., the electroweak sphaleron and microscopic black hole, it is important to understand the detailed features of such events so that we are able to distinguish them from the conventional perturbative QCD events. In this paper, we show the characteristic features of such new physics events and discuss the search strategies and perspectives at existing and future coming detector arrays including Telescope-Array (TA) and Pierre-Auger experiment.
