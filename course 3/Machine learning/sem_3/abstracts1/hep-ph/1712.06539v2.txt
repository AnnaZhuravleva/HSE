Under the influence of gravity, light scalar fields can form bound compact objects called boson stars. We use the technique of matching asymptotic expansions to obtain the profile for boson stars where the constituent particles have self-interactions. We obtain parametric representations of these profiles as a function of the self-interactions, including the case of very strong self-interactions. We show that our methods agree with solutions obtained by purely numerical methods. Significant distortions are found as compared to the noninteracting case.
