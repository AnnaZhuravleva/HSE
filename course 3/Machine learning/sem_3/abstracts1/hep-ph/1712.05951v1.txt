We have studied the dissociation of $J/\psi$-mesons in low energy proton-nucleus ($p+A$) collisions in the energy range of the future SIS100 accelerator at Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR). According to the results of our calculations, various scenarios of $J/\psi$ absorption in nuclear matter show very distinct suppression patterns in the kinematic regime to be probed at FAIR. This suggests that the SIS100 energies are particularly suited to shed light on the issue of interaction of $J/\psi$ resonance in nuclear medium.
