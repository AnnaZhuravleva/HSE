The major drawback of "invisible axion" solutions to the strong CP problem is that they are strongly fine-tuned, suffering severely from the electroweak hierarchy problem. We implement the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in existing "composite Higgs" models, which by construction ensure a light Higgs, and explore their predictions for photon signals in axion searches. A simple renormalizable $SO(5)/SO(4)$ $\sigma$-model -which serves as a template for ultraviolet completions- is explored first, determining the minimal scalar extension required to implement the axion mechanism. The analysis is then extended to a plethora of composite Higgs realizations in the literature which differ in their exotic fermion sectors. Naturalness is used as a discriminating criterion to select preferred models. The boundaries of the axion-photon parameter space are also identified for each model explored. Because of the constraints imposed by the light fermion masses on the parameters of the exotic sector, the expected range of allowed couplings turns out to be generically narrowed with respect to that of standard invisible axion models, impacting the experimental quest.
