In models with large extra dimensions, black holes may be produced in high-energy particle collisions. We revisit the physics of black hole formation in extensive airshowers from ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, focusing on collisional QCD and black hole emissivity effects. New results for rotating black holes are presented. Monte Carlo simulations show that QCD effects and black hole spin produce no observable signatures in airshowers. These results further confirm that the main characteristics of black hole-induced airshowers do not depend on the fine details of micro black hole models.
