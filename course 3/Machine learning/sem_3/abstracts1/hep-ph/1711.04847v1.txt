The latest results on top quark physics, namely single top quark production cross sections, $W$-boson helicity and asymmetry measurements are used to probe the Lorentz structure of the $Wtb$ vertex. The increase of sensitivity to new anomalous physics contributions to the top quark sector of the Standard Model is quantified by combining the relevant results from Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider. The results show that combining an increasing set of available precision measurements in the search for new physics phenomena beyond the Standard Model leads to significant sensitivity improvements, especially when compared with the current expectation for the High Luminosity run at the LHC.
