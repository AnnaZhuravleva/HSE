We investigate the symmetry property and the stability of the heptaquark containing two identical heavy antiquarks using color-spin interaction. We construct the wave function of the heptaquark from the Pauli exclusion principle in the SU(3) breaking case. The stability of the heptaquark against the strong decay into one baryon and two mesons is discussed in a simple chromomagnetic model. We find that $q^2 s^3 \bar{s}^2$ with $I=0,S=\frac{5}{2}$ is the most stable heptaquark configuration that could be probed by reconstructing the $\Lambda+\phi+\phi$ invariant mass.
