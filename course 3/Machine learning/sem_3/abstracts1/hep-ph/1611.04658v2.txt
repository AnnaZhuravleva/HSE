The reaction ${\gamma}N \to {\eta}N$ is studied in the high-energy regime (with photon lab energies $E_{\gamma}^{\textrm{lab}} > 4$ GeV) using information from the resonance region through the use of finite-energy sum rules (FESR). We illustrate how analyticity allows one to map the t-dependence of the unknown Regge residue functions. We provide predictions for the energy dependence of the beam asymmetry at high energies.
