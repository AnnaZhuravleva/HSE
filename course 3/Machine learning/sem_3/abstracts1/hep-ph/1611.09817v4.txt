In this work, within an anomalous modified holographic softwall model, we calculate analytically the masses of the scalar glueball with its radial excitations and higher even glueball spin states, with $P=C=+1$, from a single mass equation. Using this approach we achieved an unified treatment for both scalar and high even spin glueballs masses. Furthermore, we also obtain the Regge trajectory associated with the pomeron compatible with other approaches.
