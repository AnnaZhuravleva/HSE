We use special quadrature formulas for singular and hypersingular integral to numerically solve the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in momentum space with the linear confinement potential, Coulomb and Cornell potentials. It is shown that the eigenvalues of the equation can be calculated with high accuracy, far exceeding other calculation methods. Special methods of solution for states with zero orbital angular momentum are considered.
