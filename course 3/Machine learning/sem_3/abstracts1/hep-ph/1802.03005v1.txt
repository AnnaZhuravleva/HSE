The coloron, a massive version of the gluon present in gauge extensions of QCD, has been searched for at the LHC as a dijet or top quark pair resonance. We point out that in the Renormalizable Coloron Model (ReCoM) with a minimal field content to break the gauge symmetry, a color-octet scalar and a singlet scalar are naturally lighter than the coloron because they are pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Consequently, the coloron may predominantly decay into scalar pairs, leading to novel signatures at the LHC. When the color-octet scalar is lighter than the singlet, or when the singlet mass is above roughly 1 TeV, the signatures consist of multi-jet resonances of multiplicity up to 12, including topologies with multi-prong jet substructure, slightly displaced vertices, and sometimes a top quark pair. When the singlet is the lightest ReCoM boson and lighter than about 1 TeV, its main decays ($W^+W^-$, $\gamma Z$, $ZZ$) arise at three loops. The LHC signatures then involve two or four boosted electroweak bosons, often originating from highly displaced vertices, plus one or two pairs of prompt jets or top quarks.
