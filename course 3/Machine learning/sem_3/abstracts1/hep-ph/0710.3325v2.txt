In this paper we study the possibility of testing \emph{CPT} symmetry with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. Working with an effective lagrangian of the photon with \emph{CPT} violation ${\cal L} \sim p_{\mu}A_{\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$ which causes the polarization vectors of the propagating CMB photons rotated, we determine the rotation angle $\Delta\alpha$ using the BOOMERanG 2003 and the WMAP3 angular power spectra. In this analysis we have included the newly released $TC$ and $GC$ ($l<450$) information of WMAP3 and found $\Delta\alpha=-6.2\pm3.8$ deg at $1\sigma$ confidence level. This result increases slightly the significance for the \emph{CPT} violation obtained in our previous paper (Feng \emph{et al.}, 2006) $\Delta\alpha=-6.0 \pm 4.0$ deg (1$\sigma$). Furthermore we examine the constraint on the rotation angle with the simulated Planck data. Our results show that the Planck will be sensitive to $\Delta \alpha$ at the level of 0.057 deg and able to test the \emph{CPT} symmetry with a higher precision.
