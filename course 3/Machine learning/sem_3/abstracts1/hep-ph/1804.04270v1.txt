In this paper we consider possible mechanisms to generate small Majorana neutrino masses for active neutrinos in the scenario of gauge-Higgs unification, a candidate of physics beyond the standard model. We stress that it is non-trivial to find a gauge invariant operator, responsible for the Majorana masses, which is the counterpart of the well-known SU(2)$_L \times$ U(1)$_Y$ invariant higher mass dimensional ($d = 5$) operator. As the first possible mechanism, we discuss seesaw mechanism by assigning leptonic fields to the adjoint representation of gauge group, so that $d = 5$ gauge invariant operator can be formed. It turns out that the mechanism leading to the small Majorana masses is the admixture of Type I and Type III seesaw mechanisms. As the second possibility, we consider the case where the relevant operator has $d = 7$, by introducing matter scalar belonging to the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Reflecting the fact that the mass dimension of the operator is higher than usually expected, the Majorana masses are generated by "double seesaw mechanism". Also discussed is the possibility of radiatively induced Majorana neutrino masses, where the masses are induced at one-loop level, just as in the case of Zee's model, though in our model the charged gauge singlet scalar $s^{+}$ introduced in the Zee's model is naturally combined with the Higgs doublet to form a triplet of SU(3), the minimal gauge group of unified electro-weak theory based on this scenario.
