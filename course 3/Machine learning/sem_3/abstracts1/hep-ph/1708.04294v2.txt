We performed a simulation on the DUNE experiment to probe the capability of future neutrino long-baseline experiments' ability to constrain the parameter space of high-energy models by using the correlation between the atmospheric and reactor mixing angles. As an example, we took the Tetrahedral Flavour Symmetry model, which predicts a strong relation between the non-zero value of $\theta_{13}$ and deviation of $\theta_{23}$ from the maximality. We show that in this case, the model can realistically be excluded in more than $3\sigma$ for most of the parameter space. We also study the octant degeneracy at DUNE and its impact on the sensitivity of such models.
