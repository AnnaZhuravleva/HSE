We study the custodial Randall-Sundrum model with two Higgs doublets localized in the $\TeV $ brane. The scalar potential is CP- conserving and has a softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry. In the presence of a curvature-scalar mixing term $ \xi_{ab} \mathcal{R} \Phi_a^\dagger \Phi_b$ the radion that stabilizes the extra dimension now mixes with the two CP-even neutral scalars $h$ and $H$. A goodness of fit of the LHC data on the properties of the light Higgs is performed on the parameter space of the type-I and type-II models. LHC direct searches for heavy scalars in different decay channels can help distinguish between the radion and a heavy Higgs. The most important signatures involve the ratio of heavy scalar decays into $b$ quark pairs to those into $Z$ pairs, as well as the decay of the scalar (pseudoscalar) into a $Z$ plus a pseudoscalar (scalar).
