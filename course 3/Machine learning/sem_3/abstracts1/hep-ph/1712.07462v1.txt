We construct a complete and minimal basis of subleading-power N-jet operators in position-space soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) and discuss how the Low-Burnett-Kroll amplitude is recovered in this framework. We begin a systematic investigation of the anomalous dimension of next-to-leading power N-jet operators in view of resummation of logarithmically enhanced terms in partonic cross sections and discuss the explicit result at the one-loop order for fermion-number two N-jet operators at the second order in the power expansion parameter of SCET.
