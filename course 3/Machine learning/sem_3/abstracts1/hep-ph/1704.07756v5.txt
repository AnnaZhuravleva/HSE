We complete the construction of the sphaleron $\widehat{S}$ in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with a single Higgs triplet by solving the reduced field equations numerically. The energy of the $SU(3)$ sphaleron $\widehat{S}$ is found to be of the same order as the energy of a previously known solution, the embedded $SU(2)\times U(1)$ sphaleron $S$. In addition, we discuss $\widehat{S}$ in an extended $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with three Higgs triplets, where all eight gauge bosons get an equal mass in the vacuum. This extended $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory may be considered as a toy model of quantum chromodynamics without quark fields and we conjecture that the $\widehat{S}$ gauge fields play a significant role in the nonperturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (which does not have fundamental scalar fields but gets a mass scale from quantum effects).
