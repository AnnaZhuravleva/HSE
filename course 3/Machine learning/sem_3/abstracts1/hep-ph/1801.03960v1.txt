It is often stated that the vacuum is trivial when light-front (null-plane) quantization is applied to a quantum field theory, in contrast to the situation with equal-time quantization. In fact, it is has long been known that the statement is false, and that in certain cases the standard rules for light-front perturbation theory need modification. This paper gives an elementary review of these issues, including an explanation of how and when there is a failure of the elementary derivation of the rules for light-front perturbation theory.
