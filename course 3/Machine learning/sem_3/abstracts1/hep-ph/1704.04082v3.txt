We employ the chiral quark-soliton model to describe excited baryons with one heavy quark. Identifying known charmed baryons with multiplets allowed by the model, we argue that apart from regular excitations of the ground state multiplets, some of recently reported by the LHCb collaboration narrow $\Omega^{0}_{c}$ states, may correspond to the exotic pentaquarks. This interpretation can be easily verified experimentally, since exotic $\Omega^{0}_{c}$ states -- contrary to the regular excitations -- form isospin triplets, rather than singlets.
