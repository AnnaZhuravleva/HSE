We present the energy spectra of the fluxes of positrons, anti-protons and photons generated by Dark Matter annihilations in our galaxy, as univocally predicted by the model of Minimal Dark Matter. Due to multi-TeV masses and to the Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross section, distinctive signals are generated above the background, even with a modest astrophysical boost factor, in the range of energies soon to be explored by cosmic ray experiments.
