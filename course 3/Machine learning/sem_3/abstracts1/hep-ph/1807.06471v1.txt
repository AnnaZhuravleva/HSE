We revisit a discussion on the impact-parameter dependence of proton-proton elastic scattering amplitude. This analysis allows to reveal the asymptotic properties of hadron interactions. New data clearly indicate that the impact-parameter elastic scattering amplitude exceeds the black disk limit at 13 TeV c.m.s. energy of the LHC reaching a value of $\mathrm{Im} H(s,0) = 0.568 \pm 0.001$. The inelastic overlap function reaches its maximum value at $b \approx 0.4$ fm with a clear dip at $b = 0$. New analysis is consistent with smooth energy evolution of the elastic scattering amplitude and confirms the earlier conclusion on the black disk limit excess observed at 7 TeV.
