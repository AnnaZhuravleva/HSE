In this work, we study the lepton number violating W boson and top quark decays via intermediate on-shell Majorana neutrinos Nj into three charged leptons and a light neutrino. We discuss the neutrino oscillation effects present in the decay due to the small mass gap between the heavy neutrino states. We focus on a scenario that contains at least two heavy Majorana neutrinos in the mass range 2-80 GeV. The results show that CP-phases could be observed in a future experiment such as High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. We also present regions of the heavy-light neutrino mixing in which the abovementioned phases could be explored.
