Effective field theories such as Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) are indispensable tools in controlling the effects of the strong interaction. The increasing experimental precision requires the knowledge of higher dimensional operators. We present a general method that allows for an easy construction of HQET operators that contain two heavy quarks and any number of covariant derivatives.
