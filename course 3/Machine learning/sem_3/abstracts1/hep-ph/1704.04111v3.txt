In this article, we tentatively assign the $X^*(3860)$ to be the $C\gamma_5\otimes \gamma_5C$ type scalar tetraquark state, study its mass and width with the QCD sum rules, special attention is paid to calculating the hadronic coupling constants $G_{X\eta_c\pi}$ and $G_{XDD}$ concerning the tetraquark state. We obtain the values $M_{X}=3.86 \pm 0.09\,\rm{GeV}$ and $\Gamma_{X}= 202\pm 146 \,\rm{MeV}$, which are consistent with the experimental data. The numerical result supports assigning the $X^*(3860)$ to be the $C\gamma_5\otimes \gamma_5C$ type scalar tetraquark state.
