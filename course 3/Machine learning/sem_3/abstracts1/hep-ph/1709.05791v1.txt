Given the experimental precision and the multitude of processes that can be measured at the LHC, electroweak (EW) corrections become more and more relevant. This calls for the automatisation of EW corrections and in particular their implementations in multi-purpose Monte Carlo generators in order to allow for a systematic study of such contributions. In these proceedings I present the implementation of the matrix-element generator Recola in the Sherpa Monte Carlo. The combination Sherpa+Recola allows to compute, in principle, any process in the Standard Model at NLO QCD and EW accuracy. In addition to fixed-order NLO computations, all functionalities of Sherpa such as parton shower or hadronisation are still available.
