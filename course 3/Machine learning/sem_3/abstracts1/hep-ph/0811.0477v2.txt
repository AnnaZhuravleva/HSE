We provide a scenario in which a hidden U(1) gauge boson constitutes dark matter of the Universe and decays into the standard-model particles through a kinetic mixing with an $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson. Interestingly, our model can naturally account for the steep rise in the positron fraction recently reported by PAMELA. Moreover, we find that due to the charge assignment of $U(1)_{B-L}$, only a small amount of antiprotons are produced in the decay, which is also consistent with the PAMELA and other observational data.
