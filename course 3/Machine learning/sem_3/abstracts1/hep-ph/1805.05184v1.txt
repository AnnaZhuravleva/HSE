We advocate the idea that the there is a fundamentally new mechanism for the axion production in the Sun, which has never been discussed previously in the literature. These novel axions will be produced in addition to well studied axions emitted due to the Primakoff effect. The arguments are based on the so-called Axion Quark Nugget (AQN) Dark Matter Model. This model was originally invented as a natural explanation of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude values, irrespectively to the axion mass $m_a$ or initial misalignment angle $\theta_0$. This model, without adjustment of any parameters, gives a very reasonable intensity of the extreme UV (EUV) radiation from the corona as a result of the AQN annihilation events with the solar material. This extra energy released in corona represents a resolution, within AQN framework, a long standing puzzle known in the literature as the ``solar corona heating mystery". The same annihilation events also produce the axions. The flux of these axions is unambiguously fixed in this model and expressed in terms of the EUV luminosity from corona. We also compute the spectral properties of these axions and make few comments on the potentials for the discovery of these solar axions by the updated CAST experiment.
