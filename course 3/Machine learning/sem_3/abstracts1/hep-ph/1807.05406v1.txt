The dependence on the numbers of flavors of the QCD corrections to the ratio between pole and $\overline{\rm{MS}}$-scheme running masses of heavy quarks is fixed for the $\mathcal{O}(a_s^4)$-correction by the least squares method and estimated for the $\mathcal{O}(a_s^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(a_s^6)$ contributions by means of the effective charges motivated approach and independently by the renormalon-based analysis. The application of the least squares method allows to determine the central values of the constant and linearly dependent on the number of flavors coefficients of the corresponding $a_s^4$ term and their theoretical uncertainties. The four-loop QED approximations for ratios of pole and $\overline{\rm{MS}}$-scheme running masses of three charged leptons are determined and commented. The results of our researches indicate that the asymptotic nature of the perturbative QCD relation between pole and $\overline{\rm{MS}}$-scheme running mass of $t$-quark starts to manifest itself from 7 order of PT. Therefore the concept of the pole mass of the top-quark can be safely used even at the $\mathcal{O}(a_s^6)$ level of PT. The impact of the typical to the Minkowskian region contributions, proportional to powers of $\pi^2$-terms, is discussed.
