We study the excess 1-3 GeV gamma rays signal observed from the galactic center within a conformal model. The model has a dark sector with strong self interactions. This sector couples weakly with the Standard Model particles via a scalar messenger. The lightest dark sector particle is a pion-like fermion anti-fermion bound state. We find that the observed gamma ray excess at Fermi-LAT is nicely explained in terms of decay of the dark pions. The dark matter relic density is also explained by the freeze-in mechanism in which the dark pions are produced in the early Universe by annihilation and decay of standard model particles. We have used Higgs invisible decay and dark matter direct detection experiments in order to put bounds on the parameters of the model.
