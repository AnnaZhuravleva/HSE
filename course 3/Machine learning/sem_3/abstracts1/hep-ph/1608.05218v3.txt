Bose-Einstein correlations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC are well descried by the formula with two different scales. It is shown for the first time that the pions are produced by few small size sources distributed over a much larger area in impact parameter space occupied by the interaction amplitude. The dependence of the two radii obtained in this procedure on the charged particle density and the mean transverse momentum of the pion/hadron in the correlated pair are discussed.
