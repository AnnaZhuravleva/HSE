The two-photon-exchange (TPE) effects in the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow \pi^+\pi^-$ at large momentum transfer are discussed within the perturbative QCD (pQCD). The contributions from the twist-2 and twist-3 distribution amplitudes (DAs) of pion are considered in the estimation. Different with the results under the one-photon-exchange (OPE) approximation, the TPE effects result in an asymmetry of the differential cross section on the scattering angle. The precise measurement of this asymmetry by the further experiment is an precise test of pQCD at large momentum transfer. The time-like electromagnetic form factor of pion at the leading order of pQCD is re-discussed and the comparison of our results with those in the references are presented.
