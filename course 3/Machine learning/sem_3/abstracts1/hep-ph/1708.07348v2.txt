The LHCb Collaboration recently observed five narrow $\Omega_c^{0}$ resonances, and measured their masses and widths through the decays $ \Omega_c^{0} \to \Xi_c^{+}K^{-}$. Motivated by this discovery, and also by the fact that the ground-state bottom baryon $\Omega_b^{-}$ with spin-1/2 was already found experimentally, we perform theoretical investigation of the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2, $\Omega_b$, baryons by calculating decay width of their first orbitally and radially excited states to $\Xi_b^{0} K^{-}$. For this purpose, we employ QCD sum rule method on the light-cone by including into analysis the $K$ meson distribution amplitudes up to twist-4. Obtained analytical expressions are utilized to extract parameters of these decay processes which may be useful for forthcoming experimental studies of bottom baryons.
