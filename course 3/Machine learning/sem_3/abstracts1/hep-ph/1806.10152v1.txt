To derive a structure revealing expression of the neutrino oscillation probability in matter we formulate a perturbative framework with two kind of expansion parameters, the ratio $\epsilon$ of the solar $\Delta m^2_{sol}$ to atmospheric $\Delta m^2_{atm}$ and the parameters which describe unitarity violation (UV). We show that it illuminates how the three UV complex parameters correlate with the lepton Kobayashi-Maskawa phase $\delta$ in the oscillation probability. Using the $\alpha$ parametrization, it is expressed as $e^{- i \delta } \alpha_{\mu e}$, $\alpha_{\tau e}$, and $e^{i \delta } \alpha_{\tau \mu}$, a universal combination in all the oscillation channels. Furthermore, we show that our perturbative framework sheds light on conceptual understanding of "non-unitary" neutrino evolution in matter. We argue, though it may be counterintuitive, that the three active neutrino propagation in matter {\em must be unitary} in the presence of non-unitary mixing matrix. We explicitly demonstrate this property to first order in our perturbation theory. Non-unitarity comes in only at the initial and the final projection from/to neutrino flavor states to/from mass eigenstates.
