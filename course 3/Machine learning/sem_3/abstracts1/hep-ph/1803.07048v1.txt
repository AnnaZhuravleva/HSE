We show that despite stringent constraints on the shape of the main part of the CMB spectrum, there is considerable room for its modification within its Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) end, $\omega \ll T_{\rm CMB}$. We construct explicit New Physics models that give an order one (or larger) increase of power in the RJ tail, which can be tested by existing and upcoming experiments aiming to detect the cosmological 21 cm emission/absorption signal. This class of models stipulates the decay of unstable particles to dark photons, $A'$, that have a small mass, $m_{A'} \sim 10^{-14} - 10^{-9}$ eV, non-vanishing mixing angle $\epsilon$ with electromagnetism, and energies much smaller than $T_{\rm CMB}$. The non-thermal number density of dark photons can be many orders of magnitude above the number density of CMB photons, and even a small probability of $A'\to A$ oscillations, going down to values of the mixing as small as $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9}$, can significantly increase the number of RJ photons. In particular, we show that resonant oscillations of dark photons into regular photons in the interval of redshifts $20 < z < 1700$ can be invoked as an explanation of the recent tentative observation of a stronger-than-expected absorption signal of 21 cm photons. We present a realistic model that realizes this possibility, where micro-eV mass dark matter decays to dark photons, with a lifetime longer than the age of the Universe.
