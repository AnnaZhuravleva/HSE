Macroscopic nuggets of quark matter were proposed several decades ago as a candidate for dark matter. The formation of these objects in the early universe requires the QCD phase transition to be first order - a requirement that is not satisfied in the Standard Model where lattice simulations reveal a continuous crossover instead. In this article we point out that new physics may supercool the electroweak phase transition to below the QCD scale, and the QCD phase transition with six massless quarks becomes first-order. As a result, the quark nuggets composed of six-flavor quark matter (6FQM) may survive as a viable dark matter candidate. The size of a 6FQM nugget is estimated to be around $10^{10}$ grams in mass and $10^{-2}$ cm in radius. The calculated relic abundance of 6FQM nuggets is comparable to the observed dark matter energy density; therefore, this scenario provides a compelling explanation for the coincident energy densities of dark and baryonic matter. We have explored various potential signatures - including a gravitational wave background, gravitational lensing, and transient photon emission from collisions with compact stars and other nuggets - and demonstrated that the favored region of parameter space is still allowed by current constraints while discovery of 6FQM nugget dark matter may require new experimental probes.
