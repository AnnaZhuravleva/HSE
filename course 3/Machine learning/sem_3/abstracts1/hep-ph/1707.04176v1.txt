We calculate 1-loop radiative corrections to the $hZZ$ and $hWW$ couplings in models with next--to--simplest Higgs sectors satisfying the electroweak $\rho$ parameter equal to 1 at tree level: the Higgs singlet model, the two-Higgs doublet models, and the Georgi-Machacek model. Under theoretical and current experimental constraints, the three models have different correlations between the deviations in the $hZZ$ and $hWW$ couplings from the standard model predictions. In particular, we find for each model predictions with no overlap with the other two models.
