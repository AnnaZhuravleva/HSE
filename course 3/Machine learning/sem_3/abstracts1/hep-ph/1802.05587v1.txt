In recent years the Tsallis statistics is gaining popularity in describing charged particle produc- tion and their properties, in particular pT spectra and the multiplicities in high energy particle collisions. Motivated by its success, an analysis of the LHC data of proton-proton collisions at ener- gies ranging from 0.9 TeV to 7 TeV in different rapidity windows for charged particle multiplicities has been done. A comparative analysis is performed in terms of the Tsallis distribution, the Gamma distribution and the shifted-Gamma distribution. An interesting observation on the inapplicability of these distributions at sqrt{s}=7 TeV in the lower rapidity windows is intriguing. The non-extensive nature of the Tsallis statistics is studied by determining the entropic index and its energy depen- dence. The analysis is extrapolated to predict the multiplicity distribution at sqrt{s}=14 TeV for one rapidity window, |y| < 1.5 with the Tsallis function.
