The Nobel prize in physics 2015 has been awarded "... for the discovery of neutrino oscillations which show that neutrinos have mass". While SuperKamiokande (SK), indeed, has discovered oscillations, SNO observed effect of the adiabatic (almost non-oscillatory) flavor conversion of neutrinos in the matter of the Sun. Oscillations are irrelevant for solar neutrinos apart from small $\nu_e$ regeneration inside the Earth. Both oscillations and adiabatic conversion do not imply masses uniquely and further studies were required to show that non-zero neutrino masses are behind the SNO results. Phenomena of oscillations (phase effect) and adiabatic conversion (the MSW effect driven by the change of mixing in matter) are described in pedagogical way.
