We describe the implementation of four models for production of dark matter or as- sociated particles at the LHC based on the simplest extensions of the Standard Model. The first kind of models include dark matter production via s-channel mediators. This includes production in association with a jet for a vector boson (Z') or scalar (S) mediator as well as mono-higgs production via associated hZ' production. We implement the simplest t-channel mediator in the form of a scalar with leptonic quantum numbers and completely generic Yukawa couplings to the dark matter fermion and a right-handed SM lepton. Finally, we implement a generalised model of mixed dark matter where the dark matter is a mixture of an SU(2) singlet and N-plet. We find that the last two models are also ideally suited to study the production of a range of long-lived particle signatures. We illustrate this by reinterpreting the limits from CMS search for heavy charged particles for the t-channel case.
