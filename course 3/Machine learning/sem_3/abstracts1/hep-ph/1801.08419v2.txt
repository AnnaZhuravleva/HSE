In this article, we construct the scalar-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type current to study the ground state triply charmed pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules. We separate the contributions of the negative-parity and positive parity triply charmed pentaquark states explicitly, and take the energy scale formula $\mu=\sqrt{M^2_{P}-(3{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to determine the optimal energy scales of the QCD spectral densities. The predicted pentaquark masses can be confronted to the experimental data in the future.
