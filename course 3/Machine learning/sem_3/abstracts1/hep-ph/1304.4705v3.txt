We declare that we live in the quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time with, via the gauge principle, the force-fields gauge-group structure, $SU_c(3) \times SU_L(2) \times U(1)$ applied to the quark world or $SU_L(2) \times U(1) \times SU_f(3)$ applied to the lepton world, built-in from the very beginning. The quark world with the triplets from the "quark" group $SU_Q(3)$ (used to be called "flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry"), which is of nuclear sizes and is protected by $SU_c(3) \times SU_L(2) \times U(1)$ (i.e. the (123) symmetry), can be seen by our world, while the lepton world, as of atomic sizes and protected by $SU_L(2) \times U(1) \times SU_f(3)$ or another (123) symmetry, can also be seen, as singlets of the quark group $SU_Q(3)$, by our world. Apart from the "ignition" term, the entire Standard Model is dimensionless and massless in the quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time; that is, all couplings are dimensionless and there are no mass terms in the quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.   Therefore, there exist the well-studied $3^\circ \,K$ cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the now clustered neutrino halos formed from cosmic background (CB) neutrinos (of three flavors, and antineutrinos), both present in the overall background of our Universe. In theory, it yields neutrino oscillations, as some lepton-flavor-violating processes, in a natural manner.
