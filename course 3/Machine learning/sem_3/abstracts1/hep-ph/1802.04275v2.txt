We study the implications of generalized CP transformations acting on the mass matrices of charged leptons in a model-independent way. Generalized $e-\mu$, $e-\tau$ and $\mu-\tau$ symmetries are considered in detail. In all cases the physical parameters of the lepton mixing matrix, three mixing angles and three CP phases can be expressed in terms of a restricted set of independent "theory" parameters that characterize a given choice of CP transformation. This leads to implications for neutrino oscillations as well as neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.
