Masses and decay constants of scalar $D_0$ and $D_{s0}$ mesons in isospin asymmetric strange hadronic matter at finite temperature are evaluated using QCD sum rules and chiral SU(3) model. In-medium light quark condensates, $\left\langle \bar{u}u\right\rangle_{\rho_{B}}$ and $\left\langle \bar{d}d\right\rangle_{\rho_{B}}$, the strange quark condensates, $\left\langle \bar{s}s\right\rangle_{\rho_{B}}$, and the gluon condensates, $\left\langle \frac{\alpha_{s}}{\pi} {G^a}_{\mu\nu} {G^a}^{\mu\nu} \right\rangle_{\rho_{B}}$, needed in QCD sum rule calculations are evaluated using chiral SU(3) model. As an application, we calculate the in-medium partial decay width of scalar $D_0$ ($D_{s0}$) meson decaying to $D$ + $\pi$ ($D_s$+$\pi$) pseudoscalar mesons using $^3 P_0$ model. The medium effects in their decay widths are assimilated through the modification in the masses of these mesons. These results may be helpful to understand the possible outcomes of the future experiments like CBM and PANDA under the FAIR facility where the study of charmed hadrons is one of major goal.
