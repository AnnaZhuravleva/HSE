For gravitino dark matter with conserved R-parity and mass in the GeV range, very strong constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis exclude the popular NLSP candidates like neutralino and charged sleptons. In this letter we therefore draw attention to the case of a sneutrino NLSP, that is naturally realised in the context of gaugino mediation. We find interesting collider signatures, characterised by soft jets or leptons due to the small sneutrino--stau mass splitting. Moreover, the lightest neutralino can have visible decays into staus, and in some part of the parameter space also into selectrons and smuons. We also show the importance of coannihilation effects for the evaluation of the BBN constraints.
