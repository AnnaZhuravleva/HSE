We study the charm quark elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) in heavy ion as well as small system collisions by tracking the evolution history of quarks of different flavors within a multi-phase transport model. The charm quark $v_{2}$ is studied as a function of the number of collisions the charm quark suffers with other quarks and then compared to the $v_{2}$ of lighter quarks. We find that the common escape mechanism is at work for both the charm and light quark $v_{2}$. However, contrary to the naive expectation, the hydrodynamics-type flow contributes much more to the charm $v_{2}$ than the light quark $v_{2}$. This could be explained by the smaller average deflection angle the heavier charm quark undergoes in each collision. Our finding thus suggests that the charm $v_{2}$ is a better probe for studying the hydrodynamic properties of the quark-gluon plasma.
