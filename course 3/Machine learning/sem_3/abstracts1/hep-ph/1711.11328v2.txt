We present an analytic representation of $F_K/F_\pi$ as calculated in three-flavour two-loop chiral perturbation theory, which involves expressing three mass scale sunsets in terms of Kamp\'e de F\'eriet series. We demonstrate how approximations may be made to obtain relatively compact analytic representations. An illustrative set of fits using lattice data is also presented, which shows good agreement with existing fits.
