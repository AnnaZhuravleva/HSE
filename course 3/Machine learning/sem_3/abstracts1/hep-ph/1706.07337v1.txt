The recent intriguing measurements of $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$ are important hints of new physics that violates lepton universality. We analyze the semileptonic decays $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ in the framework of the $B-L$ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with Inverse Seesaw (BLSSMIS). A salient feature of this model is that one of the right-handed sneutrino can be light and the neutrino Yukawa couplings are of order one. We show that the box diagram mediated by right-handed sneutrino, higgsino-like chargino, and light stop can account simultaneously for both $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$. Within this context, a significant lepton flavor non-universality is generated by large neutrino Yukawa couplings,
