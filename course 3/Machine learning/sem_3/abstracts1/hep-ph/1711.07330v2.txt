We discuss two examples of oscillations apparently hidden in some experimental results for high energy multiparticle production processes: (i) - the log-periodic oscillatory pattern decorating the power-like Tsallis distributions of transverse momenta, (ii) - the oscillations of the modified combinants obtained from the measured multiplicity distributions. We show that in both cases these phenomena can provide new insight into the dynamics of these processes.
