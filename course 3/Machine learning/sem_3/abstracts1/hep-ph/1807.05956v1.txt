We present an analysis of the three-flavor holographic model of QCD associated to a $D4/D8$ brane configuration, with symmetry breaking induced by a worldsheet instanton associated to a closed loop connecting $D4-D8-D6-\overline{D8}$. We calculate the electromagnetic and axial couplings of all octet and decuplet baryons, as well as several negative parity excitations, with and without symmetry breaking effects, and demonstrate qualitative and quantitative agreement with many available experimental measurements, with marked improvement over the analogous two-flavor models.
