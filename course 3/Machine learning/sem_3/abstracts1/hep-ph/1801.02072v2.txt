The possibility of axion detection by observing axion induced atomic excitations as recently suggested by Sikivie is discussed. The atom is cooled at low temperature and it is chosen to posses three levels. The first is the ground state, the second is completely empty chosen so that the energy difference between the two is close to the axion mass. Under the spin induced axion-electron interaction an electron is excited from the first to the second level. The presence of such an electron there can be confirmed by exciting it further via a proper tunable laser beam to a suitably chosen third level, which is also empty, and lies at a higher excitation energy. From the observation of its subsequent de-excitation one infers the presence of the axion. In addition the presence of the axion can be inferred from the de-excitation of the second level to the ground state. The system is in a magnetic field so that the energies involved can be suitably adjusted. Reasonable axion absorption rates have been obtained.
