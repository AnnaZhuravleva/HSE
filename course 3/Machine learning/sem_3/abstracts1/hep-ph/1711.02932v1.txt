We report on a recent calculation of the complete NLO QCD and electroweak corrections to the process $pp\to\mu^+\nu_\mu e^+\nu_ejj$, i.e. like-sign charged vector-boson scattering. The computation is based on the complete amplitudes involving two different orders of the strong and electroweak coupling constants at tree level and three different orders at one-loop level. We find electroweak corrections of $-13\%$ for the fiducial cross section that are an intrinsic feature of the vector-boson scattering process. For differential distributions, the corrections reach up to $-40\%$ in the phase-space regions explored. At the NLO level a unique separation between vector-boson scattering and irreducible background processes is not possible any more at the level of Feynman diagrams.
