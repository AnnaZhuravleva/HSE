We provide a small C++ library with Mathematica and Python interfaces for computing thermal functions, defined $$ J_\text{B/F}(y^2) \equiv \Re \int_0^\infty x^2 \log\left[1 \mp e^{-\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \right] \,\text{d}x, $$ which appear in finite-temperature quantum field theory and play a role in phase-transitions in the early Universe, including baryogenesis, electroweak symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism.
