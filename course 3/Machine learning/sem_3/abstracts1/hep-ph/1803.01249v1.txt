I study a class of Randall-Sundrum (RS) models with Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance (SBSI). This class of models implements the Contino-Pomarol-Rattazzi (CPR) mechanism to achieve SBSI through the small running of an external close-to-marginal scale-breaking operator that leads to a light dilaton/radion with couplings to matter suppressed by the small running. I show that for radion masses $\lesssim 1$ KeV, it can serve as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate, with a lifetime longer than the age of the universe, and show that the experimental bounds from LHC, Non-Newtonian Gravity and Axion-Like Particle (ALP) searches allow for the existence of such a radion.
