We revisit the transverse momentum broadening of a fast parton pair crossing a nuclear medium, putting emphasis on the pair global color state, for any number of colors $N$ and within the eikonal limit for parton propagation and the Gaussian approximation for the gluon field of the target. This study should provide the necessary tools to address nuclear broadening of $n$-parton systems in phenomenology while highlighting the color structure of the process.
