In this work, we study strong and radiative decays of S-wave D\Xi molecular state, which is related to the \Omega^*_c states newly observed at LHCb. The coupling between the D\Xi molecular state and its constituents D and \Xi is calculated by using the compositeness condition. With the obtained coupling, the partial decay widths of the D\Xi molecular state into the \Xi_c^{+}K^{-}, \Xi^{'+}_cK^{-} and \Omega^{*}_c(2695)\gamma final states through hadronic loop are calculated with the help of the effective Lagrangians. By comparison with the LHCb observation, the current results of total decay width support the \Omega^{*}_c(3119) or \Omega^{*}_c(3050) as D\Xi molecule while the the decay width of the \Omega^{*}_c(3000), \Omega^{*}_c(3066) and \Omega^{*}_c(3090) can not be well reproduced in the molecular state picture. The partial decay widths are also presented and helpful to further understand the internal structures of \Omega^{*}_c(3119) and \Omega^{*}_c(3050).
