We propose a new model with flavor-dependent gauged $U(1)_{B-L_1}\times U(1)_{B-L_{2}-L_{3}}$ symmetry in addition to the flavor-blind one in the standard model. The model contains three right-handed neutrinos to cancel gauge anomalies and several Higgses to construct the measured fermion masses. We show the generic feature of the model and explore its phenomenology. In particular, we discuss the current bounds on the extra gauge bosons from the LEP experiments and focus on their contributions to the lepton flavor violating processes of $\ell_{i+1}\to \ell_i\gamma$ (i=1,2).
