I suggest an extension of the SM by introducing a dark sector with the local $U(1)_{D}$ symmetry. The particles in the dark sector bring about the new physics beyond the SM. In particular the global $B-L$ symmetry is violated just above the electroweak scale, this becomes a common origin of the tiny neutrino mass, the cold dark mater and the baryon asymmetry. The model can not only account for the tiny neutrino mass and the "WIMP Miracle", but also achieve the leptogenesis around the electroweak scale. Finally, it is very possible that the model predictions are tested in near future experiments.
