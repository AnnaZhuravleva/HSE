We summarize our recent paper on neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter, explaining the importance, relevance and need for simple, highly accurate approximations to the neutrino oscillation probabilities in matter. Simple expressions for the neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences in matter are given in an Appendix. Using these in the vacuum oscillation probabilities instead of the vacuum values, gives an excellent approximation to the oscillation probabilities in matter.
