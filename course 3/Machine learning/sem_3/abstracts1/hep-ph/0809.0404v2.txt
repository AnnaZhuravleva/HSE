We calculate the spin dependent Fermi liquid parameters (FLPs), single particle energies and energy densities of various spin states of polarized quark matter. The expressions for the incompressibility($K$) and sound velocity ($c_1$) in terms of the spin dependent FLPs and polarization parameter $(\xi)$ are derived. Estimated values of $K$ and $c_1$ reveal that the equation of state (EOS) of the polarized matter is stiffer than the unpolarized one. Finally we investigate the possibility of the spin polarization (ferromagnetism) phase transition.
