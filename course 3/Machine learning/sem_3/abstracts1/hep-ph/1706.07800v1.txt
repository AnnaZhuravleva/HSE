From a systematic analysis of the energy-dependence of four antibaryon-to-baryon ratios relative to the antikaon-to-kaon ratio, we propose an alternative approach determining the strange-quark chemical potential ($\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$). It is found that $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ generically genuinely equals one-fifth the baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\mathrm{b}}$). An additional quantity depending on $\mu_{\mathrm{b}}$ and the freezeout temperature ($T$) should be added in order to assure averaged strangeness conversation. This quantity gives a genuine estimation for the possible strangeness enhancement with the increase in the collision energy. At the chemical freezeout conditioned to constant entropy density normalized to temperature cubed, various particle ratios calculated at $T$ and $\mu_{\mathrm{b}}$ and the resultant $\mu_{\mathrm{s}}$ excellently agree with the statistical-thermal calculations.
