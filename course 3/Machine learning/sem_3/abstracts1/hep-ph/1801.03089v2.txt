We study observational consequences arising from dark matter (DM) of non-thermal origin, produced by dark freeze-out from a hidden sector heat bath. We assume this heat bath was populated by feebly-coupled mediator particles, produced via a Higgs portal interaction with the Standard Model (SM). The dark sector then attained internal equilibrium with a characteristic temperature different from the SM photon temperature. We find that even if the coupling between the DM and the SM sectors is very weak, the scenario allows for indirect observational signals. We show how the expected strength of these signals depends on the temperature of the hidden sector at DM freeze-out.
