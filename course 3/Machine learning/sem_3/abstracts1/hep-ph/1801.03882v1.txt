We discuss the connection between the top quark, naturalness and flavor in composite Higgs models. The phenomenological features of the top quark and the associated fermionic partners are presented. The main realizations of the flavor structure, in particular the anarchic partial compositeness scenario and its possible modifications, are also briefly reviewed.
