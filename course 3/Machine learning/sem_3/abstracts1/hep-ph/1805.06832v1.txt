We address the anomalies in the semi leptonic decays of $B$ mesons in a warped custodial framework. Two possible solutions of lepton non-universality are discussed: A) The muon singlets couple non-universally to NP and B) The non-universality is in the coupling of lepton doublets. Both these scenarios are characterized by different predictions for rare Kaon decays. An essential feature of these scenarios is that the electron contribution to the Wilson coefficients (WC) is non-vanishing, thereby offering possibilities for different patterns of solutions. Beginning with a generic $Z'$ model, we demonstrate how the observation of the ratio $N_{\mu\mu}/N_{ee}$ can be mapped to a given pattern of WC which satisfy the anomalies.
