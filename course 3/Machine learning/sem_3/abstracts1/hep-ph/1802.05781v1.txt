The recent wide recognition of the existence of neutrino oscillations concludes the pioneer stage of these studies and poses the problem of how to communicate effectively the basic aspects of this branch of science. In fact, the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations has peculiar features and requires to master some specific idea and some amount of formalism. The main aim of these introductory notes is exactly to cover these aspects, in order to allow the interested students to appreciate the modern developments and possibly to begin to do research in neutrino oscillations.
