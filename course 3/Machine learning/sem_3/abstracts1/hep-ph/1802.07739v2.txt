Recently, a new minimal extension of the Standard Model has been proposed, where a spontaneously broken, flavor-dependent global U(1) symmetry is introduced. It not only explains the hierarchical flavor structure in the quark and lepton sector, but also solves the strong CP problem by identifying the Nambu-Goldstone boson as the QCD axion, which we call flaxion. In this work, we consider supersymmetric extensions of the flaxion scenario. We study the CP and flavor violations due to supersymmetric particles, the effects of R-parity violations, the cosmological gravitino and axino problems, and the cosmological evolution of the scalar partner of the flaxion, sflaxion. We also propose an attractor-like inflationary model where the flaxion multiplet contains the inflaton field, and show that a consistent cosmological scenario can be obtained, including inflation, leptogenesis, and dark matter.
