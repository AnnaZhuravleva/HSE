In order to induce a family of mixing patterns of leptons which accommodate the experimental data with a simple mathematical construct, we construct a novel object from the hybrid of two elements of a finite group with a parameter $\theta$. This construct is an element of a mathematical structure called group-algebra. It could reduce to a generator of a cyclic group if $\theta/2\pi$ is a rational number. We discuss a specific example on the base of the group $S_{4}$. This example shows that infinite cyclic groups could give the viable mixing patterns for Dirac neutrinos.
