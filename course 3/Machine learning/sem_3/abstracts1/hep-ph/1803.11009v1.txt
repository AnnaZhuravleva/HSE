We consider a class of models of neutrino mixing with $S_4$ flavour symmetry and generalised CP symmetry, broken to $Z_2$ and $Z_2 \times {\rm CP}$ residual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors, respectively. In this scheme, and up to discrete ambiguities, the neutrino mixing matrix is determined by two angles and one phase. We classify the phenomenologically viable mixing patterns, deriving predictions for the Dirac and Majorana CPV phases and for the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay.
