We computed the leading order Wilson coefficients relevant to all the exclusive $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ decays in the framework of Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry by including the $\mathcal{O}(m_b)$ corrections. We elucidate the issue of appropriate matching between the full and the effective theory when dealing with the (pseudo-)scalar operators for which keeping the external momenta different from zero is necessary. We then make a phenomenological analysis by using the measured $\mathcal{B}(B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B\to K \mu^+\mu^-)_{\mathrm{high}-q^2}$, for which the hadronic uncertainties are well controlled, and discussed their impact on various types of 2HDM. A brief discussion of the decays with $\tau$-leptons in the final state is also made.
