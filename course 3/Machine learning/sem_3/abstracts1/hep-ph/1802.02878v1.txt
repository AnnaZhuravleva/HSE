In this presentation the new physics implications of the $B$-meson decay anomalies, observed at LHCb, are discussed. In the first part of the talk a brief overview of the experimental status is presented. In the second part, a class of semi-local F-theory GUT models with additional neutral gauge bosons are proposed which are capable of accounting for the anomalous $B$-decay ratios $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$
