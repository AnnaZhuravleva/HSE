Electron energy and angular distributions in the process of low-energy elastic neutrino-electron scattering are treated in the free-electron approximation. The effects of the millicharges, magnetic, electric, and anapole moments of massive neutrinos along with the flavor change of neutrinos traveling from the source to the detector are taken into account under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The footprints of neutrino electromagnetic interactions in the electron energy and angle distributions are discussed.
