We exploit all LHC available Run 2 data at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. We scrutinize the allowed parameter space of Little Higgs models with the concrete symmetry of T-parity by providing comprehensive analyses of all relevant production channels of heavy vectors, top partners, heavy quarks and heavy leptons and all phenomenologically relevant decay channels. Constraints on the model will be derived from the signatures of jets and missing energy or leptons and missing energy. Besides the symmetric case, we also study the case of T-parity violation. Furthermore, we give an extrapolation to the LHC high-luminosity phase at 14 TeV as well.
