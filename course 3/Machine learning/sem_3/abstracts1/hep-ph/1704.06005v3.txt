We show that new physics models without new flavor violating interactions can explain the recent anomalies in the $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ transitions. The $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ arises from a $Z'$ penguin which automatically predicts the $V-A$ structure for the quark currents in the effective operators. This framework can be realized either in a renormalizable $U(1)'$ setup or be due to new strongly interacting dynamics. The di-muon resonance searches at the LHC are becoming sensitive to this scenario since the $Z'$ is relatively light, and could well be discovered in future searches by ATLAS and CMS.
