We explore the sparticle mass spectra including LSP dark matter within the framework of supersymmetric $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ (422) models, taking into account the constraints from extensive LHC and cold dark matter searches. The soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters at $M_{GUT}$ can be non-universal, but consistent with the 422 symmetry. We identify a variety of coannihilation scenarios compatible with LSP dark matter, and study the implications for future supersymmetry searches and the ongoing muon g-2 experiment.
