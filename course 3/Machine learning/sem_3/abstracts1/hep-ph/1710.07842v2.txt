We perform a status analysis of selective supersymmetric GUT models in light of recent constraints from collider and dark matter detection experiments. We find that a significant region of the parameter space of these models is still accessible to these experiments. Amongst the models we analyze, the split family model provides solutions that can explain the observed deviation in anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Furthermore, there is a notable region of the parameter space of each model which yields the desired relic abundance for neutralino dark matter. We also present the prediction of spin independent and spin dependent neutralino cross sections in these models and find that there is parameter space which can be probed at future experiments searching for dark matter. Our analysis serves as a motivation to continue the search for supersymmetry at various experimental fronts.
