We show that the Higgsplosion mechanism makes a prediction for the mass and coupling of a WIMP-like minimal scalar dark matter model. In particular the currently favoured minimal value for the Higgsplosion scale, $E_\mathrm{H}\sim 25$ TeV, implies a dark matter mass $m_\mathrm{DM} \sim 1.25$ TeV and a moderate quartic coupling with the Standard Model Higgs field $\lambda_\mathrm{H,DM} \sim 0.4$. This point in the parameter space is still allowed by all current experimental bounds, including direct detection (XENON), indirect detection (HESS, Fermi, Planck) and collider searches. We have updated the scalar dark matter bounds to reflect the latest results from XENON and HESS experiments. We also comment on vacuum stability and dark matter self-interactions in this model.
