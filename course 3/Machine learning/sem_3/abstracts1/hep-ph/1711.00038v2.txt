In this work we perform a study of the dark matter properties of supersymmetric models with an extra U(1)' gauge symmetry well motivated by string theory phenomenology. We calculate the dark matter relic density and dark matter-nucleon scattering cross sections useful for direct detection experiments in certain parameter regions which are in agreement with the well-known SM Higgs boson mass and current lower bounds of the mass of the new gauge boson Z' obtained from ATLAS. In these regions the correct dark matter relic abundance is mainly obtained due to Z' resonance enhancement where the dark matter mass is approximately half of the Z' mass. We analyze different scenarios of dark matter in useful U(1)' extensions of the MSSM and calculate the highest mass that the new gauge boson can have that still gives the correct dark matter relic density.
