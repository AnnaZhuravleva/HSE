The Standard Model problems lead to the new theories of extra dimensions: Randall-Sundrum model, Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali model and TeV$^{-1}$ model. In the framework of these models with the help of computer program Pythia8.2 were calculated the production cross sections for Kaluza-Klein particles at various energies at the LHC. The generation of monojet events from scalar graviton emission was considered for number of extra dimensions, n=2, 4, 6, for the energy at the LHC 14 TeV. Also are studied the graviton production processes through the gluon-gluon, quark-gluon and quark-quark fusion processes and found some periodicity in the behavior of the graviton mass spectrum. Within Randall-Sundrum scenario were calculated $\sigma\times$ Br for production process of massive graviton, gg $\rightarrow$ $G^{*}$, and the most probable processes of graviton decay at 13 TeV, 14 TeV and 100 TeV.
