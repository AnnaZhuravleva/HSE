We review the current status of neutrino oscillation experiments, mainly focussed on T2(H)K, NO$\nu$A and DUNE. Their capability to probe high energy physics is found in the precision measurement of the CP phase and $\theta_{23}$. In general, neutrino mass models predicts correlations among the mixing angles that can be used to scan and shrink down its parameter space. We updated previous analysis and presents a list of models that contain such structure.
