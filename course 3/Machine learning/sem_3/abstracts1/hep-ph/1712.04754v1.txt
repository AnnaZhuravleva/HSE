We present the Recola2 library for the efficient generation and computation of one-loop amplitudes in Beyond-Standard-Model theories. Recola2 is based on Recola, an efficient one-loop amplitude generator for the Standard Model, and Rept1l, a newly developed tool to generate one-loop model files for Recola2 in a fully automated way. Recola2 is able to operate with non-trivial extensions of the SM, e.g. extended Higgs sectors and effective field theories. We discuss first applications to extended Higgs sectors and their renormalization.
