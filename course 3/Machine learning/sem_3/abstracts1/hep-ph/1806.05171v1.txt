We extend the universal one-loop effective action (UOLEA) by operators which translate between dimensional reduction (DRED) and dimensional regularization (DREG). These regularization scheme translating operators allow for an application of the UOLEA to supersymmetric high-scale models matched to non-supersymmetric effective theories. The operators are presented in a generic, model independent form, suitable for implementation into generic spectrum generators.
