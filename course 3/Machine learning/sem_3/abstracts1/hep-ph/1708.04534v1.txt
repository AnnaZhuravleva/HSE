We perform an analysis of the simplified dark matter models in the light of cosmic ray observables by AMS-02 and Fermi-LAT. We assume fermion, scalar or vector dark matter particle with a leptophobic spin-0 mediator that couples only to Standard Model quarks and dark matter via scalar and/or pseudo-scalar bilinear. The propagation and injection parameters of cosmic rays are determined by the observed fluxes of nuclei from AMS-02. We find that the AMS-02 observations are consistent with the dark matter framework within the uncertainties. The AMS-02 antiproton data prefer 30 (50) GeV - 5 TeV dark matter mass and require an effective annihilation cross section in the region of 4x10^{-27} (7x10^{-27}) - 4x10^{-24} cm^3/s for the simplified fermion (scalar and vector) dark matter models. The cross sections below 2x10^{-26} cm^3/s can evade the constraint from Fermi-LAT dwarf galaxies for about 100 GeV dark matter mass.
