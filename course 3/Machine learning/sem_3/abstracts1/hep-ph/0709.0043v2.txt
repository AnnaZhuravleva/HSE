We compute the full O(alpha_s) SUSY-QCD corrections to dark matter annihilation in the Higgs-funnel, resumming potentially large mu tan beta and A_b contributions and keeping all finite O(m_b,s,1/tan^2 beta) terms. We demonstrate numerically that these corrections strongly influence the extraction of SUSY mass parameters from cosmological data and must therefore be included in common analysis tools such as DarkSUSY or micrOMEGAs.
