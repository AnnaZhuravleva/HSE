Radiative corrections to the cross sections of photon electroproduction and the single spin asymmetries induced by the interference between the Bethe Heitler and deep virtual Compton scattering amplitudes are calculated within the leading log approximation. The deep virtual Compton scattering amplitude is presented in the Belitsky, M\"uller, and Kirchner approximation for the polarized initial particles. The Fortran code for estimation of the radiative effects in a given kinematic point and Monte Carlo generator for simulation of one or two photons are developed. Numerical results are performed for beam-spin asymmetries in kinematical conditions of current experiments in the Jefferson Laboratory.
