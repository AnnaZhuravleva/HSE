Diphoton channel provides a clean signature in searches for new physics. In this paper, we discuss a connection between the diphoton channel ($\gamma\gamma$) and triboson channels ($Z\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma$, $WW\gamma$) imposed by the $SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}$ symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) in certain classes of models. To illustrate this idea we choose a simple model that has all these channels. In this model, the same physics can give rise to $\gamma+$MET instead of $\gamma\gamma$ and 2 bosons plus missing energy instead of 3-boson channels. We analyze existing constraints and previous searches and show that channels $WW\gamma$ and especially $Z\gamma+$MET have a potential to discover new physics at the LHC.
