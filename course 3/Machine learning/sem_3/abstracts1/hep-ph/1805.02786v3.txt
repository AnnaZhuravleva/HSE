Sphaleron and instanton solutions of the Standard Model provide violation of baryon and lepton numbers and could lead to spectacular events at the LHC or future colliders. Certain models of new physics can also lead to sphaleron-like vacuum transitions. This nonperturbative physics could be relevant to the generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. We have developed BaryoGEN, an event generator that facilitates the exploration of sphaleron-like transitions in proton-proton collisions with minimal assumptions. BaryoGEN outputs standard Les Houches Event files that can be processed by PYTHIA, and the code is publicly available. We also discuss various approaches to experimental searches for such transitions in proton-proton collisions.
