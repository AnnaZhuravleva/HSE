We calculate the gravitational radiation background generated from boson star binaries formed in locally dense clusters with formation rate tracked by the regular star formation rate. We compute how the the frequency window in gravitational waves is affected by the boson field mass and repulsive self-coupling, anticipating constraints from EPTA and LISA. We also comment on the possible detectability of these binaries.
