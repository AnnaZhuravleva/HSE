We investigate how the Fine-Tuning (FT) in the B-L Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM) compares to the Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), where both models have universality. This is done for two scales: both low (i.e. collider) and high (i.e. Grand Unified Theory (GUT)) scales. We see this is similar for both models and the two scale regimes. We also study the possible Dark Matter (DM) candidates each model offers in a realistic scenario satisfying relic density constraints. Our findings are that whilst the parameter space for the single MSSM DM candidate is severely constrained, the BLSSM offers multiple candidates in a much wider region.
