The thermalization of the particles produced in collisions of small size objects can be achieved by quantum entanglement of the partons of the initial state as it was analyzed recently in proton-proton collisions. We extend such study to Pb-Pb collisions and to different multiplicities of proton-proton collisions. We observe that, in all cases, the effective temperature is approximately proportional to the hard scale of the collision. We show that such relation between the thermalization temperature and the hard scale can be explained as a consequence of the clustering of the color sources. The fluctuations on the number of parton states decreases with multiplicity in Pb-Pb collisions as far as the width of the transverse momentum distributions decreases, contrary to the p-p case. We relate these fluctuations to the temperature time fluctuations by means of a Langevin equation for the white noise due to the quench of a hard parton collision.
