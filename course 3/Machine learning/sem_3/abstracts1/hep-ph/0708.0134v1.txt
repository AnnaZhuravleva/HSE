In these Lectures I review possible constraints on particle physics models, obtained by means of combining the results of collider measurements with astrophysical data. I emphasize the theoretical-model dependence of these results. I discuss supersymmetric dark matter constraints at colliders (mainly LHC) in various theoretical contexts: the standard Cosmological-Constant-Cold-Dark-Matter (Lambda-CDM) model, (super)string-inspired ones and non-equilibrium relaxation dark energy models. I then investigate the capability of LHC measurements in asserting whether supersymmetric matter (if discovered) constitutes part, or all, of the astrophysical dark matter. I also discuss prospects for improving the constraints in future precision facilities, such as the International Linear Collider.
