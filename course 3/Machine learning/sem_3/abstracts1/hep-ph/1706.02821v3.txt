In the framework of the littlest Higgs Model with T-parity, we discuss the top partner production at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. We calculate the cross sections of the top partner production processes and associated production processes of Higgs and top partner under current constraints. Then, we investigate the observability of the T-odd top partner pair production through the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow T_{-}\bar{T}_{-}\rightarrow t\bar{t}A_{H}A_{H}$ in the $t\bar{t}$ di-lepton channel for two T-odd top partner mass $m_{T_{-}}$=603(708) GeV at $\sqrt{s}$=1.5 TeV. We analyze the signal significance depending on the integrated luminosity and find this signal is promising at the future high energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider.
