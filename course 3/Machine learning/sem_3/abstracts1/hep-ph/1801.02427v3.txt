We incorporate recent calculations of one-loop corrections for the reduced Ioffe-time pseudo-distribution ${\mathfrak M} (\nu,z_3^2)$ to extend the leading-logarithm analysis of lattice data obtained by Orginos et al. We observe that the one-loop corrections contain a large term reflecting the fact that effective distances involved in the most important diagrams are much smaller than the nominal distance $z_3$. The large correction in this case may be absorbed into the evolution term, and the perturbative expansion used for extraction of parton densities at the $\mu \approx 2$ GeV scale is under control. The extracted parton distribution is rather close to global fits in the $x>0.1$ region, but deviates from them for $x<0.1$.
