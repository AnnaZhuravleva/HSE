We present a version of the twin Higgs mechanism with minimal symmetry structure and particle content. The model is built upon a composite Higgs theory with global $SO(6)/SO(5)$ symmetry breaking. The leading contribution to the Higgs potential, from the top sector, is solely cancelled via the introduction of a Standard Model neutral top partner. We show that the inherent $Z_2$ breaking of this construction is under control and of the right size to achieve electroweak symmetry breaking, with a fine-tuning at the level of $5-10\%$, and compatibly with the observed Higgs mass. We briefly discuss the particular phenomenological features of this scenario.
