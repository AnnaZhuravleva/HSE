We present several differential distributions for the associated production of charm and dijets. Both single-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton scattering (DPS) contributions are calculated in the $k_T$-factorization approach. We have found regions of the phase space where the SPS contribution is negligible compared to the DPS one. The distribution in transverse momentum of charmed mesons as well as azimuthal correlations ($D^0\mathrm{\textit{-jet}}$, $D^0 \overline{D^0}$) can be used for experimental identification of the DPS effects.
