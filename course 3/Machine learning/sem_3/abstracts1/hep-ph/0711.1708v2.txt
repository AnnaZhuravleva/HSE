I discuss the essential features of the QCD axion: the strong CP solution and hence its theoretical necessity. I also review the effects of the QCD axion on astrophysics and cosmology, in particular with emphasis on its role in the dark matter component together with its supersymmetric partner axino. It is pointed out that string theory may or may not give a detectable QCD axion.
