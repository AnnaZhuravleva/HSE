Recently several measurements induced by the quark level transition $b\rightarrow s \mu^+\mu^-$ show significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions. Different new physics operators which can explain all measurements in this sector, are identified previously. In order to discriminate between these new physics operators, we study the longitudinal polarization asymmetry of final state muons in $B^*_s\rightarrow \mu^+\,\mu^-$ decay. We find the muon longitudinal polarization asymmetry can be a good discriminant of new physics solution $C_9^{NP}<0$ where $C_9^{NP}$ is the Wilson coefficient corresponding to the operator $(\overline{s} \gamma^{\mu} P_L b)(\overline{\mu} \gamma_{\mu} \mu)$.
