We extend a previous investigation of the QCD phase diagram with heavy quarks in the context of background field methods by including the two-loop corrections to the background field effective potential. The nonperturbative dynamics in the pure-gauge sector is modeled by a phenomenological gluon mass term in the Landau-DeWitt gauge-fixed action, which results in an improved perturbative expansion. We investigate the phase diagram at nonzero temperature and (real or imaginary) chemical potential. Two-loop corrections yield an improved agreement with lattice data as compared to the leading-order results. We also compare with the results of nonperturbative approaches. We further study the equation of state as well as the thermodynamic stability of the system at two-loop order. Finally, we show, using simple thermodynamic arguments, that the behavior of the Polyakov loops as functions of the chemical potential complies with their interpretation in terms of quark and anti-quark free energies.
