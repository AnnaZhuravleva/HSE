The direct observation of the time reversal symmetry (T) violation (TV) is important for the test of CPT conservation and the Standard Model (SM). In this paper, we study time-dependent and time-independent TV signals in entangled $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ pairs. A possible CPT-violation (CPTV) effect called $\omega$-effect is also investigated. Within SM, the asymmetries due to TV in the $C=-1$ states are found to be of the order of $10^{-5}$. The modification on the asymmetries due to the $\omega$-effect in the $C=-1$ states is about $10\%$-$30\%$ when $|\omega|\sim 10^{-4}$. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation which is consistent with the estimated numerical results. The time-dependent asymmetries as TV signals are not easily observed in the $C=-1$ system, however, they may provide a window to detect New Physics (NP) such as the $\omega$-effect.
