Leptogenesis could have occurred at temperatures much lower than generally thought, if the cosmological history of the Universe underwent a period of accelerated expansion, as is predicted for example in a class of scalar-tensor theories of gravitation. We discuss how non-standard cosmologies can open new pathways for low scale leptogenesis. Within these scenarios, direct tests of leptogenesis could also provide information on the very early times Universe evolution, corresponding to temperatures larger than the TeV.
