In the last few years, the ratios $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ have reportedly exhibited significant deviations from the relevant Standard Model predictions, hinting towards a possible violation of Lepton Flavor Universality and a window to New Physics. We investigate to what extent the inclusion of R-parity violating couplings in the Minimal Supersymemtric Standard Model can provide a better fit to the anomalies simultaneously. We perform this analysis employing an approximate, non-abelian $\mathcal{G}_f=U(2)_q \times U(2)_\ell$ flavour symmetry, which features a natural explanation of the appropriate hierarchy of the R-parity violating couplings. We show that, under the requirement of a supersymmetric spectrum with much heavier left-handed doublet superpartners, our assumption favors a considerable enhancement in the tree-level charged-current $B \to D^{(*)} \tau \overline{\nu}$, while the the anomalies induced by $b \to s\ell^+\ell^-$ receive up to an approximate $30 \%$ improvement. The consistency with all relevant low-energy constraints is assessed.
