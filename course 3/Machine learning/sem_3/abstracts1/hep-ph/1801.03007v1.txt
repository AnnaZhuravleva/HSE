We have recently proposed a setup of the "Domain-Wall Standard Model" in a non-compact 5-dimensional space-time, where all the Standard Model (SM) fields are localized in certain domains of the 5th dimension. While the SM is realized as a 4-dimensional effective theory at low energies, the model involves Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the SM particles. In this paper we introduce two simple solvable examples which lead to domain-wall configurations for the SM particles and their KK-modes. Based on the examples, we address a variety of phenomenologies of the Domain-Wall SM, such as the KK-mode gauge boson phenomenology at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the effect of the KK-mode SM fermions on Higgs boson phenomenology, and the KK-mode fermion search at the LHC with its decay into a corresponding SM fermion and a Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with a spontaneous breaking of the translational invariance in the 5th dimension. We also propose a simple unified picture of localizing all the SM fields.
