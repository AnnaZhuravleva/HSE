The reported combined excess of about 4$\sigma$, by BABAR, Belle and LHCb, in the measurements of R($D^{(*)}$) and Br(B $\rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau}$) from that of the standard model expectation constitute the most significant discrepancy from the standard model in collider experiments thus far(apart from the non zero neutrino masses). Here we analyze the phenomenological implications for these decay modes in a Flipped/Lepton-Specific two-Higg-doublet model with anomalously enhanced charged Higgs coupling to $\tau$/b. We conclude that this extension of the standard model can give results in agreement within 1$\sigma$ of the experimental values for the combination of R($D^{(*)}$) and Br(B $\rightarrow \tau \nu_{\tau}$) data.
