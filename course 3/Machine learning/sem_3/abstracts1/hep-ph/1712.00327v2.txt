We have reviewed the renormalization procedure used in the unitarized coupled-channel model of Phys. Rev. D85 114032 (2012), and its impact in the $C=1$, $S=-2$, and $I=0$ sector, where five $\Omega_c^{(*)}$ states have been recently observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The meson-baryon interactions used in the model are consistent with both chiral and heavy-quark spin symmetries and lead to a successful description of the observed lowest-lying odd parity resonances $\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c(2625)$, and $\Lambda_b(5912)$ and $\Lambda_b(5920)$ resonances. We show that some (probably at least three) of the states observed by LHCb will also have odd parity and spins $J=1/2$ and $J=3/2$, belonging two of them to the same ${\rm SU(6)}_{\rm light-spin-flavor}\times$HQSS multiplets that the latter strangenessless heavy$-\Lambda$ baryons.
