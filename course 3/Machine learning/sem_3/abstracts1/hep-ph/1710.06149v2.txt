The Conformal Standard Model (CSM) is a minimal extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics based on the assumed absence of large intermediate scales between the TeV scale and the Planck scale, which incorporates only right-chiral neutrinos and a new complex scalar in addition to the usual SM degrees of freedom, but no other features such as supersymmetric partners. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of this model, and show that all outstanding issues of particle physics proper can in principle be solved `in one go' within this framework. This includes in particular the stabilization of the electroweak scale, `minimal' leptogenesis and the explanation of Dark Matter, with a small mass and very weakly interacting Majoron as the Dark Matter candidate (for which we propose to use the name `minoron'). The main testable prediction of the model is a new and almost sterile scalar boson that would manifest itself as a narrow resonance in the TeV region. We give a representative range of parameter values consistent with our assumptions and with observation.
