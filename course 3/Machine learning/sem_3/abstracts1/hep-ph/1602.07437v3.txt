A see-saw scenario for an $A_4$ flavour symmetric standard model is presented. The latter, compared with the standard model, has an extended field content adopting now an additional $A_4$ symmetry structure (along with the standard model symmetry). As before, the see-saw mechanism can be realized in several models of different types depending on different ways of neutrino mass generation corresponding to the introduction of new (heavy in general) fields with different symmetry structures. In the present paper, a general description of all these see-saw types is made with a more detailed investigation on type-I models, while for type-II and type-III models a similar strategy can be followed. As within the original see-saw mechanism, the symmetry structure of the standard model fields decides the number and the symmetry structure of the new fields. In a model considered here, the scalar sector consists of three standard-model-Higgs-like iso-doublets ($SU_L(2)$-doublets) forming together an $A_4$-triplet, and three iso-singlets transforming as three singlets (1,$1^{'}$ and $1^{''}$) of $A_4$. In the lepton sector, the three left-handed lepton iso-doublets form an $A_4$-triplet, while the three right-handed charged leptons are either $A_4$-singlets in one version of the model, or components of an $A_4$-triplet in another version. To generate neutrino masses through, say, the type-I see-saw mechanism, it is natural to add four right-handed neutrino multiplets, including one $A_4$-triplet and three $A_4$-singlets. For an interpretation, the model is applied to deriving some physics quantities such as neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass $|\langle m_{ee}\rangle|$, CP violation phase $\delta_{CP}$ and Jarlskog parameter $J_{CP}$, which can be verified experimentally.
