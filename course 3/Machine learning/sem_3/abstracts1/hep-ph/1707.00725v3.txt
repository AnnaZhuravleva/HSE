We use the framework of dark matter effective field theories to study the complementarity of bounds for a dark matter particle with mass in the MeV range. Taking properly into account the mixing between operators induced by the renormalization group running, we impose experimental constraints coming from the CMB, BBN, LHC, LEP, direct detection experiments and meson decays. In particular, we focus on the case of a vector coupling between the dark matter and the standard model fermions, and study to which extent future experiments can hope to probe regions of parameters space which are not already ruled out by current data.
