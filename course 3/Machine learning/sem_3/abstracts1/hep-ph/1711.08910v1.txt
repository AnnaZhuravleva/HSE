We review recent results on next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and electroweak (EW) corrections for processes involving off-shell top quarks. For the off-shell production of two top quarks that decay leptonically, the full NLO EW corrections have been computed. For the very same process in association with a Higgs boson, EW corrections have been calculated and combined with existing NLO QCD corrections. In both cases, selected differential distributions are shown. In these proceedings, particular emphasis is put on the effect of the EW corrections as well as the off-shell contributions.
