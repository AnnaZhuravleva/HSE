A geometric Glauber model applied to p-p or p-A collisions assumes that participant partons within a projectile nucleon independently follow eikonal trajectories, just as for projectile nucleons within target nuclei, and interact independently with any target nucleons encountered along their trajectory. A noneikonal quadratic relation for dijet production observed for p-p collisions suggests that such assumptions for p-N collisions may be incorrect. Data from p-A collisions supports that conclusion. For both isolated p-p collisions and for p-N interactions within p-A collisions a proton projectile interacts with only a single target nucleon within a brief time interval. Multiple overlapping p-N collisions are inhibited, suggesting the exclusivity of p-N interactions within p-A collisions.
