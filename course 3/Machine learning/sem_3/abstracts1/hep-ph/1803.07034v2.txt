In this note we analyse the structure of the baryonic state $|[qc]c\rangle$ with a spin-0 diquark $[qc]$, as compared to baryonic states $|(qc)c\rangle$ and $|q(cc)\rangle$ containing internal spin-1 diquark states. While one can identify the state $|q(cc)\rangle$ with the state observed at LHCb, the state $|(qc)c\rangle$ could probably be part of the state $\Xi_{cc}^{++}(3780)$. Accordingly, the ground state of $|[qc]c\rangle$ can be identified with the state $\Xi_{cc}^+(3520)$.
