In this work we apply relativistic mean-field theory in neutron stars assuming that fermionic dark matter is trapped inside the star and interacts directly with neutrons by exchanging Standard Model Higgs bosons. For realistic values of the parameters of the model we compute numerically the equation of state, and we compare it to the standard one. Furthermore, the mass-to-radius relation for both equations of state (pure neutron matter as well as admixed DM-neutron star) is shown, and the highest star mass for both cases is reported.
