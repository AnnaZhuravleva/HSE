Although Tevatron has discovered top quark and LHC (pp collisions) has discovered Higgs boson but the RHIC and LHC heavy-ion colliders have not discovered thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This is because the experimental data of top quark at Tevatron and the experimental data of Higgs boson at LHC are compared with the exact first principle calculation but the experimental data at RHIC and LHC are compared with simplistic models and assumptions which are not exact first principle calculation. In this paper we show that the exact first principle method to study quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC is the nonequilibrium-nonperturbative QCD by using closed-time path integral formalism. Hence in the absence of such exact first principle calculation we conclude that there is no proof of thermalized quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC.
