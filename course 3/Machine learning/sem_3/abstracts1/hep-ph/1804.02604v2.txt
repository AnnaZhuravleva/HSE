We review predictions and constraints for nuclear recoil signals from Higgs portal dark matter under the assumption of standard thermal creation from freeze-out. Thermally created scalar and vector Higgs portal dark matter masses are constrained to be in the resonance region near half the Higgs mass or above several TeV. The resonance region for these models will be tested by XENONnT and LZ. The full mass range up to the unitarity limit can be tested by DarkSide-20k and DARWIN. Fermionic Higgs portal dark matter with a pure CP odd coupling is constrained by the Higgs decay width, but has strongly suppressed recoil cross sections which cannot be tested with upcoming experiments. Fermionic Higgs portal dark matter with a combination of CP even and odd Higgs couplings can be constrained by the direct search experiments.
