Results of an updated global electoweak fit to the Standard Model (SM) are presented, where special attention is paid to some key observables, such as the weak mixing angle, the $W$ boson mass, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Implications for new physics beyond the SM are also discussed.
