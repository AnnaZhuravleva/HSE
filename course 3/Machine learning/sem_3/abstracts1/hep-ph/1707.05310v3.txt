The Bogoliubov transformation is an important idea in modern physics. It was developed for finding solutions of BCS theory and is also used to explain the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation and many other topics. In this paper, we study CP violation and generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry during preheating, when particles are generated due to the Bogoliubov transformation. We also discuss a new baryogenesis scenario, in which the asymmetry is generated without introducing loop corrections.
