The most recent determination of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ seems to point to a $\sim 2.4 \,\sigma$ negative deviation in the measured electron anomalous magnetic moment $g_e-2$. The corresponding experimental value for the muon, $g_\mu - 2$, has long had a $\sim 3.7 \,\sigma$ deviation, in the positive direction. In this short letter, we point out that one real scalar, with a mass of $\sim 250-1000$ MeV, could explain the deviations in $g_\mu-2$ and $g_e-2$, through one- and two-loop processes, respectively. We briefly discuss potential implications of this simple scenario for low and high energy phenomena.
