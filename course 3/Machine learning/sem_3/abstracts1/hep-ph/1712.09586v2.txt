The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) experiment has recently announced the first results for the measurement of total electron plus positron fluxes between 25 GeV and 4.6 TeV. A spectral break at about 0.9 TeV and a tentative peak excess around 1.4 TeV have been found. However, it is very difficult to reproduce both the peak signal and the smooth background including spectral break simultaneously. We point out that the numbers of events in the two energy ranges (bins) close to the 1.4 TeV excess have $1\sigma$ deficits. With the basic physics principles such as simplicity and naturalness, we consider the $-2\sigma$, $+2\sigma$, and $-1\sigma$ deviations due to statistical fluctuations for the 1229.3 GeV bin, 1411.4 GeV bin, and 1620.5 GeV bin. Interestingly, we show that all the DAMPE data can be explained consistently via both the continuous distributed pulsar and dark matter interpretations, which have $\chi^{2} \simeq 17.2 $ and $\chi^{2} \simeq 13.9$, respectively. These results are different from the previous analyses by neglecting the 1.4 TeV excess. Moreover, we present a $U(1)_D$ dark matter model with Breit-Wigner mechanism, which can provide the proper dark matter annihilation cross section and escape the CMB constraint. Furthermore, we suggest a few ways to test our proposal.
