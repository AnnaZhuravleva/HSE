We analyze in details the effects associated with mixing of bosonic fields in gauge theories. A simple proof of factorizability of residues of non-diagonal propagators at the complex poles is given, together with a prescription for finding the "square-rooted" residues to all orders of perturbation theory, in an arbitrary renormalization scheme consistent with the Slavnov-Taylor identities of the gauge symmetry. Usefulness of these generic results is illustrated with the explicit one-loop calculations in the Standard Model ($Z$-photon mixing) and its singlet Majoron extension ($G_Z$-Majoron mixing).
