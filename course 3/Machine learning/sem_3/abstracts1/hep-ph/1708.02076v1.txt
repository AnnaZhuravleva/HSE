We investigate the relative importance of initial and final state effects on azimuthal correlations of gluons in low and high multiplicity p+Pb collisions. To achieve this, we couple Yang-Mills dynamics of pre-equilibrium gluon fields (IP-GLASMA) to a perturbative QCD based parton cascade for the final state evolution (BAMPS) on an event-by-event basis. We find that signatures of both the initial state correlations and final state interactions are seen in azimuthal correlation observables, such as $v_2\left\lbrace2PC\right\rbrace(p_T)$, their strength depending on the event multiplicity and transverse momentum. Initial state correlations dominate $v_2\left\lbrace2PC\right\rbrace(p_T)$ in low multiplicity events for transverse momenta $p_T>2~{\rm GeV}$. While final state interactions are dominant in high multiplicity events, initial state correlations affect $v_2\left\lbrace2PC\right\rbrace(p_T)$ for $p_T>2~{\rm GeV}$ as well as the pT integrated $v_2\left\lbrace2PC\right\rbrace$.
