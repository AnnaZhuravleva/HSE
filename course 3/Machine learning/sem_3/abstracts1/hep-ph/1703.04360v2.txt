We define a Focus Point (FP) Asymmetry, $A_{\rm FP}$, obtained by integrating the normalised transverse momentum distribution of either lepton produced in the Drell-Yan (DY) process below and above a point where a variety of popular $Z^\prime$ models all have the same magnitude. For a given $Z^\prime$ mass the position of this FP is predictable, depending only on the collider energy and on the low transverse momentum cut chosen in the normalisation procedure. The resulting $A_{\rm FP}$ is very sensitive to the $Z^\prime$ width, and can be used to constrain this parameter in experimental fits.
