There are currently many experimental searches underway that try to detect QCD axions and axion-like particles. These, in addition to other constraints from astrophysics and cosmology, require a consistent and statistically rigorous analysis of the large landscape of axion models. Here, we present the rationale, methodology and preliminary results for global fits of axion models using the recently developed software framework GAMBIT.
