The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has provided, and will continue to provide, data for collisions at the highest energies ever seen in a particle accelerator. A strong knowledge of the properties of amplitudes for Quantum Chromodynamics in the High Energy Limit is therefore important to interpret this data. We study this limit in the context of the High Energy Jets (HEJ) formalism. This formalism resums terms in the perturbative expansion of the cross-section that behave like $\alpha_s^n \log \left(\frac{s}{-t}\right)^{n-1}$, which are enhanced in this limit. Understanding this region is particularly important in certain key analyses at the LHC: for example, Higgs-boson-plus-dijet analyses where cuts are applied to pick out events with a large $m_{jj}$ and in many searches for new physics.
