This paper is designed to calculate the branching ratio of four-body decays of $B$ meson with lepton number changed by 2. With the new experimental data limit to lepton-number violation processes, we update the upper limits of mixing parameters between heavy Majorana neutrino and charged leptons. Afterwards, we calculate the branching ratio of $B^0(P)\rightarrow D^{*-}(P_1)\ell^+_1(P_2)\ell^+_2(P_3)M_2^-(P_4)$ using the updated parameters. It is found that the most hopeful decay channel is $B^0(P)\rightarrow D^{*-}(P_1)e^+_1(P_2)e^+_2(P_3)\rho^-(P_4)$ or $B^0(P)\rightarrow D^{*-}(P_1)e(\mu)^+_1(P_2)\mu(e)^+_2(P_3)\rho^-(P_4)$, whose branching ratio can reach about $10^{-4}$ with heavy Majorana neutrino mass range around $2~\mathrm{GeV}$.
