I provide updates for the theoretical predictions of the muon and electron anomalous magnetic moments, for the shift in the fine structure constant $\alpha(M_Z)$ and for the weak mixing parameter $\sin^2 \Theta_W(M_Z)$. Phenomenological results for Euclidean time correlators, the key objects in the lattice QCD approach to hadronic vacuum polarization, are briefly considered. Furthermore, I present a list of isospin breaking and electromagnetic corrections for the lepton moments, which may be used to supplement lattice QCD results obtained in the isospin limit and without the e.m. corrections.
