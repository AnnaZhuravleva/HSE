An analytic solution of the N-dimensional radial Schr\"odinger equation with the mixture of vector and scalar potentials via the Laplace transformation method (LTM) is studied. The present potential is extended to include the spin hyperfine, spin-orbit and tensor interactions. The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions have been determined in the N-dimensional space. The present results are employed to study the different properties of the heavy-light mesons. The masses of the scalar, vector, pseudoscalar and pseudovector of B, Bs, D and Ds mesons have been calculated in the three dimensional space. The effect of the dimensional number space is studied on the masses of the heavy-light mesons. We find that the meson mass increases with increasing dimensional space. The decay constants of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons have been computed. In addition, the leptonic decay widths and branching ratio for the B+, D+ and Ds+ mesons have been studied. Therefore, the present method with the present potential gives good results which are in good agreement with experimental data and are improved in comparison with recently theoretical works.
