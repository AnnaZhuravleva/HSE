Xe+Xe collision at relativistic energies may provide us with a partonic system whose size is approximately in between those produced by p+p and Pb+Pb collisions. The experimental results on anisotropic flow in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions should provide us with an opportunity to study system size dependence of $v_2$. In the present work, we have used AMPT transport model to calculate charged particles' $v_2$ for Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.44 TeV. We have also tried to demonstrate the no. of constituent quark, $N_q$, and $m_T$ scaling of the elliptic flow. We find that $n_q$ scaling of $v_2$ is not observed for the identified hadrons. The $v_2$ results from Xe+Xe collisions have also been compared to Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. We find that flow of charged particles in (50-60)\% central collisions for Xenon nuclei is almost 30\% less than particle flow developed in lead ion collisions, implying the important role the system size play in development of particle collective motion in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
