The strong constraints on the R-parity conserving supersymmetry (SUSY) from the LHC searches motivate us to consider the new models in which the low-scale SUSY is still allowed. We propose a kind of R-parity violating SUSY scenarios with a non-zero $U^c_2 D^c_2 D^c_3$ operator. Three relevant LHC searches are recasted to test the status of this scenario in terms of four simplified models, with either light stop-Bino, stop-Higgsino, sbottom-Bino or sbottom-Higgsino. Some difficult scenarios for the LHC SUSY searches in these simplified models are identified. By extrapolate the current LHC searches to the future 14 TeV LHC with integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, most of the difficult scenarios can be probed, except the sbottom-Bino simplified one. An improved search, which utilises the multiple b-jets as well as its kinematic features, is expected to probe the signature of this case.
