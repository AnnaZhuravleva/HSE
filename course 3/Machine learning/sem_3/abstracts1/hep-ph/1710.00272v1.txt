The Standard Model is by far the most encompassing physics theory. With the recent discovery of the Higgs Boson, the Standard Model has performed extremely well against experimental data. However, the theory is intrinsically not complete, it does not address physical phenomenon such as gravity and dark matter. Many proposals for physics beyond the Standard Model predict new massive bosons from additional gauge fields or extended Higgs sectors. This paper examines a preliminary search of possible V gamma decay channels of proposed new bosons.
