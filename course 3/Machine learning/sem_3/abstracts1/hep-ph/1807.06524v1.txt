We investigate the results of the charged kaon multiplicities off the deuteron target from HERMES and COMPASS experiments. The discrepancy of the two data sets cannot be explained by different $Q^2$ values. Furthermore we examine the empirical parametrization of the fragmentation functions, DSS2017, and find that the agreement between the theoretical predictions and the HERMES data is less satisfactory as claimed.
