We present a determination of the mass, width and coupling of the strange resonances appearing in pion-kaon scattering below 1.8 GeV, namely the much debated $K^*_0(800)$ or $\kappa$, the scalar $K^*_0(1430)$, the $K^*(892)$ and $K^*(1410)$ vectors, the spin-two $K^*_2(1430)$ as well as the spin-three $K^*_3(1780)$. The parameters of each resonance are determined using a direct analytic continuation of the pion-kaon partial waves by means of Pad\'e approximants, thus avoiding any particular model description of their pole positions and residues, while taking into account the analytic requirements imposed by dispersion relations.
