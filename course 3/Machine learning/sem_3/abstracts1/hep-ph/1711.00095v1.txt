We discuss single-diffractive production of dijets. The cross section is calculated for the first time in the $k_t$-factorization approach, neglecting transverse momentum of the pomeron. We use Kimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated parton (gluon, quark, antiquark) distributions (UPDF) both in the proton as well as in the pomeron or subleading reggeon. The UPDFs are calculated based on conventional MMHT2014nlo PDFs in the proton and H1 collaboration diffractive PDFs used previously in the analysis of diffractive structure function and dijets at HERA. We try to describe the existing data from Tevatron and make detailed predictions for possible LHC measurements.
