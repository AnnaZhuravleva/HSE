Mass pattern of the SM fermions is one of the most important mysterious in particle physics. Flavor Democracy could shed light on this mystery. Addition of isosinglet quark and isosinglet lepton give opportunity to obtain masses of charged leptons and quarks of the 2nd and 3rd family due to small deviations of full Flavor Democracy.
