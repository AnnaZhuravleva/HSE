Photoproduction of vector mesons are computed in dipole model in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions(UPCs) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The dipole model framework is employed in the calculations of vector mesons production in diffractive processes. Parameters of the bCGC model are refitted with the latest inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data. Employing the bCGC model and Boosted Gaussian light-cone wave function for vector mesons, we obtain prediction of rapidity distributions of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2s)$ mesons in proton-proton ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC. The predictions give a good description to the experimental data of LHCb. Predictions of $\phi$ and $\omega$ mesons are also evaluated in this paper.
