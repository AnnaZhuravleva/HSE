We introduce fully SGUTs, SUSY grand unified theories that, upon symmetry breaking through the Higgs mechanism, decompose into a visible sector and an extra sector where the dynamics of the extra sector gauge group is responsible for SUSY breaking. Fully SGUTs thus have the important feature that all gauge groups of the visible sector and the extra sector unify into a simple gauge group at the SGUT scale, therefore generalizing the successful MSSM gauge coupling unification to all the gauge couplings of the theory. By focusing on the ISS SUSY-breaking mechanism in the extra sector, we show that it is impossible to reproduce the MSSM matter content when there exists a metastable ISS SUSY-breaking state.
