We discuss the high energy scattering of hadrons with the multi - Regge kinematics. The effective $2D$ model for the interaction between the produced hard gluons appears as a result of the dimensional reduction, which is similar to the dimensional reduction $3+1$ D $\to 3$ D of the high temperature gauge theory. It is demonstrated that being supplemented by the exchange by virtual $3+1$ D gluons this $2D$ model gives rise to the hermitian version of the effective action of Lipatov for the interaction between the ordinary and the reggeized gluons.
