In this paper, we propose and study a model, in which there exists only one basic neutrino. Basically, the Lagrangian of the model is obtained from the Lagrangian in the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam electroweak theory by reducing the three flavor neutrinos there to one basic neutrino. In this model, neutrino states with a fixed flavor are interpreted as certain superpositions of states of the basic neutrino and states of the related charged lepton. Neutrino mass states are associated with low-lying eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian. We derive an approximate expression for a ratio of neutrino-mass differences, which gives a value $17$ for the ratio, about half of the experimental result of $33$.
