We analyze recent $K^+$ meson photoproduction data from the CLAS collaboration for the reactions $\gamma p\rightarrow K^+\Lambda$ and $\gamma p\rightarrow K^+\Sigma_0$, fitting measured forward-angle differential cross sections to the form $Ae^{Bt}$. We develop a quantitative scheme for determining the kinematic region where the fit is to be done, and, from the extracted $t$-slope $B$, determine whether single-Reggeon exchange can explain the production mechanism. We find that, in the region $5 < s < 8.1$ GeV$^2$, production of the $K^+\Lambda$ channel can be explained by single $K^+$ Reggeon exchange, but the $K^+\Sigma_0$ production channel cannot. We verify these conclusions by fitting the data to a differential cross section produced by the interfering sum of two exponential amplitudes.
