This article summarizes a brief development of exotic mesons with Vector-Vector (VV) final states starting from the $J/\psi\phi$ mass spectrum, as well as extensions to other final states for strong-interaction physics and physics beyond standard model. These VV final states are very suitable to be studied at CEPC through associate production and two-photon production, as well as a visionary low energy photon collider.
