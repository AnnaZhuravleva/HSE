In the context of the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet quenching, we perform a global fit to hadron and jet data in the most central bins both at RHIC and LHC. The qualitative and quantitative success of the analysis is attributed to the fact that the model correctly captures the fact that wider jets lose, on average, more energy than the narrower ones, to which high energy hadrons belong. We show how one can understand the relative jet and hadron suppression by analyzing the jet fragmentation functions, and also discuss the role of plasma finite resolution effects.
