We evaluate the transport properties such as shear viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and their ratios over entropy density ($s$) for hadronic matter using relativistic non-extensive Boltzmann transport equation (NBTE) in relaxation time approximation (RTA). In NBTE, we argue that the system far from equilibrium may not reach to an equilibrium described by extensive (Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG)) statistics but to a $q$-equilibrium defined by Tsallis non-extensive statistics after subsequent evolution, where $q$ denotes the degree of non-extensivity. We observe that $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ initially decrease rapidly with the temperature ($T$) for various $q$-values while they become independent of $q$ at higher $T$. As $q$ increases, the magnitudes of $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ increase in the lower temperature region. We also show the upper mass cutoff dependence of these ratios for a particular $q$ and find that they decrease with the increase in mass cutoff of hadrons. Further, we present the first estimation of isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_T$) using non-extensive Tsallis statistics at finite baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$). It is observed that, $\kappa_T$ changes significantly with the degree of non-extensivity. We also study the squared speed of sound ($c_{s}^{2}$) as a function of temperature at finite baryon chemical potential for various $q$ and upper mass cutoff. It is noticed that there is a strong impact of $q$ and mass cutoff on the behaviour of $c_{s}^{2}$.
