Single top quark production through weak interactions is considered to be an important source of charged Higgs in the Minimal Super Symmetric Standard Model. In the s-channel single top production having largest cross-section may appear as a propagator in the form of heavy resonance state decaying to a pair of top and bottom quark. The process under investigation is $pp \rightarrow H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb \rightarrow b\bar{b}W^{\pm} \rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^{\pm} \nu_{\tau}$, where top quark exclusively decays into a pair of bottom quark and W boson while W boson subsequently decays to $\tau$ jet and neutrino. So the final state is characterized by the presence of two b jets, hadronic $\tau$ decay and missing transverse energy. Within the presence of QCD multijet and electroweak background events at LHC, it has been demonstrated that the charged Higgs signal observability is possible within the available MSSM parameter space (tan$\beta$, $m_{H^{\pm}})$ respecting all experimental and theoretical constraints. In order to show the observability potential of charged Higgs, the exclusion curves at 95$\%$ confidence level and 5$\sigma$ contours are plotted at different integrated luminosities with $\sqrt{s}=$14 TeV.
