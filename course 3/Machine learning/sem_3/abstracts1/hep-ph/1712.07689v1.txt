Developing a theory that can describe everything in the universe is of great interest, and is closely relevant to M-theory, neutrino oscillation and charge-parity (CP) violation. Although M-theory is claimed as a grand unified theory, it has not been tested by any direct experiment. Here we show that existing neutrino oscillation experimental data supports one kind of high dimensional unified theory, such as M-theory. We propose a generalization of the tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing ansatz, and we find that the latest neutrino oscillation experimental data constraints dimension in a range between 10.46 and 12.93 containing 11, which is an important prediction of M-theory. This ansatz naturally incorporates the fractal feature of the universe and leptonic CP violation into the resultant scenario of \textit{fractal} nearly tri-bimaximal flavor mixing. We also analyze the consequences of this new ansatze on the latest experimental data of neutrino oscillations, and this theory matches the experimental data. Furthermore, an approach to construct lepton mass matrices in fractal universe under permutation symmetry is discussed. The proposed theory opens an unexpected window on the physics beyond the Standard Model.
