We discuss inverse magnetic catalysis effect on conserved charge fluctuations and correlations along the chemical freezeout curve in hadron resonance gas model. We have compared fluctuations and correlations with and without charge conservation. Charge conservation plays an important role in the calculation of fluctuations at nonzero magnetic field and for fluctuations in strange charge at zero magnetic field. Charge conservation diminishes the correlation $\chi_{BS}$ and $\chi_{QB}$,but enhances the correlation $\chi_{QS}$.We point out that baryonic fluctuations (2nd order) at B=0.25 ${GeV}^2$ increases more than two times compared to B=0 at higher $\mu_{B}$. We have compared the fluctuations along the freezeout curve without IMC effect and the results are very different with IMC effect. This is clearly seen in the products of different moments ${{\sigma}^2}/{M}$ and $S\sigma$ of net-kaon distribution.
