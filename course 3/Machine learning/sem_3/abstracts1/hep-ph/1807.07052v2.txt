Recent results on the Higgs plus jet production is reviewed. We have computed the two-loop amplitudes for $ gg \to Hg $, $ q\bar{q} \to Hg $ and $ qg \to Hq $ at the large Higgs transverse momentum. It was long-missing part of NLO corrections to the Higgs plus jet production above the top mass threshold. This results are combined with the real corrections to produce the Higgs boson transverse momentum distribution at NLO.
