We present a study of transverse single-spin asymmetries (SSAs) in $p^\uparrow p\to J/\psi\,X$ and $p^\uparrow p\to D X$ within the framework of the generalized parton model (GPM), which includes both spin and transverse momentum effects, and show how they can provide useful information on the still almost unknown gluon Sivers function. Moreover, by adopting a modified version of this model, named color gauge invariant (CGI) GPM, we analyze the impact of the initial- and final-state interactions on our predictions. As a consequence, we find that these two processes are sensitive to different gluon Sivers functions, which can be expressed as linear combinations of two distinct, universal gluon distributions. We therefore define proper observables which could allow for a separate extraction of these two independent Sivers functions. At the same time, we show how it would be possible to discriminate between the GPM and the CGI-GPM approaches by comparing the corresponding estimates of SSAs with present and future experimental results at RHIC.
