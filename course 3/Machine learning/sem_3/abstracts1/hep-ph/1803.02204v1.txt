We present the update of the SModelS database with the simplified model results from CMS searches for supersymmetry at Run 2 with 36 fb$^{-1}$ of data. The constraining power of these new results is compared to that of the 8 TeV results within the context of a full model, the pMSSM. The new database, v1.1.2, is publicly available and can readily be employed for physics studies with SModelS.
