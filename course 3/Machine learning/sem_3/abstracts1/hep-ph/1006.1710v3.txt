We argue that because the source-detector distance of 1.8 microseconds (in natural units) for the MiniBooNE is comparable to the muon lifetime of 2.2 microseconds, and because time dilation effects are wiped out in the beam stop, the Goldman entanglement of the neutrinos leads to hitherto unsuspected interpretational consequences. We show that a distinct possibility exists in which a LSND-like experiment sees no CP violation, whereas a MiniBooNE-like setup reproduces the LSND results for the $\bar\nu_\mu$ to $\bar\nu_e$ oscillations while seeing only a significantly suppressed signal for the $\nu_\mu$ to $\nu_e$ oscillations. We also discuss an alternate scenario. This also suggests that the LSND experiment and the MiniBooNE should not be compared without taking into account the Goldman entanglement.
