Many facets of nonclassicality are probed in neutrino system in the context of three flavour neutrino oscillations. The analysis is carried out for parameters relevant to two ongoing experiments NO$\nu$A and T2K, and also for the upcoming experiment DUNE. The various quantum correlations turn out to be sensitive to the mass-hierarchy problem in neutrinos. This sensitivity is found to be more prominent in DUNE experiment as compared to NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments. This can be attributed to the large baseline and high energy of the DUNE experiment. Further, we find that to probe these correlations, the neutrino (antineutrino) beam should be preferred if the sign of mass square difference $\Delta_{31}$ turns out to be positive (negative).
