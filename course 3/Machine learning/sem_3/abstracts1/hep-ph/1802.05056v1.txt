Reliable analysis of the Electroweak phase transition (EWPT) requires use of non-perturbative methods. We apply the method of finite-temperature dimensional reduction to the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). This allows us to study the EWPT in this model, in terms of a non-perturbative study of three-dimensional effective theories. We present a detailed derivation of the mapping between the full four-dimensional and the effective three-dimensional theories. In particular, we study the case where the second scalar doublet is so heavy in the vicinity of the phase transition that it can be integrated out. The resulting effective three-dimensional theory is the same as in the case of the Standard Model, and existing non-perturbative results can be recycled. In the alignment limit of the 2HDM, results of our study are presented in the companion paper.
