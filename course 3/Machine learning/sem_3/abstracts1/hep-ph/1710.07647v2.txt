We obtain the renormalization group improved expressions of the Wilson coefficients of the HQET Lagrangian with leading logarithmic approximation to ${\cal O}(1/m^3)$ for the spin-independent sector, which includes the heavy quark chromo-polarizabilites. Our analysis includes the effects induced by spectator quarks. We observe that the numerical impact of these logarithms is very large in most cases.
