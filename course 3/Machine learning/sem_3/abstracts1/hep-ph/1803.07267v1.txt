In QCD matter under an external magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect (CME) leads to the collective gapless mode called the chiral magnetic wave (CMW). Since dynamic universality class generally depends on low-energy gapless modes, it is a priori nontrivial whether the CME and the resulting CMW affect the dynamic critical phenomena of the second-order chiral phase transition in QCD. To address this question, we study the critical dynamics near the chiral phase transition in massless two-flavor QCD under an external magnetic field. By performing the dynamic renormalization-group analysis within the {\epsilon} expansion, we show that the dynamic universality class remains unchanged even in the presence of the CME. On the other hand, we find that a new dynamic critical phenomenon appears: the speed of the CMW tends to zero when the second-order chiral phase transition is approached. We also show that the transport coefficient of the CME is not renormalized by the critical fluctuations of the order parameter.
