The standard model does not provide an explanation of the observed alignment of quark flavors i.e. why are the up and down quarks approximately aligned in their weak interactions according to their masses? We suggest a resolution of this puzzle using a combination of left-right and Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. The quark mixings in this model vanish at the tree level and arise out of one loop radiative corrections which explains their smallness. The lepton mixings on the other hand appear at the tree level and are therefore larger. We show that all fermion masses and mixings can be fitted with a reasonable choice of parameters. The neutrino mass fit using seesaw mechanism requires the right handed $W_R$ mass bigger than 18 TeV. Due to the presence of PQ symmetry, this model clearly provides a solution to the strong CP problem.
