Light radions constitute one of the few surviving possibilities for observable new particle states at the sub-TeV level which arise in models with extra spacetime dimensions. It is already known that the 125 GeV state discovered at CERN is unlikely to be a pure radion state, since its decays resemble those of the Standard Model Higgs boson too closely. However, due to experimental errors in the measured decay widths, the possibility still remains that it could be a mixture of the radion with one (or more) Higgs states. We use the existing LHC data at 8 and 13 TeV to make a thorough investigation of this possibility. Not surprisingly, it turns out that this model is already constrained quite effectively by direct LHC searches for an additional scalar heavier than 125 GeV. We then make a detailed study of the so-called 'conformal point', where this heavy state practically decouples from (most of) the Standard Model fields. Some projections for the future are also included.
