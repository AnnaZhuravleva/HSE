We present a new method for renormalisation group improvement of the effective potential of a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of scalar fields. The method amounts to solving the renormalisation group equation for the effective potential with the boundary conditions chosen on the hypersurface where quantum corrections vanish. This hypersurface is defined through a suitable choice of a field-dependent value for the renormalisation scale. The method can be applied to any order in perturbation theory and it is a generalisation of the standard procedure valid for the one-field case. In our method, however, the choice of the renormalisation scale does not eliminate individual logarithmic terms but rather the entire loop corrections to the effective potential. It allows us to evaluate the improved effective potential for arbitrary values of the scalar fields using the tree-level potential with running coupling constants as long as they remain perturbative. This opens the possibility of studying various applications which require an analysis of multi-field effective potentials across different energy scales. In particular, the issue of stability of the scalar potential can be easily studied beyond tree level.
