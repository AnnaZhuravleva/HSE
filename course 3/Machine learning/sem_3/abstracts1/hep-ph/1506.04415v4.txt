We provide results for the open-flavor strong decays of open-charm ($D$ and $D_{\rm s}$) and open-bottom ($B$, $B_{\rm s}$ and $B_{\rm c}$) mesons. The decays are calculated in a modified version of the $^3P_0$ pair-creation model, assuming harmonic oscillator wave functions. The spectra of open-charm and open-bottom mesons used in the calculations are computed within Godfrey and Isgur's relativized quark model. Quantum number assignments are also provided. Our results are compared with the existing experimental data.
