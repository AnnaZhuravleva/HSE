Very recently Belle Collaboration reported observation of a narrow state called $\Omega(2012)$ with mass $2012.4 \pm 0.7$~(stat)~$\pm 0.6$(syst)~MeV and width $6.4^{+2.5}_{-2.0}$~(stat)~$\pm 1.6$~(syst)~MeV. We calculate the mass and residue of $\Omega(2012)$ state by employing the QCD sum rule method. Comparison of the obtained results with the experimental data allows us to interpret this state as $1P$ orbital excitation of the ground state $\Omega$ baryon, i.e. with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$.
