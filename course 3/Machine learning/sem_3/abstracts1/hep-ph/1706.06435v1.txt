Using the latest experimental data, performed by ATLAS Collaboration and within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, we presented the calculations for cross sections times branching fractions, $\sigma\times Br$, as a functions of the CP-even, H, Higgs boson mass, CP-odd, A, Higgs boson mass and charged, H$^{\pm}$, Higgs boson mass. Using the restricted parameter set, received from the hMSSM+HDECAY and "low-tb-high" scenarios, with the help of the computer programs SOFTSUSY, Prospino and SusHi, we received the large values of $\sigma\times Br$ for A and H bosons at tan$\beta$=2 for the planned 14 TeV at the LHC and found the large $\sigma\times Br$ at tan$\beta$=30 for charged Higgs boson. The obtained results are of experimental interest as they are connected with the experimental searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC.
