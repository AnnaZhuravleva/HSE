The high-multiplicity events of pPb collisions at $\sqrt s_{NN}$ = 5.02 TeV at the LHC exhibit unforeseen collective behaviour. One of the possible explanations to the collectivity could be the formation of thermalized partonic matter, like the one formed in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions and is described by the hydrodynamic models. This article presents a study on the centrality dependent long-range 2 < $|\Delta\eta|$ < 4 two-particle azimuthal correlations of D-mesons and charged particles in pPb collisions at $\sqrt s_{NN}$ = 5.02 TeV. The study has been conducted on the events, generated with the EPOS3 hydrodynamic code that reproduces most of the features of the pPb data at the LHC energy. There appears a ridge-like structure in the long-range two-particle angular correlations of D-mesons, in the intermediate pT -range, and charged particles in the simulated high-multiplicity pPb events.
