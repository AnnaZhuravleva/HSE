This paper presents an explanation for the hollowness effect of the inelastic overlap function claiming that result is a consequence of fundamental thermodynamic processes. The use of Tsallis entropy allows the identification of energy in the center-of-mass system with the entropic index $w$. Moreover, the probabilities involved in the description of the Tsallis entropy are replaced by the inelastic overlap function, which represents the probability of an event in a given energy and impact parameter. The obtained entropy formula can be directly connected to the unitarity, imposing restrictions on the shape of the function. The Coulomb and confinement potential is considered as naive approaches to the internal energy of the colliding hadrons. The Coulomb potential for the impact parameter picture is not able to furnish any result near forward direction. However, the confinement potential results in the hollowness effect of the inelastic overlap function.
