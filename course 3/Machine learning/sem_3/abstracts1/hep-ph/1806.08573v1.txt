Motivated by recent results from neutrino experiments, we study the neutrino masses and mixing in the framework of a SUSY $SU(5)\times \mathbb{A}_{4} $ model. The hybrid of Type I and Type II seesaw mechanisms leads to the nonzero value of the reactor angle $\theta_{13}\neq 0$ and to the recently disfavored maximal atmospheric angle $\theta_{23} \neq45^{\circ}$ by the NOvA experiment. The phenomenological consequences of the model are studied for both normal and inverted mass hierarchies. The obtained ranges for the effective Majorana neutrino mass $m_{\beta \beta}$, the electron neutrino mass $m_{\nu_{e}}$, and the $CP$ violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ lie within the current experimental allowed ranges where we find that the normal mass hierarchy is favored over the inverted one.
