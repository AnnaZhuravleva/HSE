We propose a further development of a multi-pomeron exchange model of pp and p$\bar p$ collisions at high energy. The model describes consistently multiplicity, transverse momentum of charged particles and their correlation in wide energy range (from ISR to LHC) by introducing string collectivity effects in pp collisions. The particles species differentiation is implemented according to Schwinger mechanism. Due to the influence of higher resonances on the yields of observed particles, we implement the production of a large set of hadron resonances with cascade decays. We present the results on pion, kaon and proton yields as a function of the collision energy and the correlation of strange and multi-strange hadrons with multiplicity and compare the results with experimental data.
