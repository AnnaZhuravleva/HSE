We study electroweak baryogenesis driven by the top quark in a general two Higgs doublet model with flavor-changing Yukawa couplings, keeping the Higgs potential $CP$ invariant. With Higgs sector couplings and the additional top Yukawa coupling $\rho_{tt}$ all of $\mathcal{O}$(1), one naturally has sizable $CP$ violation that fuels the cosmic baryon asymmetry. Even if $\rho_{tt}$ vanishes, the favor-changing coupling $\rho_{tc}$ can still lead to successful baryogenesis. Phenomenological consequences such as $t\to ch$, $\tau \to \mu\gamma$, electron electric dipole moment, $h\to\gamma\gamma$, and $hhh$ coupling are discussed.
