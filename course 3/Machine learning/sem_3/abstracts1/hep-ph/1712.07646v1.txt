Partial compositeness is a key ingredient of models where the electroweak symmetry is broken by a composite Higgs state. Recently, a UV completion of partial compositeness was proposed, featuring a new strongly coupled gauge interaction as well as new fundamental fermions and scalars. We work out the full flavor structure of the minimal realization of this idea and investigate in detail the consequences for flavor physics. While CP violation in kaon mixing represents a significant constraint on the model, we find many viable parameter points passing all precision tests. We also demonstrate that the recently observed hints for a violation of lepton flavor universality in $B\to K^{(*)}\ell\ell$ decays can be accommodated by the model, while the anomalies in $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ cannot be explained while satisfying LEP constraints on $Z$ couplings.
