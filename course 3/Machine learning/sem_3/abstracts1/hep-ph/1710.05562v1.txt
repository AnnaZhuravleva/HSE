We characterize Leggett-Garg-Type Inequality (LGtI) for three flavor neutrino oscillations in the presence of matter and CP violating effects, showing how they can be expressed in terms of the neutrino survival as well as oscillation probabilities. Hence, our results are in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. We then explicitly show the violation of LGtI in the context of two ongoing accelerator facilities, NOvA and T2K. Remarkably, such combinations of two-time correlators are sensitive to the well-known mass hierarchy problem in Delta_{31} and also to the CP violation in the leptonic sector.
