We study inflation in a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model driven by a potential generated in the context of no-scale supergravity. The Pati-Salam gauge group $SU(4)_{c}\times{SU(2)_{L}\times{SU(2)_{R}}}$ , is supplemented with a $Z_{2} $ symmetry. Spontaneous breaking via the $SU(4)$ adjoint leads to the left-right symmetric group. Then the $SU(2)_{R}$ breaks at an intermediate scale and the inflaton is a combination of the neutral components of the $SU(2)_{R}$ doublets. We discuss various limits of the parameter space and we show that consistent solutions with the cosmological data for the a spectral index $n_{s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio r are found for a wide range of the parameter space of the model. Regarding the latter, which is a canonical measure of primordial gravity waves, we find that $r\sim{10^{-3}-10^{-2}}$. An alternative possibility where the adjoint scalar field $S$ has the role of the inflaton is also discussed.
