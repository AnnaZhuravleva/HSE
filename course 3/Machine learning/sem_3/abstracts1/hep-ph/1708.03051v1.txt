We present general formulae to compute Wilson line correlators with the Color Glass Condensate described by the McLerran-Venugopalan model. We explicitly construct a complete and non-orthogonal set of color-singlet bases and write matrix elements down, so that the exponential of the matrix leads to the Wilson line correlators. We further develop a systematic perturbative expansion of dipole Wilson line correlators in terms of $1/N_c$ where $N_c$ is the color number. As a phenomenological application we calculate the flow harmonics $v_n\{m\}$ in the dipole model and discuss the $N_c$ scaling.
