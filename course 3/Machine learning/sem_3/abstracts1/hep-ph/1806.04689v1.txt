We address the possibility of realising successful leptogenesis from dark matter annihilations in the scotogenic model of neutrino masses to explain the same order of magnitude abundance of dark matter and baryons in the present Universe. After showing that the minimal model in this category can not satisfy all these requirements, we study a minimal extension of this model and find that the scale of leptogenesis can be as low as 5 TeV, lower than the one in vanilla leptogenesis scenario in scotogenic model along with the additional advantage of explaining the baryon-dark matter coincidence. Due to such low scale, the model remains predictive at dark matter direct detection and rare decay experiments looking for charged lepton flavour violating processes.
