The low-temperature representation for the quark condensate in a weak magnetic field $H$ is known up to two-loop order. Remarkably, at one-loop order, the published series for the quark condensate in the chiral limit and $H \ll T^2$ are inconsistent. Using an alternative representation for the kinematical Bose functions, we derive the series to arbitrary order in $H/T^2$, and also determine which of the published results is correct.
