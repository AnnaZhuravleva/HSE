To explaine the matter-antimatter asymmetry, a supersymmetric extention of the standard model is proposed where baryon and lepton numbers are local gauged(BLMSSM), and exotic superfields are introduced when gauge group is enlarged to $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(2)_L\otimes U(1)_Y \otimes U(1)_B \otimes U(1)_L$. As signals of new physics have not been observed on Large Hadron Collider, the parameter space relevant to the masses of new particles is stringently constrainted. By diagonalizing the mass squared matrices for neutral scalar sectors and the mass matrices for exotic quarks, we plot the masses of new particles varying with different parameters with some assumptions, so the constraints on model parameter is obtained with different lower limit on particle mass.
