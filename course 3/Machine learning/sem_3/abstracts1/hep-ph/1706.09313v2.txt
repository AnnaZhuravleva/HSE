We revisit the current LHC constraints on the electroweak-ino sector parameters in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) that are relevant to explaining the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly via the dominant chargino and muon sneutrino loop. Since the LHC bounds on electroweak-inos become weaker if they decay via an intermediate stau or a tau sneutrino instead of the first two generation sleptons, we perform a detailed analysis of the scenario with a bino as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and a light stau as the next-to-lightest one (NLSP). Even in this scenario, the chargino sector parameters in the MSSM that can account for the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly within $1 \sigma$ are already found to be significantly constrained by the 8 TeV LHC and the available subset of the 13 TeV LHC limits. We also estimate the current LHC exclusions in the left-smuon (and/or left-selectron) NLSP scenario from multilepton searches, and further combine the constraints from the multi-tau and multi-lepton channels for a mass spectrum in which all three generations of sleptons are lighter than the chargino. In the latter two cases, small corners of the $1 \sigma$ favoured region for $(g-2)_\mu$ are still allowed at present.
