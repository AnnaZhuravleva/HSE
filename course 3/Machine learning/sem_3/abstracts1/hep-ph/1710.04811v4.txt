The mass spectra of the standard model particles are reproduced in the $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification in the six-dimensional warped space without introducing exotic light fermions. Light neutrino masses are explained by the gauge-Higgs seesaw mechanism. We evaluate the effective potential of the 4d Higgs boson appearing as a fluctuation mode of the Aharonov-Bohm phase $\theta_H$ in the extra-dimensioal space, and show that the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking takes place with the Higgs boson mass $m_H \sim 125\,$GeV and $\theta_H \sim 0.1$. The Kaluza-Klein mass scale in the fifth dimension is approximately given by $m_{\rm KK} \sim 1.230\,{\rm TeV}/\sin \theta_H$.
