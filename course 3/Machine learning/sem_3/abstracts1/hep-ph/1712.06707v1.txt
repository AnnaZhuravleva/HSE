In this work we study the the sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment to probe non-standard interaction in neutrino propagation. As this experiment will be statistically dominated due to its large detector volume and high beam-power, it is expected that the sensitivity will be affected by systematics. This motivates us to study the effect of systematics in probing the non-standard interaction. We also compare our results with the other future proposed experiments i.e., T2HK, HK and DUNE.
