We consider a scenario where the supersymmetry breaking and its mediation, and the cancellation of the theta parameter of SU(3)c are all caused by a single chiral multiplet. The string axion multiplet is a natural candidate of such a single superfield. We show that the scenario provides a convincing basis of focus point gaugino mediation, where the electroweak scale is explained with a moderate tuning among the parameters of the theory.
