The ${\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\to}$ $B_{c}^{\ast}D$ weak decays ($n$ $=$ $1$, $2$, $3$) are investigated with perturbative QCD approach. It is found that the CKM-favored ${\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\to}$ $B_{c}^{\ast}D_{s}$ decays have branching ratio of ${\cal O}(10^{-10})$, which might be potentially accessible to the future LHC and SuperKEKB experiments.
