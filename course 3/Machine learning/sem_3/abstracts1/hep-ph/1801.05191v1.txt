We review the MasterCode fits of several incarnations of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). These include the GUT models based on mAMSB and SU(5), sub-GUT models as well as a model defined at low energies with 11 free parameters, the pMSSM11. The fit combines consistently measurements of Higgs boson properties, searches for additional Higgs bosons and supersymmetric (SUSY) particles, low-energy and flavor experiments as well as Dark Matter (DM) measurements. We predict the preferred SUSY mass spectra in these models and analyze the discovery potential of future e+e- colliders such as the ILC and CLIC.
