This study aims to analyze the data on multiplicity distributions and Bose-Einstein correlations collected at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations using a double-generalized Glauber-Lachs formula (D-GGL) and double-negative binomial distribution (D-NBD). From this investigation, it can be inferred that the D-GGL formula performs as effectively as the D-NBD. Moreover, our results show that the parameters estimated in multiplicity distributions (MD) (P(n)) are related to those contained in the BEC formula.
