Inspired by the recent measurements on two-body nonleptonic $J/{\psi}$ weak decay at BESIII, the charm-changing $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s,d}V$ weak decays are studied with perturbative QCD approach, where $V$ denotes ${\rho}$ and $K^{\ast}$ vector mesons. It is found that branching ratio for $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}{\rho}$ decay can reach up to ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which is within the potential measurement capability of the future high-luminosity experiments.
