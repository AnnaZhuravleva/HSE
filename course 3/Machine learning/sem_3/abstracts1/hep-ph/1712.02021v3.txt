The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has observed a tentative peak at $E\sim1.4~\TeV$ in the cosmic-ray electron spectrum. In this paper, we interpret this excess in the scotogenic type-II seesaw model. This model extends the canonical type-II seesaw model with dark matter (DM) candidates and a loop-induced vacuum expectation value of the triplet scalars, $v_\Delta$, resulting in small neutrino masses naturally even for TeV scale triplet scalars. Assuming a nearby DM subhalo, the DAMPE excess can be explained by DM annihilating into a pair of triplet scalars which subsequently decay to charged lepton final states. Spectrum fitting of the DAMPE excess indicates it potentially favors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. We also discuss how to evade associated neutrino flux in our model.
