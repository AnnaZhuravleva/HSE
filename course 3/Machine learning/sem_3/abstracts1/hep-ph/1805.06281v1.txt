Chargino pair production via photon-photon collision is investigated in Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model at a future linear collider. The process is computed using all the possible diagrams at the next-to-leading order level, including box, triangle, and self-energy diagrams. The numerical analysis is carried out for the production rates of the lightest chargino pairs in RNS, NS, mSUGRA, BB, NUHM2, and NUGM scenarios. These distinct benchmark models were introduced in the light of LHC results presented at $\sqrt{s}=7-8\tev$. Among these scenarios, Radiatively Driven Susy has the highest cross-section for the $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow \tilde\chi_1^+ \tilde\chi_1^-$. The partonic cross-section reaches up to $4.15\pb$ at $\sqrt{\hat{s}}=250\gev$. The convoluted cross-section in $e^+e^-$-collider is $\sim950\fb$ at $\sqrt{s}=350\gev$, which makes it accessible even at very low energies. Besides, the cross-section for each scenario is presented for the possible polarization configurations of the incoming photon beams. The results show that the opposite polarization of the photon beams enhances the cross-section. The total convoluted cross-section with the photon luminosity in a $e^+e^-$ machine is given as a function of center-of-mass energy, and up to $\sqrt{s}=1\tev$.
