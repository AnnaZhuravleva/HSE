We explore the potential of a selected model of radiative neutrino masses to be implemented in a renormalizable SU(5) unification framework. The Zee-type model under consideration uncovers the SU(5) representations in which the new fields are embedded and which may contain also other light states leading to the unification of gauge couplings. We perform an exhaustive search which reveals specific patterns of new states and demonstrate that such patterns are consistent with a general choice of relevant scalar potential. It turns out that all of the specific scenarios which lead to successful unification include the colored scalars testable at the LHC.
