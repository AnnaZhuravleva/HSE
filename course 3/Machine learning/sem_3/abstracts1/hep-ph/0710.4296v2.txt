Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are one of the leading candidates for Dark Matter. So far we can use direct Dark Matter detection to estimate the mass of halo WIMPs only by fitting predicted recoil spectra to future experimental data. Here we develop a model-independent method for determining the WIMP mass by using experimental data directly. This method is independent of the as yet unknown WIMP density near the Earth as well as of the WIMP-nuclear cross section and can be used to extract information about WIMP mass with O(50) events.
