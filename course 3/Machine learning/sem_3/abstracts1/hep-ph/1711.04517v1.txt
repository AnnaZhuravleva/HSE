We explore the leading effective interactions between the Standard Model and a generic singlet CP-odd (pseudo)Goldstone boson in two frameworks for electroweak symmetry breaking: linear and non-linear realizations, determining the basis of leading effective operators for the latter. New bounds are obtained and prospects of signals at colliders are explored. Mono-Z, mono-W, and aW{\gamma} are signals expected in both frameworks while non-standard Higgs decays and mono-h signals may point to non-linear EWSB realizations.
