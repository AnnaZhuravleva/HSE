We look for possible (partial) compositeness properties of the bottom quark according to the Composite Standard Model (CSM) concept in the same way this was previously done for Higgs boson and top quark. After looking at the direct form factor effects appearing in $e^+e^-\to b\bar b$ we analyze the more complex features of the $e^+e^-, gg, \gamma\gamma \to b\bar b H, b\bar b Z, t\bar b W^-$ processes. We emphasize typical differences appearing between CSM concerving and CSM violating cases. We also mention the possible appearence of an effective bottom mass.
