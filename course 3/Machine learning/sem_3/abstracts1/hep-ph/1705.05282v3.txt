Effects of Kaluza-Klein excited neutral vector bosons ($Z'$ bosons) in the gauge-Higgs unification on $e^+e^- \to \bar{q}q, \ell^+\ell^-$ cross sections are studied, particularly in future $e^+ e^-$ collider experiments with polarized beams. Significant deviations in the energy and polarization dependence in $\sigma(\mu^+\mu^-)$, the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, $R_b(\mu) \equiv \sigma(\bar{b}b)/\sigma(\mu^+\mu^-)$ and the left-right asymmetry from the standard model are predicted.
