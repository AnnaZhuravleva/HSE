We present a tool to produce benchmarks with realistic mass spectra and realistic mixing in the gaugino-higgsino sector of the MSSM. We suggest as a next-to-minimal approach the use of benchmarks, whose mass spectra and mixing matrix elements are the result of a proper matrix diagonalisation at treelevel. We scan over the four relevant parameters $\{\mu, \tan \beta, M_{1}, M_{2}\}$ for a specific grid of neutralino and chargino masses. We demonstrate how to define a measure for the quality of a fit, including a method to maximise properties such as the gaugino or higgsino content.
