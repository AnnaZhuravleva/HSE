(Anti-)(hyper-)nuclei are unique probes of the medium created in proton-proton, proton-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at the energies available at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their production is typically discussed within the framework of coalescence and thermal-statistical production models. While it is often argued that these two approaches are not distinguishable, we present a detailed study of both theories which reveals large differences between the two scenarios for the production of objects with extended wave-functions. Both models give similar predictions and show similar agreement with experimental data for (anti-)deuterons and (anti-)$^{3}$He nuclei, but they largely differ in their description of (anti-)hyper-triton production. The thermal-statistical model is found to be in agreement with results in central Pb-Pb collisions even though fragile objects such as light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei should be destroyed in hadronic interactions after the chemical freeze-out of the system. Our findings highlight the unique potential of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a laboratory to clarify the internal structure of exotic QCD objects and can serve as a basis for more refined calculations in the future.
