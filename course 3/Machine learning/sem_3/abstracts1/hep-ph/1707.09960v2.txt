We analyze the theoretical and phenomenological considerations for the electroweak phase transition and dark matter in an extension of the Standard Model with a complex scalar singlet (cxSM). In contrast with earlier studies, we use a renormalization group improved scalar potential and treat its thermal history in a gauge invariant manner. We find that the parameter space consistent with a strong first order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and present dark matter phenomenological constraints is significantly restricted compared to results of a conventional, gauge non-invariant analysis. In the simplest variant of the cxSM, recent LUX data and a SFOEWPT require a dark matter mass close to half the mass of the Standard Model-like Higgs boson. We also comment on various caveats regarding the perturbative treatment of the phase transition dynamics.
