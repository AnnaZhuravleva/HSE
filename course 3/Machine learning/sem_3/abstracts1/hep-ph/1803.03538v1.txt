We investigate the dipole moments of the tau- neutrino at high-energy and high luminosity at linear electron positron colliders, such as CLIC or ILC through the analysis of the reaction $e^{+}\, e^{-}\rightarrow \nu\, \bar \nu \,\gamma$ in the framework of the $SU(4)_L \times U(1)_X$ model. The limits on dipole moment were obtained for integrated luminosity of $\cal{L}$= 500-2000\, fb$^{-1}$ and center of mass between 0.5 and 3.0 TeV. The estimated limits for the tau-neutrino magnetic and electric dipole moments are improved by 2-3 orders of magnitude and complement previous studies on the dipole moments.
