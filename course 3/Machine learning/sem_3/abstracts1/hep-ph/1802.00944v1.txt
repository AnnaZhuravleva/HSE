In a class of neutrino mass models with a lepton flavor violation (LFV) Yukawa interaction term that involves a heavy right handed neutrino, a charged scalar and a charged lepton, we investigate at the ILC@500 GeV the possibility of observing news physics. These models can address neutrino mass and dark matter without being in conflict with different LFV constraints. By imposing DM relic density and LFV constraints, we recast the analysis done by L3 collaboration at LEP-II of monophoton searches on our space parameter and look for new physics in such channels like monophoton and $S S(\gamma)$, where we give different cuts and show the predicted distributions. We show also that using polarized beams could improve the statistical significance.
