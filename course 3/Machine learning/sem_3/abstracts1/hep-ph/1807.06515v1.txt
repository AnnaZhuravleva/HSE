The decay of a heavy neutral scalar particle into fermions and into charged scalars are analyzed when in the presence of an external magnetic field and finite temperature. Working in the one-loop approximation for the study of these decay channels, it is shown that the magnetic field always leads to a suppression of the decay width. Our results are also contrasted with common approximations found in the literature, e.g., when the magnitude of the external magnetic field is smaller than the decaying product particle masses, i.e., in the weak field approximation, and in the opposite case, i.e., in the strong field approximation. Possible applications of our results are discussed.
