We consider instant preheating as the mechanism for generating the curvature perturbation at the end of chaotic inflation. Then we examine if inflation could be driven by a Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) flat direction or a sneutrino. Our simple mechanism relaxes some serious constraints that appeared in past studies, making inflation driven by a MSSM flat direction or a sneutrino more plausible.
