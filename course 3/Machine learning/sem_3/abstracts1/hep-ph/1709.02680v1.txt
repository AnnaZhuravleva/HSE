Now that the mass limits for gluinos have been pushed to the few-TeV range, they might only be visible at the LHC in associated production with lighter gauginos. We compute the corresponding cross section at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) and next-to-leading order (NLO) precision in the QCD coupling constant. The resulting expressions are implemented in the public code RESUMMINO and can be directly used in the corresponding experimental searches.
