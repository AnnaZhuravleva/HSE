Taking into account the negative searches for New Physics at the LHC, electroweak effective theories are appropriate to deal with current energies. Tracks of new, higher scales can be studied through next-to leading order corrections of the electroweak effective theory. We assume a generic non-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking with a singlet Higgs and a strongly-coupled UV-completion. We further consider a high-energy Lagrangian that incorporates explicitly a general set of new heavy fields. After integrating out these heavy resonances, we study the pattern of low-energy constants among the light fields, which are generated by the massive states.
