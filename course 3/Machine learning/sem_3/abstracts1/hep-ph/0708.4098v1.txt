We present a new general mechanism for generating curvature perturbations after inflation. Our model is based on the simple assumption that a field that starts to oscillate after inflation has a potential characterized by an underlying global symmetry that is slightly or badly broken. Inhomogeneous preheating occurs due to the oscillation with the broken symmetry. Unlike the traditional curvaton model, we will not identify the curvaton with the oscillating field. The curvaton is identified with the preheat field that could be either a scalar, vector, or fermionic field. We introduce an explicit mass term for the curvaton, which is important for later evolution and the decay. Our present model represents the simplest example of the hybrid of the curvatons and inhomogeneous preheating.
