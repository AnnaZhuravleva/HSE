As the $B-L$ gauge symmetry is the most plausible addition among the various extensions of the Standard Model, it is attractive to identify symmetry which stabilizes dark matter with the $B-L$ gauge symmetry. Besides, dark matter which is stabilized by $B-L$ naturally leads to asymmetric dark matter. In this paper, we construct a model of composite asymmetric dark matter in a bottom-up approach. By assuming that the entropy of the dark sector is released to the Standard Model sector through a kinetic mixing of the dark photon, we reach a simple dark sector with a QCD-like $SU(3)$ and QED-like $U(1)$ gauge theory. We also show that such a model can be tested via direct detection experiments of dark matter.
