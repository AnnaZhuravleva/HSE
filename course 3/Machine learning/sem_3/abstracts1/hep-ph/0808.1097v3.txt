In conventional models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is invariably the gravitino. However, if the supersymmetry breaking sector is strongly coupled, conformal sequestering may raise the mass of the gravitino relative to the remaining soft supersymmetry-breaking masses. In this letter, we demonstrate that such conformal dynamics in gauge-mediated theories may give rise to satisfactory neutralino dark matter while simultaneously solving the flavor and mu/ B mu problems.
