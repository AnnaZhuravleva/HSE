In this paper we show that for a nucleon at rest if the quarks and/or antiquarks are in motion inside the nucleon producing chromo-magnetic field then the mass sum rule in QCD is violated when the confinement potential energy at large distance $r$ rises linearly with $r$ (or faster). Hence we find that the mass of the nucleon at rest is not equal to the mass-energy of all the quarks plus antiquarks plus gluons inside the nucleon if there exists chromo-magnetic field inside the nucleon and the confinement potential energy at large distance $r$ rises linearly with $r$ (or faster).
