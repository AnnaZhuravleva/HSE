In this article, we study the $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, $\bar{D}^{*}\Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^{*}\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark molecular states with the QCD sum rules by carrying out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension $13$ in a consistent way. The present calculations support assigning the $P_c(4380)$ to be the $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark molecular state with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-$, assigning the $P_c(4450)$ to be the $\bar{D}^{*}\Sigma_c$ pentaquark molecular state with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-$ or the $\bar{D}^{*}\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark molecular state with $J^P={\frac{5}{2}}^-$. Special attentions are payed to the operator product expansion.
