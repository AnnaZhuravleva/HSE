We show that a contribution to the total curvature perturbation may be due to the presence of flat directions in supersymmetric models. It is generated at the first os- cillation of the flat direction condensate when the latter relaxes to the minimum of its potential after the end of inflation. We also point out that, if the contribution to the total curvature perturbation from supersymmetric flat direction is the dominant one, then a significant level of non-Gaussianity in the cosmological perturbation is also naturally expected.
