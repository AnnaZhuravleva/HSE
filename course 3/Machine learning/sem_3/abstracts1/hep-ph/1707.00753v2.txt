We investigate simplified models of new physics that can accommodate the measured value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the relic density of dark matter. We define a set of renormalizable, SU(2)$\times$U(1) invariant extensions of the Standard Model, each comprising an inert $Z_2$-odd scalar field and one or more vector-like pairs of colorless fermions that communicate to the muons through Yukawa-type interactions. The new sectors are classified according to their transformation properties under the Standard Model gauge group and all models are systematically confronted with a variety of experimental constraints: LEP mass bounds, direct LHC searches, electroweak precision observables, and direct searches for dark matter. We show that scenarios featuring only one type of new fermions become very predictive once the relic density and collider constraints are taken into account, as in this case $g-2$ is not enhanced by chirality flip. Conversely, for models where an additional source of chiral-symmetry violation is generated via fermion mixing, the constraints are much looser and new precision experiments with highly suppressed systematic uncertainties may be required to test the parameter space.
