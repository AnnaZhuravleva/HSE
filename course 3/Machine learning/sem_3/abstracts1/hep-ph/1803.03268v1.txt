We study the weak decay $\Omega_b^- \to (\Xi_c^+ \, K^-) \, \pi^-$, in view of the narrow $\Omega_c$ states recently measured by the LHCb collaboration and later confirmed by the Belle collaboration. The $\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\Omega_c(3090)$ are described as meson-baryon molecular states, using an extension of the local hidden gauge approach in coupled channels. We investigate the $\Xi D$, $\Xi_c \bar K$ and $\Xi_c^\prime \bar K$ invariant mass distributions making predictions that could be confronted with future experiments, providing useful information that could help determine the quantum numbers and nature of these states.
