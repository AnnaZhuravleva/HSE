We suggest 3P0 quantum state of virtual (ss') pairs in the nucleon can be polarised by the internal fields permeating the volume of the nucleon (proton or neutron). Due to the quadratic Zeeman interaction, 3P0 wavefunction of virtual (qq') pairs acquires the admixture of 1P10 quantum state in the magnetic field, which generates the antiparallel polarization of s and s' quarks (in the nucleon). Considering the internal magnetic fields of neutron and proton (originating from their measured magnetic dipole moments), we suggest the induced s-quark polarization in the neutron to be of the oposite direction compared to the proton case. We mention the influence of the internal chromo-magnetic fields on the quantum state of (qq') pairs in the nucleon and we discuss also the expected behaviour of virtual (cc') pairs.
