We revisit the description of the Pomeron within the effective string theory of QCD. Using a string duality relation, we show how the static potential maps onto the high-energy scattering amplitude that exhibits the Pomeron behavior. Besides the Pomeron intercept and slope, new additional terms stemming from the higher order string corrections are shown to affect both the growth of the nucleon's size at high energies and its profile in impact parameter space. The stringy description also allows for an odderon that only disappears in critical dimension. Some of the Pomeron's features that emerge within the effective string description can be studied at the future EIC collider.
