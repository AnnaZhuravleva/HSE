We study baryon number violating nucleon decays induced by unparticle interactions with the standard model particles. We find that the lowest dimension operators which cause nucleon decays can arise at dimension 6 + (d_s-3/2) with the unparticles being a spinor of dimension d_s=d_\U +1/2. For scalar and vector unparticles of dimension d_\U, the lowest order operatoers arise at 6+d_\U and 7+d_\U dimensions,respectively. Comparing the spinor unparticle induced n \to O^s_\U and experimental bound on invisible decay of a neutron from KamLAND, we find that the scale for unparticle physics is required to be larger than 10^{10} GeV for d_\U < 2 if the couplings are set to be of order one. For scalar and vector unparticles, the dominant baryon number violating decay modes are n\to \bar \nu + O_\U (O^\mu_\U) and p \to e^+ + O_\U (O^\mu_\U). The same experimental bound puts the scales for scalar and vector unparticle to be larger than 10^{7} and 10^{5} GeV for d_\U <2 with couplings set to be of order one. Data on, p \to e^+ invisible, puts similar constraints on unparticle interactions.
