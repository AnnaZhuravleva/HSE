The clockwork mechanism is a means of naturally generating exponential hierarchies in theories without significant hierarchies among fundamental parameters. We emphasize the role of interactions in the clockwork mechanism, demonstrating that clockwork is an intrinsically abelian phenomenon precluded in non-abelian theories such as Yang-Mills, non-linear sigma models, and gravity. We also show that clockwork is not realized in extra-dimensional theories through purely geometric effects, but may be generated by appropriate localization of zero modes.
