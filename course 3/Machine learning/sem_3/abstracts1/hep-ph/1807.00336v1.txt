The $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry is a promising extension of the standard model of particle physics, which is supposed to be broken at some high energy scale. Associated with the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry breaking, right-handed neutrinos acquire their Majorana masses and then tiny light neutrino masses are generated through the seesaw mechanism. In this paper, we demonstrate that the first order phase transition of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry breaking can generate a large amplitude of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) radiation for some parameter space of the model, which is detectable in future experiments. Therefore, the detection of GWs is an interesting strategy to probe the seesaw scale which can be much higher than the energy scale of collider experiments.
