In the context of an atom endowed with nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM), we consider the effects on the Schiff moment of $CPT$-even Lorentz-violating (LV) terms that modify the Coulomb potential. First, we study the modifications on the Schiff moment when the nucleus interacts with the electronic cloud by means of a Coulomb potential altered only by the $P$-even LV components. Next, by supposing the existence of an additional intrinsic LV EDM generated by other LV sources, we assess the corrections to the Schiff moment when the interaction nucleus-electrons runs mediated by a Coulomb potential modified by both the $P$-odd and $P$-even LV components. We then use known estimates and EDM measurements to discuss upper bounds on the new Schiff moment components and the possibility of an intrisic nuclear EDM component ascribed to LV effects.
