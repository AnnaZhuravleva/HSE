The absence of supersymmetric particles at the weak scale is a puzzle if supersymmetry solves the gauge hierarchy problem. We show that, if the right-handed neutrino masses arise from hidden gaugino condensation via GUT-suppressed operators, successful thermal leptogenesis leads to the lower bound on the gravitino mass, which may explain the little hierarchy problem. If domain walls associated with the gaugino condensation are formed after inflation, they annihilate when $H \sim m_{3/2}$. We address the possibility that observable gravitational wave signals might emerge from the domain wall annihilation.
