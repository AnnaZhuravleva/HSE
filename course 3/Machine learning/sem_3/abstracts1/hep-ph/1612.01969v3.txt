We consider a selection of recent experimental results on electroweak $W^{\pm},\,Z$ gauge boson production in $pp$ collisions at BNL RHIC and CERN LHC energies in comparison to prediction of perturbative QCD calculations based on different sets of NLO parton distribution functions including the statistical PDF model known from fits to the DIS data. We show that the current statistical PDF parameterisation (fitted to the DIS data only) underestimates the LHC data on $W^{\pm},\,Z$ gauge boson production cross sections at the NLO by about 20\%. This suggests that there is a need to refit the parameters of the statistical PDF including the latest LHC data.
