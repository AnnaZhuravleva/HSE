The possibility that the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Standard Model (SM) may be generated by the Top-Higgs Yukawa interaction (which determines the so called "second minimum" in the SM) is examined. A former analysis is extended about a QCD action only including the Yukawa interaction of a single quark with a scalar field. We repeat the calculation of the two loop effective action of the model for the scalar field. A correction of the evaluation allowed choosing a strong coupling $\alpha $($\mu,\Lambda_{QCD})=0.2254$ GeV at an intermediate scale $\mu=11.63$ GeV, in order to fix the minimum of the potential at a scalar field determining $175$ GeV for the quark mass. A scalar field mass $m=44$ GeV is following, which is of the order than the experimental Higgs mass. The effects of considering a running with momenta coupling are studied. For this, the finite part of the two loop potential contribution determined by the strong coupling, was represented as a momentum integral. Next, substituting in this integral the experimental values of the running coupling, the potential curve became very similar to the one for constant coupling. This happened after simply assuming that the low momentum dependence of the coupling is "saturated" to a constant value being close to its lowest experimental value.
