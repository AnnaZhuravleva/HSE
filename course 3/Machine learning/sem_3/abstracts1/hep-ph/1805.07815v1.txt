We consider new modes of two-neutrino and neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decays in which one $\beta$ electron goes over to a continuous spectrum and the other occupies a vacant bound level of the daughter ion. We calculate the corresponding phase-space factors of the final states, estimate the partial decay rates, and derive the one- and two-electron energy spectra using relativistic many-electron wave functions of atoms provided by the multiconfiguration Dirac--Hartree--Fock package GRASP2K. While the bound-state neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decays are strongly suppressed, their two-neutrino counterparts can be observed in the next-generation double-$\beta$-decay experiments, most notably SuperNEMO.
