We investigate the potential of single Higgs boson production at the LHC and at egamma mode of future linear electron-positron collider to probe non-standard HZgamma and Hgammagamma couplings. We consider the semi-elastic production process pp-> p gamma p-> pHqX at the LHC where q represents the quarks and X represents the remnants of one of the initial protons. We also study the single Higgs production through gamma e-> He in the egamma collision at the future linear collider. We perform a model-independent analysis and obtain the sensitivity bounds on the non-standard Higgs couplings for both colliders.
