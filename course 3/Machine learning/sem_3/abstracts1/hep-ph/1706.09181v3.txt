The finite size of doubly heavy diquark gives a positive correction to the masses of baryons calculated in the local diquark approximation. We evaluate this correction for the basic states of doubly charmed baryons to give quite accurate predictions actual for current searches of those baryons at LHCb: $m[{\Xi_{cc}^{1/2}}^{+}]\approx m[{\Xi_{cc}^{1/2}}^{++}]=3615\pm 55$ MeV and   $m[{\Xi_{cc}^{3/2}}^{+}]\approx m[{\Xi_{cc}^{3/2}}^{++}]=3747\pm 55$ MeV.
