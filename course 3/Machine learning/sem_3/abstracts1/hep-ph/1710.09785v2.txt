An inclusive baryon to meson enhancement with increase in multiplicity has been observed in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 7 TeV. Such a striking feature of the data can be explained by approaches based on hydrodynamics and multi-parton interactions (MPI) coupled with color reconnection (CR) mechanism. In this paper, we investigate the multiplicity evolution of the charged particle yields associated with pions and protons selected from the intermediate $p_{T}$ region where the inclusive baryon to meson enhancement has been observed. The study has been peformed using EPOS 3 (hydrodynamics) and PYTHIA 8 (MPI with CR) event generators in pp collisions at 7 TeV. We find that the response of the individual pion and proton triggered correlation towards these two mechanisms is different and can be used to disentangle the effect of one from the other. The current study can, therefore, provide important insights on the origin of radial flow like effects in high multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC energies.
