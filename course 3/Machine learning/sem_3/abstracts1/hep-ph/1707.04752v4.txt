The R-parity conserving MSSM in light of the decay $B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ with near-SM branching ratio is an interesting platform for studying the complementarity between direct and indirect searches for beyond the SM physics. Based on this, we have analysed the possible impact of the $B_s\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^-$ observation on the posterior sample from the global fit of a 30-parameter MSSM (MSSM-30), and the related Wilson Coefficients. The MSSM-30 is a systematically constructed, symmetry-guided, MSSM parametrization, as opposed to the traditional frames (e.g. pMSSM) with crude treatment of flavor violation parameters. This paper illustrates why phenomenological frames like the MSSM-30 should be preferred to study flavor physics. For the current and future B-physics experimental precision, such a consideration is crucial for suitably assessing supersymmetric contributions to flavor observables.
