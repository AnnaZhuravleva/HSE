We have studied modulated inflation that generates curvature perturbation from light-field fluctuation. As discussed in previous works, even if the fluctuation of the inflaton itself does not generate the curvature perturbation at the horizon crossing, fluctuation of a light field may induce fluctuation for the end-line of inflation and this may lead to generation of cosmological perturbation ``at the end of the inflation''. Our scenario is different from those that are based on the fluctuations of the boundary of the inflaton trajectory, as clearly explained in this paper by using the $\delta N$ formalism. In this paper, we will consider the perturbation of the inflaton velocity that can be induced by a light field other than the inflaton. We also explain the crucial difference from the standard multi-field inflation model. We show concrete examples of the modulated inflation scenario in which non-gaussianity can be generated. We also discuss the running of the non-gaussianity parameter.
