We investigate the strong coupling constants for the baryon octet-octet, decuplet-octet, and decuplet-decuplet vertices with pseudoscalar mesons within a general framework of the chiral quark-soliton model, taking into account the effects of flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking to linear order in the expansion of the strange current quark mass. All relevant dynamical parameters are fixed by using the experimental data on hyperon semileptonic decays and the singlet axial-vector constant of the nucleon. The results of the strong coupling constants for the baryon octet and the pseudoscalar meson octet are compared with those determined from the J\"ulich-Bonn potential and the Nijmegen extended soft-core potential for hyperon-nucleon scattering. The results of the strong decay widths of the baryon decuplet are in good agreement with the experimental data. The effects of $SU_f(3)$ symmetry breaking are sizable on the $\eta'$ coupling constants. We predict also the strong coupling constants for the $\Omega$ baryons.
