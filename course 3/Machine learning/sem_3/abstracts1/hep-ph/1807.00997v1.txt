Very recently, a new $\Omega^{*}$ state was reported by the Belle Collaboration, with its mass of $2012.4 \pm 0.7\ \text{(stat)}\pm 0.6\ \text{(syst)}\ \mathrm{MeV}$, which locates just below the $K\Xi^*$ threshold and hence hints to be a possible $K\Xi^*$ hadronic molecule. Using the effective Lagrangian approach as the same as our previous works for other possible hadronic molecular states, we investigate the decay behavior of this new $\Omega^*$ state within the hadronic molecular picture. The results show that the measured decay width can be reproduced well and its dominant decay channel is predicted to be the $K\pi\Xi$ three-body decay. This suggests that the newly observed $\Omega^*$ may be ascribed as the $J^P={3/2}^-$ $K\Xi^*$ hadronic molecular state and can be further checked through its $K\pi\Xi$ decay channel.
