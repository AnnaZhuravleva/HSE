We study baryo-charmonium [$\eta_{\rm c}$- and $J/\psi$-$N^*$, $\eta_{\rm c}(2S)$-, $\psi(2S)$- and $\chi_{\rm c}(1P)$-$N$] and baryo-bottomonium [$\eta_{\rm b}(2S)$-, $\Upsilon(2S)$- and $\chi_{\rm b}(1P)$-$N$] bound states, where $N$ is the nucleon and $N^*$ a nucleon resonance. In the baryo-quarkonium model, the five $qqq Q \bar Q$ quarks are arranged in terms of a heavy quarkonium core, $Q \bar Q$, embedded in light baryonic matter, $qqq$, with $q = u$ or $d$. The interaction between the $Q \bar Q$ core and the light baryon can be written in terms of the QCD multipole expansion. The spectrum of baryo-charmonium states is calculated and the results compared with the existing experimental data. In particular, we can interpret the recently discovered $P_{\rm c}(4380)$ and $P_{\rm c}(4450)$ pentaquarks as $\psi(2S)$-$N$ and $\chi_{\rm c2}(1P)$-$N$ bound states, respectively. We observe that in the baryo-bottomonium sector the binding energies are, on average, slightly larger than those of baryo-charmonia. Because of this, the hidden-bottom pentaquarks are more likely to form than their hidden-charm counterparts. We thus suggest the experimentalists to look for five-quark states in the hidden-bottom sector in the $10.4-10.9$ GeV energy region.
