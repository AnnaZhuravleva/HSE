Heavy quarkonium ($\Upsilon$) production at low transverse momentum ($P_\perp$) in high-energy hadronic collisions is revisited from the point of view of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) framework. We perform resummation of double logarithmic correction associated with initial-state soft gluon shower for $b\bar b$ production by employing Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism. We show that the CSS formalism provides a nice description of $\Upsilon$ production data in p+$\rm\bar{p}$ collisions at Tevatron and p+p collisions at the LHC.
