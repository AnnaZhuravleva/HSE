Recently, the LHCb collaboration has reported the excesses in the $b \to s ll$ processes. One of the promising candidates for new physics to explain the anomalies is the extended Standard Model (SM) with vector-like quarks and leptons. In that model, Yukawa couplings between the extra fermions and SM fermions are introduced, adding extra scalars. Then, the box diagrams involving the extra fields achieve the $b \to s ll$ anomalies. It has been known that the excesses require the large Yukawa couplings of leptons, so that this kind of model can be tested by studying correlations with other observables. In this paper, we consider the extra scalar to be a dark matter (DM) candidate, and investigate DM physics as well as the flavor physics and the LHC physics. The DM relic density and the direct-detection cross section are also dominantly given by the Yukawa couplings, so that we find some explicit correlations between DM physics and the flavor physics. In particular, we find the predictions of the $b \to s ll$ anomalies against the direct detection of DM.
