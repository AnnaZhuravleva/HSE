We revisit the extraction of the triple electroweak gauge boson couplings from the Large Hadron Collider Run I data on the $W^+W^-$ and $W^\pm Z$ productions when the analysis also contains additional operators that modify the couplings of the gauge bosons to light quarks and the gauge boson self-energies. We work in the framework of effective Lagrangians where we consider dimension-six operators and perform a global fit to consistently take into account the bounds on these additional operators originating from the electroweak precision data. We show that the constraints on the Wilson coefficients $f_B/\Lambda^2$ and $f_W/\Lambda^2$ are modified when we include the additional operators while the limits on $f_{WWW}/\Lambda^2$ remain unchanged.
