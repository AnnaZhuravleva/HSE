We show that the scalar field that drives inflation can have a dynamical origin, being a strongly coupled right handed neutrino condensate. The resulting model is phenomenologically tightly constrained, and can be experimentally (dis)probed in the near future. The mass of the right handed neutrino obtained this way (a crucial ingredient to obtain the right light neutrino spectrum within the see-saw mechanism in a complete three generation framework) is related to that of the inflaton and both completely determine the inflation features that can be tested by current and planned experiments.
