We study supersymmetric (SUSY) models in which the muon $g-2$ discrepancy and the dark matter relic abundance are simultaneously explained. The muon $g-2$ discrepancy, or a 3$\sigma$ deviation between the experimental and theoretical results of the muon anomalous magnetic moment, can be resolved by SUSY models, which implies at least three SUSY multiplets have masses of $\mathop{\mathcal{O}}(100)\, \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, models with the bino, higgsino and slepton having $\mathop{\mathcal{O}}(100)\, \mathrm{GeV}$ masses are not only capable to explain the muon $g-2$ discrepancy but naturally contains the neutralino dark matter with the observed relic abundance. We study constraints and future prospects of such models; in particular, we find that the LHC search for events with two hadronic taus and missing transverse momentum can probe this scenario through chargino/neutralino production. It is shown that almost all the parameter space of the scenario can be probed at the high-luminosity LHC, and a large part can also be tested at the XENON1T experiment as well as at the ILC.
