I present a preliminary determination of the Fragmentation Functions (FFs) of unidentified charged hadrons at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics. The analysis is based on hadron production cross section data in single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation. It extends a recent determination of the FFs of identified charged pions, charged kaons and protons/antiprotons performed by the NNPDF Collaboration. I illustrate the quality of the FFs determined in this analysis and show how they describe the charged hadron spectra measured in proton-(anti)proton collisions.
