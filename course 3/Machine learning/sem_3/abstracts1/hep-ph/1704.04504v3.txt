We present DsixTools, a Mathematica package for the handling of the dimension-six Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Among other features, DsixTools allows the user to perform the full one-loop Renormalization Group Evolution of the Wilson coefficients in the Warsaw basis. This is achieved thanks to the SMEFTrunner module, which implements the full one-loop anomalous dimension matrix previously derived in the literature. In addition, DsixTools also contains modules devoted to the matching to the $\Delta B = \Delta S = 1,2$ and $\Delta B = \Delta C = 1$ operators of the Weak Effective Theory at the electroweak scale and their QCD and QED Renormalization Group Evolution below the electroweak scale.
