We quantify our present knowledge of the size and flavor structure of non-standard neutrino interactions which affect the matter background in the evolution of solar, atmospheric, reactor and long-baseline accelerator neutrinos as determined by a global analysis of oscillation data - both alone and in combination with the results on coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering from the COHERENT experiment. We consider general neutral current neutrino interactions with quarks whose lepton-flavor structure is independent of the quark type. We study the dependence of the allowed ranges of non-standard interaction coefficients, the status of the LMA-D solution, and the determination of the oscillation parameters on the relative strength of the non-standard couplings to up and down quarks. Generically we find that the conclusions are robust for a broad spectrum of up-to-down strengths, and we identify and quantify the exceptional cases related to couplings whose effect in neutrino propagation in the Earth or in the Sun is severely suppressed. As a result of the study we provide explicit constraints on the effective couplings which parametrize the non-standard Earth matter potential relevant for long-baseline experiments.
