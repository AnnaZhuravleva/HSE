The Yukawa parameters of the general 2HDM-III have received much attention in the context of the anomalies reported in $\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ measurements by the BaBar, Belle and LHCb collaborations. We review the parameter regions found in the literature that can explain these two ratios in 2HDM-III and use them as constraints to predict additional observables in $b\to c\tau\nu$ modes that can further test or rule out this model. In particular we consider the differential decay distributions $d\Gamma/dq^{2}$, the ratios $\mathcal{R}(J/\psi)$ and $\mathcal{R}(\Lambda_{c})$, and the tau-lepton polarisation in $B\to D^{(\star)}\tau\nu$, with emphasis on the CP violating normal polarisation.
