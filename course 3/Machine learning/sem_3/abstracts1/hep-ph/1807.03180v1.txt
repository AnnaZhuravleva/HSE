We study the development of heavy-flavor flow harmonics in high-energy nuclear collisions. The elliptic and triangular flow of heavy-flavor hadrons, arising from the finite impact parameter of the two nuclei and from event-by-event fluctuations of the initial geometry, is analyzed in detail, considering the contribution from particles decoupling from the fireball at various times. We also study the dependence of the flow harmonics on the event-shape fluctuations, considering events belonging to the same centrality class but characterized by very different eccentricities (or vice-versa).
