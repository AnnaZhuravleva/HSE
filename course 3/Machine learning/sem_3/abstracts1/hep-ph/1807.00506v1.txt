We investigate the scale dependence of transverse momentum dependent(TMD) gluon distribution in saturation regime. We found that in the Collins-2011 scheme, the scale dependence of small x gluon TMD is governed by the same renormalization group(RG) equation that holds at moderate or large $x$. Following the standard procedure, one then can resum both double leading logarithm and single leading logarithm in saturation regime by jointly solving the Collins-Soper equation and the RG equation.
