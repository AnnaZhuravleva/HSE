We revisit the alternative left-right symmetric model, motivated by superstring-inspired $E_6$ model. We systematically analyze the constraints imposed by theoretical and experimental bounds on the parameter space of this class of models. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the Higgs sector and show that three neutral CP-even and two CP-odd Higgs bosons in addition to two charged Higgs bosons can be light, of ${\cal O}(100)$ GeV.   We emphasise that our model has a potential to account for the recent Large Hadron Collider results for signal strength of Higgs decays. We also explore discovery signatures of the exotic down-type quark, which is one of the salient predictions of this model.
