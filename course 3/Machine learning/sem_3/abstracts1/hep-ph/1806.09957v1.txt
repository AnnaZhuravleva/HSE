We propose a predictively radiative neutrino mass model with gauged $U(1)_{B-2L_{\ell_2}-L_{\ell_1}}$ symmetry in which we successfully realize two-zero textures of neutrino mass matrix depending on charge assignment for leptons and the singlet scalar fields. Then some correlations of neutrino parameters are shown where we take mass structure given by $(\ell_2, \ell_1) = (\mu, \tau)$ or $(\mu, e)$ as a representative case. Furthermore we discuss phenomenology of the model such as lepton flavor violations, collider physics, and dark matter candidate.
