We point out the importance of the decay channels $A\to Zh$ and $H\to VV$ in the wrong-sign limit of the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) of type II. They can be the dominant decay modes at moderate values of $\tan\beta$, even if the (pseudo)scalar mass is above the threshold where the decay into a pair of top quarks is kinematically open. Accordingly, large cross sections $pp\to A\to Zh$ and $pp\to H\to VV$ are obtained and currently probed by the LHC experiments, yielding conclusive statements about the remaining parameter space of the wrong-sign limit. In addition, mild excesses - as recently found in the ATLAS analysis $b\bar b \to A\to Zh$ - could be explained. The wrong-sign limit makes other important testable predictions for the light Higgs boson couplings.
