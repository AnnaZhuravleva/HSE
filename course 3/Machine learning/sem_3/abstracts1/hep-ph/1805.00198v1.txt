Numerical data of the SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f=8$ fermions in the fundamental representation suggest the existence of a large-mass regime, where the fermion mass is not small relative to the confinement scale, but nevertheless the dilaton-pion low-energy theory is applicable thanks to the parametric proximity of the conformal window. In this regime, the leading hyperscaling relations are similar to those of a mass-deformed conformal theory, so that distinguishing infrared conformality from confinement requires the study of subleading effects. Assuming that the $N_f=8$ theory confines, we estimate how light the fermion mass should be to enter the small-mass regime, where the pions become much lighter than the dilatonic scalar meson.
