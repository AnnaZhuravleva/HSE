Asymptotically safe extensions of the Standard Model have been searched for by adding vector-like fermions charged under the Standard Model gauge group and having Yukawa-like interactions with new scalar fields. Here we study the corresponding renormalization group beta functions to next and next-to-next to leading order in the perturbative expansion, varying the number of extra fermions and the representations they carry. We test the fixed points of the beta functions against various criteria of perturbativity to single out those that are potentially viable. We show that all the candidate ultraviolet fixed points are unphysical for these models: either they are unstable under radiative corrections, or they cannot be matched to the Standard Model at low energies.
