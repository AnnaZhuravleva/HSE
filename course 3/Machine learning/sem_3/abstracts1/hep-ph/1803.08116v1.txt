In this work we consider the Linear BESS model at the LHC. This model can be seen as an adequate benchmark for exploring the phenomenological consequences of a composite Higgs sector since its particle content is the one we would expect in a realistic low energy description of modern (Technicolor inspired) dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scenarios. Additionally, the model exhibits the property of decoupling, producing a good ultraviolet behavior. We focus on the limits on the masses of the new heavy vector particles imposed by direct resonance searches, recent measurements of the decay of the Higgs boson into two photons and the electroweak precision tests. We found that the model is capable to accommodate the existing experimental constrains provided that the spin-1 resonances are heavier than 3.4 TeV.
