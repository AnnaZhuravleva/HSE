We apply the covariant derivative expansion of the Coleman-Weinberg potential to the sfermion sector in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, matching it to the relevant dimension-6 operators in the standard model effective field theory at one-loop level. Emphasis is paid to nondegenerate large soft supersymmetry breaking mass squares, and the most general analytical Wilson coefficients are obtained for all pure bosonic dimension-6 operators. In addition to the non-logarithmic contributions, they generally have another logarithmic contributions. Various numerical results are shown, in particular the constraints in the large $X_t$ branch reproducing the $125$~GeV Higgs mass can be pushed to high values to almost completely probe the low stop mass region at the future FCC-ee experiment, even given the Higgs mass calculation uncertainty.
