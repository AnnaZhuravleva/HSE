Leptoquarks have been suggested to solve a variety of discrepancies between the expected and observed phenomenon. In this paper, we show that the scalar doublet Leptoquark with Hypercharge 7/6 can simultaneously explain the recent measurement of $R_{K}$, $R_{K^*}$, the excess in anomalous magnetic moment of muon, and the observed excess in IceCube HESE data. For appropriate choice of couplings, the flavor anomalies are generated at one-loop level and IceCube data is explained via resonant production of the Leptoquark. Several constraints from LHC searches are imposed on the model parameter space.
