We develop an effective-field-theory (EFT) framework to analyze the spectra emerging from lattice simulations of a large class of confining gauge theories. Simulations of these theories, for which the light-fermion count is not far below the critical value for transition to infrared conformal behavior, have indicated the presence of a remarkably light singlet scalar particle. We incorporate this particle by including a scalar field in the EFT along with the Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGB's), and discuss the application of this EFT to lattice data. We highlight the feature that data on the NGB's alone can tightly restrict the form of the scalar interactions. As an example, we apply the framework to lattice data for an SU(3) gauge theory with eight fermion flavors, concluding that the EFT can describe the data well.
