The two messenger results of the GeV gamma-ray excess at the Galactic center and a probable antiproton excess in the recent AMS-02 observation suggest that these two anomalies may be owing to the same origin --- the dark matter (DM) annihilation into $b \bar b$, while these results seem in tension with the dwarf spheroidal galaxy observations. To give a compatible explanation about it, we consider the pseudoscalar DM particles $S_d^+ S_d^-$ annihilating via $S_d^+ S_d^- \rightarrow S_d^0 S_d^0$, with the process mediated by a new scalar $\phi$ and $S_d^0$ quickly decaying into $b \bar{b}$. For the particles $S_d^+$, $S_d^-$ and $S_d^0$ in a triplet with degenerate masses, the annihilation cross section of DM today is linearly dependent on the relative velocity $v_r$, and thus constraints from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies are relaxed. The parameter spaces are derived with corresponding constraints. Though traces from the new sector seem challenging to be disclosed at collider and in DM direct detections, the indirect search of the gamma-ray line from the $S_d^0$'s decay has the potential to shed light on DM annihilations, with the energy of the gamma-ray line $\sim m_{S_d^0} /2$, i.e. about 50$-$75 GeV.
