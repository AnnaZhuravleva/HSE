We study the transport coefficients from the QCD Kondo effect in quark matter which contains heavy quarks as impurity particles. We estimate the coupling constant of the interaction between a light quark and a heavy quark at finite density and temperature by using the renormalization group equation up to two-loop order. We also estimate the coupling constant at zero temperature by using the mean-field approximation as non-perturbative treatment. To calculate the transport coefficients, we use the relativistic Boltzmann equation and apply the relaxation time approximation. We calculate the electric resistivity from the relativistic kinetic theory, and the viscosities from the relativistic hydrodynamics. We find that the electric resistivity is enhanced and the shear viscosity is suppressed due to the QCD Kondo effect at low temperature.
