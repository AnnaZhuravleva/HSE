Chiral effects exhibit peculiar universality in idealized theoretical limits. However, they are known to be infrared sensitive and get modified in more realistic settings. In this work, we study how the corresponding conductivities vary with the constituent mass. We concentrate on a pionic realization of chiral effects which provides a better control over infrared properties of the theory. The pionic medium is considered at finite vector and axial isospin chemical potentials in the presence of an external magnetic field. This system supports electric and axial isospin currents along the magnetic field which correspond to chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects. We show that these currents are sensitive to the finite mass of the constituents, but the conductivities follow a simple scaling with the corresponding charge densities as one would expect for polarization effects. It is argued that this relation can capture the dependence of chiral effects on other infrared parameters. Finally, we briefly comment on the realization of the 't Hooft matching condition in pionic media at finite densities.
