LHCb has recently reported more than $2\sigma$ deviation from the Standard Model prediction in the observable $R_{J/\psi}$. We study this anomaly in the framework of a vector leptoquark along with other lepton flavor universality violating measurements which include $R_{K^{(*)}}$, and $R_{D^{(*)}}$. We show that a chiral vector leptoquark can explain all the aforementioned anomalies consistently while also respecting other experimental constraints.
