We show that axion dark matter (DM) may be detectable through narrow radio lines emitted from neutron stars. The neutron star magnetosphere hosts a strong magnetic field and a plasma frequency that increases towards the neutron star surface. As the axions pass through the magnetosphere, they can resonantly convert into radio photons in a narrow region around the radius at which the plasma frequency equals the axion mass. The bandwidth of the signal is set by the small DM velocity dispersion far away from the neutron star. We solve the axion-photon mixing equations, including a full treatment of the magnetized plasma and associated anisotropic dielectric tensor, to obtain the conversion probability. We discuss possible neutron-star targets and how they may probe the QCD axion parameter space in the mass range of ~0.2-40 $\mu$eV.
