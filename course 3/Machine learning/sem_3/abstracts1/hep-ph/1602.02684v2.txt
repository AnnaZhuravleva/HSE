We have shown a new scenario of successful leptogenesis with one $L$ violating coupling and a relative Majorana phase playing the role of $CP$ violation. This is in contrast to the usual consideration of diagram with at least two $L$ violating couplings. We have considered $R$-parity violating Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for leptogenesis at TeV scale. This scenario is also consistent with generating appropriate light neutrino mass with the same $L$ violating coupling.
