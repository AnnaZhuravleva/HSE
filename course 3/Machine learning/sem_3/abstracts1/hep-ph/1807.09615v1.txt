The JETSCAPE collaboration announced the first publice release candidate of its framework and Monte Carlo event generator at this conference, providing a unified interface and a comprehensive suite of model implementations for all stages of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. This release focuses on validation of the framework and the $pp$ reference. A full manual is under development. In the mean-time, these proceedings will provide a guide for installation and simulation runs in lieu of the more traditional summary of the presentation.
