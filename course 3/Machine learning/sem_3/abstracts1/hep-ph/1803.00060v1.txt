We study the framework of $U(1)_X$ models with kinetic mixing and/or mass mixing terms. We give general and exact analytic formulas and derive limits on a variety of $U(1)_X$ models that induce new physics contributions to neutrino-electron scattering, taking into account interference between the new physics and Standard Model contributions. Data from TEXONO, CHARM-II and GEMMA are analyzed and shown to be complementary to each other to provide the most restrictive bounds on masses of the new vector bosons. In particular, we demonstrate the validity of our results to dark photon-like as well as light $Z^\prime$ models.
