We show that the $ZWW$ production process may give complementary informations about scale dependent heavy particle masses and possible final state interactions as compared to previously studied top quark production processes. We illustrate the $p_Z$ distribution of the rate of longitudinal $Z_L$ component showing its sensitivity to these effects which may arise from heavy particle substructure or a dark matter (DM) environment.
