We propose a model with two Higgs doublet where quark and charged-lepton masses in the first and second families are induced at one-loop level, and neutrino masses are induced at the two-loop level. In our model we introduce an extra $U(1)_R$ gauge symmetry that plays a crucial role in achieving desired terms in no conflict with anomaly cancellation. We show the mechanism to generate fermion masses, the resultant mass matrices and Yukawa interactions in mass eigenstates, and discuss several interesting phenomenologies such as muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment and dark matter candidate that are arisen from this model.
