In this paper we use numerical simulations to calculate the particle yields. We demonstrate that in the model of local particle creation the deviation from the pure exponential distribution is natural even in equilibrium, and an approximate Tsallis-Pareto-like distribution function can be well fitted to the calculated yields, in accordance with the experimental observations. We present numerical simulations in classical $\Phi^4$ model as well as in the SU(3) quantum Yang-Mills theory to clarify this issue.
