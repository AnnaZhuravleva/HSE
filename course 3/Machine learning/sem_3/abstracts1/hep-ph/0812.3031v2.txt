Neutrino and antineutrino fluxes from a core-collapse galactic supernova are studied, within a representative three-flavor scenario with inverted mass hierarchy and tiny 1-3 mixing. The initial flavor evolution is dominated by collective self-interaction effects, which are computed in a full three-family framework along an averaged radial trajectory. During the whole time span considered (t=1-20 s), neutrino and antineutrino spectral splits emerge as dominant features in the energy domain for the final, observable fluxes. Some minor or unobservable three-family features (e.g., related to the muonic-tauonic flavor sector) are also discussed for completeness. The main results can be useful for SN event rate simulations in specific detectors.
