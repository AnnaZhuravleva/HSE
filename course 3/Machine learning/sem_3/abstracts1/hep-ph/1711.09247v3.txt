The evolution of the solar neutrino flux which is described by the wave function $\Psi^T=(\nu_{eL},\nu_{XL}, \overline{\nu}_{eL}, \overline{\nu}_{XL})$ is examined. Our treatment of the problem holds for any standard model (SM) extensions possessing nonzero dipole magnetic and anapole moments. When the solar neutrino flux moves through the solar flare (SF) region in the preflare period, then it undergoes the additional (compared with the SM) resonance conversions. As a result, the weakening the electron neutrinos flux takes place. On the other hand, existence of the additional resonances lead to appearance of the $\overline{\nu}_{eL}$ and $\overline{\nu}_{XL}$ neutrinos that could be detected by the terrestrial detectors.   The hypothesis of the $\nu_e$-induced $\beta$-decays is also discussed. According to it, before the large SF, decreasing the $\beta$-decay rate for some elements takes place. The possible influence of the electron antineutrino flux produced in the superflares on the regime of the hypothetical georeactor is considered.
