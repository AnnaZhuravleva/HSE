Constraints on couplings of several Beyond Standard Model Physics scenarios, mediated by massive intermediate particles including (1) Extra Z-prime, (2) New Light Spin-1 Boson, and (3) Charged Higgs Boson, are placed via neutrino-electron scattering channel to test Standard Model at low energy-momentum transfer regime. Data on $\bar{\nu}_{e}-e$ and $\nu_{e}-e$ scattering from the TEXONO and LSND Experiments, respectively, are used. Upper bounds to coupling constants of Flavor Conserving and Flavor Violating New Light Spin-1 Boson and Charged Higgs Boson with respect to different mediator masses are determined. The relevant parameter spaces are extended by allowing light mediators. New lower mass limits for extra Z-prime gauge boson models are also placed.
