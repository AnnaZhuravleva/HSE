The calculation of hadronic polarizability contribution of the nucleus to hyperfine structure of muonic hydrogen and helium is carried out within the unitary isobar model and experimental data on the polarized structure functions of deep inelastic lepton-proton and lepton-deuteron scattering. The calculation of virtual absorption cross sections of transversely and longitudinally polarized photons by nucleons in the resonance region is performed in the framework of the program MAID.
