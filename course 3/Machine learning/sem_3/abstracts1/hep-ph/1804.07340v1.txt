We argue that dark matter in the form of macroscopically large nuggets of standard model quarks and antiquarks can help to alleviate the tension between standard model cosmology and the recent EDGES observation of a stronger than anticipated 21 cm absorption feature. The effect occurs as a result of the thermal emission from quark nugget dark matter at early times and at energies well below the peak of the CMB. Similar radiation at early times may also contribute a fraction of the GHz range excess observed by ARCADE2.
