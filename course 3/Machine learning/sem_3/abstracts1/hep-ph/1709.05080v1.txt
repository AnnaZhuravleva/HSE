Besides the conventional strong and electromagnetic decay modes, the $J/{\psi}$ particle can also decay via the weak interaction in the standard model. In this paper, nonleptonic $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s,d}{\pi}$, $D_{s,d}K$ weak decays, corresponding to the externally emitted virtual $W$ boson process, are investigated with the perturbative QCD approach. It is found that branching ratio for the Cabibbo-favored $J/{\psi}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}{\pi}$ decay can reach up to ${\cal O}(10^{-10})$, which might be potentially measurable at the future high-luminosity experiments.
