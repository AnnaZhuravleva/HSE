Phenomenological aspects of simple dark matter models are studied. We discuss ways to discriminate the dark matter models in future experiments. We find that the measurements of the branching fraction of the Higgs boson into two photons and the electric dipole moment of the electron as well as the direct detection experiments are quite useful in discriminating particle models of dark matter. We also discuss the prospects of finding new particles in dark sector at the LHC/ILC.
