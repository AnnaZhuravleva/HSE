In the light of recent experimental results from IceCube, LHC searches for scalar leptoquark, and the flavor anomalies $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, we analyze two scalar leptoquark models with hypercharge $Y=1/6$ and $Y=7/6$. We consider the 53 HESE events from IceCube and perform a statistical analysis, taking into account both the Standard Model and leptoquark contribution together. The lighter leptoquark states that are in agreement with IceCube are strongly constrained from LHC di-lepton+dijet search. Heavier leptoquarks in the TeV mass range are in agreement both with IceCube and LHC. We furthermore show that leptoquark that explains the $B$-physics anomalies and does not have any coupling with third generation of quarks and leptons, can be strongly constrained.
