We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo global analysis of neutrino parameters using both cosmological and experimental data. Results are presented for the combination of all presently available data from oscillation experiments, cosmology, and neutrinoless double beta decay. In addition we explicitly study the interplay between cosmological, tritium decay and neutrinoless double beta decay data in determining the neutrino mass parameters. We furthermore discuss how the inference of non-neutrino cosmological parameters can benefit from future neutrino mass experiments such as the KATRIN tritium decay experiment or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.
