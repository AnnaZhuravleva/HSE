We propose a one-loop induced neutrino mass model with hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, in which we successfully involve a bosonic dark matter (DM) candidate propagating inside a loop diagram in neutrino mass generation to explain the $e^+e^-$ excess recently reported by the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) experiment. In our scenario dark matter annihilates into four leptons through $Z'$ boson as DM DM $\to Z' Z' (Z' \to \ell^+ \ell^-)$ and $Z'$ decays into leptons via one-loop effect. We then investigate branching ratios of $Z'$ taking into account lepton flavor violations and neutrino oscillation data.
