In the framework of an extended bag model the magnetic moments, M1 transition moments, and decay widths of all ground-state heavy hadrons are calculated. For the heavy baryons containing three quarks of different flavors the effect of hyperfine mixing of the states is taken into account. The additional care is taken to get more accurate theoretical estimates for the mass splittings of heavy hadrons. The use of such improved values enables one to provide more accurate predictions for the decay widths. These values of the hyperfine splittings between baryons may be also useful for the further experimental searches of new heavy hadrons. For instance, we predict $M(\Xi_{cc}^{*})=3695\pm5$ MeV. The agreement of our results for the M1 decay rates with available experimental data is good. We also present a wide comparison of the predictions obtained in our work with the results obtained using various other approaches.
