We study $\eta_{\rm c}$- and $J/\psi$-isoscalar meson bound states in the hadro-charmonium picture. In the hadro-charmonium, the four $q\bar q c \bar c$ quarks are arranged in terms of a compact charm-anticharm pair, $c \bar c$, embedded in light hadronic matter, $q \bar q$, with $q = u$, $d$ or $s$. The interaction between the charmonium core and the light matter can be written in terms of the multipole expansion in QCD, with the leading term being the $E1$ interaction with chromo-electric field ${\bf E}^a$. The spectrum of $\eta_{\rm c}$- and $J/\psi$-isoscalar meson bound states is calculated and the results compared with the existing experimental data.
