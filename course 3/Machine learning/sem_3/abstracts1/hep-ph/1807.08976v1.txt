Charge exchange process $\pi^-p\to\pi^0n$ and elastic scatterings $\pi^\pm p\to \pi^\pm p$ are investigated within the Regge framework where the relativistic Born amplitude is reggeized for the $t$-channel meson exchange. % Charge exchange cross section is featured by the single $\rho$ exchange. Additional correction by Regge cuts, $\rho$-$f_2$ and $\rho$-Pomeron, agree with differential cross sections and new trajectory for the $\rho'(1450)$ exchange is attempted to reproduce polarization data. % For the description of elastic scattering data up to pion momentum $P_{\rm Lab}\approx 250$ GeV/c, Pomeron exchange of the Donnachie-Landshoff type is newly constructed and applied in this work. Elastic cross section data are well reproduced with the dominance of $f_2-$Pomeron exchanges in intermediate and high energies.
