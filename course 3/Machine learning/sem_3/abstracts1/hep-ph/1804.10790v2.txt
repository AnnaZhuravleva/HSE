In this paper, the b quark pair production events are analyzed as a source of neutral Higgs bosons of the two Higgs doublet model type I at linear colliders. The production mechanism is e+e- -> Z/gamma -> HA -> bbbb assuming a fully hadronic final state. The analysis aim is to identify both scalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons in different benchmark points accommodating moderate boson masses. Due to pair production of Higgs bosons, the analysis is most suitable for a linear collider operating at sqrt(s) = 1 TeV. Results show that in selected benchmark points, signal peaks are observable in the b-jet pair invariant mass distributions at integrated luminosity of 500 fb-1.
