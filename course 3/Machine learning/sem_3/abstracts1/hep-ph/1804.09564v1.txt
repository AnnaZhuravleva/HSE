In these proceedings, we investigate non-perturbative models for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) motivated by the behavior of the Landau-gauge lattice gluon propagator with the purpose of testing their validity in the perturbative regime of strong interactions and to explore their behavior in the infrared region. In particular, we discuss the potentials between heavy quarks and antiquarks, since this observable might reveal the appearance of confining properties in these non-perturbative models through a linear growth at large and intermediate distances.
