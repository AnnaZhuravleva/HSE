It is believed that there are extra fundamental gauge symmetries beyond these described by the Standard Model of particle physics. The scale of these new gauge symmetries are usually too high to be reachable by particle colliders. Considering that the phase transition (PT) relating to the spontaneous breaking of new gauge symmetries to the electroweak symmetry might be strongly first order, we propose in this paper taking the stochastic gravitational waves (GW) arising from this phase transition as an indirect way of detecting these new fundamental gauge symmetries. As an illustration, we explore the possibility of detecting the stochastic GW generated from the PT of $\mathbf{ B-L}$ in the space-based interferometer detectors. Out study shows that the GW energy spectrum is reachable by the LISA, BBO, Taiji and DECIGO experiments only for the case where the spontaneous breaking of $\mathbf{B-L}$ is triggered by at least two electroweak singlet scalars.
