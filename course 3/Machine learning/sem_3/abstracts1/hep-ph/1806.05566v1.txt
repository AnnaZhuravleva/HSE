We present results of new field-theoretic simulation of cosmological axion strings, which are eight times longer than previous ones. We have upgraded our simulation of physical strings in Hiramatsu et al. (2011) in terms of the number of grids as well as the suite of analysis methods. These improvements enable us to monitor a variety of quantities characterizing the dynamics of the physical string network for the longest term ever. Our extended simulations have revealed that global strings do not evolve according to the scaling solution but its scaling parameter, or the number of long strings per horizon, increases logarithmically in time. In addition, we have also found that the scaling parameter shows nontrivial dependence on the breaking scale of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry.
