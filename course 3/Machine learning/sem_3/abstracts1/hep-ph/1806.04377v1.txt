In order to obtain the equation of state and construct hybrid stars, we calculate the thermodynamic potential in the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with tensor-type four-point interaction between quarks. In addition, we impose the beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions on the system. We show that the tensor condensate appears at large chemical potential, however, it is difficult to hold hybrid stars with two-solar mass by using the equation of state with the tensor-interaction. However, if we make the coupling constant of the tensor-interaction large enough, we can obtain the hybrid star and quark star with two-solar mass.
