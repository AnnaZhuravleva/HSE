We present a microscopic model for collective effects in high multiplicity proton--proton collisions, where multiple partonic subcollisions give rise to a dense system of strings. From lattice calculations we know that QCD strings are transversely extended, and we argue that this should result in a transverse pressure and expansion, similar to the flow in a deconfined plasma. The model is implemented in the PYTHIA8 Monte Carlo event generator, and we find that it can qualitatively reproduce the long range azimuthal correlations forming a near-side ridge in high multiplicity proton--proton events at LHC energies.
