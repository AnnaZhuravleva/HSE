A perturbative expansion for hadrons and soft QCD processes is formulated. Bound states must be expanded around initial states that are non-polynomial in the coupling. Atomic physics suggests to use states which are bound by the classical field of their constituents. Including the classical field of the $in$ and $out$ states allows to calculate bound state $S$-matrix elements. Quark states are bound by an $O(\alpha_s^0)$ classical gluon field $A^0_a$ which is characterized by a universal scale $\Lambda$. It confines color in $q\bar q$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons, giving relativistic dynamics with the characteristics of dual models. Massless bound states allow to include a $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ condensate in the perturbative vacuum, thus breaking chiral symmetry spontaneously.
