We suggest a clockwork mechanism for a Higgs inflation with the non-minimal coupling term \xi \phi^2R. The seemingly unnatural ratio of parameters, \lambda/\xi^2 ~ 10^(-10) of the self quartic coupling of the inflaton, \lambda, and the non-minimal coupling, \xi, is understood by exponential suppression of {\lambda} by the clockwork mechanism, instead of a large non-minimal coupling. The portal interaction between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM) Higgs doublet is introduced as a source of reheating and the inflaton mass. Successful realization of inflation requires that the inflaton gets a mass around (sub) GeV scale, which would lead to observable consequences depending on reheating process and its lifetime.
