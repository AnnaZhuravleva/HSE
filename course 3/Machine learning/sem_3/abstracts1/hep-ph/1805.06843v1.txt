We extend our previous study on the decay behavior of $P_c$ hadronic molecules to their strange and beauty partners. While $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ locate just below the $\bar D\Sigma_c^*$ and $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ thresholds, respectively, their proposed strange partners $N(1875)$ and $N(2080)$ sit just below the $K\Sigma^*$ and $K^*\Sigma$ thresholds, respectively. Using the effective Lagrangian approach as the same as for the study of $P_c$ hadronic molecular states and with the couplings determined by the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry, the decay patterns of $N(1875)$ and $N(2080)$ are obtained assuming them to be the $S$-wave $K\Sigma^*$ and $K^*\Sigma$ molecules, respectively. It is found that the measured decay properties of $N(1875)$ and $N(2080)$ are reproduced well. Our results suggest that both $N(1875)$ and $N(2080)$ can be ascribed as the hadronic molecular pentaquark states in the hidden strangeness sector with quantum number $I(J^P)=1/2({3/2}^-)$. Further checks on their hadronic molecule nature by various experiments are proposed. With the same approach, we also give our predictions for the decay behavior of the possible beauty partners of the $P_c$ hadronic molecular states. The $B^*\Lambda_b$ is found to be the largest decay mode for both $B\Sigma_b^*$ and $B^*\Sigma_b$ hadronic molecules, hence can be used to look for the hidden beauty pentaquark states in forthcoming experiments.
