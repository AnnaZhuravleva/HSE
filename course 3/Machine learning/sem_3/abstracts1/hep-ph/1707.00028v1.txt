New machine learning based algorithms have been developed and tested for Monte Carlo integration based on generative Boosted Decision Trees and Deep Neural Networks. Both of these algorithms exhibit substantial improvements compared to existing algorithms for non-factorizable integrands in terms of the achievable integration precision for a given number of target function evaluations. Large scale Monte Carlo generation of complex collider physics processes with improved efficiency can be achieved by implementing these algorithms into commonly used matrix element Monte Carlo generators once their robustness is demonstrated and performance validated for the relevant classes of matrix elements.
