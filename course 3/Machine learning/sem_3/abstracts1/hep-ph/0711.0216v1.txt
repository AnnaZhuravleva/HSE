A histogram display of the solar neutrino capture-rate measurements made by the GALLEX experiment appears to be bimodal, but that of the follow-on GNO experiment does not. To assess the significance of these results, we introduce a "bimodality index" based on the probability-transform procedure. This confirms that the GALLEX measurements are indeed bimodal (at the 99.98 percent confidence level), and that the GNO measurements are not. Tracking the bimodality index as a function of time shows that the strongest contribution to bimodality comes from runs 42 to 62, i.e. from the time interval 1995.1 to 1996.9. The bimodality index for the first half (runs 1 through 33) is 2.56, whereas that for the second half (runs 33 through 65) is 7.05. Power-spectrum analysis shows a similar distinction: the peaks in the power spectrum formed from the second half are stronger than those in the power spectrum formed from the first half, suggesting that bimodality and rotational modulation are related.
