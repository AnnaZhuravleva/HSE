We revisit a scenario with an enhanced top yukawa coupling in vector-like quark (VLQ) models, where the top yukawa coupling is larger than the standard model value and the lightest VLQ has a negative yukawa coupling. We find that the parameter space satisfying the LHC bounds of the Higgs signal strengths consistently with the precision measurements is rather wide. Because the Lagrangian parameters of the yukawa couplings are large, such scenario can be realized in some strongly interacting theories. It also turns out that there is a noticeable relation between the contributions of the triangle and box diagrams in the $gg \to hh$ process by using the lowest order of the $1/M$ expansion where $M$ is the heavy mass running in the loops.
