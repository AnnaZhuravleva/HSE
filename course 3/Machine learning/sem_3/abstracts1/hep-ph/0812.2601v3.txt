Recently, deeper understanding of QCD emerges from the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence. New results include the properties of quark-gluon plasma and the confinement/deconfinement phase transition, which are both very important for the scenario of the QCD phase transition in the early universe. In this paper, we study some aspects of how the new results may affect the old calculations of the cosmological QCD phase transition, which are mainly based on the studies of perturbative QCD, lattice QCD and the MIT bag model.
