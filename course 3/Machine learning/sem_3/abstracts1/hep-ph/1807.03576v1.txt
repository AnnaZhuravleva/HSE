The production of a single top quark in the $t$-channel and its subsequent decay is studied at NLO accuracy in QCD, augmented with the relevant dimension-6 effective operators from the Standard Model Effective Theory. We examine various kinematic and angular distributions for proton-proton collisions at the LHC at 13 TeV, in order to assess the sensitivity to these operators, both with and without the top quark narrow width approximation. Our results will be helpful when devising strategies to establish bounds on their coefficients, including the amount of CP violation of the weak dipole operator.
