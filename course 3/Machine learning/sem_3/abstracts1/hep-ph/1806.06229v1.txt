We study the non-Hermitian extension of the Lagrangian of the Standard Model extended by singlet right-handed heavy neutrinos. The neutrino mass eigenvalues are calculated for three generation case. Using experimental data available for neutrino mass observables, the non-Hermitian parameters are constrained. New contributions to leptogenesis are analyzed. While allowing for a low scale seesaw it is identified that branching ratio close to the experimental limit for lepton flavor violation is achievable in the context of Type-I seesaw mechanism.
