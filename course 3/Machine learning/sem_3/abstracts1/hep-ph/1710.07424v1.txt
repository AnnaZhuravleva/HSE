We discuss the possibility that the X(3872) can be a $D\bar{D}^*$ molecular bound state in the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach in the ladder and instantaneous approximations. We show that the $D\bar{D}^*$ bound state with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ exists. We also calculate the decay width of $X(3872) \rightarrow \gamma J/\psi$ channel and compare our result with those from previous calculations.
