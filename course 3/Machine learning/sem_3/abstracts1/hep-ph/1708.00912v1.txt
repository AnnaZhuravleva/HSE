I present a determination of the photon PDF from a fit to the recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan lepton-pair production at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. This analysis is based on the {\tt xFitter} framework interfaced to the {\tt APFEL} program, that accounts for NLO QED effects, and to the {\tt aMCfast} code to account for the photon-initiated contributions within {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}. The result is compared with other recent determinations of the photon PDF finding a general good agreement.
