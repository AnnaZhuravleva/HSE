We study the consequences of the gravitino decay into dark matter. We suppose that the lightest neutralino is the main component of dark matter. In our framework gravitino is heavy enough to decay before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis starts. We consider a model coming from a five dimensional supergravity compactified on $S^1/Z_2$ with gravity in the bulk and matter localized on tensionless branes at the orbifold fixed points. We require that the dark matter, which is produced thermally and in the decay of Kaluza-Klein modes of gravitino, has an abundance compatible with observation. We deduce from our model that there are curves of constraints between the size of the extra-dimension and the reheating temperature of the universe after inflation.
