We quantify the magnitude of the parton energy loss in jets in lead-lead collisions at the LHC. We extract the effective color factor characterizing the difference between the in-medium radiation of quark-initiated jets and gluon-initiated jets from the data. Then, we examine the energy loss of prompt charmonia and we point to a remarkable similarity between the quenching of light-quark-initiated jets and the prompt charmonia suppression. Finally, we discuss possible sources of this similarity.
