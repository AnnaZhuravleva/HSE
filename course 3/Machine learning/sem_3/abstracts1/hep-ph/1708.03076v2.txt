The smallness of neutrino mass, the strong CP problem, and the existence of dark matter are explained in an economical way. The neutrino mass is generated by the colored version of a radiative seesaw mechanism by using color adjoint mediators. The Majorana mass term of the adjoint fermion, which carries lepton number U(1)_L, is induced by its spontaneous breaking, resulting in a Majoron which doubles as the QCD (quantum chromodynamics) axion, thereby solving the strong CP problem. The breaking of U(1)_L sets simultaneously the seesaw scale for neutrino mass and the Peccei-Quinn breaking scale. This axion is a good candidate for dark matter as usually assumed.
