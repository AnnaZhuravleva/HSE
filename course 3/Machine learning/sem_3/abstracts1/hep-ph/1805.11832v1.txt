In this article, we will present a systematic analysis of transverse momentum spectra of the strange hadron in different multiplicity events produced in pp collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, pPb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and PbPb collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The differential freeze out scenario of strange hadron $K^{0}_{s}$ assumed while analyzing the data using a Tsallis distribution which is modified to include transverse flow. The $p_{T}$ distributions of strange hadron in different systems are characterized in terms of the parameters namely, Tsallis temperature ($T$), power ($n$) and average transverse flow velocity ($\beta$).
