Sparticle landscapes in mSUGRA, in SUGRA models with nonuniversalities (NUSUGRA), and in D brane models are analyzed. The analysis exhibits the existence of Higgs Mass Patterns (HPs) (for $\mu>0$) where the CP odd Higgs could be the next heavier particle beyond the LSP and sometimes even lighter than the LSP. It is shown that the Higgs production cross sections from the HPs are typically the largest enhancing the prospects for their detection at the LHC. Indeed it is seen that the recent Higgs production limits from CDF/D\O\ are beginning to put constraints on the HPs. It is also seen that the $B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ limits constrain the HPs more stringently. Predictions of the Higgs production cross sections for these patterns at the LHC are made. We compute the neutralino-proton cross sections $\sigma (\chi p)$ for dark matter experiments and show that the largest $\sigma (\chi p)$ also arise from the HPs and further that the HPs and some of the other patterns are beginning to be constrained by the most recent data from CDMS and from Xenon10 experiments. Finally, it is shown that the prospects are bright for the discovery of dark matter with $\sigma(\chi p)$ in the range $10^{-44\pm .5}$cm$^2$ due to a "Wall" consisting of a copious number of parameter points in the Chargino Patterns (CPs) where the chargino is the NLSP. The Wall, which appears in all models considered (mSUGRA, NUSUGRA and D branes) and runs up to about a TeV in LSP mass, significantly enhances the chances for the observation of dark matter by SuperCDMS, ZEPLIN-MAX, or LUX experiments which are expected to achieve a sensitivity of $10^{-45}$ cm$^2$ or more.
