We evaluate nonperturbatively the quark quasidistribution amplitude and the valence quark quasidistribution function of the pion in the framework of chiral quark models, namely the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and the Spectral Quark Model. We arrive at simple analytic expressions, where the nonperturbative dependence on the longitudinal momentum of the pion can be explicitly assessed. The model results for the quark quasidistribution amplitude of the pion compare favorably to the data obtained from the Euclidean lattice simulations. The quark distribution amplitude, arising in the limit of infinite longitudinal momentum of the pion, agrees, after suitable QCD evolution, to the recent data extracted from Euclidean lattices, as well as to the old data from transverse lattice simulations.
