We consider pair-production of electroweakinos promptly decaying to light gravitinos in general gauge mediation scenarios within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. Typically the presence of photons and missing transverse momentum is the key signature for this kind of scenarios. We highlight where LHC analyses which have originally been designed to probe different scenarios provide complementary constraints with respect to the dedicated searches and we present the constraints on the parameter space.
