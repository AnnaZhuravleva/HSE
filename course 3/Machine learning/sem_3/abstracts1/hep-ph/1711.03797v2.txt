Exclusive light meson production processes possible to be measured at RHIC and LHC accelerators are briefly described. This includes Pomeron and photon induced continuum of pions and kaons as well as $f_0$ and $\rho^0$ resonant production. Next, GenEx, a new Monte Carlo generator recently developed in Cracow, is presented. Its purpose is to generate resonant and non-resonant pion and kaon production and diffractive Bremsstrahlung. Its future development will take into account spin (polarization) effects and simulate corrections due to absorption and re-scattering.
