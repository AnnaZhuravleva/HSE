In this article a recipe for CP-violation will be demonstrated step by step. The first step is an analyzation of the general pattern of Yukawa couplings between quarks and the Higgs doublet. That pattern is substentially simplified down to a manageable level with an assumption of hermiticity of the quark mass matrix. Thus, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are analytically derived and the unitary transformation thus derived depends only on two parameters. That leads to complex CKM elements which indicate the breaking of CP symmetry. However, there are some imperfections in the derived CKM elements which make their fittings with empirical values as poor as ${\bf O}(10^{-2})$. The second step is to phenomenologcally employ some fine-tunning parameters which may fit all amplitudes of CKM elements as good as ${\bf O}(10^{-4})$. The third step is a numerical fitting of amplitudes of the CKM elements through which their phases are predicted. Thus, a way to break CP symmetry in electro-weak interactions is achieved.
