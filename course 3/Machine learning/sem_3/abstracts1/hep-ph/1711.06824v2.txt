Heavy vector-boson hunting is one of the major analyses undertaken by the experiments carried out at the LHC. I will explore two scenarios which have not been investigated yet by the experimental collaborations. The first scenario consists in searching for Z' bosons, predicted by U(1)' GUT-inspired models, by studying its supersymmetric decays, leading to resonant final states with charged leptons and missing energy. Afterwards, I shall discuss the 331 model and the production of doubly-charged vector bileptons, yielding events with two same-sign lepton pairs at the LHC.
