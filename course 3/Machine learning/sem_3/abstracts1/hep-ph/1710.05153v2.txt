For the first time, the pair production of the heavy charged gauge bosons, known as $W'$ bosons is considered, when both decay to $\tau$ leptons. The reported detailed efficiency of object/event selection by the CMS experiment is used to find the lower limit on the mass of $W'$ boson. Various assumptions for the coupling of the new gauge boson are examined and the results are reported. In the case of a SM-like $W'$ boson, masses below 290 GeV are excluded at 95\% confidence level. The method can be used to constrain the new models with the similar final state.
