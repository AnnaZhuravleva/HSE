We discuss how to apply the Hessian method (i) to predict the impact of a new data set (or sets) on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and their errors, by producing an updated best-fit PDF and error PDF sets, such as the CTEQ-TEA PDFs; (ii) to predict directly the effect of a new data set on the PDF errors of any other set of observables, without the need to recalculate using the new error PDFs; and (iii) to transform the original set into a reduced set of error PDFs which is optimized for a specific set of observables to reproduce the PDF-induced uncertainties to any specified precision. We present a software package, {\tt ePump} (error PDF Updating Method Package), that can be used to update or optimize a set of PDFs, including the best-fit PDF set and Hessian eigenvector pairs of PDF sets (i.e., error PDFs), and to update any other set of observables. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the Large Hadron Collider. Special care is given to discuss the assumptions made and the limitations of this theoretical framework compared to a treatment by the full global analysis program.
