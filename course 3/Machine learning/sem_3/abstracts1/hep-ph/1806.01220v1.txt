To prove the momentum sum rule in the operator product expansion (OPE) in QCD at high energy colliders it is assumed that $<P| {\hat T}^{++}(0)|P>=2(P^+)^2$ where $|P>$ is the momentum eigenstate of the hadron $H$ with momentum $P^\mu$ and ${\hat T}^{++}(0)$ is the $++$ component of the gauge invariant color singlet energy-momentum tensor density operator ${\hat T}^{\mu \nu}(0)$ of all the quarks plus antiquarks plus gluons inside the hadron $H$. However, in this paper, we show that this relation $<P| {\hat T}^{++}(0)|P>=2(P^+)^2$ is correct if ${\hat T}^{\mu \nu}(0)$ is the energy-momentum tensor density operator of the hadron but this relation $<P| {\hat T}^{++}(0)|P>=2(P^+)^2$ is not correct if ${\hat T}^{\mu \nu}(0)$ is the gauge invariant color singlet energy-momentum tensor density operator of all the quarks plus antiquarks plus gluons inside the hadron. Hence we find that the momentum sum rule is violated in the operator product expansion (OPE) in QCD at high energy colliders.
