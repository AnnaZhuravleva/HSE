Under the working hypothesis that the structure of a bound hadron is modified by its interactions with other hadrons, one may expect to see changes in carefully chosen observables. In the light of a recent proposal to measure the axial charge in the strangeness changing beta-decay of a bound Lambda hyperon, we examine the size of the change expected within the quark-meson coupling model. It is predicted to be significant.
