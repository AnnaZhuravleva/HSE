At the future high luminosity electron-positron collider FCC-ee proposed for CERN, the precise measurement of the charge asymmetry in $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ near the Z resonance is of special interest. In particular, such a measurement at $M_Z \pm 3.5$ GeV may provide a very precise measurement of the electromagnetic coupling at the scale $\sim M_Z$, a fundamental constant of the Standard Model. However, this charge asymmetry is plagued by a large trivial contribution from the interference of photon emission from initial state electrons and final state muons. We address the question whether this interference can be reliably calculated and subtracted with the help of a resummed QED calculation.
