In this paper, we propose a simple model for the complex heavy quark potential. The perturbative contributions are induced by one-gluon exchange at short distance which have been computed in the thermal field theory with hard loop approximation. The non-perturbative real and imaginary parts of the potential are described in a unified way in which one considers the long distance behavior between the quark and antiquark as an effective one-dimensional string interaction. Therefore, the non-perturbative terms in this model are assumed to be proportional to the one-dimensional Fourier transform of the resummed gluon propagator at static limit. The proportional coefficient is related to the string tension which is taken to be the same for both real and imaginary part of the potential model. The obtained real part is identical to the real-valued Karsch-Mehr-Satz potential model which may indicate the rationality of the construction for the corresponding imaginary part. In addition, for a quantitative comparison to the current lattice simulations, we introduce an entropy contribution in the model and a reasonably good agreement between the model and lattice data is obtained.
