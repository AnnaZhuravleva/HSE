We study radiative neutrino pair emission in deexcitation process of atoms taking into account coherence effect in a macroscopic target system. In the course of preparing the coherent initial state to enhance the rate, a spatial phase factor is imprinted in the macroscopic target. It is shown that this initial spatial phase changes the kinematics of the radiative neutrino pair emission. We investigate effects of the initial spatial phase in the photon spectrum of the process. It turns out that the initial spatial phase provides us significant improvements in exploring neutrino physics such as the Dirac-Majorana distinction and the cosmic neutrino background.
