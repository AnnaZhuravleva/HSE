We develop a comprehensive dynamical framework, CIBJET, to calculate on an event-by-event basis the dependence of correlations between soft ($p_T<2$ Gev) and hard ($p_T> 10$ Gev) azimuthal flow angle harmonics on the color composition of near-perfect QCD fluids produced in high energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. CIBJET combines consistently predictions of event-by-event VISHNU2+1 viscous hydrodynamic fluid fields with CUJET3.1 predictions of event-by-event jet quenching. We find that recent correlation data favor a temperature dependent color composition including bleached chromo-electric $q(T)+g(T)$ components and an emergent chromo-magnetic degrees of freedom $m(T)$ consistent with non-perturbative lattice QCD information in the confinement/deconfinement temperature range.
