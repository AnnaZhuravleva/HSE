We show the 13 TeV proton-proton collider simulation in a $\nu$-two-Higgs-doublet-model ($\nu$-THDM). The heavy charged Higgs bosons are produced in pairs through the electroweak processes and decay to the light sterile neutrinos. The light sterile neutrino further decays into a jet-like object with a muon in it. This helps us discriminate the signal from the backgrounds with the standard model jets.
