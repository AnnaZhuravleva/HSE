Determination of the Higgs self-coupling in the Standard Model is the primary motivations among all the future lepton colliders. Extending the scalar sector of the Standard Model by a new Higgs doublet with a quadratic Higgs potential gives many new features to the model, and most importantly additional Higgs self-couplings emerge. Measuring these couplings is the only way to reconstruct the shape of the scalar potential. In this study, the numerical analysis of several scattering processes is carried out for the two-Higgs-doublet model to determine all these Higgs self-couplings. These processes are selected among various possible combinations of additional Higgs states. The computation is carried out in the exact alignment limit ($s_{\beta\alpha}=1$). The distribution of the cross-sections is presented regarding the polarization of the incoming beams and up to $\sqrt{s}=3\text{ TeV}$. A strategy for extracting the Higgs self-couplings are considered in 2HDM and at the future lepton colliders.
