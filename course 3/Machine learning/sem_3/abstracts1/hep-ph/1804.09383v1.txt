In this work, we study the possibility to produce a hidden-strange molecular state composed of a nucleon and $\phi$ meson from coupled-channel $\Sigma^* K-N\phi-\Sigma K^*$ interaction. With the help of the effective Lagrangians which coupling constants are determined by the SU(3) symmetry, the $\Sigma^* K-N\phi-\Sigma K^*$ interaction kernel were constructed and inserted into the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation to search for the pole corresponding to the $N\phi$ bound state. No bound state can be found if direct interaction between nucleon and $\phi$ meson is neglected according to the OZI rule. After introduction of a van der Waals force between nucleon and $\phi$ meson, a bound state can be produced from the $N\phi$ interaction with spin parity $3/2^-$, and the coupled-channel effects from the $\Sigma^*K$ and $\Sigma K^*$ channels are found small in our calculation. Our results also suggest that the structure of $N\phi$ bound state in the invariant mass spectrum may not be a standard resonance, of which the experimentist should be mindful in future possible observation at facilities, such as JLab.
