Analyticity constitutes a rigid constraint on hadron scattering amplitudes. This property is used to relate models in different energy regimes. Using meson photoproduction as a benchmark, we show how to test contemporary low energy models directly against high energy data. This method pinpoints deficiencies of the models and treads a path to further improvement. The implementation of this technique enables one to produce more stable and reliable partial waves for future use in hadron spectroscopy and new physics searches.
