We derive new Lorentz Invariance and Equation of Motion Relations between twist-three Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and moments in the parton transverse momentum, $k_T$, of twist-two Generalized Transverse Momentum-Dependent Distributions (GTMDs), as a function of the parton longitudinal momentum fraction $x$. Although GTMDs in principle define the observables for partonic orbital motion, experiments that can unambiguously detect them appear remote at present. The relations presented here provide a solution to this impasse in that, e.g., the orbital angular momentum density is connected to directly measurable twist-three GPDs. Out of 16 possible Equation of Motion relations that can be written in the T-even sector, we focus on three helicity configurations that can be detected analyzing specific spin asymmetries: two correspond to longitudinal proton polarization and are associated with quark orbital angular momentum and spin-orbit correlations; the third, obtained for transverse proton polarization, is a generalization of the relation obeyed by the $g_2$ structure function. We also exhibit an additional relation connecting the off-forward extension of the Sivers function to an off-forward Qiu-Sterman term.
