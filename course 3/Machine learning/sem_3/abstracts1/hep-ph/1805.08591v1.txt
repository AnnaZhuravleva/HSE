ExDiff2.0 is a Monte Carlo event generator for simulation of Exclusive Diffractive processes in proton-proton collisions. The present version includes reactions: elastic scattering $pp\to pp$ at 7, 8, 13, 14~TeV; $pp\to p+R+p$, $R = f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $f_2(1950)$ at 8 and 13~TeV, $f_2(1270)$ at 8~TeV, $f_2(2220)$ at 13~TeV. In the future versions many processes of Central Exclusive Diffractive Production will be added. This version is linked to PYTHIA 8 (to make resonance decays and hadronization) and also to ROOT and HEPMC output via PYTHIA 8 interface. Also some test files of Born distributions for CEDP of two pions are added.
