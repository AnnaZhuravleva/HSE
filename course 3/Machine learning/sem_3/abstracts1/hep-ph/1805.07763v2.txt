We study the sensitivity of certain observables to the anomalous right tensorial coupling in single top production at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=13 \text{ TeV}$. The observables consist of asymmetries constructed from the energy and angles of the decay products of the top quark produced in single top production through $t$-channel. The computation is done at Leading Order (LO) and Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in the strong coupling in the $5$ flavor scheme. We have estimated projected limits on the anomalous coupling, both at the parton level without cuts and at the particle level with cuts. We find that the asymmetries are robust with respect to the higher order QCD corrections and are indeed a very good probe of this anomalous coupling of the top. Hence they can be used as experimental probes of the same.
