We propose a Majorana fermion dark matter in the context of a simple gauge-Higgs Unification (GHU) scenario based on the gauge group $SU(3)$ x $U(1)'$ in 5-dimensional Minkowski space with a compactification of the 5th dimension on $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. The dark matter particle is identified with the lightest mode in $SU(3)$ triplet fermions additionally introduced in the 5-dimensional bulk. We find an allowed parameter region for the dark matter mass around a half of the Standard Model Higgs boson mass, which is consistent with the observed dark matter density and the constraint from the LUX 2016 result for the direct dark matter search. The entire allowed region will be covered by, for example, the LUX-ZEPLIN dark matter experiment in the near future. We also show that in the presence of the bulk $SU(3)$ triplet fermions the 125 GeV Higgs boson mass is reproduced through the renormalization group evolution of Higgs quartic coupling with the compactification scale of around $10^8$ GeV.
