We study how the resonant decay of moduli fields arising in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) could affect large scale curvature perturbations in the early universe. It has been known for some time that the presence of entropy perturbations in a multi-component system can act as seeds for the curvature perturbations on all scales. These entropy perturbations could be amplified exponentially if one of the moduli decays via stochastic resonance, affecting the curvature power spectrum in the process. By imposing the COBE normalization on this power spectrum, one could put constraints on the masses and couplings of the underlying particle physics model without having to rely on collider experiments. We discuss in detail the case of the MSSM but this method could be applied to other theories beyond the Standard Model.
