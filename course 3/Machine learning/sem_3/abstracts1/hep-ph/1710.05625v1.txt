Based on the use of contour gauge and collinear factorization, we propose a new set of single spin asymmetry which can be measured in polarized Drell-Yan process by SPD@NICA. We stress that the discussed single transverse spin asymmetries exist owing to the gluon poles manifesting in the twist-3 or twist-2$\otimes$twist-3 parton distributions related to the transverse-polarized Drell-Yan process.
