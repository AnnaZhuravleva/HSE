We revisit the flavor-changing processes involving an axion-like particle (ALP) in the context of generic ALP effective lagrangian with a discussion of possible UV completions providing the origin of the relevant bare ALP couplings. We focus on the minimal scenario that ALP has flavor-conserving couplings at tree level, and the leading flavor-changing couplings arise from the loops involving the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model fermions. We note that such radiatively generated flavor-changing ALP couplings can be easily suppressed in field theoretic ALP models with sensible UV completion. We discuss also the implication of our result for string theoretic ALP originating from higher-dimensional $p$-form gauge fields, for instance for ALP in large volume string compactification scenario.
