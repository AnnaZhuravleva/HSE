We study the case of a di-bottomonium $bb\bar b\bar b$ particle at the LHC. Its mass and decay width are obtained within a new model of diquark-antidiquark interactions in tetraquarks. The same model solves several open problems on the phenomenology of the experimentally better known $X,Z$ states. We show that the $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquark is expected approximately 100 MeV below threshold, and compare to a recent analysis by LHCb seeking it in the $\Upsilon\mu\mu$ final state.
