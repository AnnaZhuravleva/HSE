We present our progress on simulating the Glasma in the early stages of heavy ion collisions in a non-boost-invariant setting. Our approach allows us to describe colliding nuclei with finite longitudinal width by extending the McLerran-Venugopalan model to include a parameter for the Lorentz-contracted but finite extent of the nucleus in the beam direction. We determine the rapidity profile of the Glasma energy density, which shows strong deviations from the boost invariant result. Both broad and narrow profiles can be produced by varying the initial conditions. We find reasonable agreement when we compare the results to rapidity profiles of measured pion multiplicities from RHIC.
