We show that the processes of $\gamma b, Hb, Zb, W^-t$ production in gluon+bottom collision can give interesting informations about possible Higgs boson, top and bottom quark compositeness. We make illustrations of the ratios of new cross sections over standard ones. Specific energy dependences appear for each assumption about $b_L$, $b_R$, $t_L$, $t_R$ compositeness and CSM constraints concerning the Higgs sector.
