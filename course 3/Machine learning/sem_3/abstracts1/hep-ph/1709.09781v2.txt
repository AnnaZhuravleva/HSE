We calculate the effect of sterile neutrinos and nonstandard neutrino interactions on the flux of active neutrinos from the Earth's crust and mantle taking matter effect into account in both cases. For simple Earth model and using previous emission flux estimates at the source, we find that for reasonable choice of parameters for both the sterile neutrino and nonstandard interaction, the effect on the neutrino flux is a few percent or less.
