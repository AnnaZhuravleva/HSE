We study the transverse momentum spectrum of dilepton produced in the unpolarized $\pi^- N$ Drell-Yan process, using transverse momentum dependent factorization up to next-to-logarithmic order of QCD. We extract the nonperturbative Sudakov form factor for the pion in the evolution formalism of the unpolarized TMD distribution function, by fitting the experimental data collected by the E615 Collaboration at Fermilab. With the extracted Sudakov factor, we calculate the normalized differential cross section with respect to transverse momentum of the dimuon and compare it with the recent measurement by the COMPASS Collaboration.
