The Pontecorvo theory describes neutrinos as linear combinations of mass eigenstates. We prove that this construction is incompatible with Poincare-covariant quantum field theory unless all the mass eigenstates are identical where there are no flavour oscillations. The formalism pioneered by Blasone and Vitiello provides a possible description of massive neutrinos as generalized coherent flavour eigenstates via Bogoliubov transformations within the extended Standard Model. In the relativistic limit, the Blasone-Henning-Vitiello formulae for flavour oscillations reduce to the Pontecorvo formulae but discrepancies arise at low energy. We propose an experiment to study flavour oscillations in sub-eV region.
