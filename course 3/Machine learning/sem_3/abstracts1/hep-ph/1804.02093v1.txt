We will revise one of the methods given in the literature to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions that the parameters must satisfy to have a stable scalar potential in the general two-Higgs doublet model. We will give a procedure that facilitates finding the conditions for stability of a scalar potential. The stability guarantees that the scalar potential has a global minimum, that is, the potential is bounded from below, which is a necessary condition to implement the spontaneous gauge-symmetry breaking in the models.
