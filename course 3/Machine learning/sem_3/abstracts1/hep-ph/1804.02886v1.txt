Methods of spinor calculus in particle physics are described in this series of four chapters written in french. A special emphasis is made on the well-known helicity-coupling scheme which is the guiding thread of all these methods. Numerous explicit formulas are given for projectors onto two-particles helicity states as well as for bilinears of Dirac spinors, for the s and t channels of a given two-body process involving spin 1/2 particles. In the last chapter, applications to various elementary processes are given.
