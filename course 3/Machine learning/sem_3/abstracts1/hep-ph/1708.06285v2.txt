We classify the meson and baryon long lived resonances considering quarks with electric charge 5/3 and $-4/3$ (in units of $\vert e\vert$) predicted by some 3-3-1 models. Some of these exotic resonances have the usual electric charges $0,\pm1$, others have $\pm(3,4,5)$, and the lightest ones decaying only into leptons plus known resonances. We propose another heavy $SU(3)_H$ global symmetry under which hadrons involving only exotic quarks can be constructed.
