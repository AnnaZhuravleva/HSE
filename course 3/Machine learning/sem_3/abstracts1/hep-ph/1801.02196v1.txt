We present a new version of the EtaMAID model for $\eta$ and $\eta'$ photoproduction on nucleons. The model includes 23 nucleon resonances parameterized with Breit-Wigner shapes. The background is described by vector and axial-vector meson exchanges in the $t$ channel using the Regge cut phenomenology. Parameters of the resonances were obtained from a fit to available experimental data for $\eta$ and $\eta'$ photoproduction on protons and neutrons. The nature of the most interesting observations in the data is discussed.
