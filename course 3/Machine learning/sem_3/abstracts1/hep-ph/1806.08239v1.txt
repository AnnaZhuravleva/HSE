We present a model independent analysis of Leptonic CP violation for some well known mixing scenarios. In particular, we considered modified schemes for Bimaximal(BM), Democratic(DC), Hexagonal(HG) and Tribimaixmal(TBM) mixing for our numerical investigation. These model independent corrections to mixing matrices are parameterized in terms of complex rotation matrices ($U$) with related modified PMNS matrix of the forms \big($U_{ij}^l\cdot V_{M},~V_{M}\cdot U_{ij}^r$ \big ) where $U_{ij}^{l, r}$ is complex rotation in ij sector and $V_{M}$ is unperturbed mixing scheme. We present generic formulae for mixing angles, Dirac CP phase($\delta_{CP}$) and Jarkslog Invariant($J_{CP}$) in terms of correction parameters. The parameter space of each modified mixing case is scanned for fitting neutrino mixing angles using $\chi^2$ approach and the corresponding predictions for Leptonic CP Phase($\delta_{CP}$) and Jarkslog Invariant($J_{CP}$) has been evaluated from allowed parameter space. The obtained ranges are reported for all viable cases.
