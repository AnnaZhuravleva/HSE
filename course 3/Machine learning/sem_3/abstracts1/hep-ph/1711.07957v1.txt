We present recent analytic results for the 3-loop corrections to the massive operator matrix element $A_{Qg}^{(3)}$for further color factors. These results have been obtained using the method of arbitrarily large moments. We also give an overview on the results which were obtained solving all difference and differential equations for the corresponding master integrals that factorize at first order.
