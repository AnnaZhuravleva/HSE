Supersymmetry and more specifically supergravity grand unification allow one to extrapolate physics from the electroweak scale up to the grand unification scale consistent with electroweak data. Here we give a brief overview of their current status and show that the case for supersymmetry is stronger as a result of the Higgs boson discovery with a mass measurement at $\sim 125$ GeV consistent with the supergravity grand unification prediction that the Higgs boson mass lie below 130 GeV. Thus the discovery of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its mass provide a further impetus for the search for sparticles to continue at the current and future colliders.
