We analyze the charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decays of vector mesons $V\rightarrow l_i^{\pm}l_j^{\mp}$ with $V\in\{\phi, J/\Psi, \Upsilon, \rho^0, \omega \}$ in BLMSSM model. This new model is introduced as an supersymmetric extension of Standard Model (SM), where local gauged baryon number B and lepton number L are considered. The numerical results indicate BLMSSM model can produce significant contributions to such two-body CLFV decays. And the branching ratios for these CLFV processes can easily reach the present experimental upper bounds. Therefore, searching for CLFV processes of vector mesons may be an effective channels to study new physics.
