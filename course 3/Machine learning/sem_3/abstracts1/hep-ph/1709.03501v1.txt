Phenomenological studies performed for non-supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model usually use tree-level parameters as input to define the scalar sector of the model. This implicitly assumes that a full on-shell calculation of the scalar sector is possible - and meaningful. However, this doesn't have to be the case as we show explicitly at the example of the Georgi-Machacek model. This model comes with an appealing custodial symmetry to explain the smallness of the $\rho$ parameter. However, the model cannot be renormalised on-shell without breaking the custodial symmetry. Moreover, we find that it can often happen that the radiative corrections are so large that any consideration based on a perturbative expansion appears to be meaningless: counter-terms to quartic couplings can become much larger than $4\pi$ and/or two-loop mass corrections can become larger than the one-loop ones. Therefore, conditions are necessary to single out parameter regions which cannot be treated perturbatively. We propose and discuss different sets of such perturbativity conditions and show their impact on the parameter space of the Georgi-Machacek model. Moreover, the proposed conditions are general enough that they can be applied to other models as well. We also point out that the vacuum stability constraints in the Georgi-Machacek model, which have so far only been applied at the tree level, receive crucial radiative corrections. We show that large regions of the parameter space which feature a stable electroweak vacuum at the loop level would have been - wrongly - ruled out by the tree-level conditions.
