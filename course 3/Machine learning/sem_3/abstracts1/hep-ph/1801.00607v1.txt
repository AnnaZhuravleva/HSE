The aim of these lectures is to convey a working knowledge of Light Front Holographic QCD and Supersymmetric Light Front Holographic QCD. We first give an overview of holographic QCD in general and then concentrate on the application of the holographic methods on QCD quantized in the light front form. We show how the implementation of the supersymmetric algebra fixes the interaction and how one can obtain hadron mass spectra with the minimal number of parameters. We also treat propagators and compare the holographic approach with other non-perturbative methods. In the last chapter we describe the application of Light Front Holographic QCD to electromagnetic form factors.
