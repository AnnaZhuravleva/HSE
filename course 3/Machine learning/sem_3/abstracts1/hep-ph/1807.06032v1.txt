We report on recent progress in understanding multiparticle correlations in small systems from the initial state. First, we consider a proof-of-principle parton model, which we use to demonstrate that many of the multiparticle correlations observed in light-heavy ion collisions, often ascribed to hydrodynamic collectivity, can be qualitatively reproduced in an initial state model. Then, we study the two-particle harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$ for p/d/$^3$He+Au collisions at RHIC using the dilute-dense Color Glass Condensate Effective Field Theory framework. We show that this provides a viable alternative explanation to hydrodynamics, and elaborate on how such modeling can be improved.
