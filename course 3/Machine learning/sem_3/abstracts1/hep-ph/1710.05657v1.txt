At present, the Boer-Mulders (BM) functions are extracted from asymmetry data using the simplifying assumption of their proportionality to the Sivers functions for each quark flavour. Here we present two independent tests for this assumption. We subject COMPASS data on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering on the $\langle\cos\phi_h\rangle$, $\langle\cos 2\phi_h\rangle$ and Sivers asymmetries to these tests. Our analysis shows that the tests are satisfied with the available data if the proportionality constant is the same for all quark flavours, which does not correspond to the flavour dependence used in existing analyses. This suggests that the published information on the BM functions may be unreliable.   The $\langle\cos\phi_h\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 2 \phi_h\rangle$ asymmetries receive contributions also from the, in principle, calculable Cahn effect. We succeed in extracting the Cahn contributions from experiment (we believe for the first time) and compare with their calculated values, with interesting implications.
