In this proceedings contribution, we will review the basics of quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics. Then, we will present some recent phenomenological results of 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics and Pb-Pb $2.76$ TeV collisions from the ALICE collaboration. We show that 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics model is able to describe the experimental results for Pb-Pb collisions at $2.76$ TeV quite well for many observables such as the spectra, the elliptic flow, and HBT radii in many centrality classes.
