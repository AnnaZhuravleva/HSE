We present a comparison of the computation of energy-energy correlation in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions in the back-to-back region at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched with the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative prediction to LEP, PEP, PETRA, SLC and TRISTAN data. With these predictions we perform an extraction of the strong coupling constant taking into account non-perturbative effects modelled with Monte Carlo event generators. The final result at NNLO+NNLL precision is $\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})=0.11750\pm 0.00018 {\text( exp.)}\pm 0.00102{\text(hadr.)}\pm0.00257{\text(ren.)}\pm 0.00078{\text(res.)}$.
