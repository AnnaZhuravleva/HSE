The mass and coupling of the doubly charmed pseudoscalar diquark-antidiquark states $T_{cc;\bar{s} \bar{s}}^{++}$ and $T_{cc;\bar{d} \bar{s}}^{++}$ that bear two units of the electric charge are calculated by means of QCD two-point sum rule method. Computations are carried out by taking into account vacuum condensates up to and including terms of tenth dimension. The dominant $S$-wave decays of these tetraquarks to a pair of conventional $D_{s}^{+}D_{s0}^{\ast +}(2317)$ and $D^{+}D_{s0}^{\ast +}(2317)$ mesons are explored using QCD three-point sum rule approach, and their widths are found. The obtained results for the mass and width of these states $m_{T}=(4410~\pm 120)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $\Gamma =(109.8~\pm 30.8)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ and $\widetilde{m}_{T}=(4270\pm 115~)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $ \widetilde{\Gamma }=(52.6~\pm 14.8)~\mathrm{MeV}$ may be useful in experimental studies of exotic resonances. \end{abstract}
