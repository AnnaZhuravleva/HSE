Imposing flavour symmetries to neutrino non-standard interactions (NSIs) is discussed for the first time. For definiteness, we choose $A_4$ as the flavour symmetry, subsequently broken to the residual symmetry $Z_2$ in the neutrino sector. We provide a general discussion on flavour structures of NSIs from higher-dimensional operators ($d \leqslant 8$) without inducing unnecessary tree-level 4-charged-fermion interactions. Both $A_4$- and $Z_2$-motivated NSI textures are obtained. UV completions of higher-dimensional operators lead to extra experimental constraints on NSI textures. As a consequence, only a few textures can maximally reach the percent level of the standard matter effect. We study the implement of matter-effect NSIs in DUNE from phenomenological point of view, and discover that DUNE can test $A_4$ with high statistics level. We also present exclusion limits of sum rules suggested by UV-complete models. DUNE has a better performance for off-diagonal elements than diagonal ones.
