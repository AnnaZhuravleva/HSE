The strong suppression of heavy quarkonia is a good indicator that one has generated a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision. Recent advancements in first principles calculations of the heavy quark potential provide additional insight into this suppression and can be used to further pin down the in-medium properties of the QGP. Realistic 3+1d dissipative hydrodynamical models can be used to simulate the QGP and, with bottomonium as a probe, one can make inferences for the initial temperature of the QGP and other phenomenological parameters such as the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. However, progressing to LHC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions, one expects regeneration to have an increasingly important impact on the suppression observables. In this proceedings, we present a brief overview to set up the model and then provide model results for bottomonium suppression and regeneration, for ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC.
