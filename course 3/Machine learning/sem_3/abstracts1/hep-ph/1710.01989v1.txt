In composite Higgs models, new composite pseudoscalars can interact with the Higgs and with electroweak gauge bosons via anomalous interactions, which stem from the topological structure of the underlying theory. A future 100 TeV pp collider (FCC-pp) will be able to test these anomalous interactions and thus shed light on the strong dynamics which generates the Higgs and other composite resonances. We will discuss the topological interactions of a minimal composite Higgs model with fermionic ultraviolet completion, based on the coset SU(4)/Sp(4). We will indicate the strategy to test these interactions at the FCC-pp and the expected reach.
