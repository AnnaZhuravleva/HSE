By using predictions from the Pythia 8 Monte Carlo event generator, we determine the energy-dependent turn-over values (pT0) of the partonic cross section for the simulation of multiparton interactions. Since the observed energy dependence of the pT0 values is not well described by a power-law function, we introduce an additional energy-dependent term, to better describe the experimental observations in the energy range sqrt(s) = 0.3-13 TeV. We obtain a similar level of agreement for predictions using various parton densities.
