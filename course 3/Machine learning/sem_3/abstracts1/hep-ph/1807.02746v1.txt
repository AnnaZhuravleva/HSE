Beam dump experiments like the Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment have the potential to detect hundreds of tau neutrino and antineutrino charged current interaction events. We evaluate the impact of including intrinsic transverse momentum effects and other kinematic angular corrections in the evaluation of the far-forward flux of neutrinos in a next-to-leading order QCD evaluation. We compare this flux to the flux in a next-to-leading order QCD evaluation without intrinsic transverse momentum that used the angular distribution of charmed quarks rather than the neutrinos from their decays. The tau neutrino plus antineutrino event rate is reduced by a factor of about three when intrinsic transverse momentum and the full decay kinematics are included. We show that intrinsic charm contributions can significantly enhance the tau neutrino plus antineutrino event rates. The muon neutrino-antineutrino charged current event rate asymmetry as a function of energy is another diagnostic for the presence of intrinsic charm.
