The workshop on Parton Distributions and Lattice Calculations in the LHC era (PDFLattice2017) was hosted at Balliol College, Oxford (UK), from 22$^{\rm nd}$ to 24$^{\rm th}$ March 2017. The workshop brought together the lattice-QCD and the global-fit physicists who devote their efforts to determine the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. The goals were to make the two communities more familiar between each other, review developments from both sides, and set precision targets for lattice calculations so that they can contribute, together with the forthcoming experimental input, to the next generation of PDF determinations. This contribution summarises the relevant outcome of the workshop, in anticipation of a thorough white paper.
