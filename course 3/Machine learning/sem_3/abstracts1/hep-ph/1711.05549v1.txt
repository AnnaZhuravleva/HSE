In this talk we discuss some aspects of the analytical calculation of energy correlations in electron-positron annihilation at a next-to-leading order in QCD. Our primary focus is on the most difficult task: the calculation of master integrals for real-emission contributions, which are functions of two dimensionless variables and the dimensional regulator. We use a method of differential equations and their so-called epsilon-form which is constructed with the help of the Fuchsia program based on Lee's algorithm.
