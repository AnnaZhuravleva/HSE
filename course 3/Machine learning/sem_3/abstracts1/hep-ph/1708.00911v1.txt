I present a preliminary version of {\tt APFEL++}, a C++ rewriting of the Fortran 77 evolution code {\tt APFEL}. In this contribution I discuss the new philosophy adopted for the numerical computation of the convolutions, demonstrate the ability to reproduce old results in an accurate and fast way, and present an original application to the computation of the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering cross section to next-to-leading order in QCD.
