We propose a theory in which the Standard Model gauge symmetry is extended by a new $SU(2)_\ell$ group acting nontrivially on the lepton sector which is spontaneously broken at the TeV scale. Under this $SU(2)_\ell$ the ordinary leptons form doublets along with new lepton partner fields. This construction naturally contains a dark matter candidate, the partner of the right-handed neutrino, stabilized by a residual global $U(1)_\chi$ symmetry. We show that one can explain baryogenesis through an asymmetric dark matter scenario, in which generation of related asymmetries in the dark matter and baryon sectors is driven by the $SU(2)_\ell$ instantons during a first order phase transition in the early universe.
