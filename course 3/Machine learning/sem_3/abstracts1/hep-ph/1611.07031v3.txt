We determine the nucleon neutral weak electromagnetic form factors $G^{Z,p(n)}_{E,M}$ by combining results from light-front holographic QCD and lattice QCD calculations. We deduce nucleon electromagnetic form factors from light-front holographic QCD which provides a good parametrization of the experimental data of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the entire momentum transfer range and isolate the strange quark electromagnetic form factors $G^{s}_{E,M}$ using lattice QCD. From these calculations, we obtain precise estimates of the neutral weak form factors in the momentum transfer range of $0\,\text{GeV}^2\leq Q^2 \leq 0.5 \,\text{GeV}^2 $. From the lattice QCD calculation, we present $Q^2$-dependence of the strange quark form factors. We also deduce the neutral weak Dirac and Pauli form factors $F_{1,2}^{Z,p(n)}$ of the proton and the neutron.
