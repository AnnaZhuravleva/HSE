The meaningful specific anisotropy in the angle distribution of leptons with respect to the three-momentum of pair is predicted as a feasibility signature of synchrotron-like mechanism resulting from the quarks interacting with a collective confining color field in the heavy ion collisions. The lepton pair production rate and the spectrum of pair invariant mass are presented for this new dilepton source that is apparently not taken into consideration in the available phenomenological estimates.
