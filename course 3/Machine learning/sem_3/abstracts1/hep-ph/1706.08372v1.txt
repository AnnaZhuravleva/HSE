We explore the low energy phenomenology of an F-theory based SU(5) model which, in addition to the known quarks and leptons, contains Standard Model singlets, and vector-like color triplets and SU(2) doublets. Depending on their masses and couplings, some of these new particles may be observed at the LHC and future colliders. We discuss the restrictions by CKM constraints on their mixing with the ordinary down quarks of the three chiral familes. The model is consistent with gauge coupling unification at the usual supersymmetric GUT scale, dimension five proton decay is adequately suppressed, while dimension-six decay mediated by the superheavy gauge bosons is enhanced by a factor of 5-7. The third generation charged fermion Yukawa couplings yield the corresponding low-energy masses in reasonable agreement with observations. The hierarchical nature of the masses of lighter generations is accounted for via non-renormalisable interactions, with the perturbative vacuum expectation values of the SM singlet fields playing an essential role.
