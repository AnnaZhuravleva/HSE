Working within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we compare current bounds from quark flavor changing processes with current and upcoming bounds on lepton flavor violation. We assume supersymmetry breaking approximately respects CP invariance. Under the further assumption that flavor violating insertions in the quark and lepton scalar masses are comparable, we explore when lepton flavor violation provides the strongest probe of new physics. We quote results both for spectra with all superpartners near the TeV scale and where scalars are multi-TeV. Constraints from quark flavor changing neutral currents are in many cases already stronger than those expected from future lepton flavor violation bounds, but large regions of parameter space remain where the latter could provide a discovery mode for supersymmetry.
