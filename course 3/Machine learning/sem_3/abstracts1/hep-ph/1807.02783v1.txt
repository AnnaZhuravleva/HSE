In this paper we demonstrate that the selection of events with different multiplicities of produced particles, leads to the violation of the azimuthal angular symmetry, $\phi \to \pi - \phi$. We find for LHC and lower energies, that this violation can be so large for the events with multiplicities $n \geq 2 \bar{n}$, where $\bar{n}$ is the mean multiplicity, that it leads to almostno suppression of $v_n$, with odd $n$. However, this can only occur if the typical size of the dipole in DIS with a nuclear target is small, or $Q^2 \,>\,Q^2_s\Lb A, Y_{\rm min},b\Rb$, where $Q_s$ is the saturation momentum of the nucleus at $Y = Y_{\rm min}$. In the case of large sizes of dipoles, when $Q^2 \,<\,Q^2_s\Lb A, Y_{\rm min},b\Rb$, we show that $v_n =0$ for odd $n$. Hadron-nucleus scattering is discussed.
