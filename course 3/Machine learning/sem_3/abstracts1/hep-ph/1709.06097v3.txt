The dynamical diquark picture asserts that exotic hadrons can be formed from widely separated colored diquark or triquark components. We use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation to study the spectrum of states thus constructed, both in the basis of diquark spins and in the basis of heavy quark-antiquark spins. We develop a compact notation for naming these states, and use the results of lattice simulations for hybrid mesons to predict the lowest expected BO potentials for both tetraquarks and pentaquarks. We then compare to the set of exotic candidates with experimentally determined quantum numbers, and find that all of them can be accommodated. Once decay modes are also considered, one can develop selection rules of both exact ($J^{PC}$ conservation) and approximate (within the context of the BO approximation) types and test their effectiveness. We find that the most appealing way to satisfy both sets of selection rules requires including additional low-lying BO potentials, a hypothesis that can be checked on the lattice.
