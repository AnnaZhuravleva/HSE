The Standard Model (SM) supplemented by Type II Seesaw and a SM gauge-singlet scalar dark matter (DM) is a very simple framework to incorporate the observed neutrino oscillations and provide a plausible DM candidate. In this framework, the scalar DM naturally has a leptophilic nature with a pair annihilating mainly into the SM SU(2)$_L$ triplet Higgs scalar of Type II Seesaw which, in turn, decay into leptons. In this work, we consider indirect signatures of this leptophilic DM and examine the spectrum of the cosmic ray electron/positron flux from DM pair annihilations in the Galactic halo. Given an astrophysical background spectrum of the cosmic ray electron/positron flux, we find that the contributions from DM annihilations can nicely fit the observed data from the AMS-02, DAMPE and Fermi-LAT collaborations, with a multi-TeV range of DM mass and a boost factor for the DM annihilation cross section of ${\cal O}(1000)$. The boost factor has a slight tension with the Fermi-LAT data for gamma-ray from dwarf spheroidal galaxies, which can be ameliorated with an enhanced local DM density by a factor of about 2.
