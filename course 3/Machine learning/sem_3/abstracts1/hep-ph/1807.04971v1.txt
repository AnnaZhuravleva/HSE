We study a puzzle raised recently regarding the running coupling prescription used in the calculation of forward particle production in proton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order: using a coordinate space prescription which is consistent with the one used in the high energy evolution of the target leads to results which can be two orders of magnitude larger than the ones obtained with a momentum space prescription. We show that this is an artefact of the Fourier transform involved when passing between coordinate and momentum space and propose a new coordinate space prescription which avoids this problem.
