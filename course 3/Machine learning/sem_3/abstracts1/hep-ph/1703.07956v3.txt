We introduce a new local symmetry into the fermion sector of a gauge invariant Lagrangian which may or may not contain a scalar or spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Standard Model in the unitary gauge and QCD are particular cases where this symmetry may apply. We determine the associated vector and axial vector currents and their conservation laws. We show that a single current conservation law may lead to multiple Ward-Takahashi identities. Our results can potentially have important consequences for effective models of low-energy QCD and hadron structure. As an specific example, we discuss the construction of tetraquark states within a generalized linear sigma model and show that this new symmetry probes the tetraquarks in a manner that is consistent with the large $N_c$ limit of QCD.
