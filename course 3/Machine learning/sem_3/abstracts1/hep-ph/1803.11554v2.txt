We explain the two upgoing ultra-high energy shower events observed by ANITA as arising from the decay in the Earth's interior of the quasi-stable dark matter candidate in the CPT symmetric universe. The dark matter particle is a 480 PeV right-handed neutrino that decays into a Higgs boson and a light Majorana neutrino. The latter interacts in the Earth's crust to produce a tau lepton that in turn initiates an atmospheric upgoing shower. The fact that both events emerge at the same angle from the Antarctic ice-cap suggests an atypical dark matter density distribution in the Earth.
