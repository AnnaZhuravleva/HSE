In a large class of scenarios, dark matter (DM) particles that belong to a multiplet of the standard model (SM) weak interactions are challenging to probe in direct detection experiments due to loop-suppressed cross-sections. Direct production at colliders is thus crucial to look for such DM candidates, and under current estimates, future runs of the 14-TeV LHC are projected to probe masses of around 300 GeV for DM belonging to an SU(2) doublet (Higgsino-like), and 900 GeV for SU(2) triplet (wino-like). We examine how far this mass reach can be extended at the proposed 27-TeV high-energy upgrade of the LHC (HE-LHC), and compare the results to the case for a 100-TeV hadron collider. Following a detector setup similar to that of the ATLAS tracking system for the Run-2 LHC upgrade, with a new Insertable B-Layer (IBL), a disappearing charged track analysis at the HE-LHC can probe Higgsino-like (wino-like) DM mass of up to 600 GeV (2.1 TeV) at the 95% C.L. The monojet and missing transverse momentum search, on the otherhand, has a weaker reach of 490 GeV (700 GeV) at 95% C.L. for the Higgsino-like (wino-like) states. The mass range accessible in the collider searches can be complementary to the indirect detection probes using gamma rays from dwarf-spheroidal galaxies.
