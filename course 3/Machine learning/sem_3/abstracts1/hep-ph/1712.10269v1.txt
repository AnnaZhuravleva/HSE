I explore the phenomenology and models of Gauge Mediation with a mixed spectrum of Dirac and Majorana gauginos. Scalar sfermion masses are generated using a mixture of Supersoft and Minimal Gauge Mediated communication mechanisms. I build simple models where Dirac and Majorana gauginos arise from distinct SUSY breaking sectors. I explore the phenomenology of the gauge mediated parameter space, identifying candidate NLSP's and possible mass hierarchies. The phenomenological focus is on 'collider safe' models where the gluino is Dirac. Within this model space I find a range of complex SUSY spectra and decay chains.
