It is shown that standard constituent quark models produce $(\bar c c qqq)$ hidden-charm pentaquarks, where $c$ denotes the charmed quark and $q$ a light quark, which lie below the lowest threshold for spontaneous dissociation and thus are stable in the limit where the internal $\bar c c$ annihilation is neglected. The binding is a cooperative effect of the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic components of the interaction, and it disappears in the static limit with a pure chromoelectric potential. Their wave function contains color sextet and color octet configurations for the subsystems and can hardly be reduced to a molecular state made of two interacting hadrons. These pentaquark states could be searched for in the experiments having discovered or confirmed the hidden-charm meson and baryon resonances.
