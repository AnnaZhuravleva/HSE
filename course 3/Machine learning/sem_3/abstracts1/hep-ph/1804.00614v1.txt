Inspired by the recent observations of $Y(4320)$ and $Y(4390)$, we evaluate the possibility of these two charmonium-like states as $\psi(3^3D_1)$ by investigating their open charm decays in quark-pair creation model. In the present work, our estimations indicate that the total width of $\psi(3^3D_1)$ is consistent with those of both $Y(4320)$ and $Y(4390)$. In addition, we find $D_1(2430) \bar{D}$ is one of dominant decay modes of $Y(4390)$, which indicates the process $Y(4390) \to \pi^+ D^0 D^{\ast -}$ may dominantly occur via the cascade decay $Y(4390) \to D^0 \bar{D}_1(2430) \to D^0 (\pi^+D^{\ast-})$. Moreover, the dominant decay channels of $\psi(3^3D_1)$ are predicted, which could be tested by further measurement at BES III and Belle II.
