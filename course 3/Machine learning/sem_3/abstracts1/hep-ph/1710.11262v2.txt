An appealing candidate of the galactic dark matter is the axion, which was postulated to solve the strong CP (Charge-conjugation Parity) violation problem in the standard particle theory. A new experimental method is proposed to determine the axion mass. The method uses collectively and coherently excited atoms or molecules, the trigger laser inducing galactic axion absorption along with signal photon emission to be detected.
