The generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the meson and nucleon at small and large values of the momentum transfer were determined on the basis of the comparative analysis of different sets of experimental data of electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron, using the different sets of the parton distribution functions (PDFs). As a result, different form factors of the nucleons and meson were calculated. The t-dependence of these form factors was checked up in the description of the nucleon-nucleon and meson-nucleon elastic scattering and the differential cross sections of the real Compton scattering.
