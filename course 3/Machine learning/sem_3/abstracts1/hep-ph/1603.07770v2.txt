Meson mixing is considered to be an ideal candidate for new physics searches. Current experimental precision has greatly increased over the recent years, excelling in several cases the theoretical precision. A possible limit in the theoretical accuracy could be a hypothetical breakdown of quark-hadron duality. We propose a simple model for duality violations and give stringent bounds on such effects for mixing observables, indicating regions, where future measurements of $\Delta \Gamma_d$, $a_{sl}^d$ and $a_{sl}^s$ would be clear signals of new physics. Finally, we turn our attention to the charm sector, and reveal that already a modest duality violation of about $20 \%$ could explain the huge difference between HQE predictions for D-mixing and experimental data.
