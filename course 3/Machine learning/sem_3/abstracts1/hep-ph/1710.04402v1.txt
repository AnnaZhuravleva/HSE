We consider the noncommutative Standard Model that contains Lorentz symmetry violation as a subset of the Standard Model extension. We introduce a constant electromagnetic field as a background to derive mutual relations between the free parameters of both theories. As the Lorentz violation parameters of the Standard Model extension are extensively explored in different experiments and many stringent bounds on these parameters are available, we can find new bounds on the scale of noncommutativity of the order of a few to tens of teraelectron volts.
