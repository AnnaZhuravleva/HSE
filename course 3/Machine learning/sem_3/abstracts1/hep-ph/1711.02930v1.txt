The spin asymmetries in SIDIS associated with $T$-odd TMDs are presented in a light-front quark-diquark model of a proton. To incorporate the effects of the final state interaction, the light front wave functions are modified to have a phase factor which is essential to have Sivers or Boer-Mulders functions. The Sivers and Boer-Mulder asymmetries are compared with HERMES and COMPASS data.
