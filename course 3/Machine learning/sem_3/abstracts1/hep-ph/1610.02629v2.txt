These notes are based on the lectures I gave at the 2015 European School of High-Energy Physics (ESHEP2015). I discuss 1) flavor physics within the Standard Model, 2) effective field theories and Minimal Flavor Violation, 3) flavor physics in theories beyond the Standard Model and "high energy" flavor transitions of the top quark and of the Higgs boson. As a bi-product, I present the most updated constraints from the measurements of B_s -> mu^+mu^-, as well as I discuss the most recent development in the LHC searches for top flavor changing couplings.
