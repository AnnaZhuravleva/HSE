We review in detail modern numerical methods used in the determination and solution of Bethe-Salpeter and Dyson--Schwinger equations. The algorithms and techniques described are applicable to both the rainbow-ladder truncation and its non-trivial extensions. We discuss pedagogically the steps involved in constructing conventional mesons and baryons as systems of two- and three-quarks respectively. As further application we describe the self-consistent calculation of form-factors and highlight the challenges that remain therein.
