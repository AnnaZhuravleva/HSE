The transverse momentum spectra of weak gauge bosons and their ratios probe the underlying dynamics and are crucial in testing our understanding of the Standard Model. They are an essential ingredient in precision measurements, such as the $\mathrm{W}$-boson mass extraction. To fully exploit the potential of the LHC data, we compute the second-order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the inclusive-$p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{W}$ spectrum as well as to the ratios of spectra for $\mathrm{W}^-/\mathrm{W}^+$ and $\mathrm{Z}/\mathrm{W}$. We find that the inclusion of NNLO QCD corrections considerably improves the theoretical description of the experimental CMS data and results in a substantial reduction of the residual scale uncertainties.
