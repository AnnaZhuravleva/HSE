We study the signatures of the triplet-quadruplet dark matter model at the LHC and future colliders, including the 100 TeV Super Proton-Proton Collider and the 240 GeV Circular Electron Positron Collider. The dark sector in this model contains one fermionic electroweak triplet and two fermionic quadruplets, which have two kinds of Yukawa couplings to the Higgs doublet. Electroweak production signals of the dark sector fermions in the $\text{monojet}+/\!\!\!\!E_\mathrm{T}$, disappearing track, and $\text{multilepton}+/\!\!\!\!E_\mathrm{T}$ channels at the LHC and the Super Proton-Proton Collider are investigated. Moreover, we study the loop effects of this model on the Circular Electron Positron Collider precision measurements of $e^+e^-\to Zh$ and $h\to\gamma\gamma$. We find that most of the parameter regions allowed by the observed dark matter relic density will be well explored by such direct and indirect searches at future colliders.
