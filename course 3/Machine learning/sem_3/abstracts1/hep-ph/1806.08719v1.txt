We study spin and spin-flavor oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in a plane electromagnetic wave with circular polarization. The evolution of massive neutrinos with nonzero magnetic moments in the field of an electromagnetic wave is based on the exact solution of the Dirac-Pauli equation. We formulate the initial condition problem to describe spin-flavor oscillations in an electromagnetic wave. The transition probabilities for spin and spin-flavor oscillations are obtained. In case of spin-flavor oscillations, we analyze the transition probability for different neutrino magnetic moments. As an application of the obtained results, we study $\nu_{e\mathrm{L}}\to\nu_{\mu\mathrm{R}}$ oscillations in an electromagnetic wave emitted by a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Our results are compared with findings of other authors.
