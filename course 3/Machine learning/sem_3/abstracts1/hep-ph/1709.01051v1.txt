A method to extract Wilson coefficients for semi-leptonic $b\rightarrow s$ transition and form factors for the hadronic process $B\rightarrow K^*\mu^+\mu^-$ is suggested. The method is based on data of angular distribution of the process $B\rightarrow K^*(\rightarrow K \pi)\mu^+\mu^-$ with the optimized observables plotted as functions of dilepton invariant mass squared. We have constructed plots of the observables using present knowledge of Wilson coefficients and form factors. Assuming these plots to be experimental data, we have discussed and used the strategy to determine the form factors and Wilson coefficients. The method is novel as this provides a form-factor-independent determination of Wilson coefficients and also provides a reliable data driven method to extract information about form factors.
