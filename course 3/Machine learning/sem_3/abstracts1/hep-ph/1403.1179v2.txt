We study the impact of higher order quark-meson scattering processes on the chiral phase structure of two-flavour QCD at finite temperature and quark density. Thermal, density and quantum fluctuations are included within a functional renormalisation group approach to the quark-meson model. We present results on the chiral phase boundary, the critical endpoint, and the curvature of the phase transition line at vanishing density.
