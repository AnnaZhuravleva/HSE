We present a method to combine the all-order treatment of the High Energy Jets exclusive partonic Monte Carlo (HEJ) with the parton shower of Pythia8, while retaining the logarithmic accuracy of both. This procedure enables the generation of fully realistic and hadronised events with HEJ. Furthermore, the combination of the two all-order treatments leads to improvements in the quality of the description of observables, in particular for regions with disparate transverse scales.
