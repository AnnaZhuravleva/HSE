The diquark-diquark-antiquark model describes pentaquark states both in terms of quarks and hadrons. The latest LHCb data for pentaquarks with open charm emphasize the importance of hadron components in the structure of pentaquarks. We discuss pentaquark states with hidden charm $P(\bar c cuud)$ and those with open charm $P(\bar uussc)$ which were discovered recently in LHCb data ($J/\Psi p$ and $\Xi_c^+ K^-$ spectra correspondingly). Considering the observed states as members of the lowest (s-wave) multiplet we discuss the mass splitting of states and the dumping of their widths.
