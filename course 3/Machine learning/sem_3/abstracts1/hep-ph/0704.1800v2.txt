The current status and some perspectives of the phenomenology of massive neutrinos is reviewed. We start with the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and in matter. We summarize the results of neutrino experiments using solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino beams. We update the leptonic parameters derived from the three-neutrino oscillation interpretation of this data. We describe the method and present results on our understanding of the solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes by direct extraction from the corresponding neutrino event rates. We present some tests of different forms of new physics which induce new sources of leptonic flavor transitions in vacuum and in matter which can be performed with the present neutrino data. The aim and potential of future neutrino experiments and facilities to further advance in these fronts is also briefly summarized. Last, the implications of the LSND observations are discussed, and the status of extended models which could accommodate all flavor-mixing signals is presented in the light of the recent results from MiniBooNE.
