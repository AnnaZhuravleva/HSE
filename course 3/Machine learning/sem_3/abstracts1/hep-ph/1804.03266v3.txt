We investigate $\rho$ vector meson production in $ep$ collisions at HERA with leading neutrons in the dipole formalism. The interaction of the dipole and the pion is described in a mixed-space approach, in which the dipole-pion scattering amplitude is given by the Marquet-Peschanski-Soyez saturation model, which is based on the travelling wave solutions of the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. We estimate the magnitude of the absorption effects and compare our results with a previous analysis of the same process in full coordinate space. In contrast with this approach, the present study leads to absorption $K$ factors in the range of those predicted by previous theoretical studies on semi-inclusive processes.
