The phenomenon of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the quantum chromodynamic theory in the framework of logarithmic quark sigma model is studied. Thermodynamic properties are calculated in the mean-field approximation such as the pressure, the entropy density, the energy density, and measure interaction. The pressure, the entropy density, and the energy density increase with increasing temperature and an external magnetic field. The critical temperature increases with increasing an external magnetic field. In addition, the chiral phase transition is crossover in the presence of an external magnetic field with absent of baryonic chemical potential when explicit symmetry breaking is included. A comparison is presented with the original sigma model and other works. A conclusion indicates that the logarithmic quark model enhances the magnetic catalysis phenomenon.
