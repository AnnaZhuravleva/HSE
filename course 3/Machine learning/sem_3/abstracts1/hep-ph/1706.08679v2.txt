We study the system-size dependence of Knudsen number, a measure of degree of thermalization, for hadron resonance gas that follows the Lattice-QCD equation of state at zero chemical potential. A comparison between Knudsen numbers for the AuAu collisions at RHIC and the hadron gas of size similar to the size of high-multiplicity pp events at LHC, reassures the applicability of hydrodynamics in interpreting the features of particle production in high-multiplicity pp events.
