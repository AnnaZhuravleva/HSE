Colorelectric and Colormagnetic structure of the flux tubes, connecting heavy quark and antiquark, is investigated in the framework of the Field Correlator method which describes all resulting fields in terms of correlators $D^E$ and $D^E_1$. The latter have been computed via gluelumps, which allows to predict the resulting distribution of color fields $\mathbf{E} (\mathbf{r}),$ and colormagnetic currents $\mathbf{k} (\mathbf{r})$ in the flux tubes. It is shown, that at large distances $r\gg \lambda \approx 0.2$ fm the whole structure of fields and relations between them is similar to that of the dual superconductor theory, but the basic dynamics, including small distances, is given by field correlators of the real stochastic vacuum. The important contradiction between the strong screening of color fields in the width of flux tubes and almost no screening in the perturbative $Q\bar Q$ potential is resolved.
