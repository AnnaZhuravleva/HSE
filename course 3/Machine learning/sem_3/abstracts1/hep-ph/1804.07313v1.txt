We compute the color-planar and complete light quark non-singlet contributions to the heavy quark form factors in the case of the axialvector, scalar and pseudoscalar currents at three loops in perturbative QCD. We evaluate the master integrals applying a new method based on differential equations for general bases, which is applicable for all first order factorizing systems. The analytic results are expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms and real-valued cyclotomic harmonic polylogarithms.
