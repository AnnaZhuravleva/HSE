We propose a phenomenological formula relating the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Masukawa matrix $V_{CKM}$ and quark masses in the form $(\sqrt{m_d} \, \sqrt{m_s} \, \sqrt{m_b}) \propto (\sqrt{m_u} \, \sqrt{m_c} \, \sqrt{m_t})V_{CKM}$. The results of the proposed formula are in agreement with experimental data. Under the constraint of the formula, we show that the invariant amplitude of the charged current weak interactions is maximized.
