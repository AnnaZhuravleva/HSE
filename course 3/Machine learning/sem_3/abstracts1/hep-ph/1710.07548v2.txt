We estimate production cross sections for 2-body resonances of the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking sector (in W_L W_L, Z_L Z_L and hh rescattering) through intermediate photon-photon scattering. We employ unitarized Higgs Effective Theory amplitudes previously computed coupling the two photon channel to the EWSBS. We work in the Effective Photon Approximation and examine both e-e+ collisions at energies of order 1-2 TeV (as relevant for future lepton machines) and pp collisions at LHC energies. Dynamically generating a spin-0 resonance around 1.5 TeV (by appropriately choosing the parameters of the effective theory) we find that the differential cross section per unit s, p_t^2 is is of order 0.01 fbarn/TeV^4 at the LHC. Injecting a spin-2 resonance around 2 TeV we find an additional factor 100 suppression for p_t up to 200 GeV. The very small cross sections seem to put these photon-photon processes, though very clean, out of reach of immediate future searches.
