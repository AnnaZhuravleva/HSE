We investigate the spectral function of the amplitude mode in 2D Boson gas using $O(2)$ model without large-N expansion at zero temperature limit. We calculate the spectral function with full 2-loop contributions and with higher order contributions included. We find that both the peeks of the spectral function of the longitudinal susceptibility and the scalar susceptibility could show up. We argue that the visibility of the amplitude does not depend on the choice of the longitudinal or scalar susceptibility. We also find that the $O(2)$ model at zero temperature limit cannot explain the disappearance of the response when the weakly interaction limit is approached, which was observed in the experiments. We also find there could be another smaller peek in the spectral function at about $2m_{\sigma}$.
