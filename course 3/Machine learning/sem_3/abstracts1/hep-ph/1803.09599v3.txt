Higgs, being the first discovery of a fundamental scalar field in the standard model (SM), opens the possibility of existence of other scalar or pseudo scalar particles. Though it does not conclusively fulfill the role of inflaton, it does provide motivation for experimental searches involving interactions of scalar (or pseudo scalar) particles as well as implications of such particles' existence from the perspective of theoretical understanding. Yukawa interactions are among the possible interactions. The considered model addresses Yukawa interaction among the Higgs (and Higgs bar) \footnote{Higgs bar is referred to $h^{\dagger}$, with h being the Higgs field, throughout this paper.} and a real singlet scalar field using Dyson Schwinger equations (DSEs) over a range of bare coupling values relevant to inflation-related physics, for several scalar and Higgs' masses, without involving any DSEs but those for the field propagators. It is found that Higgs mass does not receive considerable contributions while scalar propagators do not degenerate over the whole parameter space. The interaction vertices show significant deviations from tree level expression for a number of parameters and exhibit a two-plateau behavior. Furthermore, the theory does not show any conclusive sign of triviality over the explored parameter space.
