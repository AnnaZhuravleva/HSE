We show that neutrino spin and spin-flavor transitions involve nonvanishing geometric phases. The geometric character of neutrino spin rotation is explored by studying the neutrino spin trajectory in the projective Hilbert space representation and its relation to the geometric phase. Analytical expressions are derived for noncyclic geometric phases. Several calculations are performed for different cases of rotating and nonrotating magnetic fields in the context of solar neutrinos and neutrinos produced inside neutron stars. Also the effects of adiabaticity, critical magnetic fields and cross boundary effects in the case of neutrinos emanating out of neutron stars are examined.
