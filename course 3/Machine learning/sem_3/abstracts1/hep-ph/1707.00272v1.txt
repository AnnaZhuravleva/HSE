We study the phase transition of nuclear (baryonic) matter in the model of one-dimensional random fluctuation walk. The stochastic fields (forces) influence intrinsic to Bose-Einstein correlations between two identical particles is a particular ingridient of the model. The solution in terms of the characteristic functional equation contains the regular (homogenious) and the singular non-analytical (non-homogenious) parts for baryonic matter (BM) and anomaly matter (AM), respectively. The conditions to phase transition from BM to AM are found.
