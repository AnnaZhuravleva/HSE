The ambiguities inherent in renormalization are considered when using mass-independent renormalization in massless theories that involve two coupling coupling constants. We review how there is no renormalization scheme in which the beta-functions can be chosen to vanish beyond a certain order in perturbation theory, but that the beta-functions always contain ambiguities beyond first order. We examine how the coupling constants depend on the coefficients of the beta-function beyond one loop order. A way of characterizing renormalization schemes that doesn't use coefficients of the beta-function is considered for models with either one or two couplings. The renormalization scheme ambiguities of physical quantities computed to finite order in perturbation theory are also examined. We demonstrate how summation of the logarithms that have explicit dependence on the renormalization scale parameter mu in a physical quantity R leads to a cancellation with the implicit dependence of R on mu through the running couplings. It is also shown that there exists a renormalization scheme in which all radiative effects beyond lowest order are incorporated into the behaviour of the running couplings.
