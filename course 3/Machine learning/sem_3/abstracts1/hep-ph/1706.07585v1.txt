A higher moment analysis of multiplicity distribution is performed using the Weibull description of particle production in $pp\,(p\bar{p})$ collisions at SPS and LHC energies. The calculated normalized moments and factorial moments of Weibull distribution are compared to the measured data. The calculated Weibull moments are found to be in good agreement with the measured higher moments (up to 5$^{\rm{th}}$ order) reproducing the observed breaking of KNO scaling in the data. The moments for $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are also predicted.
