Using approximate methods of nonperturbative quantization \`a la Heisenberg and taking into account the interaction of gauge fields with quarks, we find regular solutions describing the following configurations: (i) a spinball consisting of two virtual quarks with opposite spins, (ii) a quantum monopole, (iii) a spinball-plus-quantum-monopole system, and (iv) a spinball-plus-quantum-dyon system. All these objects (except the spinball) are embedded in a bag created by the quantum coset condensate consisting of the SU(3)/(SU(2)~$\times$~U(1)) gauge fields. The existence of these objects is due to the Meissner effect, which implies that the SU(2)~$\times$~U(1) gauge fields are expelled from the condensate. The physical interpretation of these solutions is proposed in two different forms: (i) an approximate glueball model, and (ii) quantum fluctuations in the coset condensate of the nonperturbative vacuum or in a quark-gluon plasma. For the spinball and the spinball-plus-quantum-monopole configuration, we obtain energy spectra, in which mass gaps are present. The process of deconfinement is discussed qualitatively. It is shown that the quantum chromodynamics constant $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ appears in the nonperturbative quantization \`a la Heisenberg as some constant controlling the correlation length of quantum fields in a spacelike direction.
