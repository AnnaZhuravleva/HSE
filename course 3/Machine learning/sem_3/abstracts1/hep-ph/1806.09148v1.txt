We present the flavor-dependent EMC effect from nIMParton nuclear PDFs, of which the $x$-dependence is described with a nucleon swelling model. The nuclear correction originated from the nucleon swelling is considered through modifying the initial valence quark distributions instead of the dynamical rescaling. To probe the flavor-dependence of the model, the experimental observables are calculated applying nIMParton nuclear modifications for the widely discussed experiments: parity-violating deep inelastic scattering on nuclear target, pion-induced Drell-Yan experiment, and W-boson production in proton-nucleus collisions. In addition, we show that measuring the spectator-tagged deep inelastic scattering process is another novel experimental method to probe the flavor-dependent EMC effect, which can be performed on CLAS12 with ALERT detector. The predictions of $F_2$ ratios for bound proton and bound neutron are given for the future experimental test.
