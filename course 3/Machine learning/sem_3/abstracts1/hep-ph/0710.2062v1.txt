For the SUSY 2007 conference, I was asked to review the topic of indirect searches for dark matter. As part of that talk, I summarized several observations which have been interpreted as the product of dark matter annihilations. In my contribution to the proceedings, I have decided to focus on this aspect of my talk. In particular, I will discuss the cosmic positron spectrum measured by HEAT, the 511 keV emission from the Galactic Bulge measured by INTEGRAL, the diffuse galactic and extragalactic gamma ray spectra measured by EGRET, and the microwave excess from the Galactic Center observed by WMAP.
