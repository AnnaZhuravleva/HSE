We derive constraints on mixed dark-matter scenarios consisting of primordial black holes (PBHs) and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In these scenarios, we expect a density spike of the WIMPs that are gravitationally bound to the PBHs, which results in an enhanced annihilation rate and increased indirect detection prospects. We show that such scenarios provide strong constraints on the allowed fraction of PBHs that constitutes the dark matter, depending on the WIMP mass $m_{\chi}$ and the velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$. For the standard scenario with $m_{\chi} = 100\,{\rm GeV}$ and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 3 \times 10^{-26}\,{\rm cm}^{3} / {\rm s}$, we derive bounds that are stronger than all existing bounds for PBHs with masses $10^{-12}\,M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{4}\,M_{\odot}$, where $M_{\odot}$ is the solar mass, and mostly so by several orders of magnitude.
