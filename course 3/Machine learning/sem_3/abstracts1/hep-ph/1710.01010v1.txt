Entropy production in multiparticle systems is investigated by analysing the experimental data on ion-ion collision at AGS and SPS energies and comparing the findings with those reported earlier for hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is observed that the entropy produced in limited and full phase space, when normalised to maximum rapidity exhibits a kind of scaling which is nicely supported by Monte Carlo model \hij. Using the R\'{e}nyi's order-q information entropy, multifractal characteristics of particle production are examined in terms of Generalized dimensions, D$_{q}$. Nearly the same values of multifractal specific heat, \(c\) observed in hadronic and ion-ion collisions over a wide range of incident energies suggest that the quantity \(c\) may be used as a universal characteristic of multiparticle production in hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.
