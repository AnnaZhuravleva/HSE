We investigate the mass range of the quark-antiquark fluctuations of the photon that are active in producing the total photoabsorption cross section in the color dipole picture, emphasizing the notion of color transparency and saturation. We consider the implications of measurements at future extensions of the available electron-proton-scattering energy.
