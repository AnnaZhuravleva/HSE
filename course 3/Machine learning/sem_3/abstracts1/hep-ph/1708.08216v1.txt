The effect of two loop correction in the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet is studied with the introduction of the two loop correction factor in the mean field potential. Due to the correction factor it shows stability in the droplet formation of QGP indicating at different parametrization factors of the QGP fluid. The correction factor in the potential also shows gluon parameter factor shifts to a larger value from its earlier value of gluon factor of one loop correction in obtaining the stable droplets. The results show decreasing in the observable QGP droplets and droplet sizes are found to be $1.5-2.0$ fm radii with the two loop correction. It indicates that there is parameter like Reynold's number which can control the dynamics of QGP droplet formation and the stability of droplet in the case of droplet formation with the two loop correction factor.
