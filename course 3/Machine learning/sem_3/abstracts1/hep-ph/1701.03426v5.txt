We study the excited muon production at the FCC based muon-hadron colliders. We give the excited muon decay widths and production cross section. We deal with the $\mu p\rightarrow\mu^{\star}q\rightarrow\mu\gamma q$ process and we plot the transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass distributions of final state particles to get the discovery cuts. By using discovery cuts, we get the mass limits for excited muons. It is shown that the discovery limits on the mass of $\mu^{\star}$ are 2.2 TeV, 5.9 TeV and 7.5 TeV for $\mu63$-FCC, $\mu750$-FCC and $\mu1500$-FCC, respectively.
