We propose a Pati-Salam extension of the standard model incorporating a flavor symmetry based on the $\Delta \left( 27\right)$ group. The theory realizes a realistic Froggatt-Nielsen picture of quark mixing and a predictive pattern of neutrino oscillations. We find that, for normal neutrino mass ordering, the atmospheric angle must lie in the higher octant, CP must be violated in oscillations, and there is a lower bound for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay rate. For the case of inverted mass ordering, we find that the lower atmospheric octant is preferred, and that CP can be conserved in oscillations. Neutrino masses arise from a low-scale seesaw mechanism, whose messengers can be produced by a $Z^{\prime }$ portal at the LHC.
