We present an upgraded calculation of the effects of resonance-continuum interference for the Higgs boson decaying to two photons at the Large Hadron Collider, at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_S$, $O(\alpha_S^3)$, and including transverse-momentum ($q_T$) resummation at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We study the importance of the interference contribution in different transverse-momentum regions, with a particular focus on the low $q_T$ region $q_T^2 << Q^2$ (with $Q^2$ being the invariant diphoton mass) where resummation becomes essential for a reliable calculation.
