We study a scenario that large non-Gaussianity arises from the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. There are baryogenesis scenarios containing a light scalar field, which may result in baryonic isocurvature perturbations with some amount of non-Gaussianity. As an explicit example we consider the Affleck-Dine mechanism and show that a flat direction of the supersymmeteric standard model can generate large non-Gaussianity in the curvature perturbations, satisfying the observational constraints on the baryonic isocurvature perturbations. The sign of a non-linearity parameter, f_{NL}, is negative, if the Affleck-Dine mechanism accounts for the observed baryon asymmetry; otherwise it can be either positive or negative.
