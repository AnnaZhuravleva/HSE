The three-site Pati-Salam gauge model provides a consistent description for the hints of lepton-flavor non-universality observed in $B$ decays, connecting the present pattern of "anomalies" to the origin of the Standard Model Yukawa couplings. We present here a detailed analysis of the model predictions for a series of low-energy observables, mainly in $B$ and $\tau$ physics. The model is in good agreement with present data and predicts a well-defined pattern of non-standard effects in low-energy observables that could allow us to test it in the near future. Particularly interesting are the predictions of large $\tau\to\mu$ Lepton Flavor Violating processes, such as $\tau \to \mu\gamma$, $\tau \to 3\mu$, $B\to K \tau \mu$, and $B_s\to\tau\mu$. Also $\mu \to 3 e$, $\mu \to e\gamma$, and $K_L \to \mu e$ decays could be not far from the present exclusion bounds, although this conclusion is more model dependent.
