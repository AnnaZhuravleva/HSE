This paper explores the effects of both finite width and interference (with background) in the pair production and decay of extra heavy quarks with charge 2/3 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This dynamics is normally ignored in standard experimental searches and we assess herein the regions of validity of current approaches, also evaluating the performances of a set of current experimental analyses at 8 and 13 TeV for the deterimination of the excluded regions in the $(M_{\rm VLQ},\Gamma_{\rm VLQ})$ plane, $M_{\rm VLQ}$ being the mass of the VLQ and $\Gamma_{\rm VLQ}$ its width. Further, we discuss the configurations of masses, widths and couplings where the latter breaks down.
