We describe the phenomenology of light singlet Higgs bosons in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetry Model (NMSSM) which are mostly decoupled from the rest of Supersymmetry. Noting that the Large Hadron Collider has not excluded this scenario, we describe previous searches for light Higgs bosons at the Large Electron Positron collider and evaluate the sensitivity to neutralino production and decay to light singlet Higgs bosons at the proposed $\sqrt{s}=250$~GeV Circular Electron Positron Collider.
