We propose new mechanisms for small neutrino masses based on clockwork mechanism. The Standard Model neutrinos and lepton number violating operators communicate through the zero mode of clockwork gears, one of the two couplings of the zero mode is exponentially suppressed by clockwork mechanism. Including all known examples for the clockwork realization of the neutrino masses, different types of models are realized depending on the profile and chirality of the zero mode fermion. Each type of realization would have phenomenologically distinctive features with the accompanying heavy neutrinos.
