We calculate a class of three-loop Feynman diagrams which contribute to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic approximation for the width difference $\Delta\Gamma_{s}$ in the $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ system. The considered diagrams contain a closed fermion loop in a gluon propagator and constitute the order $\alpha_s^2 N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of light quarks. Our results entail a considerable correction in that order, if $\Delta\Gamma_{s}$ is expressed in terms of the pole mass of the bottom quark. If the $\overline{MS}$ scheme is used instead, the correction is much smaller. As a result, we find a decrease of the scheme dependence. Our result also indicates that the usually quoted value of the NLO renormalization scale dependence underestimates the perturbative error.
