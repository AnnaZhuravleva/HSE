Observations of long rang azimuthal correlations in small collision systems (p+p/A) have triggered an enormous excitement in the heavy-ion community. However, it is presently unclear to what extent the experimentally observed correlations should be attributed to initial state momentum correlations and/or the final state response to the initial state geometry. We discuss how a consistent theoretical description of the non-equilibrium dynamics is important to address both effects within a unified framework and present first results from weakly coupled non-equilibrium simulations in \cite{Greif:2017bnr} to quantify the relative importance of initial state and final state effects based on theoretical calculations.
