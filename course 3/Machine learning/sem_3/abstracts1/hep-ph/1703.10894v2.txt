We proposed to introduce general messenger-matter interactions in the deflected anomaly mediated SUSY breaking scenario to explain the $g_\mu-2$ anomaly. Scenarios with complete or incomplete GUT multiplet messengers are discussed, respectively. The introduction of incomplete GUT mulitiplets can be advantageous in various aspects. We found that the $g_\mu-2$ anomaly can be solved in both scenarios under current constraints including the gluino mass bounds, while the scenarios with incomplete GUT representation messengers are more favored by the $g_\mu-2$ data. We also found that the gluino is upper bounded by about 2.5 TeV (2.0 TeV) in Scenario A and 3.0 TeV (2.7 TeV) in Scenario B if the generalized deflected AMSB scenarios are used to fully account for the $g_\mu-2$ anomaly at $3\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) level. Such a gluino should be accessible in the future LHC searches. Dark matter constraints, including DM relic density and direct detection bounds, favor the scenario B with incomplete GUT multiplets. Much of the allowed parameter space for the scenario B could be covered by the future DM direct detection experiments.
