We find that the chromomagnetic instability existing in neutral two- flavor color superconductivity at moderate densities is removed by the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate of charged gluons and the corresponding induction of a magnetic field. It is shown that this inhomogeneous ground state is energetically favored over a homogeneous one. The spontaneous induction of a magnetic field in a color superconductor at moderate densities can be of interest for the astrophysics of compact stellar objects exhibiting strong magnetic fields as magnetars.
