We present a novel approach to compute Generalized Parton Distributions within the Lightfront Wave Function overlap framework. We show how to systematically extend Generalized Parton Distributions computed within the DGLAP region to the ERBL one, fulfilling at the same time both the polynomiality and positivity conditions. We exemplify our method using pion Lightfront Wave Functions inspired by recent results of non-perturbative continuum techniques and algebraic nucleon Lightfront Wave Functions. We also test the robustness of our algorithm on reggeized phenomenological parameterizations. This approach paves the way to a better understanding of the nucleon structure from non-perturbative techniques and to a unification of Generalized Parton Distributions and Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions phenomenology through Lightfront Wave Functions.
