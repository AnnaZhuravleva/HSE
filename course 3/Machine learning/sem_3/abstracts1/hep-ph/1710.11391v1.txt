We present the cross sections for both electromagnetic and diffractive dissociation of protons for semiexclusive production of $J/\psi$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Differential distributions in missing mass ($M_X$), as well as distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of the $J/\psi$ are calculated for $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 13 TeV proton proton collisions. We compare the distributions for purely electromagnetic and purely diffractive proton excitations/dissociation. We predict cross sections for electromagnetic and diffractive excitations of similar order of magnitude.
