In this short review I discuss how high energy (type I) seesaw models can be nicely embedded within grand-unified models and reproduce the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry with leptogenesis. In particular, after discussing general features and results in leptogenesis,   I focus on $SO(10)$-inspired leptogenesis and on a particular solution, the strong thermal $SO(10)$-inspired solution, that provides an interesting way to understand neutrino mixing parameters: the non-vanishing reactor mixing angle, the emerging negative sign of $\sin\delta$ and the slight hints favouring normally ordered neutrino masses and an atmospheric mixing angle in the first octant. I also briefly discuss leptogenesis within two right-handed seesaw neutrino models. In this case a a third decoupled right-handed neutrino can provide a candidate for very heavy cold decaying dark matter produced from right-handed neutrino mixing with a mass in the TeV-EeV range and its decays would give a contribution to the IceCube high energy neutrino events in addition to an astrophysical component.
