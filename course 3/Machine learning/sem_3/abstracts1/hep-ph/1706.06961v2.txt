Isospin splittings in baryons with two heavy quarks and a $u$ or $d$ quark are calculated using simple methods proposed previously by the authors. The results are   $M(\Xi_{cc}^{++})-M(\Xi_{cc}^+) = 1.41 \pm 0.12^{+0.76}$ MeV,   $M(\Xi_{bb}^0) - M(\Xi_{bb}^-) = - 4.78 \pm 0.06^{+0.03}$ MeV, and   $M(\Xi_{bc}^+)-M(\Xi_{bc}^0)=-1.69 \pm0.07 ^{+0.39}$ MeV, where the statistical errors reflect uncertainties in input mass splittings, and the systematic errors are associated with the choice of constituent-quark masses.
