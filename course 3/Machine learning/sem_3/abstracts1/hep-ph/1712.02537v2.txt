We present the analytic calculation of the Master Integrals necessary to compute the planar massive QCD corrections to Di-photon (and Di-jet) production at hadron colliders. The masters are evaluated by means of the differential equations method and expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms and one- or two-fold integrals of polylogarithms and irrational functions, up to transcendentality four.
