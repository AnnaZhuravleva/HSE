We calculate the decay constants of light and heavy-light pseudoscalar and vector mesons with improved soft-wall holographic wavefuntions, which take into account the effects of both quark masses and dynamical spins. We find that the predicted decay constants, especially for the ratio $f_V/f_P$, based on light-front holographic QCD, can be significantly improved, once the dynamical spin effects are taken into account by introducing the helicity-dependent wavefunctions. We also perform detailed $\chi^2$ analyses for the holographic parameters ({\it i.e.} the mass-scale parameter $\kappa$ and the quark masses), by confronting our predictions with the data for the charged-meson decay constants and the meson spectra. The fitted values for these parameters are generally in agreement with those obtained by fitting to the Regge trajectories. At the same time, most of our results for the decay constants and their ratios agree with the data as well as the predictions based on lattice QCD and QCD sum rule approaches, with only a few exceptions observed.
