We present comprehensive global fits of supersymmetric (SUSY) models from the Global and Modular Beyond-the-Standard-Model Inference Tool (GAMBIT) collaboration, based on arXiv:1705.07935 and arXiv:1705.07917. We investigate several variants of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, a fully constrained version (CMSSM) with universal scalar ($m_0$), gaugino ($m_{1/2}$) and trilinear masses ($A_0$) at the gauge coupling unification scale, a similar model that is relaxed by adding an extra parameter for the soft Higgs masses (NUHM1), another where the soft Higgs masses are also split (NUHM2) and finally a weak scale MSSM7 model. We use the public GAMBIT global fitting framework and take into account all relevant data to reveal the regions of parameter space with the highest likelihood. Our results reveal that all models have very heavy scenarios that are well out of reach of the LHC, but will be probed by forthcoming dark matter experiments, as well as a stop-co-annihilation region which has better prospects for detection in collider experiments. The stau co-annihilation region is excluded from the CMSSM at $2 \sigma$ but is present in the NUHM1 and NUHM2 variants. Finally by relaxing constraints in the NUHM1, NUHM2 and MSSM7 we see additional regions appear: lighter chargino co-annihilation region, sbottom co-annihilation and $h/Z$ funnels.
