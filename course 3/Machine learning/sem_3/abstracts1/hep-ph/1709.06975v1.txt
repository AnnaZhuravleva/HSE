I present approximate N$^3$LO theoretical results for top-antitop pair production, and for single-top production in association with a $W$ boson. The higher-order corrections are from soft-gluon radiation, which is dominant near partonic threshold. I present results for total cross sections as well as transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the top quark, and compare with data at LHC energies.
