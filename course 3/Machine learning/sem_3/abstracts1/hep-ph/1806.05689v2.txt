We address the $B$-physics anomalies within a two scalar leptoquark model. The low-energy flavor structure of our set-up originates from two $SU(5)$ operators that relate Yukawa couplings of the two leptoquarks. The proposed scenario has a UV completion, can accommodate all measured lepton flavor universality ratios in $B$-meson decays, is consistent with related flavor observables, and is compatible with direct searches at the LHC. We provide prospects for future discoveries of the two light leptoquarks at the LHC and predict several yet-to-be-measured flavor observables.
