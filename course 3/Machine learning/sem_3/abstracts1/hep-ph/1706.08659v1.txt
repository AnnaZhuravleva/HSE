We study the dynamics of the Affleck-Dine field after inflation in more detail. After inflation, the Affleck-Dine field inevitably oscillates around the potential minimum. This oscillation is hard to decay and can cause accidental suppression of the consequential baryon asymmetry. This suppression is most effective for the model with non-renormalizable superpotential $W_{AD}\sim \Phi^4$ ($\Phi$: Affleck-Dine field). It is found that the Affleck-Dine leptogenesis in high-scale inflation, which suffers from serious gravitino overproduction, becomes workable owing to this effect.
