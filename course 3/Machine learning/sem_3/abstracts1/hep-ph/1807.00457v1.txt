An attempt is made to present the influence of the scalar unparticle on some scattering processes in the Randall - Sundum model. The contribution of the scalar unparticle on the production of Higgs - radion at high energy colliders is studied in detail. We evaluate the production cross-sections in the electron-positron ($e^{+}e^{-}$), photon-photon ($\gamma\gamma$) and gluon-gluon ($gg$) collisions, which depend strongly on the collision energy $\sqrt{s}$, the scaling dimension $d_{U}$ of the unparticle operator $\mathcal{O}_{U}$ and the energy scale $\Lambda_{U}$. Numerical evaluation shows that the cross - sections for the pair production of scalar particles are much larger than that of the associated production of the scalar particle with unparticle in the same condition
