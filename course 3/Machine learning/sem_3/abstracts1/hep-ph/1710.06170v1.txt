We discuss the possibility of realising a multi-component dark matter scenario with widely separated dark matter masses: one having keV scale mass and the other with GeV-TeV scale mass, within the framework of left right symmetric models. To reduce the level of fine tuning, we consider a version of left right model with universal seesaw where keV-GeV scale right handed neutrinos having tiny mixing with light neutrinos can be naturally realised. Due to gauge interactions, both the dark matter candidates are produced thermally in the early Universe but overproducing the keV mass candidate. We consider one of the right handed neutrinos to be decaying at late epochs, just before the big bang nucleosynthesis, in order to dilute the thermally overproduced keV dark matter. We constrain the parameter space from the requirement of producing sub-dominant keV-TeV dark matter, satisfying indirect detection constraints from gamma ray searches and producing the tantalising 3.55 keV monochromatic X-ray line, reported by several groups to be present in galaxy and galaxy cluster data, from the decay of a 7.1 keV dark matter on cosmological scales. We find that these requirements constrain the right sector gauge boson masses to be much heavier than the present collider sensitivity, but can have interesting signatures at experiments like the IceCube.
