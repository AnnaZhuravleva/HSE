We estimate the target-normal single-spin asymmetry at nearly forward angles in elastic electron-nucleon scattering. In the leading-order approximation, this asymmetry is proportional to the imaginary part of the two-photon exchange (TPE) amplitude, which can be expressed as an integral over the doubly virtual Compton scattering (VVCS) tensor. We develop a model that parameterizes VVCS tensor for the case of nearly forward scattering angles. Our parameterization ensures a proper normalization of the imaginary part of the TPE amplitude on the well-known forward limit expression, which is given in terms of nucleon structure functions measurable in inelastic electron-nucleon scattering experiments. We discuss applicability limits of our theory and provide target-normal single-spin asymmetry predictions for both elastic electron-proton and electron-neutron scattering.
