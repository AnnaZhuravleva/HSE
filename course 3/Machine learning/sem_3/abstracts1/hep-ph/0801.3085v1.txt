The high energy proton beams expected when the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) comes online should provide a pass/fail test for a gravity-related explanation of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. The model predicts that particles have two kinds energies, equal for null gravitational potentials and, in the potential at the Earth, differing significantly above one TeV. If correct, a 7 TeV trajectory energy proton at the LHC would deliver a 23.5 TeV particle state energy in a collision.
