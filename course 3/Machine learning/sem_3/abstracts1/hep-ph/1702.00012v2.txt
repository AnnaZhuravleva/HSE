We propose a new table-top experimental configuration for the direct detection of dark matter axions with mass in the $(10^{-6} \rm eV - 10^{-2} \rm eV)$ range using non-perturbative effects in a system with non-trivial spatial topology. Different from most experimental setups found in literature on direct dark matter axion detection, which relies on $\dot{\theta}$ or $\vec{\nabla}\theta$, we found that our system is in principle sensitive to a static $\theta\geq 10^{-14}$ and can also be used to set limit on the fundamental constant $\theta_{\rm QED}$ which becomes the fundamental observable parameter of the Maxwell system if some conditions are met. Connection with Witten effect when the induced electric charge $e'$ is proportional to $\theta$ and the magnetic monopole becomes the dyon with non-vanishing $e'=-e \frac{\theta}{2\pi}$ is also discussed.
