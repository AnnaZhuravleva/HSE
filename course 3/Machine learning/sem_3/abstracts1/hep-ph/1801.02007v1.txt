Deviations from the standard model prediction have been reported in various semileptonic $B$ decays mediated via $b \to c$ charged current interactions. In this context, we analyze semileptonic baryon decays $\Xi_b \to \Xi_c\,\tau\,\nu$ using the helicity formalism. We report numerical results on various observables such as the decay rate, ratio of branching ratio, lepton side forward backward asymmetries, longitudinal polarization fraction of the lepton, and the convexity parameter for this decay mode using results of relativistic quark model. We also provide an estimate of the new physics effect on these observables under various new physics scenarios.
