The 1-loop effects of the MSSM at the ILC are investigated through numerical analysis. We studied the higgs production processes $e^-e^+\rightarrow Zh$ and $e^-e^+\rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}h$ at the ILC. It is found that the magnitude of the MSSM contribution through the 1-loop effects is sizable enough to be detected. In the study, three sets of the MSSM parameters are proposed, which are consistent with the observed higgs mass, the muon $g$-$2$, the dark matter abundance and the decay branching ratios of $B$ mesons. In the $e^-e^+\rightarrow Zh$ process, the 1-loop effects of the MSSM are visible and the distinction of the parameter sets is partially possible. For the study of $e^-e^+\rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}h$, we used the equivalent $\it W$-boson approximation in the evaluation of the 1-loop cross section. While the 1-loop effect of the MSSM is visible, the distinction of the parameter sets might not be possible in this process under the value of realistic luminosity at the ILC.
