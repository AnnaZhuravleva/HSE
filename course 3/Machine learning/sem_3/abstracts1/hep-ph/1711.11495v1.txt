We use a non-relativistic model to study the mass spectroscopy of a tetraquark composed by $c \, \bar{c} \, c \, \bar{c}$ quarks in the diquark-antidiquark picture. By numerically solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a Cornell-inspired potential, we separate the four-body problem into three two-body problems. Spin-dependent terms (spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor) are used to describe the splitting structure of the $c\bar{c}$ spectrum and are also extended to the interaction between diquarks. Recent experimental data on charmonium states are used to fix the parameters of the model and a satisfactory description of the spectrum is obtained. We find that the spin-dependent interaction is sizable in the diquark-antidiquark system, despite of the heavy diquark mass, and that the diquark has a finite size if treated in analogy to the $c\bar{c}$ systems. We find that the lowest $S$-wave $T_{4c}$ tetraquarks might be below their thresholds of spontaneous dissociation into low-lying charmonium pairs, while orbital and radial excitations would be mostly above the corresponding charmonium pair threshold. These states could be investigated in the forthcoming experiments at LHCb and Belle II.
