We propose a model of neutrino mass matrix with large $SU(2)$ multiplets and gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry, in which we introduce $SU(2)$ quartet scalar and quintet fermions with nonzero $L_\mu - L_\tau$ charge. Then we investigate the neutrino mass structure and explore phenomenologies of large multiplet fields at the collider, particularly, focussing on doubly- and singly- charged exotic leptons from the quintet.
