We perform the investigation of two-body hidden-bottom transitions of the $\Upsilon(6S)$, which include $\Upsilon(6S) \to \Upsilon(1^3D_J) \eta~~(J=1,2,3)$ decays. For estimating the branching ratios of these processes, we consider contributions from the triangle hadronic loops composed of S-wave $B_{(s)}$ and $B_{(s)}^*$ mesons, which are a bridge to connect the $\Upsilon(6S)$ and final states. Our results show that both of the branching ratios of these decays can reach $10^{-3}$. Due to such considerable potential to observe these two-body hidden-bottom transitions of the $\Upsilon(6S)$, we suggest the forthcoming Belle II experiment to explore them.
