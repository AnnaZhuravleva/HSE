We consider an alternative mechanism for the production of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. It is basically due to vacuum pair creation (VPC) of vector bosons (W and Z) as a consequence of a rapid W and Z mass generation during the electroweak phase transition in the early Universe. The mechanism is as follows: after their pair crreation, the vector bosons may either annihilate directly into photons or decay into leptons and quarks which subsequently annihilate as lepton-antilepton and quark-antiquark pairs into photons. Preliminary estimates show that the number of CMB photons obtained this way can be sufficient to explain the presently observed CMB photon density. In this contribution we present an exactly soluble model for vacuum pair creation kinetics.
