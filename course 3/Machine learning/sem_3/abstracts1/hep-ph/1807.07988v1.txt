We propose that the radiative generation of the neutrino mass can be achieved by incorporating the kinetic mixing of fermion fields which arises radiatively at 1 loop level. As a demonstrative example of the application of the mechanism, we will present the particular case of Standard Model extension by U(1)$_D$ symmetry. As a result, we show how neutrino masses can be generated via kinetic mixing portal instead of mass matrix with residual symmetries responsible for stability of multicomponent dark matter.
