We investigate the universality of truncation schemes for Dyson-Schwinger equations developed for quantum chromodynamics in theories which differ from quantum chromodynamics only in the gauge group. Our specific choices are the gauge groups $SU(2)$ and $G_2$, for which lattice calculations at nonvanishing chemical potential are possible. Thus, corresponding calculations can provide benchmarks for testing calculations with functional equations. We calculate the quark and gluon propagators and determine the chiral and dual chiral condensates at vanishing density to determine the confinement/deconfinement and chiral transitions, respectively. We can reproduce the expected type of transitions in the quenched and unquenched cases. In general, all three theories react very similarly to modifications of the employed model for the quark-gluon vertex.
