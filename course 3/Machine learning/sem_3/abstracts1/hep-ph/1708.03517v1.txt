We study the possibility of identifying a boosted resonance that decays into a charm pair against different sources of background using QCD event shapes, which are promoted to jet shapes. Using a set of jet shapes as input to a boosted decision tree, we find that observables utilizing the simultaneous presence of two charm quarks can access complementary information compared to approaches relying on two independent charm tags. Focusing on Higgs associated production with subsequent $H\to c \bar{c}$ decay and on a CP-odd scalar $A$ with $m_A \leq 10$ GeV we obtain the limits $\mathcal{B}r(H\rightarrow c\bar{c})\leq 6.09\%$ and $\mathcal{B}r(H\rightarrow A(\rightarrow c\bar{c}) Z)\leq 0.01\%$ at $95\%$ C.
