Transversity generalized parton distributions (GPDs) appear as scalar functions in the decomposition of off-forward quark-quark and gluon-gluon correlators with a parton helicity flip. For a spin 1 hadron, we find 9 transversity GPDs for both quarks and gluons at leading twist 2. We study these twist-2 chiral odd quark transversity GPDs for the deuteron in a light cone convolution model, based on the impulse approximation, and using the lowest Fock-space state for the deuteron.
