A comparison study of world data for the structure function F2 for Iron, as measured by both charged lepton and neutrino scattering experiments, is presented. Consistency of results for both charged lepton and neutrino scattering is observed for the full global data set in the valence regime. Consistency is also observed at low x for the various neutrino data sets, as well as for the charged lepton data sets, independently. However, data from the two probes exhibit differences on the order of 15% in the shadowing/anti-shadowing transition region where the Bjorken scaling variable x is < 0.15. This observation is indicative that neutrino probes of nucleon structure might be sensitive to different nuclear effects than charged lepton probes. Details and results of the data comparison are here presented.
