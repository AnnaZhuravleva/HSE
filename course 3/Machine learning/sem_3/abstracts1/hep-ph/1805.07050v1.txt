We interest to investigate of the three-body decays of $B^{0}$ meson to $ \phi\pi^+\pi^- $ and $B_s^{0}$ meson to $ \phi \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$. Hadronic three-body decays include both nonresonant and resonant contributions, on the basis of the factorization hypothesis. In this analysis, resonant structure is exhibited only in the $ \pi^+\pi^-$ channel which the resonant contribution can be described by S-wave, P-wave and D-wave $ \pi^+\pi^-$ contribution from $ f_0(980)$, $ \rho$ and $f_2$ mesons and other possible resonance. Therefore, the theoretical values at the scale $ m_b$ are $(1.69 \pm 0.19 )\times10^{-7}$ and $(3.28\pm 0.17 )\times10^{-6}$, while the experimental results of them are $(1.82 \pm 0.25 )\times10^{-7}$ and $(3.48\pm 0.23 )\times10^{-6}$, respectively. Comparing computation analysis values with experimental values show that our results at the scale $\mu_b $ are in agreement with them.
