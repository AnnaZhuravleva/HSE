In this paper, we calculate the $B\to D$ transition form factors (TFFs) within the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) and predict the ratio $\mathcal{R}(D)$. More accurate $D$-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) are essential to get a more accurate theoretical prediction. We construct a new model for the twist-3 DAs $\phi^p_{3;D}$ and $\phi^\sigma_{3;D}$ based on the QCD sum rules under the background field theory for their moments as we have done for constructing the leading-twist DA $\phi_{2;D}$. As an application, we observe that the twist-3 contributions are sizable in whole $q^2$-region. Taking the twist-2 and twist-3 DAs into consideration, we obtain $f^{B\to D}_{+,0}(0) = 0.659^{+0.029}_{-0.032}$. As a combination of the Lattice QCD and the QCD LCSR predictions on the TFFs $f^{B\to D}_{+,0}(q^2)$, we predict $\mathcal{R}(D) = 0.320^{+0.018}_{-0.021}$, which improves is about $1.5\sigma$ deviation from the HFAG average of the Belle and BABAR data. At present the data are still of large errors, and we need further accurate measurements of the experiment to confirm whether there is signal of new physics from the ratio $\mathcal{R}(D)$.
