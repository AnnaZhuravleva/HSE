To discuss the possible contribution of parafermions to the dark matter abundance, we extend the Boltzmann equation for fermionic dark matter to include parafermions. Parafermions can accommodate $r$ particles per quantum state $(2\le r<\infty)$, where the parafermion of order $r=1$ is identical to the ordinary fermion. It is found that the parafermionic dark matter can be more abundant than the fermionic dark matter in the present universe.
