We extend existing work on reparametrization invariance (RPI) of the heavy-quark expansion. We discuss the total rates of inclusive processes and obtain results which have a manifest RPI and can be expressed through matrix elements of operators and states defined in full QCD. This approach leads to a partial re-summation of higher-order terms in the heavy-quark expansion and has the advantage that the number of independent parameters is reduced.
