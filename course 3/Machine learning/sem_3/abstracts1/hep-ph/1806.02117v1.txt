We report the effect of including repulsive interactions on various thermodynamic observables calculated using a S-matrix based Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model to already available corresponding results with only attractive interactions \cite{Dash:2018can}. The attractive part of the interaction is calculated by parameterizing the two body phase shifts using K-matrix formalism while the repulsive part is included by fitting to experimental phase shifts which carry the information about the nature of interaction. We find that the bulk thermodynamic variables for a gas of hadrons such as energy density, pressure, entropy density, speed of sound and specific heat are suppressed by the inclusion of repulsive interactions and more sensitive for second and higher order correlation and fluctuation, particularly for the observable $\chi^2_Q$, $\chi^2_B-\chi^4_B$ and $C_{BS}$. We find a good agreement for the $C_{BS}$ and lattice QCD simulations. Additionally, assuming that the value of interacting pressure versus temperature for a gas of hadrons calculated in S-matrix formalism is same as that from a van der Waals HRG (VDHRG) model, we have quantified the attractive and repulsive interactions in our model in terms of attractive and repulsive parameters used in the VDHRG model. The values of parameters thus obtained are comparable to that which reproduces the properties of nuclear matter in the ground state.
