It has recently been suggested that a scale invariant "unparticle" sector with a non-trivial infrared fixed point may couple to the Standard Model (SM) via higher dimensional operators. The weakness of such interactions hides the the unparticle phenomena at low energies. We demonstrate how cosmology and astrophysics can place significant bounds on the strength of unparticle-SM interactions. We also discuss the possibility of a having a non-negligible unparticle relic density today.
