It has recently been proposed that the relatively inert, highly symmetric, neutral flavor singlet scalar hadron made of uuddss quarks may have a mass < 2 (m_p + m_e). This is consistent with QCD theory, and with existing accelerator and non-accelerator constraints. For mass in the 1.5-1.8 GeV range, the observed DM relic abundance and the observed DM to ordinary matter ratio can emerge naturally. Dark matter freezes out before primordial nucleosynthesis and does not significantly impact primordial abundances, so the conventional argument that DM is non-baryonic does not apply. The interaction cross section between DM and the gas in the Galaxy is such that the dark matter in our local neighborhood is naturally co-rotating with the solar system, to a sufficient degree that DM may not have enough energy to be detected in applicable DM experiments. Interaction with the gas in galactic disks provides the first (non-MONDian) explanation for the striking correlation in the small-scale structure of rotation curves and the inhomogeneous distribution of gas, and also accounts (unlike MOND) for instances of galaxies not exhibiting such correlations. Depending on the cross-section, a DM-baryon interaction can produce a dark matter disk as suggested by recent studies, and has many or all virtues of self-interacting DM (SIDM) for removing inconsistencies of LCDM. Lab experiments to discover this particle are discussed.
