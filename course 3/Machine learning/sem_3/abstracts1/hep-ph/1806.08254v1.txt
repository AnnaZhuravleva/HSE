From 't Hooft's argument, one expects that the analyticity domain of an asymptotically free quantum field theory is horned shaped. In the usual Borel summation, the function is obtained through a Laplace transform and thus has a much larger analyticity domain. However, if the summation process goes through the process called acceleration by Ecalle, one obtains such a horn shaped analyticity domain. We therefore argue that acceleration, which allows to go beyond standard Borel summation, must be an integral part of the toolkit for the study of exactly renormalisable quantum field theories. We sketch how this procedure is working and what are its consequences.
