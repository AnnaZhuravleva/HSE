The NNPDF collaboration has recently presented NNPDF3.1, a new determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton including a number of new data, some of which are particularly sensitive to the gluon PDF at large x. In this contribution, we present the results of two new analyses based on NNPDF3.1. First, we study the impact of the ATLAS 2011 7 TeV inclusive jet data on the gluon PDF including different rapidity bins. Second, we quantitatively compare the constraints provided by all measurements sensitive to the large-x gluon PDF, namely inclusive jet cross sections, the transverse momentum distributions of the Z-boson and top-pair rapidity distributions.
