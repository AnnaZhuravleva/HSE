The proposed LDMX experiment would provide roughly a meter-long region of instrumented tracking and calorimetry that acts as a beam stop for multi-GeV electrons in which each electron is tagged and its evolution measured. This would offer an unprecedented opportunity to access both collider-invisible and ultra-short lifetime decays of new particles produced in electron (or muon)-nuclear fixed-target collisions. In this paper, we show that the missing momentum channel and displaced decay signals in such an experiment could provide world-leading sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter, millicharged particles, and visibly or invisibly decaying axions, scalars, dark photons, and a range of other new physics scenarios.
