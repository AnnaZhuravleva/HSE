The $ spin $ $ light$ $ of $ $neutrino $ ($SL\nu$) is a phenomenon of electromagnetic radiation by a massive neutrino moving in external media that is originated owing to neutrino magnetic moment. In this short paper we note on the importance of this effect in the light of its connection with the neutrino magnetic moment, recap its basic properties in dense matter and give some general criteria for its best efficiency in nature. On this basis we propose a set of possible astrophysical environments where the $SL\nu$ can be manifested in principle.
