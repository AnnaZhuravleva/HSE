In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), axial charge is known to be non-conserved due to chiral anomaly and non-vanishing quark mass. In this paper, we explore the role of quark mass in axial charge fluctuation and dissipation. We present two separate calculations of axial charge correlator, which describe dynamics of axial charge. The first is free quarks at finite temperature. We find that axial charge can be generated through effective quantum fluctuations in free theory. However the fluctuation does not follow a random walk behavior, and also does not relax to thermodynamic limit. The second calculation is in weakly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP). We find in the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation, the quark-gluon interaction leads to random walk growth of axial charge, but dissipation is not visible. We estimate relaxation time scale for axial charge, finding it lies beyond the HTL regime. We also obtain correlator of axial charge in the hydrodynamic approximation, and show generically that axial charge settles to thermodynamic limit in sufficient long time.
