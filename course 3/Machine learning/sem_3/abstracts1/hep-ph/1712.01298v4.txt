Quantum field theory, which is the basis for all of particle physics, requires that all processes respect $CPT$ invariance. It is therefore of paramount importance to test the validity of $CPT$ conservation. In this Letter, we show that the time-dependent, indirect $CP$ asymmetries involving $B$ decays to a $CP$ eigenstate contain enough information to measure $T$ and $CPT$ violation in $B^0$-${\bar B}^0$ mixing, in addition to the standard $CP$-violating weak phases. Entangled $B^0{\bar B}^0$ states are not required (so that this analysis can be carried out at LHCb, as well as at the $B$ factories), penguin pollution need not be neglected, and the measurements can be made even if the $B^0$-${\bar B}^0$ width difference vanishes.
