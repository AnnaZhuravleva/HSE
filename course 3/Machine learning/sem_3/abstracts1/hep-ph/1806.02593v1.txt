Some of the difficulties faced when calculating multi-loop amplitudes with several mass scales are reviewed. We then focus on one particular difficulty, the evaluation of the Feynman integrals, and introduce the program pySecDec which can be used to numerically compute such integrals. Some of the new features and in particular the sector symmetry finder, which can help to reduce the number of sectors to be numerically integrated after sector decomposition, are described.
