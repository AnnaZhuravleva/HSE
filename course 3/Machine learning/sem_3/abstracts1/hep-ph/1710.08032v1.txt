Flavor physics has been crucial in the development of particle physics and it will keep being so in the future. Nowadays, this kind of processes, in particular lepton flavor changing observed in neutrino oscillations, give us the clearest evidence of the fact that the Standard Model of fundamental interactions needs to be modified. Some of the most popular theories that try to asses this issue postulate the existence of new heavy right-handed neutrinos, with masses in the energy range that the LHC experiment is currently exploring. In this thesis, we study the connection between the possible existence of these neutrinos and charged lepton flavor changing physics. We consider the inverse seesaw model as a particular realization of a low scale seesaw model and analyze its lepton flavor violating phenomenology, in particular the Higgs and Z boson decays to two charged leptons of different flavor. Moreover, we also explore the possibility of having new exotic lepton flavor violating signals at the LHC, coming from the production and decay of these new heavy neutrinos.
