We present a fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order calculation of the Higgs pair production in association with a $Z$ boson, which is important for probing the trilinear Higgs self-coupling. The next-to-next-to-leading-order corrections enhance the next-to-leading order total cross sections by a factor of $1.2\sim 1.5$, depending on the collider energy, and change the shape of next-to-leading order kinematic distributions. We discuss how to determine the trilinear Higgs self-coupling using our results.
