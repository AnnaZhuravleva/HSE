We calculate the angular distribution spectra between beauty ($B$) and anti-beauty ($\bar B$) mesons in proton-proton collisions in the leading order approximation of the parton Reggeization approach consistently merged with the next-to-leading order corrections from the emission of additional hard gluon. To describe b-quark hadronization we use the universal scale-depended parton-to-meson fragmentation functions extracted from the world $e^+e^-$ annihilation data. We have obtained good agreement between our predictions and data from the CMS Collaboration at the energy $\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV for $B \bar B$ angular correlations within uncertainties and without free parameters. Predictions for analogous correlation observables at $\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV are provided.
