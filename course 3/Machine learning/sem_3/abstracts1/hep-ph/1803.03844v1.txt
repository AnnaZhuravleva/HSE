Lattice computations of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ suggest that the QCD thermodynamics deep in the hadronic phase can be adequately modeled by an ideal hadron resonance gas (I-HRG). However, it is not clear where on the $(\mu_B, T)$ plane this description breaks down, making it essential to account for hadronic interactions and change in the nature of the degrees of freedom. We have made an estimate of the maximum possible extent of the I-HRG phase on the QCD phase diagram. We work with only those thermodynamic quantities that show a monotonic rise with $T$ and $\mu_B$ with limiting values obtained in the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) limit for a gas of massless quarks and gluons. The rise of these quantities in I-HRG beyond the corresponding SB limit values signal a breakdown of the applicability of I-HRG model to study QCD thermodynamics. While $\chi^Q_2$ provides the tightest bound for $\mu_B/T\leq2$, $C_{BS}=-3\chi^{BS}_{11}/\chi^S_2$ is found to provide the tightest bound for larger values of $\mu_B/T$. For moderately high $\mu_B/T$, the application of I-HRG breaks down for $T$ much lower than the freeze-out curve of heavy ion collisions. This will have implications on the phenomenology of freeze-out in a baryonic fireball.
