We study popular scalar extensions of the Standard Model, namely the singlet extension, the 2-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) and its extension by a singlet scalar. We focus on the contributions of the added scalars to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, and the electric dipole moment of the electron ($e$EDM) in these models. In the absence of CP-violation, CP-even and CP-odd scalars contribute with an opposite sign to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and as a result these models are generally incapable of explaining the observed discrepancy in $(g-2)_\mu$. We show that by introducing CP-violation one can explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a region of the parameter space which is also allowed by the $e$EDM constraints. However, this is shown to work only in Type I and Y 2HDM models and only when all neutral scalars have comparable masses.
