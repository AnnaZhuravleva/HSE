When nuclei collide peripherally at relativistic velocities, a Quark-Gluon Plasma may be formed with much larger values of vorticity than in any other known physical system: the STAR collaboration has reported observations of global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons, generated in such collisions, corresponding to a value of the local angular velocity about $9\,\pm 1\,\times 10^{21}\,\cdot\,$s$^{-1}$ (averaged over impact energies). We show that, in a gauge-gravity model of QGP vorticity, one should nevertheless expect the vorticity to be bounded above in a collision with a given collision energy and centrality; furthermore, this bound is by a quantity which decreases with increasing impact energy. That is, the prediction is that QGP vorticity should be suppressed in collisions at high energy, and one should only expect to see evidence of it in the lower-energy collisions studied in the various Beam Energy Scans. This apparently paradoxical prediction is in fact supported by observational data. The bound is approximately attained in the cases where hyperon polarization is observable; if this is always the case in such experiments, then the model agrees with recent suggestions that these observations are related to a strong dependence of the plasma moment of inertia on impact energy.
