The self-consistent chiral quark-soliton model is a relativistic pion mean-field approach in the large $N_c$ limit, which describes both light and heavy baryons on an equal footing. In the limit of the infinitely heavy mass of the heavy quark, a heavy baryon can be regarded as $N_c-1$ valence quarks bound by the pion mean fields, leaving the heavy quark as a color static source. The structure of the heavy baryon in this scheme is mainly governed by the light-quark degrees of freedom. Based on this framework, we evaluate the electromagnetic form factors of the lowest-lying heavy baryons. The rotational $1/N_c$ and strange current quark mass corrections in linear order are considered. We discuss the electric charge and magnetic densities of heavy baryons in comparison with those of the nucleons. The results of the electric charge radii of the positive-charged heavy baryons show explicitly that the heavy baryon is a compact object. The electric form factors are presented. The form factor of $\Sigma_c^{++}$ is compared with that from a lattice QCD. We also discuss the results of the magnetic form factors. The magnetic moments of the baryon sextet with spin 1/2 and the magnetic radii are compared with other works and the lattice data.
