It was pointed out recently that in some inflationary models quantum loops containing a scalar of mass $m$ that couples to the inflaton can be the dominant source of primordial non-Gaussianities. We explore this phenomenon in the simplest such model focusing on the behavior of the primordial curvature fluctuations for small $m/H$. Explicit calculations are done for the three and four point curvature fluctuation correlations. Constraints on the parameters of the model from the CMB limits on primordial non-Gaussianity are discussed. The bi-spectrum in the squeezed limit and the tri-spectrum in the compressed limit are examined. The form of the $n$-point correlations as any partial sum of wave vectors gets small is determined.
