The spectral index is studied at the point where scalar fields deviate from slow-roll during inflation. Considering the deviation that may cause a significant difference to the time derivative of the Hubble parameter and also to the terms in the evolution equation, we show how the deviation affects the spectral index of the curvature perturbations. Considering conventional inflation, curvatons and other inhomogeneous scenarios as mechanisms for generating the cosmological perturbation, we examine whether the spectral index induced by the deviation from the standard slow-roll can explain the spectral index n-1>0 at k=0.002/Mpc while keeping n-1<0 at a smaller scale.
