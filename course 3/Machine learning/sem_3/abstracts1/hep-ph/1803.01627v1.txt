We discuss fundamental limits of electromagnetic searches for axion and hidden-photon dark matter. We begin by showing the signal-to-noise advantage of scanned resonant detectors over purely resistive broadband detectors. We discuss why the optimal detector circuit must be driven by the dark-matter signal through a reactance; examples of such detectors include single-pole resonators. We develop a framework to optimize dark matter searches using prior information about the dark matter signal (e.g. astrophysical and direct-detection constraints or preferred search ranges). We define integrated sensitivity as a figure of merit in comparing searches over a wide frequency range and show that the Bode-Fano criterion sets a limit on integrated sensitivity. We show that when resonator thermal noise dominates amplifier noise, substantial sensitivity is available away from the resonator bandwidth. Additionally, we show that the optimized single-pole resonator is close to the Bode-Fano limit, establishing the resonator as a near-ideal method for single-moded dark-matter detection. We optimize time allocation in a scanned resonator using priors and derive quantum limits on resonant search sensitivity. We show that, in contrast to some previous work, resonant searches benefit from quality factors above one million, the characteristic quality factor of the dark-matter signal. We also show that the optimized resonator is superior, in signal-to-noise ratio, to the optimized reactive broadband detector at all frequencies at which a resonator may practically be made. At low frequencies, the application of our optimization may enhance scan rates by a few orders of magnitude. Finally, we discuss prospects for evading the quantum limits using backaction evasion, photon counting, squeezing and other nonclassical approaches, as a prelude to Part II.
