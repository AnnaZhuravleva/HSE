We examine the relevance of the heavy quarks masses in the perturbative QCD description of hard interactions where charged kaons are produced in the final state. We extract a set of parton-to-kaon hadronization probabilities from a next to leading order QCD global analysis where a general mass variable flavor number scheme accounting for mass effects is implemented. We compare the results with those obtained in the massless approximation and also with those found in the case of final state pions. At variance with the very significant improvement found for the much more precise pion fragmentation phenomenology, the heavy quark mass dependent scheme improves mildly the overall description of current kaon production data. Nevertheless, the changes in the charm hadronization probability are noticeable.
