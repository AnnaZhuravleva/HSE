We review the recent progress in extracting the proton fluctuating substructure by studying exclusive processes at HERA, and the applications of these developments in the interpretation of the LHC heavy ion data. The possibilities to extract the proton geometry directly from the LHC high-multiplicity proton-nucleus and proton-proton collision data is also discussed.
