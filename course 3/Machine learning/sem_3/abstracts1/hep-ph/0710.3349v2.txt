After a period of inflationary expansion, the   Universe reheated and reached full thermal equilibrium at the reheating temperature T_R. In this work we point out that, in the context of effective low-energy supersymmetric models, LHC measurements may allow one to determine T_R as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle assumed to be either an axino or a gravitino. An upper bound on their mass may also be derived.
