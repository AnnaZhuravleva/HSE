It is a challenging task to explain, in terms of a simple and compelling new physics scenario, the intriguing discrepancies between the standard model expectations and the data for the neutral-current observables $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, as well as the charged-current observables $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$. We show that this can be achieved in an effective theory with only two unknown parameters. In addition, this class of models predicts some interesting signatures in the context of both $B$ decays as well as high-energy collisions.
