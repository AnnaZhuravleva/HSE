We show how, using multipartite entanglement, the symmetries among bosons and fermions of the Standard Model of particle physics emerge. Fermions belong to tripartite maximally entangled classes starting with basic chiral right and left states. Quarks and leptons belong to different classes, with only leptons appearing as asymptotic states in three space dimensions. The Higgs boson is the scalar mode with a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value, other bosons are as usual linked to symmetry generators.
