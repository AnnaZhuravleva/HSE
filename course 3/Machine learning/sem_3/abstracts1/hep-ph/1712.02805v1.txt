The gamma-ray annihilation and decay products of very heavy dark matter particles can undergo attenuation through pair production, leading to the development of electromagnetic cascades. This has a significant impact not only on the spectral shape of the gamma-ray signal, but also on the angular distribution of the observed photons. Such phenomena are particularly important in light of the new HAWC experiment, which provides unprecedented sensitivity to multi-TeV photons and thus to very heavy dark matter particles. In this study, we focus on dark matter in the 100 TeV-100 PeV mass range, and calculate the spectral and angular distribution of gamma-rays from dwarf galaxies and from nearby galaxy clusters in this class of models.
