The direct computation method(DCM) is developed to calculate the multi-loop amplitude for general masses and external momenta. The ultraviolet divergence is under control in dimensional regularization. In this paper we report on the progress of DCM to several scalar multi-loop integrals after the presentation in ACAT2016. Also the discussion is given on the application of DCM to physical 2-loop processes including numerator functions.
