We investigate three possible pentaquark candidates, one of which contains a single charm quark and the other two contain triple charm quarks in their substructure. To this end we apply QCD sum rule method and take into account both the positive and negative parity states corresponding to each possible pentaquark channel having spin $3/2$ or $1/2$. Insisting on the importance of identification of the members of pentaquark family we obtain their spectroscopic parameters such as masses and residues. These parameters are the main inputs in the searches for their electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions.
