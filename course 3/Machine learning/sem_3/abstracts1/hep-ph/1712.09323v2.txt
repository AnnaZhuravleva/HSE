We propose a framework to construct "Domain-Wall Standard Model" in a non compact 5-dimensional space-time, where all the Standard Model (SM) fields are localized in certain domains of the 5th dimension and the SM is realized as a 4-dimensional effective theory without any compactification for the 5th dimension. In this context, we investigate the collider phenomenology of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes of the SM gauge bosons and the current constraints from the search for a new gauge boson resonance at the LHC Run-2. The couplings of the SM fermions with the KK-mode gauge bosons depend on the configuration of the SM fermions in the 5-dimensional bulk. This "geometry" of the model can be tested at the future Large Hadron Collider experiment, once a KK-mode of the SM gauge boson is discovered.
