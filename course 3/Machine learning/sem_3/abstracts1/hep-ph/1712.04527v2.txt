In a recent work the authors have presented a general algorithm to extend the Matrix Element Method (MEM) to the hadronic production of coloured partons taking into account next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this article, the general algorithm is applied to the production of single top quarks at the LHC. In particular, the generation of unweighted events following the NLO predictions is presented. Treating these events as the result of a toy experiment we illustrate the first application of the Matrix Element Method at NLO QCD for hadronic jet production. As a concrete example, we study the determination of the top-quark mass. We show that the inclusion of the NLO corrections can lead to sizeable effects compared to the Matrix Element Method relying on leading-order predictions only and that the incorporation of the NLO corrections is mandatory to obtain reliable estimates of the theoretical uncertainties. In addition, we find that measuring the top-quark mass using the MEM in single top-quark production offers an interesting alternative to mass measurements in top-quark pair production.
