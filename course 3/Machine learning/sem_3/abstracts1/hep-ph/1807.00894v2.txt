This work presents an interpretation of high precision jet data from the ATLAS experiment in terms of exclusion limits for new coloured matter. To this end, the effect of a new coloured fermion with a mass $m_X$ on the solution of the renormalization group equation QCD is studied. Theoretical predictions for the transverse energy-energy correlation function and its asymmetry are obtained with such a modified solution and, from the comparison to data, 95\% CL exclusion limits are set on such models.
