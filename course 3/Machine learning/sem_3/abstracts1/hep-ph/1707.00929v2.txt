We propose a minimally extended gauge symmetry model with $U(1)_R$, where only the right-handed fermions have nonzero charges in the fermion sector. To achieve both anomaly cancellations and minimality, three right-handed neutrinos are naturally required, and the standard model Higgs has to have nonzero charge under this symmetry. Then we find that its breaking scale($\Lambda$) is restricted by precise measurement of neutral gauge boson in the standard model; therefore, ${\cal O}$(10) TeV$\lesssim \Lambda$. We also discuss its testability of the new gauge boson and discrimination of $U(1)_R$ model from $U(1)_{B-L}$ one at collider physics such as LHC and ILC.
