MC models of multiple partonic scattering inevitably introduce many free parameters, either fundamental to the models or from their integration with MC treatments of primary-scattering evolution. This non-perturbative and non-factorisable physics in particular cannot currently be constrained from theoretical principles, and hence parameter optimisation against experimental data is required. This process is commonly referred to as MC tuning. We summarise the principles, problems and history of MC tuning, and the still-evolving modern approach to both model optimisation and estimation of modelling uncertainties.
