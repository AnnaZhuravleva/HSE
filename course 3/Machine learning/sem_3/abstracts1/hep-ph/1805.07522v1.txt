We study the effect of charged-Higgs-induced chromomagnetic operator, $Q_{8G}(-) \equiv \bar s \sigma^{\mu \nu} T^a \gamma_5 d G^a_{\mu \nu}$, on the Kaon direct CP violation $Re(\epsilon'/\epsilon)$. Using the matrix element $\langle \pi \pi | O_{8G}(-) | K^0 \rangle$ recently obtained by a large $N_c$ dual QCD approach, we find that if the Kobayashi-Maskawa phase is the origin of CP violation, the charged-Higgs-induced gluon penguin dipole operator in the type-III two-Higgs-doublet model can explain the measured $Re(\epsilon'/\epsilon)$ when the constraints from the relevant low energy flavor physics, such as $\Delta B(K)=2$, $B\to X_s \gamma$, and Kaon indirect CP violation parameter $\epsilon$, are included.
