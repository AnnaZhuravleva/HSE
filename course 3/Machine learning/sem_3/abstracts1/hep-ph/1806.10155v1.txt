We investigate the implications of scalar and tensor operators proposed to accommodate the hints of lepton flavor universality violation in charged-current $B$-meson decays. We show that these scenarios unavoidably induce chirality enhanced contributions to charged lepton magnetic moments and Yukawa couplings. By using an effective field theory approach we quantify in a model independent way the connection of the $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$ anomaly with the tau $g-2$ and the Higgs decay $h\to \tau\tau$, which can offer an alternative to test these scenarios. Concrete New Physics models giving rise to our setup will be illustrated.
