We fit the unfolded data of $\bar{B}^0\rightarrow D^{*+} \ell \overline{\nu}$ from the Belle experiment, where $\ell \equiv e, \mu$, using a method independent of heavy quark symmetry to extrapolate to zero-recoil and extract the value of $|V_{cb}|$. This results in $|V_{cb}| = (41.9^{~+2.0}_{~-1.9})\times 10^{-3}$, which is robust to changes in the theoretical inputs and very consistent with the value extracted from inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays.
