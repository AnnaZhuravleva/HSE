Leptoquarks have been suggested to solve a variety of discrepancies between the expected and observed phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate the effect of scalar leptoquarks on the lepton flavor violating B meson rare decays which involve the quark level transition $\bar{b} \to \bar{s} \ell^-_i \ell^+_j(i \neq j)$. The leptoquark parameter space is constrained by using the recently measured upper limits on the $\mathcal{B}(B_s^0 \to \ell^-_i \ell^+_j)$ and $\mathcal{B}(B \to K^{(*)}\ell^-_i \ell^+_j)$. Using such constrained leptoquark parameter space, some relevant physical quantities are also predicted and we find that the constrained New Physics parameters in the leptoquark model have very obvious effects on the relevant physical quantities in this paper. With future measurements of observable in $B \to K^{(*)}\ell^-_i \ell^+_j$ decays at the LHCb, more and more differentiated from the other NP explanations could be tested.
