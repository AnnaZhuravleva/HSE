We study the phenomenological implications of the presence of two texture zeros in the neutrino mass matrix assuming that the neutrino mixing matrix has its first column identical to that of the tribimaximal mixing matrix. Only two patterns of this kind are compatible with the experimental data. These textures have definite predictions for the neutrino observables that are testable in future neutrino experiments.
