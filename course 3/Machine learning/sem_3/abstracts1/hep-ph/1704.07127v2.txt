We consider radiative corrections to false vacuum decay within the framework of quantum mechanics for the general potential of the form 1/2 M q^2 (q-A)(q-B), where M , A and B are arbitrary parameters. For this type of potential we provide analytical results for Green function in the background of corresponding bounce solution together with one loop expression for false vacuum decay rate. Next, we discuss the computation of higher order corrections for false vacuum decay rate and provide numerical expressions for two and three loop contributions.
