We suggest that generalized parton distributions can be probed in charged current meson production process, $ep\to\nu_{e}\pi^{-}p$. In contrast to pion photoproduction, this process is sensitive to the unpolarized GPDs $H,\,E$, and for this reason has a very small contamination by higher twist and Bethe-Heitler type contributions. Since all produced hadrons are charged, we expect that the kinematics of this process could be easily reconstructed. We estimated the cross-sections in the kinematics of upgraded 12 GeV Jefferson Laboratory experiments and found that thanks to large luminosity the process can be measured with reasonable statistics.
