We present a new method for the local subtraction of infrared divergences at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, for generic infrared-safe observables. Our method attempts to conjugate the minimal local counterterm structure arising from a sector partition of the radiation phase space with the simplifications following from analytic integration of the counterterms. In this first implementation, the method applies to final-state massless particles. We show how our method compactly organises infrared subtraction at NLO, we deduce in detail the general structure of the subtraction terms at NNLO, and we provide a proof of principle with a complete application to a simple process at NNLO.
