We compute correlation functions of three-dimensional Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory with the Functional Renormalisation Group. Starting from the classical action as only input, we calculate the non-perturbative ghost and gluon propagators as well as the momentum-dependent ghost-gluon, three-gluon, and four-gluon vertices in a comprehensive truncation scheme. Compared to the physical case of four spacetime dimensions, we need more sophisticated truncations due to significant contributions from non-classical tensor structures. In particular, we apply a special technique to compute the tadpole diagrams of the propagator equations, which captures also all perturbative two-loop effects, and compare our correlators with lattice and Dyson-Schwinger results.
