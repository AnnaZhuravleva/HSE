Recently, there are two hints arising from physics beyond the standard model. One is a possible energy loss mechanism due to emission of very weakly interacting light particles from white dwarf stars, with a coupling strength ~ 0.7x10^{-13}, and another is the high energy positrons observed by the PAMELA satellite experiment. We construct a supersymmetric flipped-SU(5) model, SU(5)xU(1)_X with appropriate additional symmetries, [U(1)_H]_{gauge}x[U(1)_RxU(1)_\Gamma]_{global}xZ_2, such that these are explained by a very light electrophilic axion of mass 0.5 meV from the spontaneously broken U(1)_\Gamma and two component cold dark matters from Z_2 parity. We show that in the flipped-SU(5) there exists a basic mechanism for allowing excess positrons through the charged SU(2) singlet leptons, but not allowing anti-proton excess due to the absence of the SU(2) singlet quarks. We show the discovery potential of the charged SU(2) singlet E at the LHC experiments by observing the electron and positron spectrum. With these symmetries, we also comment on the mass hierarchy between the top and bottom quarks.
