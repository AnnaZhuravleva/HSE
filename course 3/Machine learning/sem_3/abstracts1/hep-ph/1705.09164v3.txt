Given the recent progress in dark matter direction detection experiments, we examine a light bino-higgsino dark matter (DM) scenario ($M_1<100$ GeV and $\mu<300$ GeV) in natural supersymmetry with the electroweak fine tuning measure $\Delta_{EW}<30$. By imposing various constraints, we note that: (i) For $sign(\mu/M_1)=+1$, the parameter space allowed by the DM relic density and collider bounds can almost be excluded by the very recent spin-independent (SI) scattering cross section limits from the XENON1T (2017) experiment. (ii) For $sign(\mu/M_1)=-1$, the SI limits can be evaded due to the cancelation effects in the $h\tilde{\chi}^0_1\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ coupling, while rather stringent constraints come from the PandaX-II (2016) spin-dependent (SD) scattering cross section limits, which can exclude the higgsino mass $|\mu|$ and the LSP mass $m_{\tilde{\chi}^0_1}$ up to about 230 GeV and 37 GeV, respectively. Furthermore, the surviving parameter space will be fully covered by the projected XENON1T experiment or the future trilepton searches at the HL-LHC.
