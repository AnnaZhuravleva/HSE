Mini-jets and mini-dijets provide useful information on multiple parton interactions in the low transverse-momentum (low-$p_T$) region. As a first step to identify mini-jets and mini-dijets, we study the clustering properties of produced particles in the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle space, in high-energy $pp$ collisions. We develop an algorithm to find mini-jet-like clusters by using the k-means clustering method, in conjunction with a k-number (cluster number) selection principle. We test the clustering algorithm using minimum-bias events generated by PYTHIA8.1, for $pp$ collision at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We find that multiple mini-jet-like and mini-dijet-like clusters of low-$p_T$ hadrons occur in high multiplicity events. However similar clustering properties are also present for particles produced randomly in a finite pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle space. The ability to identify an azimuthally back-to-back correlated mini-jet-like clusters as physical mini-jets and mini-dijets will therefore depend on the additional independent assessment of the dominance of the parton-parton hard-scattering process in the low-$p_T$ region.
