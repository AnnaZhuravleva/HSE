We review recent theoretical improvements of Monte Carlo event generators for top-quark pair production and decay at the LHC based on the POWHEG method. We present an event generator that implements spin correlations and off-shell effects in top-decay chains described in terms of exact matrix elements for $pp\to \ell^+\nu_{\ell}\, l^-\bar{\nu}_{l} \,b \,\bar b$ at order $\alpha^4 \alpha_s^2$, including full NLO QCD corrections and interference effects with single-top and non-resonant topologies yielding to the same final state. We then compare its predictions to previous generators that implement NLO corrections only in the top-pair production dynamics. We consider the mass distributions of the $Wj_{\rm B}$ and $\ell j_{\rm B}$ systems, proxies for direct top-mass determinations, and jet-vetoed cross section, a probe of the $Wt$ single top contribution.
