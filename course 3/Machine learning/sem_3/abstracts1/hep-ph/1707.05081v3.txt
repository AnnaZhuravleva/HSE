We formulate a set of mass relations for the baryon octet and decuplet with positive and negative parity in terms of the order parameter of QCD chiral symmetry. The Gell-Mann--Okubo mass formula and Gell-Mann's equal spacing rule hold manifestly in this approach. Thermal masses of the baryons are calculated in the mean field approximation for various pion masses, and the results are compared with the recent lattice studies. A general trend of the nucleon, $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ parity-doublers seen in the available lattice data can be understood qualitatively. Expected mass modifications of other strange baryons are also given with the physical and heavier pion masses.
