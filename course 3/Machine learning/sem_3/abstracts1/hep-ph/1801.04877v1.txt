We extend our framework for the automated calculation of dijet soft functions to observables that do not obey the non-Abelian exponentiation theorem, like jet-veto or grooming soft functions that are sensitive to clustering effects of the jet algorithm. Although the matrix element for uncorrelated double emissions has a simpler structure than the one for correlated emissions, we argue that its singularity structure poses more stringent constraints on the required phase-space parametrisation. Our algorithm applies to both SCET-1 and SCET-2 soft functions and it is implemented in the novel program SoftSERVE. We present results for various jet-veto observables and obtain new predictions for the soft-drop jet-grooming algorithm.
