In this talk we discuss Feynman integrals which are related to elliptic curves. We show with the help of an explicit example that in the set of master integrals more than one elliptic curve may occur. The technique of maximal cuts is a useful tool to identify the elliptic curves. By a suitable transformation of the master integrals the system of differential equations for our example can be brought into a form linear in $\varepsilon$, where the $\varepsilon^0$-term is strictly lower-triangular. This system is easily solved in terms of iterated integrals.
