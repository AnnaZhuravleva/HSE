We propose two possibilities to explain an excess of electron/positron flux around 1.4 TeV recently reported by Dark Matter Explore (DAMPE) in the framework of radiative seesaw models where one of them provides a fermionic dark matter candidate, and the other one provides a bosonic dark matter candidate. We also show unique features of both models regarding neutrino mass structure.
