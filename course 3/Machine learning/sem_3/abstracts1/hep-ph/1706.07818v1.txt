We study different phenomenological signatures associated with new spin-2 particles. These new degrees of freedom, that we call hidden gravitons, arise in different high-energy theories such as extra-dimensional models or extensions of General Relativity. At low energies, hidden gravitons can be generally described by the Fierz-Pauli Lagrangian. Their phenomenology is parameterized by two dimensionful constants: their mass and their coupling strength. In this work, we analyze two different sets of constraints. On the one hand, we study potential deviations from the inverse-square law on solar-system and laboratory scales. To extend the constraints to scales where the laboratory probes are not competitive, we also study consequences on astrophysical objects. We analyze in detail the processes that may take place in stellar interiors and lead to emission of hidden gravitons, acting like an additional source of energy loss.
