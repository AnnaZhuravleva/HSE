We provide an asymptotically safe Pati-Salam embedding of the Standard Model. Safety is achieved by adding to the theory gauged vector-like fermions and by employing recently developed large number-of-flavor techniques and results. We show that the gauge, scalar quartic and Yukawa couplings achieve an interacting ultraviolet fixed point below the Planck scale. The minimal model is a relevant example of a Standard Model extension in which unification of all type of couplings occurs because of a dynamical principle, i.e. the presence of an ultraviolet fixed point. This extension differs from the usual Grand Unified Theories scenario in which only gauge couplings unify and become free with the remaining couplings left unsafe.
