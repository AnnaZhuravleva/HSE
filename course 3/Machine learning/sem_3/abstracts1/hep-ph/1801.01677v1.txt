The charmonium photoproduction in high energy nuclear collisions is important not only in ultra peripheral events where there is no hadroproduction but also in semi-central events where the hot medium is created. Unlike the hadroproduction which is significantly suppressed by the hot medium, the coherent $\gamma A\to \Psi A$ process happens on the surfaces of the colliding nuclei and is only weakly affected by the fireball. We calculate the yield ratio of $\psi'$ to $J/\psi$ in the frame of a transport approach and find that its low transverse momentum behavior is still controlled by the photoproduction in semi-central nuclear collisions at the LHC energy.
