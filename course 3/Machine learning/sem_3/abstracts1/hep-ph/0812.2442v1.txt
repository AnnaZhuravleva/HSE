Gravity-mediated SUSY breaking models with R-parity conservation give rise to dark matter in the universe. I review neutralino dark matter in the minimal supergravity model (mSUGRA), models with non-universal soft SUSY breaking terms (NUSUGRA) which yield a well-tempered neutralino, and models with unified Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale (as may occur in an SO(10) SUSY GUT theory). These latter models have difficulty accommodating neutralino dark matter, but work very well if the dark matter particles are axions and axinos.
