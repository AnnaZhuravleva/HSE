Some Beyond the Standard Models suggested that fermions might have composite substructure. The existence of excited quarks is going to be the strong proof for the compositeness of Standard Model fermions. Therefore, the excited quarks have been investigated by the phenomenological and the experimental high energy physicists at various collider options for more than 40 years. The Future Circular Collider (FCC) is newly planned particle accelerator to be established at CERN. Beside the $\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV proton-proton collisions, FCC includes electron-positron and electron-proton collision options. Construction of linear $e^- e^+$ colliders (or dedicated e-linac) tangential to the FCC will give opportunity to handle multi-TeV $ep$ and $\gamma p$ collisions. We executed a simulation of the resonance production of the excited $u$ quark at FCC based $\gamma p$ colliders with choosing both the polarized and unpolarized photon beams. It was showed that the Lorentz structure of the $q^*$-$q$-$\gamma$ vertex can be determined by the photon beam polarization. The attainable mass limits of excited $u$ quark reached the highest values when the polarized photon beam was chosen. The ultimate compositeness scale values, also, will be handled by appropriate choice of the photon beam polarization.
