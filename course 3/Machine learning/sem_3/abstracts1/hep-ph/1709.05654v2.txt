We study the phase diagram of two-flavor massless QCD at finite baryon density by applying the functional renormalization group (FRG) for a quark-meson model with $\sigma, \pi$, and $\omega$ mesons. The dynamical fluctuations of quarks, $\sigma$, and $\pi$ are included into the flow equations, while the amplitudes of $\omega$-fields are also allowed to fluctuate. At high temperature the effects of the $\omega$-field on the phase boundary are qualitatively similar to the mean-field calculations; the phase boundary is shifted to the higher chemical potential region. As the temperature is lowered, however, the transition line bends back to the lower chemical potential region, irrespective to the strength of the vector coupling. In our FRG calculations, the driving force of the low temperature first order line is the fluctuations rather the quark density, and the effects of $\omega$-fields have little impact. At low temperature, the effective potential at small $\sigma$ field is very sensitive to the infrared cutoff scale, and this significantly affects our determination of the phase boundaries. The critical chemical potential at the tricritical point is affected by the $\omega$-field effects but its critical temperature stays around the similar value. Some caveats are given in interpreting our model results.
