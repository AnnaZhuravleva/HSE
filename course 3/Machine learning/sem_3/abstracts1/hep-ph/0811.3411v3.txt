It has been recently proposed that the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe may have its origin in "post-sphaleron baryogenesis" (PSB). It is a TeV scale mechanism that is testable at the LHC and other low energy experiments. In this paper we present a theory of PSB within a quark-lepton unified scheme based on the gauge group $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times SU(4)_c$ that allows a direct connection between the baryon asymmetry and neutrino mass matrix. The flavor changing neutral current constraints on the model allow successful baryogenesis only for an inverted mass hierarchy for neutrinos, which can be tested in the proposed long base line neutrino experiments. The model also predicts observable neutron--antineutron oscillation accessible to the next generation of experiments as well as TeV scale colored scalars within reach of LHC.
