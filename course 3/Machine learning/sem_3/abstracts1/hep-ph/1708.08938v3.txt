We estimate contributions from Kaluza-Klein excitations of gauge bosons and physical charge scalar for the explanation of the lepton flavor universality violating excess in the ratios $\mathcal{R}(D)$ and $\mathcal{R}(D^*)$ in 5 dimensional Universal Extra Dimensional scenario with non-vanishing boundary localized terms. This model is conventionally known as non-minimal Universal Extra Dimensional model. We obtain the allowed parameter space in accordance with constraints coming from $B_c \to \tau \nu$ decay, as well as those from the electroweak precision tests.
