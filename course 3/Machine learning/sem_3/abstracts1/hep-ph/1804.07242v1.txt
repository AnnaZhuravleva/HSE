In the framework of the instanton liquid model (ILM), we consider thermal modifications of the gluon properties in different scenarios of temperature $T$ dependence of the average instanton size $\bar{\rho}(T)$ and the instanton density $n(T)$ known from the literature. Due to interactions with instantons, the gluons acquire the dynamical temperature dependent "electric" gluon mass $M_{el}(q,T).$ We found that at small momenta and zero temperature $M_{el}(0,0)\approx362\,{\rm MeV}$, however the $T$-dependence of the mass is very sensitive to the temperature dependence of the instanton vacuum parameters $\bar{\rho}(T),\,n(T)$: it is very mild in case of the lattice-motivated dependence and decreases steeply in the whole range with theoretical parametrization. The inclusion of one-loop thermal gluon corrections gives a rising with temperature contribution $M_{pert,el}(0,T)\sim T$ and allows to reproduce lattice results for the dynamical gluon mass.
