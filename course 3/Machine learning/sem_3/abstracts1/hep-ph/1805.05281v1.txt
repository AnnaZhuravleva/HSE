The Asia-Europe-Pacific School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young physicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances in elementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on quantum field theory and the electroweak Standard Model, the theory of quantum chromodynamics, flavour physics and CP violation, neutrino physics, heavy-ion physics, cosmology and a brief introduction to the principles of instrumentation and detectors for particle physics.
