In the framework of model with Lorentz violation (LV) we discuss a physical observables for $q\bar{q}$ pair production at lepton-lepton colliders and describe the experimental signal to be detected. We obtain a conservative limits on Lorentz-violating dimensionless coupling for quark sector from LEP data. We also make a phenomenological prediction for LV model at the future lepton collider.
