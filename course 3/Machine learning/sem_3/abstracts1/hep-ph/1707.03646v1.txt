The large hierarchy between the Planck scale and the weak scale can be explained by the dynamical breaking of supersymmetry in strongly coupled gauge theories. Similarly, the hierarchy between the Planck scale and the energy scale of inflation may also originate from strong dynamics, which dynamically generate the inflaton potential. We present a model of the hidden sector which unifies these two ideas, i.e., in which the scales of inflation and supersymmetry breaking are provided by the dynamics of the same gauge group. The resultant inflation model is chaotic inflation with a fractional power-law potential in accord with the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The supersymmetry breaking scale can be much smaller than the inflation scale, so that the solution to the large hierarchy problem of the weak scale remains intact. As an intrinsic feature of our model, we find that the sgoldstino, which might disturb the inflationary dynamics, is automatically stabilized during inflation by dynamically generated corrections in the strongly coupled sector. This renders our model a field-theoretical realization of what is sometimes referred to as sgoldstino-less inflation.
