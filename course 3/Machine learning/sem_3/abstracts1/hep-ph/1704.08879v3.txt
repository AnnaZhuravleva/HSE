We study the contribution of the torsion-descendent four-fermion contact interaction to the decay width of a neutral (pseudo)scalar field into a fermion pair. This new interaction comes from the existence of gravitational torsion in models with extra dimensions. Additionally, we exemplify the formalism with two examples: first, the variation of the considered branching ratio of the Higgs in the context of the standard model, and second the proper variations of the scalar and pseudo scalar fields of the type II-1 two Higgs doublets model.
