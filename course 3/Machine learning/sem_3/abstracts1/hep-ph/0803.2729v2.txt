We investigate the influence of primordial perturbations of the energy density and space--time metric on the generation of the lepton and baryon asymmetries. In the weak and strong washout regimes baryon isocurvature perturbations with amplitudes of the same order as those of the CMB perturbations are generated on scales of order of the respective Hubble scale. They are, however, completely washed out by baryon and photon diffusion at the later stages of the universe's evolution.
