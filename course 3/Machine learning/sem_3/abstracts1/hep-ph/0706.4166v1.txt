An epoch of accelerated expansion, or inflation, in the early universe solves several cosmological problems. While there are many models of inflation only recently has it become possible to discriminate between some of the models using observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and large-scale structure. In this talk, we discuss inflation and its observational consequences, and then the status of current cosmological observations and their implications for different models of inflation.
