We propose a minimal extension of the standard model with U(1)_{B-L} \times Z_{2} symmetry. In this model by assuming that the neutrinos are Dirac ({\it i.e.} $B-L$ is an exact symmetry), we found a simultaneous solution for non zero neutrino masses and dark matter content of the universe. The observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is also explained using Dirac Leptogenesis, which is assisted by a dark sector, gauged under a U(1)_D symmetry. The latter symmetry of the dark sector is broken at a TeV scale and thereby giving mass to a neutral gauge boson Z_D. The standard model Z-boson mixes with the gauge boson Z_D at one loop level and thus paves a way to detect the dark matter through spin independent elastic scattering at terrestrial laboratories.
