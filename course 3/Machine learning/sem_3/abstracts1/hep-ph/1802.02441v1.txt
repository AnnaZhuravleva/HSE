We estimate transverse single spin asymmetry (TSSA) in electroproduction of $J/\psi$ for J-Lab and EIC energies. We present estimates of TSSAs in $J/\psi$ production within generalized parton model (GPM) using recent parametrizations of gluon Sivers function (GSF) and compare the results obtained using color singlet model (CSM) with those obtained using color evaporation model (CEM) of quarkonium production.
