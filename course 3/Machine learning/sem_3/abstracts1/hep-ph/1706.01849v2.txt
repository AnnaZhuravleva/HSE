The Bessel-inspired behavior of parton densities at small Bjorken $x$ values, obtained in the case of the flat initial conditions for DGLAP evolution equations, is used along with "frozen" and analytic modifications of the strong coupling constant to study the so-called EMC effect. Among other results, this approach allowed predicting small $x$ behavior of the gluon density in nuclei.
