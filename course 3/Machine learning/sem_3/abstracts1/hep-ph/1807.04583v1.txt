We present a formalism to resum large threshold logarithms to all orders in perturbative QCD for the rapidity distribution of any colorless particle at the hadron colliders. Using the derived resummed coefficients in two dimensional Mellin space, we present the rapidity distributions for the Higgs as well as for the Drell-Yan production to NNLO+NNLL accuracy at the LHC. The resummed distributions give stable prediction against the variation of unphysical renormalisation and factorisation scales in both the cases. Perturbative convergence is also improved with the inclusion of the resummed result.
