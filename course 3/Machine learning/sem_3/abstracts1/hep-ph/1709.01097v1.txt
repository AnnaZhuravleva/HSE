We present a new implementation of the NNLO QCD corrections to three-jet final states and related event-shape observables in electron--positron annihilation. Our implementation is based on the antenna subtraction method, and is performed in the NNLOJET framework. The calculation improves upon earlier results by taking into account the full kinematical information on the initial state momenta, thereby allowing the event orientation to be computed to NNLO accuracy. We find the event-orientation distributions at LEP and SLC to be very robust under higher order QCD corrections.
