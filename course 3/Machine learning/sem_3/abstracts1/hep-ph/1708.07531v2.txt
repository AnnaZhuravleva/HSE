The forward proton detectors recently installed and operating at the LHC open the possibility to observe photon collisions with high precision, providing a novel window on physics beyond the Standard Model. We review recent simulations and theoretical developments about the measurement of anomalous ${\gamma}{\gamma}{\gamma}{\gamma}$ and $Z{\gamma}{\gamma}{\gamma}$ interactions. The searches for these anomalous gauge interactions are expected to set bounds on a wide range of particles including generic electroweak particles, neutral particles with dimension-5 coupling to gauge bosons, polarizable dark particles, and are typically complementary from new physics searches in other channels.
