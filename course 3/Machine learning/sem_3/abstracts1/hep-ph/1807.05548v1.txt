We analyse the origin of dramatic breakdown of diffractive factorisation, observed in single-diffractive (SD) dijet production in hadronic collisions. One of the reasons is the application of the results of measurements of the diagonal diffractive DIS to the off-diagonal hadronic diffractive process. The suppression caused by a possibility of inelastic interaction with the spectator partons is calculated at the amplitude level, differently from the usual probabilistic description. It turns out, however, that interaction with the spectator partons not only suppresses the SD cross section, but also gives rise to the dominant mechanism of SD dijet production, providing yet another important reason for factorization failure. Our parameter-free calculations of the SD-to-inclusive cross section ratio, performed in the dipole representation, agree with the corresponding CDF Tevatron (Run II) data at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV in the relevant kinematic regions. The energy and hard scale dependences demonstrate a trend, opposite to the factorisation-based expectations and similar to the effect observed earlier in diffractive Abelian radiation.
