Finding better ways to prove the Standard Model Effective Field Theory is a very important direction of research. This paper focuses on measurements of Electroweak triple gauge couplings, paying special attention on the regime of validity of the Effective Field Theory (EFT). In this regard, one of our goals is to find measurements leading to a large increase of the interference between the SM amplitude and the contribution of irrelevant operators in the EFT. We propose two such distributions that will lead to a better accuracy. Improvements compared to the traditional methods as well as LHC high luminosity prospects are discussed.
