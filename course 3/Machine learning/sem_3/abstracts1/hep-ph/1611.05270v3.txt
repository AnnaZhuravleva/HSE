We discuss the fine-tuning issue within the MSSM framework. Following the idea that the fine-tuning can measure effects of some missing mechanism, we impose non-universal gaugino masses at the GUT scalem and explore the low scale implications. We realize that the fine-tuning parametrized with Delta_EW can be as low as zero. We consider the stop mass with a special importance and focus on the mass scales as m_stop <=700 GeV, which are excluded by current experiments when the stop decays into a neutralino along with a top quark or a chargino along with a b quark. We find that the stop mass can be as low as about 200 GeV with Delta_EW ~ 50. We find that the solutions in this region can be exluded only up to 60% when stop decays into a neutralino-top quark, and 50% when it decays into a chargino-b quark pair. Setting 65% CL to be potential exclusion and 95% to be pure exclusion limit such solutions will be tested in near future experiments, which are conducted with higher luminosity. In addition to stop, the region with low fine-tuning and light stops predicts masses for the other supersymmetric particles such as m_sbottom >~ 600 GeV, m_stau >~ 1 TeV, m_chargino >~ 120 GeV. The details for the mass scales and decay rates are also provided by tables of benchmark points.
