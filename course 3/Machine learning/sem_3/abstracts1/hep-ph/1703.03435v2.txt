Taking into account the current global information on neutrino oscillation parameters we forecast the capabilities of future long baseline experiments such as DUNE and T2HK in settling the atmospheric octant puzzle. We find that a good measurement of the reactor angle $\theta_{13}$ plays a key role in fixing the octant of the atmospheric angle $\theta_{23}$ with such future accelerator neutrino studies.
