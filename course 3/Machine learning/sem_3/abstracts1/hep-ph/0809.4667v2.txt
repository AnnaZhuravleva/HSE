Gravitino dark matter, together with thermal leptogenesis, implies an upper bound on the masses of superparticles. In the case of broken R-parity the constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis are naturally satisfied and decaying gravitinos lead to characteristic signatures in high energy cosmic rays. We analyse the implications for supergravity models with universal boundary conditions at the grand unification scale. Together with low-energy observables one obtains a window of superparticle masses, which will soon be probed at the LHC, and a range of allowed reheating temperatures.
