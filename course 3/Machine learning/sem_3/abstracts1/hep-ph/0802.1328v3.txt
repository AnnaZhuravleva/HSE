It is shown that, in the context of split supersymmetry, a simple model with a single complex scalar field can produce chaotic inflation and generate the observed amount of baryon asymmetry via the Affleck-Dine mechanism. While the inflaton quantum fluctuations give rise to curvature perturbation, we show that quantum fluctuations of the phase of the scalar field can produce baryonic isocurvature perturbation. Combining with constraints from WMAP data, all parameters in the model can be determined to within a narrow range.
