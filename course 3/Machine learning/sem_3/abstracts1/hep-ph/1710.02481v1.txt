We report computations of the production cross-section of longitudinal electroweak and Higgs boson pairs within Effective Field Theory for the Electroweak sector (including the Higgs). We have recently reported theoretical studies of gauge boson-gauge boson and Higgs-Higgs resonance production with various quantum numbers. We are now focusing on gauge boson-Higgs boson two-body axial-vector resonances and show a typical cross section. At last, we point out that photon-photon production has also been studied (in $e^-e^+$ as well as pp machines), as this is a very clean process allowing access to scalar and tensor resonances.
