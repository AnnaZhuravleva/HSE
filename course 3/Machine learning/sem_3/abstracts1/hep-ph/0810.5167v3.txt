We present a simple model in which dark matter couples to the standard model through a light scalar intermediary that is itself unstable. We find this model has several notable features, and allows a natural explanation for a surplus of positrons, but no surplus of anti-protons, as has been suggested by early data from PAMELA and ATIC. Moreover, this model yields a very small nucleon coupling, well below the direct detection limits. In this paper we explore the effect of this model in both the early universe and in the galaxy.
