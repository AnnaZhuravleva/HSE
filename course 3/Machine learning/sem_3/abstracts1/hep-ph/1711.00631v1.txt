We calculate the shift in masses and decay constants of $D_s(1968)$ and $B_s(5370)$ mesons in hot and dense asymmetric strange hadronic matter using QCD sum rules and chiral SU(3) model. In-medium strange quark condensates $\left\langle \bar{s}s\right\rangle_{\rho_B}$, and gluon condensates $\left\langle \frac{\alpha_{s}}{\pi} {G^a}_{\mu\nu} {G^a}^{\mu\nu} \right\rangle_{\rho_B}$ to be used in the QCD sum rules for pseudoscalar $D_s$ and $B_s$ mesons are calculated using chiral SU(3) model. As an application of our present work, we calculate the in-medium decay widths of the excited (c$\bar{s}$) states $D_s^*(2715)$ and $D_s^*(2860)$ decaying to ($D_s(1968)$,$\eta$) mesons. The medium effects in their decay widths are incorporated through the mass modification of the $D_s(1968)$ and $\eta$ mesons. Results of the present investigation may be helpful to understand the possible outcomes of the future experiments like CBM and PANDA under the FAIR facility.
