Based on models of confinement of quarks, we analyse a relativistic scalar particle subject to a scalar potential proportional to the inverse of the radial distance and under the effects of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the effects of the Lorentz symmetry breaking can induced a harmonic-type potential. Then, we solve the Klein-Gordon equation analytically and discuss the influence of the background of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry on the relativistic energy levels.
