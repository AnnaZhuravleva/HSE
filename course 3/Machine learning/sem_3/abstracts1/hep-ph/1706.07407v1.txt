In the context of searches for long-lived particles (LLP), we have shown, using several benchmarks, that objects which emerge from a secondary vertex due to the decay of an LLP at the TeV scale, are often at large angular separations with respect to the direction of the parent LLP and a fraction of the decay products can even go in the backward direction. These will give rise to striking signatures in the detectors at the LHC. It is worthwhile to perform dedicated searches for these signatures, and we suggest some variables that could be used to identify such unconventional signatures and reduce backgrounds coming from instrumental noise and cosmic rays.
