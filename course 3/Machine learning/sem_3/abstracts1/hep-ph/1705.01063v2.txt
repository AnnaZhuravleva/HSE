We perform a detailed analysis of dark matter signals of supersymmetric models containing an extra $U(1)^\prime$ gauge group. We investigate scenarios in which either the right sneutrino or the lightest neutralino are phenomenologically acceptable dark matter candidates and we explore the parameter spaces of different supersymmetric realisations featuring an extra $U(1)^\prime$. We impose consistency with low energy observables, with known mass limits for the superpartners and $Z^\prime$ bosons, as well as with Higgs boson signal strengths, and we moreover verify that predictions for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon agree with the experimental value and require that the dark matter candidate satisfies the observed relic density and direct and indirect dark matter detection constraints. For the case where the sneutrino is the dark matter candidate, we find distinguishing characteristics among different $U(1)^\prime$ mixing angles. If the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle, its mass is heavier than that of the light sneutrino in scenarios where the latter is a dark matter candidate, the parameter space is less restricted and differentiation between models is more difficult. We finally comment on the possible collider tests of these models.
