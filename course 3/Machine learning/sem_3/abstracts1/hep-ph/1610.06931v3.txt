A hidden sector with pure non-abelian gauge symmetry is an elegant and just about the simplest model of dark matter. In this model the dark matter candidate is the lightest bound state made of the confined gauge fields, the dark glueball. In spite of its simplicity, the model has been shown to have several interesting non-standard implications in cosmology. In this work, we explore the gravitational waves from binary boson stars made of self-gravitating dark glueball fields as a natural and important consequence. We derive the dark SU($N$) star mass and radius as functions of the only two fundamental parameters in the model, the glueball mass $m$ and the number of colors $N$, and identify the regions that could be probed by the LIGO and future gravitational wave observatories.
