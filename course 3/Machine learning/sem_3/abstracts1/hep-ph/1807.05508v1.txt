In this proceedings contribution, we review 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydroQP). Then, we show some recent phenomenological comparisons between the aHydroQP model and some experimental results. We show comparisons between aHydroQP and Pb-Pb 2.76 TeV collisions from the ALICE collaboration and Au-Au 200 GeV collisions from RHIC experiments. We show that the quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics model is able to describe the experimental results for Pb-Pb and Au-Au collisions quite well for many observables such as the spectra, multiplicity, elliptic flow, and HBT radii in many centrality classes.
