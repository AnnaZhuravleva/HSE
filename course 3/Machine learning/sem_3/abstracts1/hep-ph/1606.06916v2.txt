We present a study on the charge current quasi elastic scattering of $\nu_\mu$ from nucleon and nuclei which gives a charged muon in the final state. To describe nuclei, the Fermi Gas model has been used with proposed Pauli suppression factor. The diffuseness parameter of the Fermi distribution has been obtained using experimental data. We also investigate different parametrizations for electric and magnetic Sach's form factors of nucleons. Calculations have been made for CCQES total and differential cross sections for the cases of $\nu_{\mu}-N$, $\nu_{\mu}-^{12}C$ and $\nu_{\mu}-^{56}Fe$ scatterings and are compared with the data for different values of the axial mass. The present model gives excellent description of measured differential cross section for all the systems.
