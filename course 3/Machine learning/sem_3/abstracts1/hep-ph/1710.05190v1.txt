I give a brief review of a few recent developments and future directions in the search for dark matter using high-energy neutrinos from the Sun. This includes the ability to recast neutrino telescope limits on nuclear scattering of dark matter to arbitrary new theories, and new calculations of the solar atmospheric background relevant to such searches. I also touch on applications to global searches for new physics, and prospects for improving searches for asymmetric dark matter in the Sun.
