We analyze how the renowned X(3872), a weakly bound state right below the $D \bar D^*$ threshold, should effectively be included in a hadronic representation of the QCD partition function. This can be decided by analyzing the $D \bar D^*$ scattering phase-shifts in the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ channel and their contribution to the level density in the continuum from which the abundance in a hot medium can be determined. We show that in a purely molecular picture the bound state contribution cancels the continuum providing a vanishing occupation number density at finite temperature and the $X(3872)$ does not count below the Quark-Gluon Plasma crossover happening at $T \sim 150$MeV. In contrast, within a coupled-channels approach, for a non vanishing $c \bar c$ content the cancellation does not occur due to the onset of the $X(3940)$ which effectively counts as an elementary particle for temperatures above $T \gtrsim 250$MeV. Thus, a direct inclusion of the $X(3872)$ in the Hadron Resonance Gas is not justified. We also estimate the role of this cancellation in X(3872) production in heavy-ion collision experiments in terms of the corresponding $p_T$ distribution due to a finite energy resolution.
