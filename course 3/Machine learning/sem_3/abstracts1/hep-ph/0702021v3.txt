We calculate the shear modulus of crystalline color superconducting quark matter, showing that this phase of dense, but not asymptotically dense, three-flavor quark matter responds to shear stress like a very rigid solid. To evaluate the shear modulus, we derive the low energy effective Lagrangian that describes the phonons that originate from the spontaneous breaking of translation invariance by the spatial modulation of the gap parameter $\Delta$. These massless bosons describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal structure and are analogous to the phonons in ordinary crystals. The coefficients of the spatial derivative terms of the phonon effective Lagrangian are related to the elastic moduli of the crystal; the coefficients that encode the linear response of the crystal to a shearing stress define the shear modulus. We analyze the two particular crystal structures which are energetically favored over a wide range of densities, in each case evaluating the phonon effective action and the shear modulus up to order $\Delta^2$ in a Ginzburg-Landau expansion, finding shear moduli which are 20 to 1000 times larger than those of neutron star crusts. The crystalline color superconducting phase has long been known to be a superfluid -- by picking a phase its order parameter breaks the quark-number $U(1)_B$ symmetry spontaneously. Our results demonstrate that this superfluid phase of matter is at the same time a rigid solid. We close with a rough estimate of the pinning force on the rotational vortices which would be formed embedded within this rigid superfluid upon rotation. Our results raise the possibility that (some) pulsar glitches could originate within a quark matter core deep within a neutron star.
