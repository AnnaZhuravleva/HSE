We study the discovery reach of future Dark Matter (DM) Direct Detection experiments using DM-electron scattering in the presence of the solar neutrino background. At these low energies traditional methods for nuclear and electronic recoil discrimination fail, implying that the neutrino-{\it nucleus} scattering background can be sizable. We calculate discovery limits based on ionization values of signal and background, and quantify the dependence on the ionization model. Moreover, we explore how the dependence of the DM cross section discovery limits vary with exposure, electronic/nuclear recoil discrimination, DM form factors, and DM astrophysical uncertainties.
