There may be more than one Higgs boson present near 125 GeV which can not be resolved with current energy resolution at the large hadron collider (LHC). This is the case for beyond the standard models (BSM) such as the next to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM). In order to assess the extent to which current collider, cold dark matter relic density and direct detection limits are capable of discriminating NMSSM scenarios with two mass-degenerate Higgs bosons compared to the case with a single Higgs boson around 125 GeV, we perform global fits of weak-scale phenomenological NMSSM (pNMSSM) with 26 parameters. This is done using the nested sampling implementation in {\sc PolyChord} which is a next-generation tool for Bayesian inference. The Bayesian comparison analyses indicate that the combined collider and cosmological data used favours the pNMSSM scenario where the second to the lightest CP-even Higgs boson is identified as the discovered scalar around 125 GeV. The lightest CP-even Higgs boson is non SM-like. Its mass posterior distribution is centred around 50 GeV. More stringent constraints, perhaps from the LHC searches for BSM Higgs bosons, are needed towards decisive conclusions regarding various possibilities for 125 GeV BSM Higgs bosons.
