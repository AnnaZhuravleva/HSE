We examine in detail the semi-leptonic decay Lambda_b --> Lambda_c tau {\bar \nu}_{\tau}, which may confirm previous hints, from the analogous B decay, of a new physics beyond the standard model. First of all, starting from rather general assumptions, we predict the partial width of the decay. Then we analyze the effects of five possible new physics interactions, adopting five different form factors. In particular, for each term beyond the standard model, we find some constraints on the strength and phase of the coupling. On the one hand, some dimensionless quantities, on which our analysis is based, are substantially independent of the form factor. On the other hand, our study, when combined with those of the B semi-leptonic decay, privileges two of the new physics interactions; moreover, these may be distinguished by a suitable observable involving the differential decay width.
