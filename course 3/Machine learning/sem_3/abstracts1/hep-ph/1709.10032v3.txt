We present our predictions for the inclusive production of two heavy quark-antiquark pairs, separated by a large rapidity interval, in the collision of (quasi-)real photons at the energies of LEP2 and of some future electron-positron colliders. We include in our calculation the full resummation of leading logarithms in the center-of-mass energy and a partial resummation of the next-to-leading logarithms, within the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) approach.
