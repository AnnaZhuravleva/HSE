We revisit the phase diagram of strong-interaction matter for the two-flavor quark-meson model using the Functional Renormalization Group. In contrast to standard mean-field calculations, an unusual phase structure is encountered at low temperatures and large quark chemical potentials. In particular, we identify a regime where the pressure decreases with increasing temperature and discuss possible reasons for this unphysical behavior.
