We propose a unified model of scalar particles that addresses the flavour hierarchies, solves the strong CP problem, delivers a dark matter candidate, and provides the trigger for electroweak symmetry breaking. Besides furnishing a unification of the recently proposed axiflavon with a Goldstone-Higgs sector, the scenario can also be seen as adding a model of flavour (and strong CP conservation along with axion dark matter) to elementary Goldstone-Higgs setups. In particular, we derive bounds on the axion decay constant from the need to generate a SM-like Higgs potential at low energies, which we confront with constraints from flavour physics and cosmology. In the minimal implementation, we find that the axion decay constant is restricted to a thin stripe of $f_a \approx (10^{11}-10^{12})$ GeV, while adding right-handed neutrinos allows to realize a heavy-axion model at lower energies, down to $f_a \sim 10$ TeV.
