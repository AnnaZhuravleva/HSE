Current heavy-ion collision experiments might lead to the discovery of a first-order chiral symmetry breaking phase-transition line, ending in a second-order critical point. Nevertheless, the extraction of information about the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of baryonic matter from the highly dynamic, small, noisy and fluctuating environment formed in such collisions is an extremely challenging task. We address some of the limitations present in the experimental search for the QCD critical point.
