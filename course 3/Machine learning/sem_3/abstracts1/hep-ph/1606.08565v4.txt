We realize non-universal couplings between Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and bulk Standard Model (SM) vectors in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model by including both UV and IR brane-localised gauge kinetic terms. We find that such kinetic terms can reduce the couplings of KK gravitons to SM gauge bosons and also ensure the KK vector masses are consistent with electroweak precision constraints.
