We study the phenomenological constraints and consequences in the flavor sector, of introducing a new fourth generation $\mathcal{Z}_{2}$ odd vector-like lepton doublet along with a Standard Model (SM) singlet scalar and an $SU(2)_{L}$ singlet scalar leptoquark carrying electromagnetic charge of $+2/3$, both odd under a $\mathcal{Z}_{2}$. We show that with little fine tuning among the various Yukawa couplings in the new physics (NP) Lagrangian along with the CKM parameters, the model is able to push the theoretical value of $R(D^{*})^{th}$ from $0.252 \pm 0.003$ to $0.263 \pm 0.051$ and $R(D)^{th}$ from $0.300 \pm 0.008$ to $0.313 \pm 0.158$ compared to the SM value. Especially the NP contributions are able to reduce the discrepancy between experiment and theory of $R(D^{*})$ substantially compared to SM. This is quite impressive given that the model satisfy all other very stringent constrains coming from neutral meson oscillations and precision $Z$-pole data.
