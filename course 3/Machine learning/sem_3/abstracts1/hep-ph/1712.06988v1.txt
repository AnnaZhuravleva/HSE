We briefly summarize up-to-date results on the determination of the parameters of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$, which play an important role in the unitarity triangle and in testing the Standard Model, and recent results on semileptonic $B$ meson decays involving a $\tau$ lepton.
