The tau lepton plays important role in distinguishing neutrino mass patterns and determining the chirality nature in heavy scalar mediated neutrino mass models, in the light of the neutrino oscillation experiments and its polarization measurement. We investigate the lepton flavor signatures with tau lepton at LHC upgrades, i.e. HL-LHC, HE-LHC and FCC-hh, through leptonic processes from doubly charged Higgs in the Type II Seesaw. We find that for the channel with one tau lepton in final states, the accessible doubly charged Higgs mass at HL-LHC can reach 655 GeV and 695 GeV for the neutrino mass patterns of normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) respectively, with the luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$. Higher masses, 975-1930 GeV for NH and 1035-2070 GeV for IH, can be achieved at HE-LHC and FCC-hh.
