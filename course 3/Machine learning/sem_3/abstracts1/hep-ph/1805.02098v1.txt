We consider a model with two gauge singlet fermionic WIMPs communicating with the SM particles by a singlet scalar mediator via a Higgs portal. While the light WIMP is stable and plays the role of the dark matter (DM) candidate, the heavy partner is a short-lived WIMP without contribution to the current DM relic density. Along with the coannihilation effects the heavy WIMP, acting as a mediator in $t$- and $u$-channel DM annihilation cross sections, has a significant effect in finding the viable parameter space against the direct detection constraints provided by XENON1t and LUX experiments. This is an extension to the minimal singlet fermionic DM model whose entire parameter space (except a resonance region) excluded by the latest direct detection experiments. It is found out that there are viable regions in the parameter space which evade direct detection upper bounds and respect the observed DM relic density by WMAP/Planck. This model exemplifies a case within the WIMP paradigm whose DM candidate can escape direct detection experiments nontrivially. Such models are interesting to be studied in collider experiments like the LHC.
