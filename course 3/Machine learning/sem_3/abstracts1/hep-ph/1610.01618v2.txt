$W$ boson pair production processes at $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ colliders have been conventionally interpreted as measurements of $WWZ$ and $WW\gamma$ triple gauge couplings (TGCs). Such interpretation is based on the assumption that new physics effects other than anomalous TGCs are negligible. While this "TGC dominance assumption" was well-motivated and useful at LEP2 thanks to precision electroweak constraints, it is already challenged by recent LHC data. In fact, contributions from anomalous $Z$ boson couplings that are allowed by electroweak precision data but neglected in LHC analyses, being enhanced at high energy, can even dominate over those from the anomalous TGCs considered. This limits the generality of the anomalous TGC constraints derived in current analyses, and necessitates extension of the analysis framework and change of physics interpretation. The issue will persist as we continue to explore the high energy frontier. We clarify and analyze the situation in the effective field theory framework, which provides a useful organizing principle for understanding Standard Model deviations in the high energy regime.
