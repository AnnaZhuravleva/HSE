The properties of possibly existing tetraquarks are studied in the large-$N_{\mathrm{c}}^{}$ limit of QCD by means of four-point correlation functions of meson currents.The necessity of a detailed analysis of the singularities of Feynman diagrams, by means of the Landau equations, to recognize those diagrams that might contribute to the formation of tetraquark states, is emphasized. It is found, in general, that tetraquarks, if they exist, should have narrow widths of the order of $N_{\mathrm{c}}^{-2}$.
