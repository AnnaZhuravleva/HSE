It is shown how high energy neutrino beams from very distant sources can be utilized to learn about many properties of neutrinos such as lifetimes, mass hierarchy, mixing, minuscule pseudo-Dirac mass splittings; in addition, the production mechanism of neutrinos in astrophysical sources can also be elucidated.
