In this paper, potential of the LHC to explore the phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum-like scenario with the small curvature for the process $pp \to p \gamma \gamma p \to p \mu^- \mu^+p $ through the subprocess $\gamma \gamma \to \mu^- \mu^+$ is examined for two forward detector acceptances, $0.0015 < \xi< 0.5$ and $0.1< \xi <0.5$. This process is known to be one of the most clean channels. The sensitivity bounds on the anomalous model parameters have been found at the $95\%$ confidence level for various LHC integrated luminosity values.
