We perform the all orders resummation of threshold enhanced contributions for the Higgs boson pair production cross section via gluon fusion, including finite top quark mass ($M_t$) effects. We present results for the total cross section and Higgs pair invariant mass ($M_{hh}$) distribution. We obtain results at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NLL) which retain the full $M_t$ dependence, and are matched to the full next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction. Our NLL+NLO results represent the most advanced prediction with full $M_t$ dependence for this process, and produce an increase of about 4% in the total cross section with respect to the NLO result for LHC energies, and for a central scale $\mu_0 = M_{hh}/2$. We also consistently combine the full NLL with the next-to-next-to-leading logarithmically (NNLL) accurate resummation computed in the Born-improved large-$M_t$ limit, and match it to the next-to-next-to-leading order approximation of Ref. \cite{Grazzini:2018bsd}, so called NNLO_FTa. We find that the resummation effects are very small at NNLL for $\mu_0 = M_{hh}/2$, in particular below 1% at 13 TeV, indicating that the perturbative expansion is under control. In all cases the resummation effects are found to be substantially larger for the central scale $\mu_0 = M_{hh}$, resulting in a more stable cross section with respect to scale variations than the fixed order calculation.
