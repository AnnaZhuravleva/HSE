The large number of top quarks produced at the LHC and possible future hadron colliders allows to study rare decays of this particle. In many well motivated models of new physics, for example in non-minimal composite-Higgs models, the existence of scalar singlets can induce new flavor-violating top decays surpassing the Higgs contribution by orders of magnitude. We study the discovery prospects of rare top decays within such models and develop new search strategies to test these interactions in top pair-produced events at the LHC. We demonstrate that scales as large as $10$--$50$ TeV can be probed. Improvements by factors of $\sim 1.5$ and $\sim 3$ can be obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 27$ TeV and $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV colliders.
