We consider a scenario of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with $R$-parity violation, where the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the lighter sbottom $(\tilde b_1)$. We study the production of a sbottom pair at the LHC and their subsequent decays through the baryon number violating $(U D D)$ operators leading to a top pair with two light quarks. Looking for both semi-leptonic and fully hadronic (no leptons) final states, we perform cut-based as well as multivariate analyses (MVA) to estimate the signal significance at the 13 TeV run of the LHC. We find that a cut-based analysis can probe sbottom mass upto $\sim 650 $ GeV which may be extended upto $\sim 750 $ GeV using MVA with $300~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. The fully hadronic final state, however, is not as promising.
