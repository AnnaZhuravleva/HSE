We release an event generator package, GR@PPA 2.9, for simulating the direct (single) photon and diphoton (double photon) production in hadron collisions. The included programs were used in our previous studies, in which we have explicitly shown large contributions from parton-associated processes. The programs consistently combine simulations based on matrix elements with parton-shower simulations that reproduce the multiple parton radiation and quark fragmentation to photons. The matrix elements include associated parton production processes up to two partons. We provide instructions for the installation and execution of the programs in this article. The practical performance is also presented.
