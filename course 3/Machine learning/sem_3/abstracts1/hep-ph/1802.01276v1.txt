We calculate the two-body strong decays of the orbitally excited scalars $D_0^*(2400)^{(0,+)}$ and $D_J^*(3000)^{(0,+)}$ using the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter (BS) method, where $D_J^*(3000)^{0}$ was observed recently by LHCb Collaboration, its quantum number has not been determined yet, and we assume it to be the $0^+(2P)$ state. Is this paper, besides the PCAC relation and the low-energy theorem, the effective lagrangian is also used to obtain the transition amplitude. For the $1P$ scalars, $D_0^*(2400)^{0}$ and $ D_0^*(2400)^+$, our estimations of their widths are 226 MeV and 246 MeV, respectively. For $D_J^*(3000)^0$ and $D_J^*(3000)^+$ as the $0^+(2P)$ states, we find their widths are both about 131 MeV, which is a little higher but close to the present experimental data, so $D_J^*(3000)$ is still a strong candidate of the $2^3P_0$ state.
