We study the properties of black holes of mass 10^4--10^{11} GeV in models with the fundamental scale of gravity at the TeV. These black holes could be produced in the collision of a ultrahigh energy cosmic ray with a dark matter particle in our galactic halo or with another cosmic ray. We show that QCD bremsstrahlung and pair production processes are unable to thermalize the particles exiting the black hole, so a chromosphere is never formed during Hawking evaporation. We evaluate with HERWIG the spectrum of stable 4-dim particles emitted during the Schwarzschild phase and find that in all cases it is peaked at energies around 0.2 GeV, with an approximate 43% of neutrinos, 28% of photons, 16% of electrons and 13% of protons. Bulk gravitons are peaked at higher energies, they account for a 0.4% of the particles (16% of the total energy) emitted by the most massive black holes in n=6 extra dimensions or just the 0.02% of the particles (1.4% of the energy) emitted by a 10 TeV black hole for n=2.
