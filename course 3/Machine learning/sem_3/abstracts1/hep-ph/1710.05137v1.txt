These lectures, presented at TASI 2016: Anticipating the Next Discoveries in Particle Physics, provide an introduction to some key methods and tools of indirect dark matter searches. Topics covered include estimation of dark matter signals, thermal freezeout and related scenarios, potential effects of dark matter annihilation on the early universe, modeling photon signals from annihilation or decay, and a brief and qualitative introduction to diffusive propagation of cosmic rays. The second half of the notes gives a status report (circa summer 2016) on selected experimental searches, the resulting constraints and some potential signal candidates. These notes are intended as an introduction to indirect dark matter searches for graduate students, focusing on back-of-the-envelope estimates and useful concepts rather than detailed quantitative computations.
