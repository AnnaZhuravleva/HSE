The rare exclusive dileptonic $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ $(\ell =\mu, \tau)$ decays are investigated in the general two-Higgs-doublet model of type III. A significant enhancement to the branching ratios, differential branching ratios, leptons forward-backward asymmetry, and the $\Lambda$ baryon polarizations over the standard model is obtained. Measurements of these quantities will be useful for establishing the two-Higgs doublet model.
