In this paper, we investigate the effects of dimension six operators in the framework of the standard model (SM) effective field theory on using $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ channel at the LHC with the center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. In this analysis, we only assume leptonic top-quarks. Once the events were simulated, the CMS-measured cross-section was used to constrain the corresponding effective Wilson coefficients at $95\%$ confidence level. Considering the SM effective Lagrangian, the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ events in proton-proton collision were very sensitive to the effective Wilson coefficients $ \bar{C}_{g},\tilde{C_{g}},\bar{C}_{uG},\bar{C}_{uW}$. We show that using $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ events, we can provide stronger constraints on these Wilson coefficients than the current ones obtained from other channels.
