An operator basis of an effective theory with a heavy particle, subject to external gauge fields, is spanned by a particular kind of neutral scalar primary of the nonrelativistic conformal group. We calculate the characters that can be used for generating the operators in a non-relativistic effective field theory, which accounts for redundancies from the equations of motion and integration by parts.
