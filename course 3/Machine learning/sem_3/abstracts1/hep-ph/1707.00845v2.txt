Parton distribution functions (PDFs) with QED corrections extracted from the QED$\otimes$QCD DGLAP evolution equations in the framework of "valon" model. Our results for the PDFs with QED corrections in this phenomenological model are in good agreement with the newly related CT14QED global fit code [Phys. Rev. D93, 114015 (2016)] and APFEL (NNPDF2.3QED) [Computer Physics Communications 185, 1647 (2014)] program in a wide range of $x=[10^{-5}, 1]$ and $Q^2=[0.283, 10^8] \, {\rm GeV}^2$. The model calculations agree rather well with those codes. We also proposed the new method for studying the symmetry breaking of the sea quarks distribution functions inside proton. Then these PDFs set can be used to explore the proton-proton scattering at the LHC era.
