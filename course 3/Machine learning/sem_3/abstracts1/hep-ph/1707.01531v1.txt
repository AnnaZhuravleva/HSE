Higgsplosion is a dynamical mechanism that introduces an exponential suppression of quantum fluctuations beyond the Higgsplosion energy scale E_* and further guarantees perturbative unitarity in multi-Higgs production processes. By calculating the Higgsplosion scale for spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2 particles at leading order, we argue that Higgsplosion regulates all n-point functions, thereby embedding the Standard Model of particle physics and its extensions into an asymptotically safe theory. There are no Landau poles and the Higgs self-coupling stays positive. Asymptotic safety is of particular interest for theories of particle physics that include quantum gravity. We argue that in a Hippsloding theory one cannot probe shorter and shorter length scales by increasing the energy of the collision beyond the Higgsplosion energy and there is a minimal length set by r_* ~ 1/E_* that can be probed. We further show that Higgsplosion in consistent and not in conflict with models of inflation and the existence of axions. There is also a possibility of testing Higgsplosion experimentally at future high energy experiments.
