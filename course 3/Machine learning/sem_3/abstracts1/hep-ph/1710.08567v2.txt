We study the DM-neutrino interaction in the framework of simplified model. The phenomenology of such an interaction are derived. We also investigate the bound on DM-neutrino interaction from the LHC and neutrino telescopes. We find that for the case of a scalar dark matter, the LHC gives a stronger bound on dark matter annihilation cross-section than the neutrino telescopes. However, for the fermionic dark matter case the neutrino telescopes bounds are more stringent for dark matter mass, $\gtrsim 200$ MeV. In the case of lower DM mass, the neutrino telescopes provide better bounds for a light mediator, while the collider bounds are better for a heavy mediator. Possible UV completions of the simplified model are briefly discussed.
