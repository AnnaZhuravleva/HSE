The anomalous decays $f_1(1285)\to\rho^0\pi^+\pi^-$ and $a_1(1260)\to\omega\pi^+\pi^-$ violating natural parity for vectors and axial-vectors are studied in the framework of the Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model. We consider the Lagrangian with $U(2)_L\times U(2)_R$ chiral symmetric four quark interactions. The theory is bosonized and corresponding effective meson vertices are obtained in the leading order of $1/N_c$ and derivative expansions. The uncertainties related with the surface terms of anomalous quark triangle diagrams are fixed by the corresponding symmetry requirements. We make a numerical estimate of the decay widths $\Gamma (f_1(1285)\to\rho^0\pi^+\pi^-)=2.78\, \mbox{MeV}$ and $\Gamma (a_1(1260)\to\omega\pi^+\pi^-)=87\, \mbox{keV}$. Our result on the $f_1(1285)\to\rho^0\pi^+\pi^-$ decay rate is in a good agreement with experiment. It is shown that a strong suppression of the $a_1(1260)\to\omega \pi\pi$ decay is a direct consequence of destructive interference between box and triangle anomalies.
