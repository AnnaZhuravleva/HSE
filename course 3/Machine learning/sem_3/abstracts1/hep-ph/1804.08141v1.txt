We present a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accurate description of associated HZ production, followed by the Higgs boson decay into a pair of $b$-quarks treated at next-to-leading order (NLO), consistently matched to a parton shower (PS). The matching is achieved by performing reweighting of the $\texttt{HZJ-MiNLO}$ events, using multi-dimensional distributions that are fully-differential in the HZ Born kinematics, to the NNLO results obtained by using the $\texttt{MCFM-8.0}$ fixed-order calculation. Additionally we include the $gg\to\rm{HZ}$ contribution to the discussed process that appears at the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. We present phenomenological results obtained for 13 TeV hadronic collisions.
