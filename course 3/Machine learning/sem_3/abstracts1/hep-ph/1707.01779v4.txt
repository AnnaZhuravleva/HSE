We systematically study the $S$-wave doubly charmed baryons using the method of QCD sum rules. Our results suggest that the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ recently observed by LHCb can be well identified as the $S$-wave $\Xi_{cc}$ state of $J^P = 1/2^+$. We study its relevant $\Omega_{cc}$ state, whose mass is predicted to be around 3.7 GeV. We also systematically study the $P$-wave doubly charmed baryons, whose masses are predicted to be around 4.1 GeV. Especially, there can be several excited doubly charmed baryons in this energy region, and we suggest to search for them in order to study the fine structure of the strong interaction.
