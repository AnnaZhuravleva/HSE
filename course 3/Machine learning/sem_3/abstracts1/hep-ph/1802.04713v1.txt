The exclusive $\rho$, $\omega$ and $J/\Psi$ photoproduction in fixed - target collisions at the LHC is investigated. We estimate, for the first time, the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the vector meson photoproduction in $p He$, $p Ar$, $Pb He$ and $Pb Ar$ fixed - target collisions at the LHC using the STARlight Monte Carlo and present our results for the total cross sections. Predictions taken into account the kinematical range probed by the LHCb detector are also presented. Our results indicate that the experimental analysis of this process in fixed - target collisions at the LHC is feasible, which allows to probe the QCD dynamics in a kinematical range complementary to that studied in the collider mode.
