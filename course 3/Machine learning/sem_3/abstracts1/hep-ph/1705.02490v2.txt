We study the stability of pentaquarks within a schematic model based on SU(3) color symmetry, by taking into account algebraic arguments leading to a chromoelectric interaction containing two- and three-body parts. It has already been proven that such an interaction can influence the spectrum of ordinary baryons and the stability of tetraquarks and hexaquarks.
