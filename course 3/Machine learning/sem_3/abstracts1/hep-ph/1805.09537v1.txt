We investigate electric dipole moments (EDMs) in a CP-violating minimal supersymmetric standard model with the Bino-like neutralino dark matter (DM) annihilating through the heavy Higgs funnel. Motivated by the current experimental results, in particular, the measured mass of the standard model-like Higgs boson, we consider a mass spectrum with stop masses of about 10 TeV. For the other sfermions, we consider masses of about 100 TeV. We show that CP-violating phases of the order of ten degrees in gaugino and Higgsino mass parameters are consistent with the current bound by EDMs of the electron, the neutron, and the mercury. They are within the reach of future experiments. We also show that effects of CP-violating phases induce a difference in DM-nucleon scattering cross section by a factor.
