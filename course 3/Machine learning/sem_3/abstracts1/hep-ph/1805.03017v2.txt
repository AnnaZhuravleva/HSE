We investigate the theoretical framework of the $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry contributed by the coupling of two Boer-Mulders functions in the dilepton production unpolarized $\pi p$ Drell-Yan process by applying the transverse momentum dependent factorization at leading order. We adopt the model calculation results of the unpolarized distribution function $f_1$ and Boer-Mulders function $h_1^\perp$ of pion meson from the light-cone wave functions. We take into account the transverse momentum evolution effects for both the distribution functions of pion and proton by adopting the existed extraction of the nonperturbative Sudakov form factor for the pion and proton distribution functions. An approximate kernel is included to deal with the energy dependence of the Boer-Mulders function related twist-3 correlation function $T_{q,F}^{(\sigma)}(x,x)$ needed in the calculation. We numerically estimate the Boer-Mulders asymmetry $\nu_{BM}$ as the functions of $x_p$, $x_\pi$, $x_F$ and $q_T$ considering the kinematics at COMPASS Collaboration.
