In a large momentum nucleon state, the matrix element of a gauge-invariant Euclidean Wilson line operator accessible from lattice QCD can be related to the standard light-cone parton distribution function through the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) expansion. This relation is given by a factorization theorem with a non-trivial matching coefficient. Using the operator product expansion we prove the large-momentum factorization of the quasi-parton distribution function in LaMET, and show that the more recently discussed Ioffe-time distribution approach also obeys an equivalent factorization theorem. Explicit results for the coefficients are obtained and compared at one-loop. Our proof clearly demonstrates that the matching coefficients in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme depend on the large partonic momentum rather than the nucleon momentum.
