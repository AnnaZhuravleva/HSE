We present a systematical study of brane worlds in string theory on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Starting with the toroidal compactification of the NS/NS sector in (D+d) dimensions, we first obtain an effective $D$-dimensional action, and then compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial dimensions by introducing two orbifold branes as its boundaries. By combining the Gauss-Codacci and Lanczos equations, we write down explicitly the general gravitational field equations on each of the two branes, while using distribution theory we express the matter field equations on the branes in terms of the discontinuities of the first derivatives of the matter fields. Afterwards, we address three important issues: (i) the hierarchy problem; (ii) the radion mass; and (iii) the localization of gravity, the 4-dimensional Newtonian effective potential and the Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. With a very conservative estimation, we find that the radion mass is of the order of $10^{-2} GeV$. The gravity is localized on the visible brane, and the spectrum of the gravitational KK modes is discrete and can be of the order of TeV. The corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian potential from the higher order of gravitational KK modes are exponentially suppressed and can be safely neglected in current experiments. In an appendix, we also present a systematical and pedagogical study of the Gauss-Codacci equations and Israel's junction conditions across a (D-1)-dimensional hypersurface, which can be either spacelike or timelike.
