A number of positive and null results on the time variation of fundamental constants have been reported. It is difficult to judge whether or not these claims are mutually consistent, since the observable quantities depend on several parameters, namely the coupling strengths and masses of particles. The evolution of these coupling-parameters over cosmological history is also a priori unknown. A direct comparison requires a relation between the couplings. We explore several distinct scenarios based on unification of gauge couplings, providing a representative (though not exhaustive) sample of such relations. For each scenario we obtain a characteristic time dependence and discuss whether a monotonic time evolution is allowed. For all scenarios, some contradictions between different observations appear. We show how a clear observational determination of non-zero variations would test the dominant mechanism of varying couplings within unified theories.
