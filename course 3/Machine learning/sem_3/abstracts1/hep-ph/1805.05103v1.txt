With a second Higgs doublet, extra Yukawa couplings $\rho_{ij}$ generally exist. Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be accounted for by $\rho_{tt} \sim {\cal O}(1)$, with first order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) arising from ${\cal O}(1)$ Higgs quartic couplings. The latter can explain why the observed $h(125)$ boson so resembles the Standard Model (SM) Higgs: with coupling $\eta_6 \sim{\cal O}(1)$ for two-doublet mixing, the $H$--$h$ mixing angle $\cos\gamma \cong -\eta_6 v^2/(m_H^2 - m_h^2)$ is suppressed by the $CP$-even boson mass splitting $m_H^2 - m_h^2 > {\rm few}\ v^2$. The approximate alignment, together with the fermion mass-mixing pattern, controls FCNC Higgs effects at low energy. The picture can be probed by $pp \to tt\bar c$, $tt\bar t$, i.e. same-sign top and triple-top processes at the LHC.
