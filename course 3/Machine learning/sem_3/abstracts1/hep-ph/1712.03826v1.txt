In this paper, the strong form factors and coupling constants of $D_sDK^*$ and $D_sD^*K^*$ vertices are investigated within the three-point QCD sum rules method with and without the $SU_{f}(3)$ symmetry. In this calculation, the contributions of the quark-quark, quark-gluon, and gluon-gluon condensate corrections are considered. As an example of specific application of these coupling constants, the branching ratio of the hadronic decay $B^+\to {K^*}^0 \pi^+$ is analyzed based on the one-particle-exchange which is one of the phenomenological models. In this model, $B$ decays into a $D_s D^*$ intermediate state, and then these two particles exchange a $D (D^*)$ producing the final $K^*$ and $\pi$ mesons. In order to compute the effect of these interactions, the $D_s D K^*$ and $D_s D^* K^*$ form factors are needed.
