Inspired by the recent discovery of the pentaquark states $P_c(4450)$ and $P_c(4380)$, which can be viewed as excited nucleon states with hidden charm, we study the three-body interaction of a kaon and a pair of $D\bar{D}^*+\text{c.c.}$ We show that the two body interactions stringently constrained by the existence of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, $D^*_{s1}(2460)$, $X(3872)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, which are widely believed to contain large $DK$, $D^* K$, and $D\bar{D}^*+\text{c.c.}$ components, inevitably lead to the existence of two heavy $K^*$ mesons with hidden charm. Concrete coupled channel three-body calculations yield their masses and widths as $4337.0 - i 3.3$ MeV and $4277.6 - i 14.0$ MeV with $I(J^P)=1/2(1^-)$. These states, if found experimentally, definitely cannot be accommodated in a $q\bar{q}$ picture, and therefore presents a clear case of exotic hadrons.
