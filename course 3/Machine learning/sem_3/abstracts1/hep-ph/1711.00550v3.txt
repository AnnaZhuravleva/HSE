The current status of electroweak radiative corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is discussed. Asymptotic expansions for some important electroweak two loop top quark triangle diagrams are illustrated and extended to higher order. Results are compared with the more general integral representation solution for generic fermion triangle loops coupled to pseudoscalar and scalar bosons of arbitrary mass. Excellent agreement is found for a broader than expected range of mass parameters.
