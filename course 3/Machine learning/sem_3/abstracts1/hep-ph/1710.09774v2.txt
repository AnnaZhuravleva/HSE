An energy independent scaling of the near-side ridge yield at a given multiplicity has been observed by the ATLAS and the CMS collaborations in p+p collisions at s = 7 and 13 TeV. Such a striking feature of the data can be successfully explained by approaches based on initial state momentum space correlation generated due to gluon saturation. In this paper, we try to examine if such a scaling is also an inherent feature of the approaches that employ strong final state interaction in p+p collisions. We find that hydrodynamical modeling of p+p collisions using EPOS 3 shows a violation of such scaling. The current study can, therefore, provide important new insights on the origin of long range azimuthal correlations in high multiplicity p+p collisions at the LHC energies.
