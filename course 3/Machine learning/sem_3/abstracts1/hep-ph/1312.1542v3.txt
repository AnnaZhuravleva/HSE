The spin-charge-family theory, which is a kind of the Kaluza-Klein theories but with fermions carrying two kinds of spins (no charges), offers the explanation for all the assumptions of the standard model, with the origin of families, the higgs and the Yukawa couplings included. It offers the explanation also for other phenomena, like the origin of the dark matter and of the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It predicts the existence of the fourth family to the observed three, as well as several scalar fields with the weak and the hyper charge of the standard model higgs ($\pm \frac{1}{2}, \mp \frac{1}{2}$, respectively), which determine the mass matrices of family members, offering an explanation, why the fourth family with the masses above $1$ TeV contributes weakly to the gluon-fusion production of the observed higgs and to its decay into two photons, and predicting that the two photons events, observed at the LHC at $\approx 750$ GeV, might be an indication for the existence of one of several scalars predicted by this theory.
