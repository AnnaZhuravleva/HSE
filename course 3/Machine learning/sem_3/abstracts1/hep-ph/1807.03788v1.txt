Current dark matter detection strategies are based on the assumption that the dark matter is a gas of non-interacting particles with a reasonably large number density. This picture is dramatically altered if there are significant self interactions within the dark sector, potentially resulting in the coalescence of dark matter particles into large composite blobs. The low number density of these blobs necessitates new detector strategies. We study cosmological, astrophysical and direct detection bounds on this scenario and identify experimentally accessible parameter space. The enhanced interaction between large composite states and the standard model allows searches for such composite blobs using existing experimental techniques. This includes the detection of scintillation in MACRO, XENON and LUX, heat in calorimeters such as CDMS, acceleration and strain in gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO and AGIS, and spin precession in CASPEr. These searches leverage the fact that the transit of the dark matter occurs at a speed ~220 km/s, well separated from relativistic and terrestrial sources of noise. They can be searched for either through modifications to the data analysis protocol or relatively straightforward adjustments to the operating conditions of these experiments.
