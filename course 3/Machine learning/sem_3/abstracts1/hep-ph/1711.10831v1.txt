Inspired by the precision test of the Standard Model in future linear colliders, the numerical analysis on process $e^+e^- \rightarrow H Z^0\gamma$ is carried for the SM and 2HDM at the tree level including all possible diagrams. The numerical analysis is performed including the current experimental constraints. Taking into account the polarization of the incoming electron and positron beams, the process is analyzed for various configuration of the colliders. The production rate of $H Z^0\gamma$ in SM and 2HDM are presented in the future linear colliders as a function of center-of-mass (CM) energy. Besides of these, differential cross section as a function of rapidity and asymmetry in the forward-backward direction are also examined. The unpolarized cross section gets up to 13.29 (10.5) fb at $\sqrt{s} = 350$ (500) GeV in 2HDM and it declines with increasing energy. Polarizing the incoming beams enhances the cross section up to 2.25 (3.5) in SM (2HDM).
