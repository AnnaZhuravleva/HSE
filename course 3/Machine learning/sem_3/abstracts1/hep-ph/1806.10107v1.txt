We analyse the discrepancy between the neutron lifetimes measured in the bottle and beam experiments. Following Fornal and Grinstein (Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 191801 (2018)) we propose an explanation of such a puzzle by the dark matter channels of the neutron decay. However, unlike Fornal and Grinstein in addition to the dark matter decay channel n -> \chi + e^- + e^+, where \chi is a dark matter Dirac fermion and (e^-e^+) is an electron--positron pair, we assume the existence of the dark matter channel n -> chi + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e, where \nu_e \bar{\nu}_e is the electron neutrino-antineutrino pair. This allows to describe the discrepancy between the measurements of the neutron lifetime even in case of an unobservability of the dark matter decay channel n -> \chi + e^- + e^+, which may be below the reaction threshold. The existence of the coupling n -> \chi + e^- + e^+ can be observed experimentally by measuring electron-neutron scattering e^- + n -> \chi + e^- at very low electron energies, induced with the strength as of the decay n -> \chi + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_e$, with the differential cross section possessing the following properties: i) it is isotropic relative to outgoing electrons and inversely proportional to the velocity of incoming electrons, and ii) momenta of outgoing electrons are much larger than momenta of incoming electrons.
