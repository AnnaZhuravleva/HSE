The significance of the observed tensions in the angular observables in $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ are dependent on the theory estimation of the hadronic contributions to these decays. Therefore, we discuss in detail the various available approaches for taking into account the long-distance hadronic effects and examine how the different estimations of these contributions result in distinct significance of the new physics interpretation of the observed anomalies. Furthermore, besides the various theory estimations of the non-factorisable contributions we consider a general parameterisation which is fully consistent with the analyticity structure of the amplitudes. We make a statistical comparison to find whether the most favoured explanation of the anomalies is new physics or underestimated hadronic effects within this general parametrisation. Moreover, assuming the source of the anomalies to be new physics, there is a priori no reason to believe that - in the effective field theory language - only one type of operator is responsible for the tensions. We thus perform a global fit where all the Wilson coefficients which can effectively receive new physics contributions are considered, allowing for lepton flavour universality breaking effects as well as contributions from chirality flipped and scalar and pseudoscalar operators.
