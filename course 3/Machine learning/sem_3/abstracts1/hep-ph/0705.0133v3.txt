The effective Lagrangian of electromagnetic fields at the cubic order in field strength has been considered. This generalized Lagrangian is motivated by electrodynamics on non-commutative spaces. We find the canonical and symmetrical energy-momentum tensors and show that they possess non-zero traces. The propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam in the external transverse magnetic field is investigated. We evaluate the induced ellipticity which allows us to obtain a constraint on parameters introduced from the PVLAS experimental data.
