This is an extension of our recent work on $D^+(c\bar{d}),D^o(c\bar{u})$ production from p-p and d-Au collisions to $B^+(b\bar{d}),B^o(b\bar{u})$ production from p-p and A-A collisions. The rapidity cross sections for $B^+(c\bar{d}),B^o(b\bar{u})$ production from both p-p and A-A collisions are estimated. Our present work makes use of previous work on $J/\Psi$, $\Psi'(2S)$, $\Upsilon(nS)$ production in p-p and A-A collisions, with the main new aspect being the fragmentation probability, $D_{b \rightarrow b\bar{q}}$, which turns out to be similar to the fragmentation probability $D_{c \rightarrow c\bar{q}}$ used in our recent work.
