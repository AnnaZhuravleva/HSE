In this paper, we discuss and calculate the electroweak parameters $R_l$, $A_l$, and $N_{\nu}^l$ in a model that combine inverse seesaw with the scotogenic model. Dark matter relic density is also considered. Due to the stringent constraint from the ATLAS experimental data, it is difficult to detect the loop effect on $R_l$, $A_l$ in this model considering both the theoretical and future experimental uncertainties. However, $N_{\nu}^l$ can sometimes become large enough for the future experiments to verify.
