As free neutron targets are not available in high-energy physics experiments, the structure function $F_2^{n}$ of neutron can only be extracted by inclusive deuteron, $^{3}$He and proton deep-inelastic scattering data. We apply the Maximum Entropy Method to determine valence quark distributions and structure function of the free neutron at very low resolution scale $Q_0^2$. The structure function ratio $F_2^{n}/ F_{2}^{p}$ getting from this method is approximatively consistent with experimental data. The $F_2^{n}/ F_{2}^{p}$ and $d_v/u_v$ ratio calculated by Maximum Entropy Method are in accordance with theoretical models, such as the Diquark, Feynman, Quark Model and Isgur under the limit of x$\rightarrow$1.
