In light of a discrepancy of the direct $CP$ violation in $K\to\pi\pi$ decays, $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon_K$, we investigate gluino contributions to the electroweak penguin, where flavor violations are induced by squark trilinear couplings. Top-Yukawa contributions to $\Delta S = 2$ observables are taken into account, and vacuum stability conditions are evaluated in detail. It is found that this scenario can explain the discrepancy of $\varepsilon'/\varepsilon_K$ for the squark mass smaller than 5.6 TeV. We also show that the gluino contributions can amplify $\mathcal{B}(K \to \pi \nu \overline{\nu})$, $\mathcal{B}(K_S \to \mu^+ \mu^-)_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta A_{\rm CP}(b\to s\gamma)$. Such large effects could be measured in future experiments.
