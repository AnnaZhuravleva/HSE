We consider the noncommutative standard model based on $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. We study the gauge transformation of right handed neutrino and its direct interaction with photon in the noncommutative space-time. We show that the massive Dirac neutrinos, through the Higgs mechanism, can not accommodate this extension of the standard model; while the massive Majorana neutrinos are consistent with the gauge symmetry of the model. The electromagnetic properties and the dispersion relations for the neutrino in the noncommutative standard model is examined. We also compare the results with the noncommutative standard model based on $U(3)\times U(2)\times U(1) $.
