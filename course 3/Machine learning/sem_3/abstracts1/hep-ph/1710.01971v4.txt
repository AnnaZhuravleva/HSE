The spectroscopic parameters and decay channels of the doubly charged scalar, pseudoscalar and axial-vector charm-strange tetraquarks $Z_{ \overline{c}s}=[sd][\overline u \overline c]$ are explored within framework of the QCD sum rule. The masses and current couplings of these diquark-antidiquark states are calculated by means of two-point correlation functions and taking into account the vacuum condensates up to eight dimensions. To compute the strong couplings of $Z_{\overline{c}s}$ states with $D,\ D_{s},\ D^{\ast},\ D_{s}^{\ast},\ D_{s1}(2460),\ D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317),\ \pi$ and $K$ mesons we use QCD light-cone sum rules and evaluate width of their $S$- and $P$-wave decays to a pair of negatively charged conventional mesons: For the scalar state $Z_{\overline{c}s}\to D_s \pi,\ DK, \ D_{s1}(2460)\pi$, for the pseudoscalar state $Z_{\overline{c}s} \to D_{s}^{\ast}\pi,\ D^{\ast}K, \ D_{s0}^{\ast}(2317)\pi,$ and for the axial-vector state $Z_{\overline{c}s} \to D_{s}^{\ast}\pi,\ D^{\ast}K,\ D_{s1}(2460)\pi$ decays are investigated. Obtained predictions for the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of the $Z_{\overline{c}s}$ tetraquarks may be useful for experimental investigations of the doubly charged exotic hadrons.
