We present recent results on in-medium spectral functions of vector and axial-vector mesons, the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function and dilepton rates using the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) approach. Our method is based on an analytic continuation procedure that allows us to calculate real-time quantities like spectral functions at finite temperature and chemical potential. As an effective low-energy model for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) we use an extended linear-sigma model including quarks where (axial-)vector mesons as well as the photon are introduced as gauge bosons. In particular, it is shown how the $\rho$ and the $a_1$ spectral function become degenerate at high temperatures or chemical potentials due to the restoration of chiral symmetry. Preliminary results for the EM spectral function and the dilepton production rate are discussed with a focus on the possibility to identify signatures of the chiral crossover and the critical endpoint (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram.
