We construct a texture where the Seesaw matrix is diagonalized by the TriBiMaximal (TBM) matrix with a phase. All CKM and PMNS angles are within their PDG values, and the masses of quarks and charged leptons relations extrapolated to GUT scales are satisfied, including the Gatto relation. The novel ingredient is the asymmetry of the down quark and charged lepton Yukawa matrices. The reactor angle requires a $\require{cancel} \cancel {CP}$ phase with the Jarlskog-Greenberg invariant at $|J|=0.028$, albeit with an undetermined sign. While $SO(10)$ restrains the right-handed neutrino Majorana matrix, the neutrino masses are left undetermined.
