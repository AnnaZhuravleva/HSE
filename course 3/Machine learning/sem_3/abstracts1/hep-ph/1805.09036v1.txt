Energy-loss studies of hard particle probes produced in heavy ion collisions have often been used to get information on the interactions within the medium of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, with the study of in-medium energy-loss of individual particles alone, it remains still ambiguous, whether the occured decrease in particle energy is caused by predominantly radiative or collisional energy-loss mechanisms. Focusing on the in-medium energy-loss of hard jet-partons, we propose additional studies of the angular jet-structure as a means to further constrain the energy-loss mechanisms.
