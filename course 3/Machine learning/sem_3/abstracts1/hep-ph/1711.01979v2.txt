We show that MSSM with three right handed neutrinos incorporating a renormalizable Type-I seesaw superpotential and no-scale SURGA K\"{a}hler potential can lead to a Starobinsky kind of inflation potential along a flat direction associated with gauge invariant combination of Higgs, slepton and right handed sneutrino superfields. The inflation conditions put constraints on the Dirac Yukawa coupling and the Majorana masses required for the neutrino masses and also demands the tuning among the parameters. The scale of inflation is set by the mass of the heaviest right handed neutrino. We also fit the neutrino data from oscillation experiments at low scale using the effective RGEs of MSSM with three right handed neutrinos.
