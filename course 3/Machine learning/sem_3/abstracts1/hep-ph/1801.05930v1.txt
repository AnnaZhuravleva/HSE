We investigate the transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) in the quasi-parton-distribution framework. The long standing hurdle of the so-called pinch pole singularity from the space-like gauge links in the TMD definitions can be resolved by the finite length of the gauge link along the hadron moving direction. In addition, with the soft factor subtraction, the quasi-TMD is free of linear divergence. We further demonstrate that the energy evolution equation of the quasi-TMD a.k.a. the Collins-Soper evolution, only depends on the hadron momentum. This leads to a clear matching between the quasi-TMD and the standard TMDs.
