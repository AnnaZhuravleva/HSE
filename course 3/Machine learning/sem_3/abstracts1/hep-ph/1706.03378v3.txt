This work gives a general overview of phenomenology developed for neutral-meson searches for CPT violation in the framework of the Standard-Model Extension with focus on meson factories. It gives a comparison of notations and fundamental approach in the formalism used by the different experiments. Asymmetries and possible experimental investigations are presented for tests of the momentum-dependent phenomenological parameter of CPT violation in neutral-meson oscillations. The general results apply to any mesons produced as correlated meson pairs and addresses the issue of decoherence as a consequence of direction dependence. An analysis is given considering kinematics and orientation of the improved Belle II experiment.
