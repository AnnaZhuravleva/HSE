Effective operators provide a model-independent description of physics beyond the stan- dard model that is particularly useful given the absence of any signs of new physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We recast previous LHC analyses to set limits on lepton-flavour-violating gluonic effective operators of dimension 8 and compare our results to existing limits from low-energy precision experiments. Current LHC data constrains the scale $\Lambda$ of the effective operators to be larger than $\Lambda\gtrsim 0.5 - 1.6$ TeV depending on the flavour and thus provides the most stringent limit for all operators apart from parity-conserving operators of the form $GG\bar\mu P_{L,R} e$, where $\mu - e$ conversion in nuclei poses the most stringent constraint.
