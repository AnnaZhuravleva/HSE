We discuss diffractive photon-production of vector mesons in holographic QCD. At large $\sqrt{s}$, the QCD scattering amplitudes are reduced to the scattering of pair of dipoles exchanging a closed string or a pomeron. We use the holographic construction in AdS$_5$ to describe both the intrinsic dipole distribution in each hadron, and the pomeron exchange. Our results for the heavy meson photon-production are made explicit and compared to some existing experiments.
