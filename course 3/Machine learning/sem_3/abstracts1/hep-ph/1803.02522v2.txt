We study the mass spectra for the $cc\bar c\bar c$ and $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquark states by developing a moment sum rule method. Our results show that the $bb\bar b\bar b$ tetraquarks lie below the threshold of $\eta_b(1S)\eta_b(1S)$. They are probably stable and very narrow. The masses for the doubly hidden-charm states $cc\bar c\bar c$ are higher than the spontaneous dissociation thresholds of two charmonium mesons. We suggest to search for such states in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ and $\eta_c(1S)\eta_c(1S)$ channels.
