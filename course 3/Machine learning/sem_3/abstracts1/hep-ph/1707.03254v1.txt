We calculate the centrality dependence of inclusive cross section of large-pT charmed-meson ($D^{0}$, $D^{*}$, $D^{*+}$, and $D_{s}^{+}$) from heavy quark fragmentation by the hard photoproduction processes for the nucleus-nucleus collisions in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The numerical results indicate that the modification of the hard photoproduction processes cannot be negligible for the charmed-meson production in Au-Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Pb-Pb collisions at Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
