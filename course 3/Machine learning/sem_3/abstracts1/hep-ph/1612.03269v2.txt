The ongoing perplexing scenario with no hints of new physics at the Large Hadron Collider can be elucidated amicably if the exotic particle spectrum in many of the well-motivated theoretical models possesses degenerate mass. We investigate the usefulness of different kinematic variables sensitive to the compressed mass region, and propose a search strategy considering a phenomenological supersymmetric scenario where the top squark undergoes a four-body decay due to its extremely narrow mass difference with the lightest supersymmetric particle. Considering a challenging but relatively clean dileptonic decay channel, we demonstrate that one can effectively restrain the significant background from the top quark, which provides a complementary approach to the present CMS analysis. With the new strategic approach the current limit can be extended to a phase-space region that was not explored before.
