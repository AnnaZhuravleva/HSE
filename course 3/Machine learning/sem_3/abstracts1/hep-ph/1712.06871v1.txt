We investigate the effect of the electromagnetic field generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions on the dissociation of $\Upsilon$ mesons. The electromagnetic field is calculated using a simple model which characterizes the emerging quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by its conductivity only. A numerical estimate of the field strength experienced by $\Upsilon$ mesons embedded in the expanding QGP and its consequences on the $\Upsilon$ dissociation is made. The electromagnetic field effects prove to be negligible compared to the established strong-interaction suppression mechanisms.
