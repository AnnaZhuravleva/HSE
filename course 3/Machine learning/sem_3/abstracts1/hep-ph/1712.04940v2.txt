We propose a class of axion models with generation dependent Peccei-Quinn charges for the known fermions that allow to suppress the axion couplings to nucleons and electrons. Astrophysical limits are thus relaxed, allowing for axion masses up to ${\cal O}(0.1)$ eV. The axion-photon coupling remains instead sizeable, so that next generation helioscopes will be able to probe this scenario. Astrophobia unavoidably implies flavor violating axion couplings, so that experimental limits on flavour-violating processes can provide complementary probes. The astrophobic axion can be a viable dark matter candidate in the heavy mass window, and can also account for anomalous energy loss in stars.
