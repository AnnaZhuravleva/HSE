In situations where the low lying eigenmodes of the Dirac operator are suppressed one observed degeneracies of some meson masses. Based on these results a hidden symmetry was conjectured, which is not a symmetry of the Lagrangian but emerges in the quantization process. We show here how the difference between classes of meson propagators is governed by the low modes and shrinks when they disappear.
