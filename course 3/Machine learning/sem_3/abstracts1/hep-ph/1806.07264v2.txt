For Majorana neutrino masses the lowest dimensional operator   possible is the Weinberg operator at $d=5$. Here we discuss the   possibility that neutrino masses originate from higher dimensional   operators. Specifically, we consider all tree-level decompositions   of the $d=9$, $d=11$ and $d=13$ neutrino mass operators. With   renormalizable interactions only, we find 18 topologies and 66   diagrams for $d=9$, and 92 topologies plus 504 diagrams at the   $d=11$ level. At $d=13$ there are already 576 topologies and 4199   diagrams. However, among all these there are only very few genuine   neutrino mass models: At $d=(9,11,13)$ we find only (2,2,2) genuine   diagrams and a total of (2,2,6) models. Here, a model is considered   genuine at level $d$ if it automatically forbids lower order   neutrino masses {\em without} the use of additional symmetries. We   also briefly discuss how neutrino masses and angles can be easily   fitted in these high-dimensional models.
