We apply the perturbative grand unification due to renormalization to distinguish TeV-scale relics of supersymmetric $\rm{SO}(10)$ scenarios. With rational theoretic constraints taken into account, we find that for the breaking pattern of $SU(5)$ there are no viable choices on the Higgs supermultiplets, whereas for Pati-Salam only extra matter $\mathbf{16}$ supermultiplet of $SO(10)$ can appear at TeV scale, apart from MSSM spectrum.
