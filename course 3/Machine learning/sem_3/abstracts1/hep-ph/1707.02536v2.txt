In this paper, the charge form factor and charge radius of neutron are evaluated in the perturbative chiral quark model (PCQM) with considering both the ground and excited states in the quark propagator. A Cornell-like potential is extracted in accordance with the predetermined ground state quark wavefunction, and the excited quark states are derived by solving Dirac equation with the extracted PCQM potential numerically. The theoretical results reveal that the contributions of the excited quark states are considerably influential in the charge form factor and charge radius of neutron as expected, and that the total results on the charge form factor and charge radius of neutron are significantly improved and increased by nearly four times by including the excited states in the quark propagator.
