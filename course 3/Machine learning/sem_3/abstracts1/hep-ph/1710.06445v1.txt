MatchingTools is a Python library for doing symbolic calculations in effective field theory. It provides the tools to construct general models by defining their field content and their interaction Lagrangian. Once a model is given, the heavy particles can be integrated out at the tree level to obtain an effective Lagrangian in which only the light particles appear. After integration, some of the terms of the resulting Lagrangian might not be independent. MatchingTools contains functions for transforming these terms to rewrite them in terms of any chosen set of operators.
