Under the influence of standardly used description of Coulomb-hadronic interference proposed by West and Yennie the protons have been interpreted as transparent objects; elastic events have been interpreted as more central than inelastic ones. It is known that using more general eikonal model the measured elastic data may be interpreted also very differently; elastic processes being more peripheral than inelastic ones. The most ample elastic data set measured at ISR energy of 52.8 GeV have been recently reanalyzed with the help of the eikonal model and new results obtained. The impact of recently established electromagnetic form factors on determination of quantities specifying hadron interaction determined from the fits of experimental elastic data have been studied. The influence of some other assumptions on proton characteristics derived from elastic hadronic scattering amplitude determined on the basis of experimental data have been analyzed, too. It concerns mainly the assumed $t$-dependence of phase of elastic hadronic amplitude. The results may be then compared to similar analysis of experimental data at much higher LHC energy of 8 TeV recently published by TOTEM experiment.
