It has been shown that neutrino masses can be determined under the particle ansatz. In this paper, we give the general formulas of neutrino masses related to the neutrino oscillation parameters which show that there is a mass hierarchy transition. Using the best fit values measured by electron and muon neutrino oscillation experiments, the total neutrino mass is about 0.25 eV. According to the standard neutrino cosmology, the neutrino energy density is about 55 eV/cm$^3$ and $\Omega_m h^2>\Omega_\nu h^2\sim 0.0055$.
