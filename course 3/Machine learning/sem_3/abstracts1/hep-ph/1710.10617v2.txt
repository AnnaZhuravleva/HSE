We study an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with additional right-handed singlet neutrino superfields. While such an extension incorporates a mechanism for the neutrino mass, it also opens up the possibility of having the right-sneutrinos ($\widetilde{\nu}$) as the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). In this work, we focus on the the viability of rather small ($\lesssim 500$ GeV) higgsino mass parameter ($\mu$), an important ingredient for "naturalness", in the presence of such a LSP. For simplicity, we assume that the bino and wino mass parameters are much heavier, thus we only consider (almost) pure and compressed higgsino-like states, with small $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ gaugino admixture. Considering only prompt decays of the higgino-like states, especially the lightest chargino, we discuss the importance of leptonic channels consisting of up to two leptons with large missing transverse energy to probe this scenario at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Further, we emphasize on how the gaugino mass parameters, although very heavy, affects the decay of the low-lying higgsino-like states, thus significantly affecting the proposed signatures at LHC.
