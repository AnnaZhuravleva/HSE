Suffering from approximations in potential such as the quark mass or velocity expansion, it is hard to explain the mass order of $1^{+}$ heavy-light doublet, and we are also confused by the value of the mixing angle of $1^{+}$ doublet as well as the low mass of $D_{s1}(2460)$. A solution is proposed to solve above problems by a relativistic method with a "full" potential. We find there exist the phenomenon of mixing angle inversion, which can be described as depending on the light constitute quark mass, and explain the mass inversion between the $D_{s1}(2536)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ satisfactorily, and partly explain why the mass of $D_{s1}(2460)$ is lower than model prediction. This picture of mixing angle inversion can answer the question why we have confused mixing angles in literature. We predict that there is no mass inversion between the two $D_{s1}(2P)$ states, but exist for all the bottomed $1P$ doublets, that means the non-observed bottomed $1^+$ states are broad states and lighter than their corresponding partners. We also find that the decay constants can serve to distinguish the $1^+$ doublet.
