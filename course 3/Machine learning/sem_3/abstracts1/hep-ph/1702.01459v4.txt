We propose a new window to detect axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter from electrically charged fermions, such as electrons and quarks. We specifically consider a direct interaction between the axion and the electron and find that the non-relativistic quantum dynamics induces a spin precession due to the axion and is enhanced by the application of an external electric field. This precession gives a change in magnetic flux which under certain circumstances can yield a detectable signal for SQUID magnetometers.
