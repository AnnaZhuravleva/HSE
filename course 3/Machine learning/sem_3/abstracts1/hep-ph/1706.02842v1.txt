We study color entanglement effect for T-odd cases in collinear twist-3 factorization. As an example, we compute the transverse single spin asymmetry for direct photon production in pp collisions in pure collinear twist-3 approach. By analyzing the gauge link structure of the collinear gluon distribution on unpolarized target side, we demonstrate how color entanglement effect arises in the presence of the additional gluon attachment from polarized projectile. The result is consistent with that obtained from a hybrid approach calculation.
