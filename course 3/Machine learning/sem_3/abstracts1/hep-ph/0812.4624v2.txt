We study the details of preheating in an inflationary scenario in which the Standard Model Higgs, strongly non-minimally coupled to gravity, plays the role of the inflaton. We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through perturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which perturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons non-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition. However, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely decay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons prevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot accummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after about a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over the perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier), backreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to be significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant condensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model particles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate as a pressureless fluid. We compute the distribution of energy among all the species present at backreaction. From there on until thermalization, the evolution of the system is highly non-linear and non-perturbative, and will require a careful study via numerical simulations.
