R-parity and baryon number violating operators can be allowed in the Supersymmetric Standard Model and thus lead to interesting baryon number violating processes such as neutron-antineutron oscillations and baryogenesis of the Universe via the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Adopting the LSP baryogenesis mechanism realized by the late decay of the axino, we identify a single coupling lambda''_313 as a common origin for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe as well as potentially observable neutron-antineutron oscillation rates. From this, rather strong constraints on the supersymmetry breaking masses and the axion decay constant are obtained. The favoured parameter space of lambda''_313 ~ 0.1 and sub-TeV masses for the relevant sparticles is readily accessible by the current and future LHC searches.
