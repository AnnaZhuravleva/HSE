Initial State Radiation (ISR) effect is implemented in Madgraph using photon structure functions. Detailed examinations are performed against other generators including Whizard, BabayagaNLO and KKMC, for various physics processes at linear colliders such as 240GeV CEPC and 10.58GeV Belle II. ISR effects on new physics searches are also discussed, taking anomalous gauge boson coupling and dark photon as examples. An ISR plugin is made public for wide usage.
