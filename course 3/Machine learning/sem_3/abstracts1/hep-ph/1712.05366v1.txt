A $Z'$ gauge boson with mass around the (few) TeV scale can be a fascinating remnant of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT). When the $\mathrm{U}(1)'$ gauge symmetry of the $Z'$ is embedded in an underlying GUT group, the latter leaves a testable imprint in the $Z'$-couplings to the fermions of the Standard Model (SM). Further testable remnants are TeV scale vector-like states which can arise from additional GUT matter representations. These vector-like states can have an interesting impact on the flavour structure via enlarged fermion mass matrices, and induce non-universal $Z'$ couplings with a rich phenomenology. In this paper we show that, considering a non-universal $Z'$ from an SO(10) GUT with such an extra vector-like family, neutrino mass generation has to happen via a TeV scale seesaw mechanism, with right-handed (sterile) neutrinos in the reach of collider experiments. We present example models where neutrino masses emerge from pure linear or pure inverse seesaw mechanisms, or from a combination of both. We also consider flavour physics constraints on the scenario and find that the present $R_K$, $R_{K^\ast}$ anomalies cannot be explained by a non-universal $Z'$ from a GUT. We furthermore discuss how present and future experiments of $\mu \to 3e$ and/or $\mu$-$e$ conversion in a muonic atom can provide very sensitive additional tests of the scenario.
