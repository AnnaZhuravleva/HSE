The Weinberg operator allows for the construction of radiative Majorana neutrino masses. In this letter, it will be shown that it is possible to construct a one-loop diagram that will be the principal component of the neutrino mass matrix and that will have an exact mixing matrix with $\theta_{13} =0$. The addition of a two-loop diagram, which is naturally suppressed, allows the creation of the correct perturbations that will give a neutrino mixing matrix with entries inside experimental constrains, including the possibility of large CP Dirac phases.
