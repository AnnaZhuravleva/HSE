It is shown that the basic shape of dipion and $K\overline{K}$ mass spectra in decays $J/\psi\to\phi(\pi\pi,K\overline{K})$, $\psi(2S)\to J/\psi\,\pi\pi$, $Y(4260)\to J/\phi~\pi\pi$ and in the two-pion transitions of bottomonia states are explained by an unified mechanism based on the contribution of the $\pi\pi$, $K\overline{K}$ and $\eta\eta$ coupled channels including their interference. The role of the individual $f_0$ resonances in making up the shape of the dipion mass distributions in the charmonia and bottomonia decays is considered.
