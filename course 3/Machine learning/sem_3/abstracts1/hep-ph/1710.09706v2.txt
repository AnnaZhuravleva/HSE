In this paper the phase structure of dense quark matter has been investigated in the presence of baryon, isospin and chiral isospin chemical potentials in the framework of (3+1)-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with two quark flavors. It has been shown that in the large-$N_{c}$ limit ($N_{c}$ is the number of colors of quarks) there exists a duality correspondence between the chiral symmetry breaking phase and the charged pion condensation one. The key conclusion of our studies is the fact that chiral isospin chemical potential generates charged pion condensation in dense quark matter with isotopic asymmetry.
