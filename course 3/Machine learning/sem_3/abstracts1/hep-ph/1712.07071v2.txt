Scalar fields provide attractive modifications of pre-BBN cosmology, which have interesting implications for dark matter abundances. We analyse the effect of these modifications on the number of e-foldings between horizon exit of CMB modes and the end of inflation $(N_k)$, and examine the consequences for inflationary predictions of various models. We find significant effects in the predictions in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. For a large part of the parameter space, the shift in $N_k$ is positive; this ameliorates the tension of $m^{2} \varphi^{2}$ and natural inflation with data.
