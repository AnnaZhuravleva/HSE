We explore models and phenomenology of a photophobic axion-like particle (ALP), an axion whose coupling to photons is maximally suppressed without fine-tuning of the underlying parameters. We demonstrate that photophobia can be a natural UV property of ALP models and determine the irreducible coupling of photophobic ALPs to photons induced by violations of the axion shift symmetry. The signatures of photophobic axions are radically different from those of typical ALPs and are of particular interest for collider-based experiments, for which Standard Model triboson measurements provide a significant probe at higher masses. A variety of terrestrial and astrophysical measurements constrain the parameter space of photophobic ALPs, though bounds are typically much weaker compared to typical ALPs. We discuss implications for particle production relaxion models based on photophobic ALPs, finding that they are in mild tension with existing experimental constraints.
