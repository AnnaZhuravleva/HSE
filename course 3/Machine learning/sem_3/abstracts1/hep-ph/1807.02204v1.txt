The smallness of the neutrino masses, the nature of dark matter and the connection of inflation to low energy physics are among the most defiant problems regarding particle physics and cosmology. In this work we address these problems into the simplest gauge extension of the standard model - i.e., the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge model. Considering a $B-L$ model with the scalar sector involving doublet, triplet and singlet of scalars and imposing a $Z_2$ discrete symmetry with an adequate transformation of the fields we are able to build a scenario where the standard neutrinos acquire masses exclusively through an adapted type II seesaw mechanism, the three right-handed neutrinos compose the dark matter content of the universe, and the neutral component of the scalar triplet drives inflation when non-minimal coupling of the inflaton with gravity is evoked.
