The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is an expanding fireball, with finite dimensions. Given the finite dimensions, the temperature would be highest at the center, and close to the critical temperature, $T_c$, at the boundary, giving rise to a temperature gradient inside the QGP. A heavy quark anti-quark pair immersed in the QGP medium would see this temperature gradient. The effect of a static temperature gradient on the quark anti-quark potential is analyzed using a gravity dual model. A non-uniform black string metric is developed, by perturbing the Schwarzchild metric, which allows to incorporate the temperature gradient in the dual AdS space. Finally, an expression for the quark antiquark potential, in the presence of a temperature gradient, is derived.
