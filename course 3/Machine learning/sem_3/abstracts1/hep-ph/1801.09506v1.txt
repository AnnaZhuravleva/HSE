The program HDECAY determines the partial decay widths and branching ratios of the Higgs bosons within the Standard Model with three and four generations of fermions, including the case when the Higgs couplings are rescaled, a general two--Higgs doublet model where the Higgs sector is extended and incorporates five physical states and its most studied incarnation, the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The program addresses all decay channels including the dominant higher-order effects such as radiative corrections and multi-body channels. Since the first launch of the program, more than twenty years ago, important aspects and new ingredients have been incorporated. In this update of the program description, some of the developments are summarized while others are discussed in some detail.
