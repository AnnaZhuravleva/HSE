The full solution of technicolor (TC) Schwinger-Dyson equations should include radiative corrections induced by extended technicolor (ETC) (or other) interactions. We verify that when TC is embedded into a larger theory including also QCD, these radiative corrections couple the different strongly interacting Schwinger-Dyson equations, providing a tiny mass to technifermions and changing the ultraviolet behavior of the gap equation solution. We argue about the origin of the different quark masses without appealing for different ETC boson masses, in one scenario where most of the new physics will appear in interactions with the third fermion generation and with a TC scalar boson possibly lighter than the TC characteristic scale ($\Lambda_{\tt{TC}}$)
