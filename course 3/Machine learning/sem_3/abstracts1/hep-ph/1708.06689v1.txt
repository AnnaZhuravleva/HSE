Possible phase transition of strongly interacting matter from hadron to a quark-gluon plasma state have in the past received considerable interest. The clustering of color sources provides a framework of the partonic interactions in the initial stage of the collisions. The onset of de-confinement transition is identified by the spanning percolation cluster in 2D percolation. Various equilibrium thermodynamical properties in particular, initial energy density, entropy density, and trace anomaly are helpful to understand the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition. In this work, we have measured the initial energy density ($\varepsilon_i$), shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\eta/s$), trace anomaly ($\Delta$), the squared speed of sound ($C_s^2$), entropy density, and bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\zeta/s$) using Color String Percolation Model (CSPM) and STAR data at RHIC energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV. Results are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations for (2+1) flavour. The initial temperatures obtained by CSPM are compared with various hadronization and chemical freeze-out temperatures. The analysis of the data shows that the deconfinement to confinement transition possibly takes place between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 and 19.6 GeV.
