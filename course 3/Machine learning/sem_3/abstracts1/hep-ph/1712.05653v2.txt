In this work, we study the $J/\psi\pi$ and $\bar{D}^*D$ invariant mass spectra of the $Y(4260)$ decay to find out the origin of the $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(3885)$ structures. The $J/\psi \pi-\bar{D}^{*}D$ interaction is studied in a coupled-channel quasipotential Bethe-Saltpeter equation approach, and embedded to the $Y(4260)$ decay process to reproduce both $J/\psi\pi^-$ and $D^{*-}D^0$ invariant mass spectra observed at BESIII simultaneously. It is found out that a virtual state at energy about 3870 MeV is produced from the interaction when both invariant mass spectra are comparable with the experiment. The results support that both $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(3885)$ have the same origin, that is, a virtual state from $J/\psi \pi-\bar{D}^*{D}$ interaction, in which the $\bar{D}^*{D}$ interaction is more important and the coupling between $\bar{D}^*{D}$ and $J/\psi\pi$ channels plays a minor role.
