To study the nature, in depth and to get more and more information about it, we need to study symmetries and breaking of symmetries. On the quark level, first we have to classify and arrange the particles. Gell-Mann / Okubo arranged the baryons and mesons up to SU(3) symmetry. This resulted in QCD, and later became part of the Standard Model, which is the most successful theory of particle physics. In this article particles of the SU(4) multiplets have been arranged and analyzed in a new style and made some predictions about the masses and other properties of the missing charmed hyperons. A mass formula which relates the masses of members of SU(4) baryons multiplets having JP= 3/2+ has been extracted.
