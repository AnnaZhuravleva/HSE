We study the features of a nonlocal SU(3) Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model that includes wave function renormalization. Model parameters are determined from vacuum phenomenology considering lattice QCD-inspired nonlocal form factors. Within this framework we analyze the properties of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons at finite temperature and chemical potential determining characteristics of deconfinement and chiral restoration transitions.
