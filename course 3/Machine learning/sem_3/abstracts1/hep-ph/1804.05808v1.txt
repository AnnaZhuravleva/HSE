In the traditional neutrinophilic two-Higgs doublet model ($\nu$2HDM), there is no non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) as the interactions between the Standard Model fermions with neutrinos are negligibly small due to the tiny mixing of the two scalar doublets. In this work, we propose that if $\nu$2HDM is modified by considering the right-handed electron, $e_R$ is negatively charged under a global $U(1)$-symmetry then one can generate significant amount of NSI along with the tiny Dirac neutrino mass. Depending on different constraints from the LEP experiment, tree level lepton flavor violating processes, big-bang neucleosynthesis etc., we observe that this model significantly restricts the range of permissible NSI parameters, putting a strict upper bound on different NSIs. Furthermore, considering these model-dependent NSIs, we study their impact on the next-generation superbeam experiment, DUNE. We present a detailed discussion on the mass hierarchy sensitivity and the CP-violation discovery study considering the impact of both diagonal as well as off-diagonal NSIs.
