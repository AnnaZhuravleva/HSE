We introduce a $CP$ symmetric model where masses of fermions are given by dimensional-5 operators, and $CP$ is spontaneously broken at TeV scale. The unique feature of the model is that new $CP$ symmetric gauge sector coexists with new $CP$ symmetric fermions simultaneously at TeV scale. An ultraviolet completion of the model is also proposed. It is observed that the fine-tuning of the SM Higgs boson mass in this model is softened in a relatively small amount approximately upto $6$ TeV. Other interesting consequences are presence of a possible dark matter candidate whose mass may be bounded from above by the SM Higgs mass. The model may also provide an explanation of recently observed flavour anomalies.
