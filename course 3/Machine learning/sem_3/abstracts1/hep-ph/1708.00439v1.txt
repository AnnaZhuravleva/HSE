We estimate differential rapidity cross sections for $\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ production via p-Pb collisions at 8 TeV. We use the mixed heavy quark hybrid theory in which the $J/\Psi(1S),\Upsilon(1S),\Upsilon(2S)$ are standard mesons while the $\Psi(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$ are mixed hybrids, approximately 50% standard $|q \bar{q}>$ states and 50% hybrid $|q \bar{q} g>$ states. This is an extension of previous work on heavy-quark state production via A-A collisions at RHIC.
