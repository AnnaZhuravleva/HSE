We study the non-leptonic two-body weak decays of $\Lambda_c^+(2286)\to {\bf B}_n M$ with ${\bf B}_n$ ($M$) representing as the baryon (meson) states. Based on the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, we can describe most of the data reexamined by the BESIII Collaboration with higher precisions. However, our result of ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to p\pi^0)=(5.6\pm 1.5)\times 10^{-4}$ is larger than the current experimental limit of $3\times10^{-4}$ (90\% C.L.) by BESIII. In addition, we find that ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to \Sigma^+ K^0)=(8.0\pm 1.6)\times 10^{-4}$, ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to \Sigma^+ \eta^\prime)=(1.0^{+1.6}_{-0.8})\times 10^{-2}$, and ${\cal B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to p \eta^\prime)=(12.2^{+14.3}_{-\,\,\,8.7})\times 10^{-4}$, which are accessible to the BESIII experiments.
