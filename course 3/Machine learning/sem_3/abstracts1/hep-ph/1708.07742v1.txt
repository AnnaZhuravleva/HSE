We discuss production of two $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We take into account electromagnetic (two-photon) double-scattering production and for a first time direct $\gamma\gamma$ production of four muons in one scattering. We study the unexplored process $\gamma \gamma \to \mu^+\mu^-\mu^+\mu^-$. We present predictions for total and differential cross sections. Measurable nuclear cross sections are obtained and corresponding differential distributions and counting rates are presented.
