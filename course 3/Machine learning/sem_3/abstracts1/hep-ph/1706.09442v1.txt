This paper describes the calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to massive color-octet vector boson pair production at hadron colliders. As a concrete framework, a two-site coloron model with an internal parity is chosen, which can be regarded as an effective low-energy approximation of Kaluza-Klein gluon physics in universal extra dimensions. The renormalization procedure involves several subtleties, which are discussed in detail. The impact of the NLO corrections is relatively modest, amounting to a reduction of 11-14% in the total cross-section, but they significantly reduce the scale dependence of the LO result.
