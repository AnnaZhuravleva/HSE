We have investigated $\Omega_c$ states that are dynamically generated from the meson-baryon interaction. We use an extension of the local hidden gauge to obtain the interaction from the exchange of vector mesons. We show that the dominant terms come from the exchange of light vectors, where the heavy quarks are spectators. This has as a consequence that heavy quark symmetry is preserved for the dominant terms in the $(1/m_Q)$ counting, and also that the interaction in this case can be obtained from the $\textrm{SU(3)}$ chiral Lagrangians. We show that for a standard value for the cutoff regulating the loop, we obtain two states with $J^{P}={1/2}^{-}$ and two more with $J^{P}={3/2}^{-}$, three of them in remarkable agreement with three experimental states in mass and width. We also make predictions at higher energies for states of vector-baryon nature.
