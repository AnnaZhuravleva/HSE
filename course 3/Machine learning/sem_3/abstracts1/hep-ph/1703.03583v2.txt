The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) provides a systematic way to eliminate the renormalization scheme and renormalization scale uncertainties for high-energy processes. We have observed that by applying PMC scale-setting, one obtains comprehensive and self-consistent pQCD predictions for the top-quark pair total cross-section and the top-quark pair forward-backward asymmetry in agreement with the measurements at the Tevatron and LHC. As a step forward, in the present paper, we determine the top-quark pole mass via a detailed comparison of the top-quark pair cross-section with the measurements at the Tevatron and LHC. The results for the top-quark pole mass are $m_t=174.6^{+3.1}_{-3.2}$ GeV for the Tevatron with $\sqrt{S}=1.96$ TeV, $m_t=173.7\pm1.5$ GeV and $174.2\pm1.7$ GeV for the LHC with $\sqrt{S} = 7$ TeV and $8$ TeV, respectively. Those predictions agree with the average, $173.34\pm0.76$ GeV, obtained from various collaborations via direct measurements. The consistency of the pQCD predictions using the PMC with all of the collider measurements at different energies provides an important verification of QCD.
