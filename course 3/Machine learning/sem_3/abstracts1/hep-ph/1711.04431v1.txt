We provide a simple solution to the $\mu$-$B_\mu$ problem in the "$R$-invariant direct gauge mediation model". With the solution, the Higgsino and gluino are predicted to be light as $\mathcal{O}(100)$GeV and $\mathcal{O}(1)$TeV, respectively. Those gluino and Higgsino can be accessible at the LHC and future collider experiments. Moreover, dangerous dimension five operators inducing rapid proton decays are naturally suppressed by the $R$-symmetry.
