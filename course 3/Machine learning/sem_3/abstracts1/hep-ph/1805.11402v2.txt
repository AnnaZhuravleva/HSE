One of the fundamental predictions of the Standard Model is Lepton Flavour Universality. Any deviation from this prediction would indicate the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent LHCb measurements present a pattern of deviations from this prediction in rare B-meson decays. While not yet statistically significant (currently $2.2-2.6 \sigma$), these measurements show an imbalance in the ratio of B-meson decays to a pair of muons in association with a Kaon and decays to a pair of electrons in association with a Kaon. If the measured deviations are indeed present in nature, new physics may mediate interactions involving a pair of same flavour leptons, a $b$- and an $s$-quark. We present the prospect for a search of new physics in this type of interactions at the LHC, in a process that involves an $s$-quark, and a final state with two leptons and a $b$-jet. The proposed search can improve the sensitivity to new physics in these processes by a factor of four compared to current searches with in the total dataset expected at the LHC.
