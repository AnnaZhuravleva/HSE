Adopting the one-boson-exchange model, we perform a systematic investigation of interactions between a doubly charmed baryon $(\Xi_{cc})$ and an $S$-wave charmed baryon ($\Lambda_c$, $\Sigma_c^{(*)}$, and $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}$). Both the $S$-$D$ mixing effect and coupled-channel effect are considered in this work. Our results suggest that there may exist several possible triple-charm deuteron-like hexaquarks. Meanwhile, we further study the interactions between a doubly charmed baryon and an $S$-wave anticharmed baryon. We find that a doubly charmed baryon and an $S$-wave anticharmed baryon can be easily bound together to form shallow molecular hexaquarks. These heavy flavor hexaquarks predicted here can be accessible at future experiment like LHCb.
