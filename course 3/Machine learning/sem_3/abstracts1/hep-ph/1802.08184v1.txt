We study in this Letter the origin of the confinement in QCD by analyzing the colour charge of physics states. We derive the colour charge operator in QCD and compare it with the electromagnetic charge operator in QED. It shows that the two charges have very similar structure, but the dynamical properties of the gauge fields are different. The difference between the behaviours of the gauge boson propagator at zero momentum for QCD and that for QED guarantees that there occurs colour confinement in QCD but there is no confinement in QED. We give then a universal relation between the confinement and the dynamical property of QCD and reveals the origin of the colour confinement, which can be demonstrated as the dynamical effect of QCD or more explicitly the dynamical mass generation of the gluon.
