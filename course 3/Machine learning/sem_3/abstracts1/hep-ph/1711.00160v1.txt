We argue that the cross section from the light bending in a Coulomb field is a sum of the asymptotic series of the low energy limit of the multi-box Feynman diagrams. The cross section from the light bending has much softer dependence on the fine structure constant than would the individual diagrams suggest. At low energy Delbruck scattering the multi-box contribution dominates the cross section from the single-box diagrams.
