We study grand unified models in the five-dimensional space-time where the extra dimension is compactified on $S^1/Z_2$. The spontaneous breaking of unified gauge symmetries is achieved via vacuum expectation values of the extra-dimensional components of gauge fields. We derive one-loop effective potentials for the zero modes of the gauge fields in SU(7), SU(8), SO(10), and $E_6$ models. In each model, the rank of the residual gauge symmetry that respects the boundary condition imposed at the orbifold fixed points is higher than that of the standard model. We verify that the residual symmetry is broken to the standard model gauge symmetry at the global minima of the effective potential for certain sets of bulk fermion fields in each model.
