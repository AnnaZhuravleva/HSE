We investigate production and decay of the $\Lambda_c^+ $ hyperon. The production considered is through the $e^+e^-$ annihilation channel, $e^+e^-\rightarrow\Lambda_c^+ \bar{\Lambda}_c^-$, with summation over the $\bar{\Lambda}_c^- $ anti-hyperon spin directions. It is in this situation that the $\Lambda_c^+ $ decay chain is identified. Two kinds of sequential decays are studied. The first one is the doubly weak decay $B_1\rightarrow B_2 M_2$, followed by $B_2 \rightarrow B_3 M_3$. The other one is the mixed weak-electromagnetic decay $B_1\rightarrow B_2 M_2$, followed by $B_2 \rightarrow B_3 \gamma$. In both schemes $B$ denotes baryons and $M$ mesons. We should also mention that the initial state of the $\Lambda_c^+ $ hyperon is polarized.
