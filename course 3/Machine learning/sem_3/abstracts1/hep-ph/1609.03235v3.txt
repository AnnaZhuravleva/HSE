Using the one-boson-exchange model, we investigate the $\Lambda_c\bar{D}_s^*$, $\Sigma_c\bar{D}_s^*$, $\Sigma_c^*\bar{D}_s^*$, $\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$, $\Xi_c'\bar{D}^*$, and $\Xi_c^*\bar{D}^*$ interactions by considering the one-eta-exchange and/or one-pion-exchange contributions. We further predict the existence of hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks. Promising candidates for hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks include a $\Xi_c'\bar{D}^*$ state with $0(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ and the $\Xi_c^*\bar{D}^*$ states with $0(\frac{1}{2}^-)$ and $0(\frac{3}{2}^-)$. Experimental searches for these predicted hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks are an interesting future research topic for experiments like LHCb.
