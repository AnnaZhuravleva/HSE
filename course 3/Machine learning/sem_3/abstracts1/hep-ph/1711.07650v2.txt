Stimulated by the observations of recent observation of $\Omega_c$ as well as former one of $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$, we perform a coupled channel analysis of $\Xi_c^*\bar{K}/\Omega_c\eta/\Omega_c^*\eta/\Xi_c\bar{K}^*/\Xi_c'\bar{K}^*/\Omega_c\omega$ systems to search for possible $\Omega_c-$like molecular states by using a one-boson-exchange potential. Our results suggest there exists a loosely bound molecular state, a $\Xi_c^*\bar{K}/\Omega_c\eta/\Omega_c^*\eta/\Xi_c\bar{K}^*/\Xi_c'\bar{K}^*/\Omega_c\omega$ with $I(J^P)=0(3/2^-)$, it is mainly composed of the $\Xi_c^*\bar{K}$ system. Two-body strong decay width is also studied, where we find that $\Xi_c'\bar{K}$ is the dominant decay channel.
