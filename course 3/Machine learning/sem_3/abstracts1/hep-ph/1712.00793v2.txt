We explain the $e^+ e^-$ excess observed by the DAMPE Collaboration using a dark matter model based upon the Higgs triplet model and an additional hidden $SU(2)_X$ gauge symmetry. Two of the $SU(2)_X$ gauge bosons are stable due to a residual discrete symmetry and serve as the dark matter candidate. We search the parameter space for regions that can explain the observed relic abundance, and compute the flux of $e^+ e^-$ coming from a nearby dark matter subhalo. With the inclusion of background cosmic rays, we show that the model can render a good fit to the entire energy spectrum covering the AMS-02, Fermi-LAT and DAMPE data.
