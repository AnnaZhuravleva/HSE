Modification of standard big-bang nucleosynthesis is considered in the minimal supersymmetric standard model to resolve the excessive theoretical prediction of the abundance of primordial lithium 7. We focus on the stau as a next-lightest superparticle, which is long lived due to its small mass difference with the lightest superparticle. It provides a number of additional decay processes of $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$ and $\mathrm{^{7}Be}$. A particularly important process is the internal conversion in the stau-nucleus bound state, which destroys the $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$ and $\mathrm{^{7}Be}$ effectively. We show that the modification can lead to a prediction consistent with the observed abundance of $\mathrm{^{7}Li}$.
