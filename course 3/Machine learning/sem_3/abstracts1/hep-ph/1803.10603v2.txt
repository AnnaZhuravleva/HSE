In this paper we revisited phenomenological potentials. We studied S-wave heavy quarkonium spectra by two potential models. The first one is power potential and the second one is logarithmic potential. We calculated spin averaged masses, hyperfine splittings, decay constants, leptonic decay widhts, two-photon and two-gluon decay widths and some allowed M1 transitions. We studied ground and 4 radially excited S-wave charmonium and bottomonium states via solving nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger equation. Although the potentials were studied in this paper is not directly QCD motivated potential, obtained results are agree well with experimental data and other theoretical studies.
