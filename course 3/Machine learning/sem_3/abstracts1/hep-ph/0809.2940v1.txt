In core-collapse supernovae, neutrinos and antineutrinos are initially subject to significant self-interactions induced by weak neutral currents, which may induce strong-coupling effects on the flavor evolution (collective transitions). The interpretation of the effects is simplified when self-induced collective transitions are decoupled from ordinary matter oscillations, as for the matter density profile that we discuss. In this case, approximate analytical tools can be used (pendulum analogy, swap of energy spectra). For inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, the sequence of effects involves: synchronization, bipolar oscillations, and spectral split. Our simulations shows that the main features of these regimes are not altered when passing from simplified (angle-averaged) treatments to full, multi-angle numerical experiments.
