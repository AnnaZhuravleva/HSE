The impact parameter (b) dependence on the saturation scale, in the framework of the Color Glass Condensate (b-CGC) dipole model, is investigated from the configurational point of view. During the calculations and analysis of the quantum nuclear states, the critical points of stability in the configurational entropy setup are computed, matching the experimental parameters that define the onset of the quantum regime in the b-CGC in the literature with very good accuracy. This new approach is crucial and important for understanding the stability of quantum systems in study of deep inelastic scattering processes.
