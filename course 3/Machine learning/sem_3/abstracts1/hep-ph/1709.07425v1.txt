We present a comprehensive renormalisation group analysis of the Littlest Seesaw model involving two right-handed neutrinos and a very constrained Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix. We perform the first $\chi^2$ analysis of the low energy masses and mixing angles, in the presence of renormalisation group corrections, for various right-handed neutrino masses and mass orderings, both with and without supersymmetry. We find that the atmospheric angle, which is predicted to be near maximal in the absence of renormalisation group corrections, may receive significant corrections for some non-supersymmetric cases, bringing it into close agreement with the current best fit value in the first octant. By contrast, in the presence of supersymmetry, the renormalisation group corrections are relatively small, and the prediction of a near maximal atmospheric mixing angle is maintained, for the studied cases. Forthcoming results from T2K and NOvA will decisively test these models at a precision comparable to the renormalisation group corrections we have calculated.
