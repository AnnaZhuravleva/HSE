We investigate the possibility that both dark matter and the long-standing discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon may be explained within the MSSM. In light of the stringent bounds from direct detection, we argue that the most promising viable scenarios have bino-like dark matter produced via either bino-wino or bino-slepton co-annihilation. We find that the combination of next-generation direct detection experiments and the LHC will be able to probe much of the interesting parameter space, however a future high-energy collider is needed to comprehensively explore this scenario.
