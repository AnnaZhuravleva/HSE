The knowledge of hadron spectrum is based on experimental observations of hadronic resonances. The resonances are normally observed as peaks in certain invariant mass distributions. However, neither is a peak necessarily due to the presence of a resonance, nor does a resonance necessarily lead to a peak. Kinematic singularities can also produce peaks. Here, we discuss such possibilities and methods distinguishing genuine resonances from kinematic effects.
