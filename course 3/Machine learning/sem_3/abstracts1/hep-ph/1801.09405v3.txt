We investigate the mass spectra of the lowest-lying singly heavy baryons, based on the self-consistent chiral quark-soliton model. We take into account the rotational $1/N_c$ and strange current quark mass ($m_{\mathrm{s}}$) corrections. Regarding $m_{\mathrm{s}}$ as a small perturbation, we expand the effective chiral action to the second order with respect to $m_{s}$. The mass spectra of heavy baryons are computed and compared with the experimental data. Fitting the classical masses of the heavy baryon to the center mass of each representation, we determine the masses of all the lowest-lying singly heavy baryons. We predict the mass of the $\Omega_b^*$ baryon to be 6081.9 MeV, when the second-order $m_{\mathrm{s}}$ corrections are included.
