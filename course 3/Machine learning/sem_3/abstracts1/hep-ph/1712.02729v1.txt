In the present work we search for renormalization group invariant relations among the various massless and massive parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We find that indeed several of the previously free parameters of the model can be reduced in favor of few, the unique gauge coupling and the gaugino mass at the unification scale among them. Taking into account the various experimental constraints, including the B-physics ones, we predict the Higgs and the supersymmetric spectrum. We find that the lightest Higgs mass is in comfortable agreement with the measured value and its experimental and theoretical uncertainties, while the electroweak supersymmetric spectrum starts at 1.3 TeV and the colored at ~4 TeV. Thus the reduced MSSM is in natural agreement with all LHC measurements and searches. The supersymmetric and heavy Higgs particles will likely escape the detection at the LHC, as well as at ILC and CLIC. However, the FCC-hh will be able to fully test the predicted parameter space.
