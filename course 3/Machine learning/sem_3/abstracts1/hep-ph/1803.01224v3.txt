We examine the current constraints and future sensitivity of Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CE$\nu$NS) experiments to mixing scenarios involving a $Z^\prime$ which interacts via portals with the Standard Model. We contrast the results against those from fixed target, atomic parity violation, and solar neutrino experiments. We demonstrate a significant dependence of the experimental reach on the $Z'$ coupling non-universality and the complementarity of CE$\nu$NS to existing searches.
