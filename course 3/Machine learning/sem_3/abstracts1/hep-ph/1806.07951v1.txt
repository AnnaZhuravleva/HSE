One of the main purposes of long-baseline neutrino experiments is to unambiguously measure the CP violating phase in the neutrino sector within the three neutrino oscillation picture. In the presence of physics beyond the Standard Model, the determination of the CP phase will be more difficult, due to the already known degeneracy problem. Working in the framework of non-standard interactions (NSI), we compute the appearance probabilities in an exact analytical formulation and analyze the region of parameters where the confusion problem is present. We also discuss some cases where the falsification of the NSI parameters can be done in long-baseline experiments.
