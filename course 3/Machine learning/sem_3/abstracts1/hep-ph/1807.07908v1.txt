This talk expands on recently published results for the factorising next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to Higgs boson production in the vector boson fusion (VBF) channel. The calculation is fully differential in the kinematics of the Higgs boson and the final state jets and is implemented in the NNLOJET framework for computing higher-order QCD corrections. We find the NNLO corrections to be limited in magnitude to about $\pm 5$\% with a weak kinematical dependence in the transverse momenta and rapidity separation of the two tagging jets.
