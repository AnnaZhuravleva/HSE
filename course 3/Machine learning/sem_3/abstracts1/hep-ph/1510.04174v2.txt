Recently we have proved the NRQCD factorization in heavy quarkonium production at high energy colliders at all orders in coupling constant. In this paper we extend this to non-equilibrium QCD and prove the NRQCD factorization in heavy quarkonium production at all orders in coupling constant in non-equilibrium QCD. This proof is necessary to study heavy quarkonium production from quark gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC.
