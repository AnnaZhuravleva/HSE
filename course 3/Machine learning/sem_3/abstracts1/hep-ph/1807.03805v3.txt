Resonant production of excited u quark at the Future Circular Collider and Super proton-proton Collider have been researched. Dominant jet-jet decay mode has been considered. It is shown that FCC and SppC have great potential for discovery of excited u quark: up to 44 and 58 TeV masses, respectively. This discovery will also give an opportunity to determine the compositeness scale up to multi-PeV level.
