In this paper, we apply the Maximum Entropy Method to estimate the proton radius and determine the valence quark distributions in the proton at extremely low resolution scale Q$^{2}_{0}$. Using the simplest functional form of the valence quark distribution and standard deviations of quark distribution functions in the estimation of the proton radius, we obtain a quadratic polynomial for the relationship between the proton radius and the momentum fraction of other non-perturbative components in the proton. The proton radii are approximately equal to the muonic hydrogen experimental result $r_p$ = 0.841~fm and the CODATA analysis $r_p$ = 0.877 fm when the other non-perturbative components account for 17.5\% and 22.3\% respectively. We propose $"ghost~~matter"$ to explain the difference in other non-perturbative components (4.8\%) that the electron can detect.
