For the search for electroweak particles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses of these particles an accurate knowledge of their production and decay properties is mandatory. We review the evaluation of the cross sections for the chargino, neutralino and scalar lepton production at e+e- colliders in the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The evaluation is based on a full one-loop calculation of the various production mechanisms, including soft and hard photon radiation. The dependence of the chargino/neutralino/slepton cross sections on the relevant cMSSM parameters is analyzed numerically. We find sizable contributions to many production cross sections. They amount roughly +- 15% of the tree-level results, but can go up to +-40% or higher in extreme cases. Also the complex phase dependence of the one-loop corrections was found non-negligible. The full one-loop contributions are thus crucial for physics analyses at a future linear e+e- collider such as the ILC or CLIC.
