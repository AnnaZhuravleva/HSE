We propose a new $\mathrm{SU}(3)_C \otimes \mathrm{SU}(2)_{L}\otimes \mathrm{U}(1)_{Y}\otimes \mathrm{U}(1)_{X}$ gauge model which is non universal respect to the three fermion families of the Standard Model. We introduce additional one top-like quark, two bottom-like quarks and three right handed neutrinos in order to have an anomaly free theory. We also consider additional three right handed neutrinos which are singlets respect to the gauge symmetry of the model to implement see saw mechanism and give masses to the light neutrinos according to the neutrino oscillation phenomenology. In the context of this horizontal gauge symmetry we find mass ansatz for leptons and quarks. In particular, from the analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator neutrino oscillation experiments, we get the allow region for the Yukawa couplings for the charge and neutral lepton sectors according with the mass squared differences and mixing angles for the two neutrino hierarchy schemes, normal and inverted.
