We present the radiative corrections to neutrino masses in a minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model with local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. At tree level, three tiny active neutrinos and two nearly massless sterile neutrinos can be obtained through the seesaw mechanism. Considering the one-loop corrections to the neutrino masses, the numerical results indicate that two sterile neutrinos obtain ${\rm KeV}$ masses and the small active-sterile neutrino mixing angles. The lighter sterile neutrino is a very interesting dark matter candidate in cosmology. Meanwhile the active neutrinos mixing angles and mass squared differences agree with present experimental data.
