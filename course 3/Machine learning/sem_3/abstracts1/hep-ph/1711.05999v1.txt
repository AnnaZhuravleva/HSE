The exclusive $\Upsilon$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energies is being investigated using pQCD framework which constrain the gluon distribution in the proton and nuclei at low $x$. Rapidity distributions of $\Upsilon$ photoproduction with different gluon distribution parameterization and gluon shadowing for nuclear PDFs including photon flux suppression for strong interaction, are being presented at LHC energies. Predictions done for ultraperipheral collisions at $\sqrt s$=$8.16$ TeV in pPb, and at $\sqrt s$=$5.02$ TeV in PbPb collisions which are LHC Run 2 Heavy Ion collision scenario and measurements of cross-section will be available soon.
