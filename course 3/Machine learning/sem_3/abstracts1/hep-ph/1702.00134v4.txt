Under the assumption of Abelian dominance in QCD, we have shown that chiral condensate is locally present around each QCD monopole. The essence is that either of charge or chirality of a quark is not conserved, when the low energy massless quark collides with QCD monopole. In reality, the charge is conserved so that the chirality is not conserved. Reviewing the presence of the local chiral condensate, we show by using chiral anomaly that chiral non symmetric quark pair production takes place when a quark is putted in a vacuum with monopole condensation, while chiral symmetric pair production takes place in a vacuum with no monopole condensation. Our results strongly indicate that the chiral symmetry is broken by the monopole condensation.
