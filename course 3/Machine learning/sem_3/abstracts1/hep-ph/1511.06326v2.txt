We estimate the decay rate of the $\Psi(2S)$ to $J/\Psi(1S)$ + 2$\pi$ and $\sigma$ + 2$\pi$. This is based on the mixed hybrid theory that was developed for the $\Psi(2S)$ and was used to estimate the ratio $\Psi(2S)\rightarrow J/\Psi(1S) + \sigma$ to $\Psi(2S) \rightarrow J/\Psi(1S) + 2 \pi$ in 2011. A main motivation of the present work is to predict the possible experimental detection of the decay of $\Psi(2S)$ to $J/\Psi(1S)+ \sigma + 2 \pi$, or possibly to $J/\Psi(1S)+ 2 \pi$+glueball.
