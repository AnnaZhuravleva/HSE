We obtain mass spectra of the light and heavy meson-antimeson (molecular states) sectors by using a nonrelativistic potential model with Coulomb and one pion exchange potential terms for meson-meson interaction. The digamma decay widths are also obtained for the light sector. We compare our results with available experimental and theoretical data.
