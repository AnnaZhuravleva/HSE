We study the signal for the detection of quasi-stable supersymmetric particles produced in interactions of cosmogenic neutrinos. We consider energy loss of high energy staus due to photonuclear and weak interactions. We show that there are optimal nadir angles for which the stau signal is a factor of several hundred larager than muons. We discuss how one could potentially eliminate the muon background by considering the energy loss of muons in the detector. We also show results for the showers produced by weak interactions of staus that reach the detector.
