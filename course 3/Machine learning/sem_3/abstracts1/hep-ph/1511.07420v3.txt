We propose a simple and predictive model of fermion masses and mixing in a warped extra dimension, with the smallest discrete non-Abelian group $S_{3}$ and the discrete symmetries $Z_{2}\otimes Z_{4}$. Standard Model fields propagate in the bulk and the mass hierarchies and mixing angles are accounted for the fermion zero modes localization profiles, similarly to the the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first implementation of an $S_{3}$ flavor symmetry in this type of warped extra dimension framework. Our model successfully describes the fermion masses and mixing pattern and is consistent with the current low energy fermion flavor data. The discrete flavor symmetry in our model leads to predictive mixing inspired textures, where the Cabbibo mixing arises from the down type quark sector whereas up type quark sector contributes to the remaining mixing angles.
