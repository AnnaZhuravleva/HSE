In this paper, we studied the quasi-two-body $B_c \to D_{(s)} [ \rho(770),\rho(1450),\rho(1700) \to ] \pi \pi$ decays by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. The two-pion distribution amplitudes $\Phi_{\pi\pi}$ are applied to include the final-state interactions between the pion pair, while the time-like form factors $F_{\pi}(w^2)$ associated with the $P$-wave resonant states $\rho(770)$, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$ are extracted from the experimental data of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We found that: (a) the PQCD predictions for the branching ratios of the quasi-two-body $B_c \to D_{(s)} [\rho(770), \rho(1450), \rho(1700) \to ] \pi \pi$ decays are in the order of $10^{-9}$ to $ 10^{-5}$ and the direct $CP$ violations around $(10-40)\%$ in magnitude; (b) the two sets of the large hierarchy $R_{1a,1b,1c}$ and $R_{2a,2b,2c}$ for the ratios of the branching ratios of the considered decays are defined and can be understood in the PQCD factorization approach, while the self-consistency between the quasi-two-body and two-body framework for $B_{c} \to D_{(s)} [\rho(770) \to ] \pi \pi$ and $B_{c} \to D_{(s)} \rho(770)$ decays are confirmed by our numerical results; (c) taking currently known ${\cal B}(\rho(1450)\to\pi\pi)$ and ${\cal B}(\rho(1700) \to \pi\pi)$ as input, we extracted the theoretical predictions for ${\cal B}(B_{c} \to D \rho(1450)) $ and ${\cal B}(B_{c} \to D \rho(1700))$ from the PQCD predictions for the decay rates of the quasi-two-body decays $B_{c} \to D [\rho(1450), \rho(1700) \to ] \pi \pi$. All the PQCD predictions will be tested in the future experiments.
