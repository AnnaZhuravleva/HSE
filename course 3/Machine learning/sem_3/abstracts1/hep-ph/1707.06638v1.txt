We present a consistent embedding of the matter and gauge content of the Standard Model into an underlying asymptotically-safe theory, that has a well-determined in- teracting UV fixed point in the large colour/flavour limit. The scales of symmetry breaking are determined by two mass-squared parameters with the breaking of elec- troweak symmetry being driven radiatively. There are no other free parameters in the theory apart from gauge couplings.
