The LHCb Experiment at CERN has observed a doubly-charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++} =ccu$ with a mass of $3621.40 \pm 0.78$ MeV, consistent with many predictions. We use the same methods that led us to predict $M(\Xi_{cc},~J^P{=}1/2^+) = 3627 \pm 12$ MeV and $M(\Xi_{cc}^*,~J^P{=}3/2^+) = 3690 \pm 12$ MeV to predict $M(\Omega_{cc}^+,J^P{=}1/2^+) = 3692 \pm 16$ MeV and $M(\Omega_{cc}^*,~J^P{=} 3/2^+) = 3756 \pm 16$ MeV. Production and decay are discussed briefly, and predictions for $M(\Omega_{bc})$ and $M(\Omega_{bb})$ are included.
