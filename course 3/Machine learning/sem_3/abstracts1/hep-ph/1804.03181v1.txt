In this paper, a followup of arXiv: 1802.05722, we describe the many pathways to generate Dirac neutrino mass through dimension-6 operators. By using only the Standard Model Higgs doublet in the external legs one gets a unique operator $\frac{1}{\Lambda^2} \, \bar{L}\, \bar{\Phi} \, \bar{\Phi} \, \Phi \, \nu_R $. In contrast, the presence of new scalars implies new possible field contractions, which greatly increase the number of possibilities. Here we study in detail the simplest ones, involving $SU(2)_L$ singlets, doublets and triplets. The extra symmetries needed to ensure the Dirac nature of neutrinos can also be responsible for stabilizing dark matter.
