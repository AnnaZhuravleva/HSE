We describe a new and model-independent Levy imaging method, and reconstruct the forward scattering amplitude for high energy proton-proton and proton-antiproton elastic scattering, with quality fits to published data sets. This method allows us to determine the excitation function of the shadow profile $P(b)$, elastic slope $B(t)$ and the nuclear phase $\phi(t)$ functions of proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions directly from the data. Surprisingly, notable qualitative differences in $B(t)$ and $\phi(t)$ for proton-proton and for proton-antiproton collisions point towards an Odderon effect. As a by-product, we clearly identify two different sub-structures inside the proton, that have striking similarity to a dressed quark and a dressed diquark sub-structures. We present model-independent results for the sizes and for the cross-sections of these sub-structures inside the proton.
