We perform a model independent analysis of new physics in $B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay. We intend to identify new physics operator(s) which can provide large enhancement in the branching ratio of $B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ above its standard model prediction. For this, we consider new physics in the form of vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudoscalar operators. We find that scalar and pseudoscalar operators do not contribute to the branching ratio of $B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$. We perform a global fit to all relevant $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ data for different new physics scenarios. For each of these scenarios, we predict $Br(B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$. We find that a significant enhancement in $Br(B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$ is not allowed by any of these new physics operators. In fact, for all new physics scenarios providing a good fit to the data, the branching ratio of $B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ is suppressed as compared to the SM value. Hence the present $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ data indicates that the future measurements of $Br(B^*_s \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-)$ is expected to be suppressed in comparison to the standard model prediction.
