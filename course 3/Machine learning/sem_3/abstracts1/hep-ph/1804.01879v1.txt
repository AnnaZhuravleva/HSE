We study the $S3$ symmetric extension of the Standard Model in which all the irreducible representations of the permutation group are occupied by $SU(2)$ scalar doublets, one of which is taken as inert. We perform a scan over parameter space probing points against physical constraints ranging from unitarity tests to experimental Higgs searches limits. For physically acceptable points we compute the value of the relic density of the dark scalar and find it to be suboptimal in the totality of the explored region. Our results suggest that the possibility of extending the dark sector of this kind of models is, at the least worth of study.
