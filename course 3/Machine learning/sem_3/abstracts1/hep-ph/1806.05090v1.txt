In this paper we derive the new contributions to the effective Hamiltonian governs $\vert\Delta S \vert=1$ semileptonic tau decays in the framework of two Higgs doublet model with generic Yukawa structure. We list all operators, in the effective Hamiltonian, generated from the charged Higgs exchange up to one loop-level and provide analytical expression for their corresponding Wilson coefficients. Moreover, we analyze the role of the different contributions, originating from the scalar, vecor and tensor hadronic currents, in generating direct CP asymmetry in the decay rate of $\tau^-\to K^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$. We show that non vanishing direct CP asymmetry in the decay rate of $\tau^-\to K^-\pi^0\nu_\tau$ can be generated due to the presence of both, the weak phase in the Wilson coefficient corresponding to the tensor operator and the strong phase difference resulting from the interference between the form factors expressing the matrix elements of the vector and tensor hadronic currents. After taking into account all relevant constraints, we find that the generated CP asymmetry can be enhanced $6$ orders of magnitude larger than the standard model prediction.
