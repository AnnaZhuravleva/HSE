Inspired by the newly observed $\Omega_c^0$ states at LHCb, we decode their properties by performing an analysis of mass spectrum and decay behavior. Our studies show that the five narrow states, i.e., $\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\Omega_c(3090)^0$, and $\Omega_c(3119)^0$, could be grouped into the $1P$ states with negative parity. Among them, the $\Omega_c(3000)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3090)^0$ states could be the $J^P=1/2^-$ candidates, while $\Omega_c(3050)^0$ and $\Omega_c(3119)^0$ are suggested as the $J^P=3/2^-$ states. $\Omega_c(3066)^0$ could be regarded as a $J^P=5/2^-$ state. Since the the spin-parity, the electromagnetic transitions, and the possible hadronic decay channels $\Omega_c^{(\ast)}\pi$ have not been measured yet, other explanations are also probable for these narrow $\Omega_c^0$ states. Additionally, we discuss the possibility of the broad structure $\Omega_c(3188)^0$ as a $2S$ state with $J^P=1/2^+$ or $J^P=3/2^+$. In our scheme, $\Omega_c(3119)^0$ cannot be a $2S$ candidate.
