In a bent crystal the $P$-odd effect of short-lived baryon spin rotation could imitate spin rotation caused by assumed EDM. Use of different behavior of $P$-odd and $T$-odd spin rotations at crystal turning around the direction of particle momentum makes it possible to exclude $P$-odd rotation contribution, when measuring short-lived baryons EDM. Subtraction of the measurement results for angle ranges $\varphi$ and $\varphi + \pi$ from each other enables measuring $T$-odd rotation at scattering of negatively charged beauty and neutral baryons by axes of unbent crystal.
