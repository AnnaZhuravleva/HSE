In our recent paper entitled "The return of the King: No-Scale ${\cal F}$-$SU(5)$", we showed that the model space supporting the most favorable phenomenology should have been probed in 2016 at the LHC2, with an even further reach into this region of the model in 2017-18. This ideal realm of the one-parameter version of No-Scale ${\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ yields a 1.9-2.3 TeV gluino mass at the very same point where the light Higgs boson mass enters its rather narrow experimentally determined range of $m_h = 125.09 \pm 0.24$ GeV. Given the recent results reported at Moriond 2017 for 36 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ of luminosity collected in 2016 at the 13 TeV LHC2, we now update the status of the No-Scale ${\cal F}$-$SU(5)$ model space in light of the gluino mass exclusion limits presented by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. We illustrate that a resolution could be reached soon as to whether supersymmetry lives in this most critical region of the model space.
