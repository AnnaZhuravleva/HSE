We discuss the impact of corrections beyond the leading-logarithmic accuracy on some recently proposed LHC observables that are based on azimuthal-angle ratios in a kinematical setup that is an extension to the usual one for Mueller-Navelet jets, after requiring an extra tagged jet in central regions of rapidity. The corrections tend to be mild which suggests that these observables are an excellent way to probe the onset of BFKL effects at hadronic colliders.
