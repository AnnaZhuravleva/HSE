By assuming a dynamical source of CP violation, the tension between sufficient CP violation for successful electroweak baryogenesis and strong constraints from current electric dipole moment measurements could be alleviated. We study how to explore such scenarios through gravitational wave detection, collider experiments, and their possible synergies with a well-studied example.
