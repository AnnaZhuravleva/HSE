Astrophysical measurements regarding compact stars are just ahead of a big evolution jump, since the NICER experiment deployed on ISS on 14 June 2017. This will soon provide data that would enable the determination of compact star radius with less than 10% error. This poses new challenges for nuclear models aiming to explain the structure of super dense nuclear matter found in neutron stars.   Detailed studies of the QCD phase diagram shows the importance of bosonic quantum fluctuations in the cold dense matter equation of state. Here, we using a demonstrative model to show the effect of bosonic quantum fluctuations on compact star observables such as mass, radius, and compactness. We have also calculated the difference in the value of compressibility which is caused by quantum fluctuations.   The above mentioned quantities are calculated in mean field, one-loop and in high order many-loop approximation. The results show that the magnitude of these effects is ~5%, which place it into the region where forthcoming high-accuracy measurements may detect it.
