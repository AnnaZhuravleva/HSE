We propose a radiative neutrino-mass model by introducing 3 generations of fermion pairs $E^{-(N+1)/2} E^{+(N+1)/2}$ and a couple of multi-charged bosonic doublet fields $\Phi_{N/2}, \Phi_{N/2+1}$, where $N=1,3,5,7,9$. We show that the models can satisfy the neutrino masses and oscillation data, and are consistent with lepton-flavor violations, the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the oblique parameters, and the beta function of the $U(1)_Y$ hypercharge gauge coupling. We also discuss the collider signals for various $N$, namely, multi-charged leptons in the final state from the Drell-Yan production of $E^{-(N+1)/2} E^{+(N+1)/2}$. In general, the larger the $N$ the more charged leptons will appear in the final state.
