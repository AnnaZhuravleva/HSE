The discovery of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by the LHCb Collaboration triggers the predictions of more doubly charmed baryons. By taking into account both the $P$-wave excitations between the two charm quarks and the scattering of light pseudoscalar mesons off the ground state doubly charmed baryons, a set of negative-parity spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons is predicted. In particular, it is likely that there are two very narrow $J^P=1/2^-$ $\Omega_{cc}^P$, whose strong decay mode $\Omega_{cc}\pi^0$ break isospin symmetry. In the isospin-1/2 $\Xi_{cc}^P$ sector, three states are predicted to exist below 4.2 GeV with the lowest one being narrow and the other two rather broad. We suggest to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^{P}$ states in the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\pi^-$ mode.
