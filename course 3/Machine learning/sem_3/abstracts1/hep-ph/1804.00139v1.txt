We study the electroweak properties of ground state octet baryons in a relativistic quark-spectator-diquark model, with light-front formalism applied to take relativistic effects into account. Our model provides a consistent picture of the electroweak properties of the ground state octet baryons in the low momentum transfer region. The Melosh-Wigner rotation is applied as the transformation relation between spinors in the instant form and front form. Numerical results are presented for the magnetic moments, weak transition charges and Sachs form factors. Our results are in good agreement with experimental measurements and other theoretical results.
