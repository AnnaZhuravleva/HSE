The production of jets in charged current deep inelastic scattering (CC DIS) constitutes a class of observables that can be used to simultaneously test perturbative predictions for the strong and the electroweak sectors of the Standard Model. We compute both single jet and di-jet production in CC DIS for the first time at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling. Our computation is fully differential in the jet and lepton kinematics, and we observe a substantial reduction of scale variation uncertainties in the NNLO predictions compared to next-to-leading order (NLO). Our calculation will prove essential for full exploitation of data at a possible future LHeC collider.
