The flavor problem, neutrino physics and the fermion mass hierarchy are important motivations to extend the Standard Model into the TeV scale. A new family non-universal extension is presented with three Higgs doublets, one Higgs singlet and one scalar dark matter candidate. Exotic fermions are included in order to cancel chiral anomalies and to allow family non-universal $\mathrm{U(1)}_{X}$ charges. By implementing an additional $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry the Yukawa coupling terms are suited in such a way that the fermion mass hierarchy is obtained without fine-tuning. The neutrino sector include Majorana fermions to implement inverse see-saw mechanism. The effective mass matrix for SM neutrinos is fitted to current neutrino oscillation data to check the consistency of the model with experimental evidence, obtaining that the normal-ordering scheme is preferred over the inverse ones and the values of the neutrino Yukawa coupling constants are shown. Finally, the $h\rightarrow \tau\mu$ lepton-flavor-violation process is addressed with the rotation matrices of the CP-even scalars, left- and right-handed charged leptons, yielding definite regions where the model is consistent with CMS reports of $\mathrm{BR}(h\rightarrow \tau\mu)$.
