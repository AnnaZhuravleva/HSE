The SuperChic Monte Carlo generator provides a common platform for QCD-mediated, photoproduction and photon-induced Central Exclusive Production (CEP), with a fully differential treatment of soft survival effects. In these proceedings we summarise the processes generated, before discussing in more detail those due to photon-photon collisions, paying special attention to the correct treatment of the survival factor. We briefly consider the light-by-light scattering process as an example, before discussing planned extensions and refinements for the generator.
