In this article, we study the two body strong decays, coupling constants and branching ratios with the emission of light pseudo-scalar mesons $(\pi, \eta, K)$ of the highly excited bottom states with in the framework of HQET. We aim to analyze the possible $J^{P}$'s for the newly observed non-strange bottom state $B_{J}(5840)$ and justify one of them to be the most favorable assignment for it by studying the associated branching ratios and decay widths. We also examine the newly observed bottom state $B_{J}(5721)$ and $B_{2}^{*}(5747)$ and their strange partners $B_{s1}(5830)$ and $B_{2s}^{*}(5840)$ for their $J^{P}$'s as $1P_{3/2}1^{+}$ and $1P_{3/2}2^{+}$ respectively with their coupling constants involved. We also focus on the study of strong decays and coupling constant for $B_{J}(5970)$. The predicted decay width of experimentally missing bottom states $B(2 ^{1}S_{0})$, $B_{s}(2 ^{3}S_{1})$, $B_{s}(2 ^{1}S_{0})$, $B(1 ^{1}D_{2})$, $B_{s}(1 ^{3}D_{1})$ and $B_{s}(1 ^{1}D_{2})$ can provide a crucial information for upcoming experimental studies. The branching ratios and the coupling constants $g_{TH}$, $\widetilde{g}_{HH}$ and $g_{XH}$ calculated in this work can be confronted with the future experimental data.
