The decays of the ground-state charmed baryon $\Lambda_c$ are now close to being completely mapped out. In this paper we discuss some remaining open questions, whose answers can help shed light on weak processes contributing to those decays, on calculations of such quantities as transition form factors in lattice QCD, and on missing decay modes such as $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda^* \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, where $\Lambda^*$ is an excited resonance. The discussion is in part a counterpart to a previous analysis of inclusive $D_s$ decays.
