We unveil the dynamics of four dimensional chiral gauge-Yukawa theories featuring several scalar degrees of freedom transforming according to distinct representations of the underlying gauge group. We consider generalized Georgi-Glashow and Bars-Yankielowicz theories. We determine, to the maximum known order in perturbation theory, the phase diagram of these theories and further disentangle their ultraviolet asymptotic nature according to whether they are asymptotically free or safe. We therefore extend the number of theories that are known to be fundamental in the Wilsonian sense to the case of chiral gauge theories with scalars.
