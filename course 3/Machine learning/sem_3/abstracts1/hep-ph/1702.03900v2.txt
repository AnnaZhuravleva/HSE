We present a largely model independent analysis of the lighter Heavy Quarkonium Hybrids based on the strong coupling regime of Potential Non-Relativistic QCD (pNRQCD). We calculate the spectrum at leading order, including the mixing of static hybrid states. We use potentials that fulfill the required short and long distance theoretical constraints and fit well the available lattice data. We argue that the decay width to the lower lying Heavy Quarkonia can be reliably estimated in some cases, and provide results for a selected set of decays. We also consider the mixing with Heavy Quarkonium states. We establish the form of the mixing potential at $O(1/m_Q)$, $m_Q$ being the mass of the heavy quarks, and work out its short and long distance constraints. The weak coupling regime of pNRQCD and the effective string theory of QCD are used for that goal. We show that the mixing effects may indeed be important and produce large spin symmetry violations. Most of the isospin zero XYZ states fit well in our spectrum, either as a Hybrid or standard Quarkonium candidates.
