In this paper, we derive in a novel approach the possible textures of neutrino mass matrix that can naturally lead us to maximal atmospheric mixing angle and leptonic CP violation which are consistent with the current neutrino oscillation data. A total of eleven textures are thus found. Interestingly, the specific texture given by the neutrino mu-tau reflection symmetry can be reproduced from one of the obtained textures. For these textures, some neutrino mass sum rules which relate the neutrino masses and Majorana CP phases will emerge.
