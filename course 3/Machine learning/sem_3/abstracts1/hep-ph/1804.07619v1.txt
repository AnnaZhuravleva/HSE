We discuss the realization of new inflation model, proposed in [1] by Senoguz and Shafi, for supersymmetric $SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models of grand unified theories (GUTs). The standard model (SM) gauge singlet scalar components of $24_H$ and $10_H$ GUT Higgs superfields are respectively employed to realize successful inflation in $SU(5)$ and flipped $SU(5)$ models. In addition to gauge symmetry, a $U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry is also considered in these models. The predictions of various inflationary parameters lie within latest Planck's data bounds on the scalar spectral index $n_s$, for $n \geq 5$ in $SU(5)$ model and for $n \geq 3$ in flipped $SU(5)$ model. In particular, the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ and the running of spectral index $d n_s/ d\ln k$ are negligibly small and lie in the range, $10^{-12} \lesssim r \lesssim 10^{-8}$ and $5 \times 10^{-9} \lesssim dn_s/d\ln k \lesssim 10^{-3}$, for realistic values of $n$. In estimating the numerical predictions, we fix the scale of gauge symmetry breaking to $M \sim 2 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. The required dilution of monopoles is naturally achieved in the breaking of $SU(5)$ gauge symmetry during inflation. Finally, the $U(1)_R \times Z_{n}$ symmetry is observed to play a crucial role in suppressing various operators of fast proton decay in flipped $SU(5)$ model and, therefore, the lifetime of proton for $p \rightarrow e^+ \pi^0$ channel is estimated to be of order $10^{36}$ years.
