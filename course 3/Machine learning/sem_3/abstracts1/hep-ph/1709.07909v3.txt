We study fermion condensation in the Randall-Sundrum background as a setting for composite Higgs models. We formalize the computation of the Coleman-Weinberg potential and present a simple, general formula. Using this tool, we study the competition of fermion multiplets with different boundary conditions, to find conditions for creating a little hierarchy with the Higgs field expectation value much smaller than the intrinsic Randall-Sundrum mass scale.
