Spontaneous magnetization and magnetic susceptibility originated from the pseudovector-type four-point interaction between quarks are calculated in quark matter with zero temperature and finite quark chemical potential by using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is shown that both the chiral condensate and spin polarized condensate coexist in a narrow region of the quark chemical potential. And then, it is also shown that, in this narrow region, the spontaneous magnetization appears. Also, the magnetic susceptibility due to quarks with the positive energy is evaluated in the spin polarized phase.
