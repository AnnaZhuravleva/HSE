The vector leptoquark representation, $U_\mu = (3,1,2/3)$, was recently identified as an exceptional single mediator model to address experimental hints on lepton flavour universality violation in semileptonic $B$-meson decays, both in neutral ($b \to s \mu \mu$) and charged ($b \to c \tau \nu$) current processes. Nonetheless, it is well-known that massive vectors crave an ultraviolet (UV) completion. We present the first full-fledged UV complete and calculable gauge model which incorporates this scenario while remaining in agreement with all other indirect flavour and electroweak precision measurements, as well as, direct searches at high-$p_T$. The model is based on a new non-abelian gauge group spontaneously broken at the TeV scale, and a specific flavour structure suppressing flavour violation in $\Delta F = 2$ processes while inducing sizeable semileptonic transitions.
