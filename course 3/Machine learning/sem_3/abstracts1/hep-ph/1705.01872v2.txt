We attempt to understand the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem within the quark seesaw extension of the standard model where parity invariance is used to solve the strong CP problem. The $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry of this model is extended by a dark $U(1)_X$ group plus inclusion of a heavy neutral vector-like fermion $\chi_{L,R}$ charged under the dark group which plays the role of dark matter. All fermions are Dirac type in this model. Decay of heavy scalars charged under $U(1)_X$ leads to simultaneous asymmetry generation of the dark matter and baryons after sphaleron effects are included. The $U(1)_X$ group not only helps to stabilize the dark matter but also helps in the elimination of the symmetric part of the dark matter via $\chi-\bar{\chi}$ annihilation. For dark matter mass near the proton mass, it explains why the baryon and dark matter abundances are of similar magnitude (the baryon-dark-matter coincidence problem). This model is testable in low threshold (sub-keV) direct dark matter search experiments.
