We review some recent theoretical progresses towards the determination of the top-quark couplings beyond the standard model. We briefly introduce the global effective field theory approach to the top-quark production and decay processes, and discuss the most useful observables to constrain the deviations. Recent improvements with a focus on QCD corrections and corresponding tools are also discussed.
