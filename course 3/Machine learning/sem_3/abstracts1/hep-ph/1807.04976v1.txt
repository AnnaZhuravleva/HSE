In my talk I gave a status update on the extension of the CoLoRFulNNLO subtraction method for computing QCD jet cross sections with hadrons in the initial state. The scheme has been fully worked out previously for electron-positron collisions and recently important steps have been made towards generalizing it to be able to deliver corrections of the same order for LHC processes as well. In particular, the important bottleneck of regularizing multiple real emissions has been addressed. We demonstrate the numerical stability of the CoLoRFulNNLO method by computing the doubly real contribution for Higgs-boson production in gluon-gluon fusion and for W production.
