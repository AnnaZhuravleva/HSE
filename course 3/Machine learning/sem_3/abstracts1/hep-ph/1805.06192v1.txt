We review some recent results about the computation of mixed QCD-QED corrections beyond the leading order in perturbation theory. We start by considering the effects induced in the Altarelli-Parisi equations and the partonic distributions. In particular, we describe the computation of one-loop mixed QCD-QED and two-loop QED terms in the splitting kernels, which are relevant to account for the presence of photon distributions. In the last part, we briefly talk about the implementation of these corrections in the context of the $q_T$-subtraction/resummation formalism.
