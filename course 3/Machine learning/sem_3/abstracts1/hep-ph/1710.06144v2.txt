For some theoretical and experimental considerations, the relatively light Majorana neutrinos at the GeV scale have been attracting some interest. In this article we consider a scenario with only one Majorana neutrino $N$, negligible mixing with the active neutrinos $\nu_{L}$, where the Majorana neutrino interactions could be described in a model independent approach based on an effective theory. Under such a framework, we particularly study the feasibility of observing the $N$ with mass in the range 0$-$30 GeV via the process $e^+ e^- \to \nu N \to\gamma + \slashed E$ in the future Belle-II and ILC experiments. The results show that it is unpromising for Belle-II to observe the signal, while ILC may easily make a discovery for the Majorana neutrino.
