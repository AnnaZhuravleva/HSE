We present the computation of energy-energy correlation in $e^+e^-$ collisions in the back-to-back region at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched with the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative prediction. We study the effect of the fixed higher order corrections in a comparison of our results to LEP and SLC data. The next-to-next-to-leading order correction has a sizable impact on the extracted value of $\alpha_{\mathrm S}(M_Z)$, hence its inclusion is mandatory for a precise measurement of the strong coupling using energy-energy correlation.
