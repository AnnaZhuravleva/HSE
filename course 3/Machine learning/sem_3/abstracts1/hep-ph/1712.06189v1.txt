We propose an extension of the standard model with an extra U(1)' abelian symmetry, three Higgs doublets and one Higgs singlet, where the new U(1)' charges are flavour non-universal. As a result, the model introduces an enlarger particle spectrum in the TeV scale with large new physics possibilities. The model reproduces the mixing angles and mass structures of the quarks, charged and neutral leptons. We found that the observed anomaly of the $B^{+}\rightarrow K^+ \ell \ell$ decay can be explained due to the existence of couplings with new extra fermions at the TeV scale.
