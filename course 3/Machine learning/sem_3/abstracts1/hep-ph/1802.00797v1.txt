Manifestations of strong and electromagnetic axial anomalies in two-photon decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons are studied. Applying dispersive approach to axial anomaly in the singlet current, we obtain an anomaly sum rule containing strong and electromagnetic anomaly contributions. The relevant low energy theorem was generalized to the case of mixed states and used to evaluate the subtraction constant of the strong anomaly-related form factor $\langle 0 |G\tilde{G} |\gamma\gamma \rangle$. We made a numerical estimation of the contributions of gluon and electromagnetic anomalies to the two-photon decays of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons and found significant suppression of the gluon anomaly contribution.
