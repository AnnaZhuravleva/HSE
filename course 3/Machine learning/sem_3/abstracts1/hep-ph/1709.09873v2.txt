We study the $K^0_S-K^0_L$ asymmetries and $CP$ violations in charm-baryon decays with neutral kaons in the final state. The $K^0_S-K^0_L$ asymmetry can be used to search for two-body doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes of charm-baryon decays, with the one in $\Lambda^+_c\to pK^0_{S,L}$ as a promising observable. Besides, it is studied for a new $CP$-violation effect in these processes, induced by the interference between the Cabibbo-favored and doubly Cabibbo-suppressed amplitudes with the neutral kaon mixing. Once the new CP-violation effect is determined by experiments, the direct $CP$ asymmetry in neutral kaon modes can then be extracted and used to search for new physics. The numerical results based on $SU(3)$ symmetry will be tested by the experiments in the future.
