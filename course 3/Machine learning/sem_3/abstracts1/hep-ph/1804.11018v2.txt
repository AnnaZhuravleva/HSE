Plasma dark matter, which arises in dissipative dark matter models, can give rise to large annual modulation signals from keV electron recoils. Previous work has argued that the DAMA annual modulation signal might be explained in such a scenario. Detailed predictions are difficult due to the inherent complexities involved in modelling the halo plasma interactions with Earth-bound dark matter. Here, we consider a simple phenomenological model for the dark matter velocity function relevant for direct detection experiments, and confront the resulting electron scattering rate with the new DAMA/LIBRA phase 2 data. We also consider the constraints from other experiments, including XENON100 and DarkSide-50.
