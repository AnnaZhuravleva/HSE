We explore the effects of nonstandard neutrino interactions in the lower components of the solar neutrino spectrum which are predominant by the vacuum oscillations. The recent measurements of Borexino experiment between 2011 and 2015 provide a clean test to study the nonstandard neutrino interactions at the source (sun) and the at solar detector. In this work, first the possible standard model parameters are estimated from the combined data of the low energy regime and then the nonstandard effects at the source, at the detector, and from the interplay between source and detector parameters are bounded. The same effects are also investigated for the proposed experiments like LENA and Jinpin Neutrino Experiment with their projected sensitivities.
