A new Higgs scalar from an extended Higgs family could easily lead to a discovery of New physics at the LHC. In the quest for new Higgs search, gluon-gluon fusion via $t$ loop has been considered as the most dominant production mechanism in the literature. Such a notion could be changed in presence of extra scalars, in particular in case of an extended two Higgs doublet model, like Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in case of Supersymmetric theories. Here we will see that gluon-gluon fusion would be subdued when heavier Higgs boson does not dominantly couple to up-type quarks. However, being driven by gauge interactions which depend upon the non-negligible doublet component of Higgs, vector-boson fusion can become the leading mechanism for new scalar productions for masses even much less than TeV scale. Using the existing 13 TeV analyses data with $36.1~fb^{-1}$ luminosity, discovery possibility of this scenario in the context of present and future run of LHC has been discussed.
