The time-dependent $CP$ asymmetry in $B^0 \to \rho^0 K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S} \gamma \to \pi^+ \pi^- K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S} \gamma$ has been measured recently by the BaBar and Belle collaborations. This measurement is sensitive to the photon polarisation in the quark level process $b \to s \gamma$. While this polarisation is predominantly left-handed in the standard model, it could be modified by the existence of new physics contributions that may possess different $CP$ properties. In this paper, we derive the $CP$ violation formulae for $B^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^- K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S} \gamma$ including the most dominant intermediate states. We also discuss the future prospects of this measurement at Belle II.
