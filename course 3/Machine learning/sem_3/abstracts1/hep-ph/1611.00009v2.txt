We revisit a recent solution to the flavor hierarchy problem based on the paradigm that Yukawa couplings are, rather than fundamental constants, effective low energy couplings radiatively generated by interactions in a hidden sector of the theory. In the present paper we show that the setup required by this scenario can be set by gauge invariance alone, provided that the Standard Model gauge group be extended to the left-right symmetric group of $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_Y$. The simplest scheme in which Yukawa couplings are forbidden at the tree-level organises the right-handed fermions into doublets and presents an additional Higgs $SU(2)_R$ doublet, responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the $SU(2)_R$ gauge sector. The flavor and chiral symmetry breaking induced by the $SU(2)_R$ breaking is transferred at the one-loop level to the Standard Model via the dynamics of the hidden sector, which effectively regulates the spread of the effective Yukawa couplings. The emerging left-right symmetric framework recovers additional appealing features typical of these models, allowing for instance to identify the hypercharges of the involved fermions with their $B-L$ charges and offering a straightforward solution to the strong CP problem. The scheme gives rise to a distinguishing phenomenology that potentially can be tested at the LHC and future colliders through the same interactions that result in the radiative generation of Yukawa couplings, as well as by exploiting the properties of the additional $SU(2)_R$ Higgs doublet.
