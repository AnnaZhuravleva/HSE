We consider loop level contributions to dark matter scattering off nucleons in cases where the spin independent scattering cross section is absent or suppressed at tree level. In the case of a pseudoscalar interaction, for which the tree level cross section is both spin-dependent and suppressed by 4 powers of the exchanged momentum, we show that loop diagrams give rise to a non- zero spin independent cross section. Importantly, if the pseudoscalar interaction is formulated using a gauge invariant framework, loop effects generate an effective $\bar{\chi}\chi h$ vertex and result in a scattering cross section that is within reach of current or forthcoming experiments. We also consider the case of inelastic dark matter, for which the tree-level direct detection cross section is negligible when the inelastic $\chi_1 N \to \chi_2 N$ process is kinematically suppressed. In this case, loop diagrams generate an interaction with both initial and final $\chi_1$ states and hence permit measurable, spin independent, $\chi_1 N \to \chi_1 N$ elastic scattering. As such, we are able to probe parameter space that was previously considered inaccessible to direct detection
