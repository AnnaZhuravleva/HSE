Motivated by the intimate connection between the strong CP problem and the flavor structure of the Standard Model, we present a flavor model that revives and extends the classic ${m_u=0}$ solution to the strong CP problem. QCD is embedded into a $SU(3)_1\times SU(3)_2 \times SU(3)_3$ gauge group, with each generation of quarks charged under the respective $SU(3)$. The non-zero value of the up-quark Yukawa coupling (along with the strange quark and bottom-quark Yukawas) is generated by contributions from small instantons at a new scale $M \gg \Lambda_{QCD}$. The Higgsing of $SU(3)^3\to SU(3)_c$ allows dimension-5 operators that generate the Standard Model flavor structure and can be completed in a simple renormalizable theory. The smallness of the third generation mixing angles can naturally emerge in this picture, and is connected to the smallness of threshold corrections to $\bar\theta$. Remarkably, $\bar\theta$ is essentially fixed by the measured quark masses and mixings, and is estimated to be close to the current experimental bound and well within reach of the next generation of neutron and proton EDM experiments.
