We propose a new class of inflationary models in which inflation takes place while the inflaton is climbing up a potential hill due to a coupling to gravity. We study their attractor behavior, and investigate its relation with known attractors. We also discuss a possible realization of this type of models with the natural inflation, and show that the inflationary predictions come well within the region consistent with the observation of the cosmic microwave background.
