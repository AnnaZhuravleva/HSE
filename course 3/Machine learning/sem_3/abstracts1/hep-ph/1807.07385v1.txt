We have explored a minimal supersymmetric standard model scenario extended by one pair of gauge singlets per generation. In the model light neutrino masses and their mixings are generated via inverse seesaw mechanism. In such a scenario, a right-handed sneutrino can be the lightest supersymmetric particle and a cold Dark Matter (DM) candidate. If Casas-Ibarra parametrisation is imposed on the Dirac neutrino Yukawa coupling matrix ($Y_{\nu}$) to fit the neutrino oscillation data, the resulting $Y_{\nu}$ is highly constrained from the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decay constraints. The smallness of $Y_{\nu}$ requires the sneutrino DM to co-annihilate with other sparticle(s) in order to satisfy DM relic density constraint. We have studied sneutrino co-annihilation with wino and observed that this sneutrino-wino compressed parameter space gives rise to a novel same-sign trilepton signal for the stop quark, which is more effective than the conventional stop search channels in the present framework. We have shown that the choice of neutrino mass hierarchy strongly affects the signal event rate, making it easier to probe the scenario with inverted mass hierarchy.
