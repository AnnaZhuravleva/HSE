The cosmological phase transition with Q-balls production mechanism can explain the baryogenesis and dark matter simultaneously, where constraints on dark matter masses and reverse dilution are significantly relaxed. We study how to probe this scenario by collider signals at QCD next-to-leading order and gravitational wave signals.
