The most recent experimental data for all measured production and decay channels of the bottomonium-like states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ are analysed simultaneously using solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equations which respect constraints from unitarity and analyticity. The interaction potential in the open-bottom channels $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{*}+\mbox{c.c.}$ contains short-range interactions as well as one-pion and one-eta exchange. It is found that the long- and intermediate-range interactions do not affect the line shapes as long as only $S$ waves are considered. Meanwhile, the line shapes can be visibly modified once $D$ waves, mediated by the strong tensor forces from the $\pi$- and $\eta$-meson exchange potentials, are included. However, in the fit they get balanced by momentum dependent contact terms. Both $Z_b$ states are found to be described by the poles located on the unphysical Riemann sheets in the vicinity of the corresponding thresholds. In particular, the $Z_b(10610)$ state is associated with a virtual state residing just below the $B\bar{B}^{*}/\bar B{B}^{*}$ threshold while the $Z_b(10650)$ state most likely is a shallow state located just above the $B^*\bar{B}^{*}$ threshold.
