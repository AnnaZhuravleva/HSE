A version of the Standard Model is considered, where the electroweak symmetry breaking is provided by cosmological initial data given for the zeroth Fourier harmonic of the Higgs field $<\phi>$. The initial data symmetry breaking mechanism removes the Higgs field contribution to the vacuum energy density, possible creation of monopoles, and tachion behavior at high energies, if one imposes an ``inertial'' condition on the Higgs potential $\textsf{V}_{\rm Higgs}(<\phi>)=0$. The requirement of zero radiative corrections to this {\em inertial} condition coincides with the limiting point of the vacuum stability in the Standard Model. The latter together with the direct experimental limit gives the prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson to be in the range $114 < m_h \lsim 134$ GeV.
