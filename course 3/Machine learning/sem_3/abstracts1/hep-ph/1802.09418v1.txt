The hierarchy problem in the Standard Model is usually understood as both a technical problem of stability of the calculation of the quantum corrections to the masses of the Higgs sector and of the unnatural difference between the Planck and gauge breaking scales. Leaving aside the gauge sector, we implement on a purely scalar model a mechanism for generating naturally light scalar particles where both of these issues are solved. In this model, on top of terms invariant under a continuous symmetry, a highly non-renormalizable term is added to the action that explicitly breaks this symmetry down to a discrete one. In the spontaneously broken phase, the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone is then driven by quantum fluctuations to values that are non-vanishing but that are generically, that is, without fine-tuning, orders of magnitude smaller than the UV scale.
