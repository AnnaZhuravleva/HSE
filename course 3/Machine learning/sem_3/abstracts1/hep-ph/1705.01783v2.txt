We review the production of gravitational waves by an electroweak first order phase transition. The resulting signal is a good candidate for detection at next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. Detection of such a source of gravitational waves could yield information about physics beyond the Standard Model that is complementary to that accessible to current and near-future collider experiments. We summarise efforts to simulate and model the phase transition and the resulting production of gravitational waves.
