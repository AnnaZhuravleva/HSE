We present an up-to-date global analysis of data coming from neutrino oscillation and non-oscillation experiments, as available in April 2018, within the standard framework including three massive and mixed neutrinos. We discuss in detail the status of the three-neutrino (3nu) mass-mixing parameters, both known and unknown. Concerning the latter, we find that: normal ordering (NO) is favored over inverted ordering (IO) at 3sigma level; the Dirac CP phase is constrained within ~15% (~9%) uncertainty in NO (IO) around nearly-maximal CP-violating values; the octant of the largest mixing angle and the absolute neutrino masses remain undetermined. We briefly comment on other unknowns related to theoretical and experimental uncertainties (within 3nu) or possible new states and interactions (beyond 3nu).
