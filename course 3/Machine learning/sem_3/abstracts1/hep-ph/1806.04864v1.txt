In light of the developments of the chiral constituent quark model ($\chi$CQM) in studying low energy hadronic matrix elements of the ground-state baryons, we have extended this model to investigate their transition properties. The magnetic moments of transitions from the $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ decuplet to $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ octet baryons have been calculated with explicit valence quark spin, sea quark spin and sea quark orbital angular momentum contributions. Since the experimental data is available for only a few transitions, we have compared our results with the results of other available models. The implications of other complicated effects such as chiral symmetry breaking and SU(3) symmetry breaking arising due to confinement of quarks have also been discussed.
