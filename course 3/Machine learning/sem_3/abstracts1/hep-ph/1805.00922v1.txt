Our present understanding of neutrino properties is reviewed with a particular emphasis on observable differences between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos. Current and future experimental efforts towards measuring neutrino properties are summarized. Consequences of the Majorana vs.Dirac nature of neutrinos on neutrino masses, neutrino decays, and neutrino electromagnetic properties are described.
