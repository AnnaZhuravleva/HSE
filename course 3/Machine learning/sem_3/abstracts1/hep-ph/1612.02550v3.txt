In the light of several recent analyses pointing towards texture 4-zero Fritzsch-like quark mass matrices as the only viable structures for quark mass matrices, this work adopts a model independent approach to reconstruct an alternate and simplified structure of texture specific quark mass matrices in a generalized 'u-diagonal' basis within the Standard Model framework using the Unitarity of CKM matrix and the observed hierarchies in quark mass spectra and mixing angles. It is observed that the measured 1$\sigma$ values of the three physical parameters namely $m_{\rm{u}}$, $m_{\rm{d}}$ and $s_{12}$ naturally lead to the vanishing of (11) element in the down type quark mass matrix and that the single measurable CP violating phase $\delta_{13}$ in the CKM matrix is sufficient enough in $M^{\prime}_{\rm{d}}$ to explain the observed mixing pattern in a suitable basis. The leading order as well as exact analytic phenomenological solutions are addressed for the modest pattern of quark mass matrices derived from CKM matrix and precision measurements of mixing parameters.
