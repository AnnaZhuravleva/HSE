Most cosmological models of inflation are far away from providing a smoking gun at low energies. A model of Higgs inflation in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, however, changes the NMSSM phenomenology drastically and may be well distinguished from the pure NMSSM or MSSM at a future Linear Collider. We point out certain differences of the inflationary model to the ordinary NMSSM and discuss the Higgs and neutralino/chargino sector in particular to identify the smoking gun of inflation at electroweak energies.
