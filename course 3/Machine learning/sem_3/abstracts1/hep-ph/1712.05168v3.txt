It has been found very recently on the lattice that at high temperature at vanishing chemical potential QCD is increasingly SU(2)_CS and SU(2N_F) symmetric. We demonstrate that the chemical potential term in the QCD Lagrangian has precisely the same symmetry. Consequently the QCD matter beyond the chiral restoration line on the T - \mu plane is at least approximately SU(2)_CS and SU(2N_F) symmetric.
