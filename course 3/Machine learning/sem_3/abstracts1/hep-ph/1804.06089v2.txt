We show that a novel decay mode $Zh$ of the bound state of stop-anti-stop pair in the ground state $^1S_0(\widetilde t_1\widetilde t_1^*)$ may have a significant branching ratio if the $CP$ violating mixing appears in the stop sector, even after we apply the stringent constraint from the measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron. We show that the branching ratio can be as large as 10% in some parameter space that it may be detectable at the LHC.
