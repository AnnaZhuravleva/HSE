Gauging the flavor (family, generation, horizontal) index of the chiral fermion fields of the Standard model, for anomaly freedom extended by three sterile right-handed neutrino fields, results in asymptotically free, {\it bona fide} nonconfining $SU(3)_f$ quantum flavor dynamics. Approximate nonperturbative strong-coupling solutions of the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation for fermion self-energies give rise to the complete flavor symmetry breaking by : (1) Three huge Majorana masses of sterile right-handed neutrinos. (2) Three exponentially light Dirac masses common to all fermion sorts in a family. Masses of charged leptons and quarks are further distinguished from Dirac neutrino masses by the weak hypercharge contributions to the universal $SU(3)_f$ kernel of the SD equation, free of unknown parameters. The $SU(3)_f$ dynamics itself thus gives the neutrino mass spectrum in the seesaw form.
