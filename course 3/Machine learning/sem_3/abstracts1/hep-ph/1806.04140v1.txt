Muons and neutrinos from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere originate from decays of mesons in air-showers. Sibyll-2.3c aims to give a precise description of hadronic interactions in the relevant phase space for conventional and prompt leptons in light of new accelerator data, including that from the LHC. Sibyll is designed primarily as an event generator for use in simulation of extensive air showers. Because it has been tuned for forward physics as well as the central region, it can also be used to calculate inclusive fluxes. The purpose of this paper is to describe the use of Sibyll-2.3c for calculation of fluxes of atmospheric leptons.
