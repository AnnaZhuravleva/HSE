Light flavour baryons are studied in a non-relativistic potential model with colour Coulomb plus linear confinement potential using a simple variational method. The ground-state masses and magnetic moments of the light baryons are computed using a spin- and isospin-dependent potential. We extend our scheme to predict the transition magnetic moments of $B_{(J^P={3/2}^+)} \rightarrow B_{(J^P={1/2}^+)}\gamma$ processes. We also compute the radiative decay widths and branching ratios of light baryons. A comparison of our results with those of other works and experimental data is also presented.
