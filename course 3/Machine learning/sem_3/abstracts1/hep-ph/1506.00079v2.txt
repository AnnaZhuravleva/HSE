We present a solution to the naturalness problem of the electroweak scale based on a change of variable in the Fourier space of non supersymmetric nature that transforms a boson into a fermion and viceversa. This is exemplified for that part of the standard model Lagrangian that contains a Dirac fermion coupled with the Higgs field. The full Lagrangian which contains both the initial particles and the partners obtained through this method is invariant under the symmetry associated to this change of variables and is free of quadratic divergences to the scalar particles present in the Lagrangian. The partners appear mostly as "off-shell" states thus explaining their experimental absence at any particle accelerators.
