The cosmic ray(CR) positrons and antiprotons are often regarded as the collision products of CR nucleons with the interstellar medium. However this conclusion is challenged by recent experimental data. In this work, we choose the latest AMS-02 data to analyze the astrophysical background of CR positrons and antiprotons with the GALPROP code for CR propagation and the QGSJET-II-04 model for the hadronic interactions. The results show that in low energies the predicted fluxes of CR antiprotons and positrons are consistent with AMS-02 data in the diffusion model combining the re-acceleration and convection terms (DCR model). Thus, the excess of CR antiprotons in the low energy are not justified. In that model, the predicted flux of CR protons is consistent with AMS-02 data whose hardening feature above 330 GeV is also matched. Based on that model, the total fluxes of CR electrons and positrons from AMS-02 are also used to analyzed the interpretation of dark matter annihilation about the positron excess. The predicted best-fit masses of dark matter are from 400 GeV to 4 TeV. The DCR model does not give the unusual interpretation of the positron excess.
