I suggest a new extension of the SM by introducing a dark sector which has several new particles and a local $U(1)_{D}$ symmetry. The dark particles bring about the new and interesting physics beyond the SM. The model can generate the tiny neutrino mass by a hybrid see-saw mechanism, achieve the leptogenesis at the TeV scale, and account for the cold dark matter. All of the three things collectively arise from the dark sector. In particular, it is very feasible to test the model predictions and probe the dark sector in near future experiments.
