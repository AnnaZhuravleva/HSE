We analyse the predictions of both Higgs and top masses in a generic MSSM satisfying gauge-coupling unification, radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, with a natural (non-splitted) spectrum of soft-breaking terms, and an arbitrary soft-breaking scale (above a few TeV). This procedure allows us to identify a relatively narrow SUSY-allowed region in the $(m_h, m_t)$ plane. We argue that the compatibility of the measured values of Higgs and top masses with this SUSY-allowed region is not less surprising than the corresponding compatibility with the narrow SM metastability region. As such, it provides a non-trivial signal of the compatibility of present data with a supersymmetric completion of the SM.
