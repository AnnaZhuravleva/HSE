Diphoton resonance was a crucial discovery mode for the 125 GeV SM Higgs boson at the LHC. This mode or the more general diboson modes may also play an important role in probing for new physics beyond the SM. In this paper, we consider the possibility that a diphoton resonance is due to a composite (pseudo)scalar boson, whose constituents are either new hyperquarks Q or scalar hyperquarks tilde{Q} confined by a new hypercolor force at a confinement scale Lambda_h. Assuming the mass m_Q (or m_{tilde Q}) >> Lambda_h, a diphoton resonance could be interpreted as either a Q bar{Q} state eta_Q with J^{PC} = 0^{-+} or a tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger state eta_{tilde Q} with J^{PC}=0^{++}. For the Q bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet partner psi_Q which is slightly heavier than eta_Q due to the hyperfine interactions mediated by hypercolor gluon exchange; while for the tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger scenario, the spin-triplet partner chi_{tilde Q} arises from higher radial excitation with nonzero orbital angular momentum. We consider productions and decays of eta_Q, eta_{tilde Q}, psi_Q, and chi_{tilde Q} at the LHC using the NRQCD factorization approach. We discuss how to test these scenarios by using the DY process and the forward dijet azimuthal angular distributions to determine the J^{PC} quantum number of the diphoton resonance. Constraints on the parameter space can be obtained by interpreting some of the small diphoton excesses reported by the LHC as the composite scalar or pseudoscalar of the model. Another important test of the model is the presence of a nearby hypercolor-singlet but color-octet state like the eta^8_Q or eta^8_{tilde Q}, which can also be constrained by dijet or monojet+monophoton data. Both possibilities of a large or small width of the resonance can be accommodated, depending on whether the hyper-glueball states are kinematically allowed in the final state or not.
