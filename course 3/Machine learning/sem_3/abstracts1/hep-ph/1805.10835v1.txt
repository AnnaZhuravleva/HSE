The existence of colour-octet scalar states, often dubbed sgluons, is predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, such as supersymmetric realisations featuring Dirac gauginos. Such states have a large pair-production rate at hadron colliders and mainly decay into pairs of jets and top quarks. Consequently, they represent a primary target for experimental searches for new resonances in the multijet and multitop channels at the Large Hadron Collider. Adopting a phenomenologically-motivated simplified model, we reinterpret the results of a recent experimental search for the four-top-quark Standard Model signal, from which we constrain the sgluon mass to be larger than about 1.06 TeV. We additionally consider how modifications of the existing four-top-quark studies could enhance our ability to unravel the presence of scalar octets in data.
