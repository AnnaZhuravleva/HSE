We present a formalism that resums threshold-enhanced logarithms to all orders in perturbative QCD for the rapidity distribution of any colorless particle produced in hadron colliders. We achieve this by exploiting the factorization properties and K+G equations satisfied by the soft and virtual parts of the cross section. We compute for the first time compact and most general expressions in two-dimensional Mellin space for the resummed coefficients. Using various state-of-the-art multiloop and multileg results, we demonstrate the numerical impact of our resummed results up to next-to-next-to-leading order for the rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson at the LHC. We find that inclusion of these threshold logs through resummation improves the reliability of perturbative predictions.
