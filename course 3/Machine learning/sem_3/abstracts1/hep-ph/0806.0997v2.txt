We argue that significant probability of protons with momenta above their Fermi surface leads for proton concentrations p/n > 1/8 to the enhancement of termally excited direct and modified URCA processes within a cold neutron star, and to a nonzero probability of direct URCA processes for small proton concentrations (p/n < 1/8). We evaluate high momentum tails of neutron, proton and electrons distributions within a neutron star. We expect also significantly faster neutrino cooling of hyperon stars.
