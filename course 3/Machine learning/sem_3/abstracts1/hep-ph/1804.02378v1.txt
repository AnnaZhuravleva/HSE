So far the most sophisticated experiments have shown no trace of new physics in the TeV scale. Consequently, new models with unexplored parameter regions are necessary to explain current results, analyse further the existing data, and propose new experiments. In this letter, we present a modified version of the $\mu\nu$SSM supersymmetric model where a non-Universal extra U(1) gauge symmetry is added in order to restore an effective R-parity that ensures proton stability. We show that anomalies equations cancel without having to add \emph{any} exotic matter, and find that it is the viability of the model through anomalies cancellation what defines the conditions in which fermions interact with dark matter candidates via the exchange of $Z'$ bosons. The strict condition of universality violation across families in the charge under the extra gauge symmetry means that LHC constraints for a $Z'$ mass do not apply directly to our model, allowing for a yet undiscovered light $Z$', as we discuss. Moreover, we explore the possibility of isospin violating interactions of dark matter with nuclei for in model; we observe that this interaction depends, surprisingly, on the Higgs charges under the new symmetry, both limiting the number of possible models and allowing to analyse indirect dark matter searches in the light of well defined, particular scenarios.
