We examine the possibility of using single-Higgs production at an $e^+e^-$ collider with polarized beams to measure, or constrain, indirectly a possible anomalous triple-Higgs coupling, which can contribute to the process via one-loop diagrams. In the dominant process $e^+e^- \to ZH$, longitudinally polarized beams can lead to an improvement in the cross section by 50% for $e^-$ and $e^+$ polarizations of $-0.8$ and $+0.3$, respectively. This corresponds to an improvement in the sensitivity to the triple-Higgs coupling of about 19% for a centre-of-mass energy of 250 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 2 ab$^{-1}$. We also study the effect of longitudinal beam polarization on the sensitivity to the triple-Higgs coupling of Higgs production through the subdominant process $e^+e^- \to H \nu \bar \nu$ occurring through $WW$ fusion.
