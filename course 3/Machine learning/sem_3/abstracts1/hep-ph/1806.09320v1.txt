We propose a double inflection point inflationary model in supergravity with a single chiral superfield. Such a model allows for the generation of primordial black holes(PBHs) at small scales, which can account for a significant fraction of dark matter. Moreover in vacuum it is possible to give a small and adjustable SUSY breaking with a tiny cosmological constant.
