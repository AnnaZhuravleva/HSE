After the first measurement of the coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering (CENNS) by the COHERENT Collaboration, it is expected that new experiments will confirm the observation. Such measurements will allow to put stronger constraints or discover new physics as well as to probe the Standard Model by measuring its parameters. This is the case of the weak mixing angle at low energies, which could be measured with an increased precision in future results of CENNS experiments using, for example, reactor antineutrinos. In this work we analyze the physics potential of different proposals for the improvement of our current knowledge of this observable and show that they are very promising.
