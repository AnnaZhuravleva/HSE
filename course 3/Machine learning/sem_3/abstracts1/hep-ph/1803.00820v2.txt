We propose a WIMP baryogensis achieved by the annihilation of non-thermally produced WIMPs from decay of heavy particles, which can result in low reheating temerature. Dark matter (DM) can be produced non-thermally during a reheating period created by the decay of long-lived heavy particle, and subsequently re-annihilate to lighter particles even after the thermal freeze-out. The re-annihilation of DM provides the observed baryon asymmetry as well as the correct relic density of DM. We investigate how wahout effects can affect the generation of the baryon asymmetry and study a model suppressing them. In this scenario, we find that DM can be heavy enough and its annihilation cross section can also be larger than that adopted in the usual thermal WIMP baryogenesis.
