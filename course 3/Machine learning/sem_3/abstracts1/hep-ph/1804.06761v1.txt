We study the spectra of the doubly charmed tetraquark states in a diquark-antidiquark model.   The doubly charmed tetraquark states form an antitriplet and a sextet configurations according to flavor SU(3) symmetry. For the tetraquark state $[qq'][\bar c\bar c]$, we show the mass for both bound and excited states. The two-body decays of tetraquark states $T^{cc}[0^+]$ and $T^{cc}[1^{--}]$ to charmed mesons have also been studied. In the end,the doubly charmed tetraquarks decays to a charmed baryon and a light baryon have been studied in the SU(3) flavor symmetry.
