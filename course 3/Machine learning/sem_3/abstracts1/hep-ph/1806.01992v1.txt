We investigate kaon photoproduction off the neutron target, i.e., $\gamma n \to K^0 \Lambda$, focusing on the role of nucleon resonances given in the Review of Particle Data Group in the range of $\sqrt{s} \approx 1600 - 2200$ MeV. We employ an effective Lagrangian method and a Regge approach. The strong couplings of nucleon resonances with $K\Lambda$ vertices are constrained by quark model predictions. The numerical results of the total and differential cross sections are found to be in qualitative agreement with the recent CLAS and FOREST experimental data. We discuss the effects of the narrow nucleon resonance $N(1685,1/2^+)$ on both the total and differential cross sections near the threshold energy.
