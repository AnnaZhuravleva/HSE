Ray optics effectively fail to detect an eleven-parameter family of deviations from a metric spacetime geometry. These ray-optically invisible deviations, however, affect quantum field theoretic scattering amplitudes and bound states. To show this, we first prove renormalizability and gauge invariance of the pertinent quantum electrodynamics to any loop order. We then calculate scattering amplitudes and radiative corrections and determine the bound states of the hydrogen atom in the presence of ray-optically undetectable deviations. In particular, we find effects on the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron as well as the ionisation energy and hyperfine transition of hydrogen, which is of direct relevance to astrophysical measurements.
