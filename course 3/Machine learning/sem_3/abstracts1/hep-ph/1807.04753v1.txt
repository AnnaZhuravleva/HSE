We explore scenarios where the $R(D^{(*)})$ anomalies arise from semitauonic decays to a right-handed sterile neutrino. We perform an EFT study of all five simplified models capable of generating at tree-level the lowest dimension electroweak operators that give rise to this decay. We analyze their compatibility with current $R(D^{(*)})$ data and other relevant hadronic branching ratios, and show that one simplified model is excluded by this analysis. The remainder are compatible with collider constraints on the mediator semileptonic branching ratios, provided the mediator mass is of order TeV. We also discuss the phenomenology of the sterile neutrino itself, which includes possibilities for displaced decays at colliders and direct searches, measurable dark radiation, and gamma ray signals.
