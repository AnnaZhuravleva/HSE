In this paper, we consider logarithmic radiative corrections and higher order terms to the supersymmetric hilltop F- and D-term hybrid inflation models. Conventional F- and D-term hybrid inflation only predicts $n_s \gae 0.98$. We show that via a positive quadratic and a negative quartic correction the spectral index can be reduced to $n_s=0.96$ suggested from latest WMAP result and also cosmic string problem appeared in SUSY hybrid inflation can be solved with mild tuning of the parameters if $\kappa \lae 0.01$ for F-term inflation and $g \lae 0.05$ for D-term inflation.
