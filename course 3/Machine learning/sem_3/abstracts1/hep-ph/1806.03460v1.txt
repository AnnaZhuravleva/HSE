The vector bosons production at the Large Hadron Collider makes it possible to investigate in detail the basic structure of electroweak interactions. Besides the LHC with a good accuracy will be measure production of weak bosons ($pp \to W^+W^-$). The production of weak bosons with photon ($pp \to W^+W^-\gamma$) provides an increasingly powerful handle at higher center-of-mass energies. We present phenomenological results for $WW\gamma$ production in proton-proton interaction at the Large Hadron Collider. In this paper, we calculate the total and differential cross sections. We consider the dependence of differential cross section distributions on transverse momentum and rapidity particles, which are produced in the final state ($W^+$ and $W^-$). We consider several important distributions, which are included in the search for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider. The results for transverse momentum distributions, rapidity distributions and total cross section are presented.
