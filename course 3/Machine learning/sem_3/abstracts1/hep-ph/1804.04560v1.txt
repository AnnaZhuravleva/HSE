We investigate the complete renormalization group running of fermion observables in two different realistic non-supersymmetric models based on the gauge group $\textrm{SO}(10)$ with intermediate symmetry breaking for both normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. Contrary to results of previous works, we find that the model with the more minimal Yukawa sector of the Lagrangian fails to reproduce the measured values of observables at the electroweak scale, whereas the model with the more extended Yukawa sector can do so if the neutrino masses have normal ordering. The difficulty in finding acceptable fits to measured data is a result of the added complexity from the effect of an intermediate symmetry breaking as well as tension in the value of the leptonic mixing angle $\theta^\ell_{23}$.
