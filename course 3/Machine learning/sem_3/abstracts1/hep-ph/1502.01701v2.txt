We estimate the reach of the 14 TeV LHC and future hadronic and leptonic colliders in the parameter space of the minimal composite Higgs model, outlining the complementarity of direct resonance searches and indirect information from the measurements of the Higgs boson couplings. The reach on electroweak charged spin-one resonances, taken here as representative direct signatures, is obtained from the current 8 TeV LHC limits by an extrapolation procedure which we outline and validate. The impact of electroweak precision tests, and their possible improvement at future colliders, is also quantified.
