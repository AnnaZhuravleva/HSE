Motivated by the AMS project, we assume that after the Big Bang or inflation epoch, antimatter was repelled onto one brane which is separated from our brane where all the observational matter resides. It is suggested that CP may be spontaneously broken, the two branes would correspond to ground states for matter and antimatter respectively. Generally a complex scalar field which is responsible for the spontaneous CP violation, exists in the space between the branes and causes a repulsive force against the gravitation. A possible potential barrier prevents the mater(antimatter) particles to enter the space between two branes. However, by the quantum tunnelling, a sizable anti-matter flux may come to our brane. In this work by considering two possible models, i.e. the naive flat space-time and Randall-Sundrum models and using the observational data on the visible matter in our universe as inputs, we derive the antimatter flux which would be observed by the AMS detector.
