In the dense supernova core, self-interactions may align the flavor polarization vectors of neutrinos and antineutrinos, and induce collective flavor transformations. Different alignment ansatzes are known to describe approximately the phenomena of synchronized or bipolar oscillations, and the split of neutrino energy spectra. We discuss another phenomenon observed in some numerical experiments in inverted hierarchy, showing features akin to a low-energy split of antineutrino spectra. The phenomenon appears to be approximately described by another alignment ansatz which, in the considered scenario, reduces the (nonadiabatic) dynamics of all energy modes to only two neutrino plus two antineutrino modes. The associated spectral features, however, appear to be fragile when passing from single- to multi-angle simulations.
