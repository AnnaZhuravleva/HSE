High precision data of lepton angular distributions for $\gamma^*/Z$ production in $pp$ collisions at the LHC, covering broad ranges of dilepton transverse momenta ($q_T$) and rapidity ($y$), were recently reported. Strong $q_T$ dependencies were observed for several angular distribution coefficients, $A_i$, including $A_0 - A_4$. Significant $y$ dependencies were also found for the coefficients $A_1$, $A_3$ and $A_4$, while $A_0$ and $A_2$ exhibit very weak rapidity dependence. Using an intuitive geometric picture we show that the $q_T$ and $y$ dependencies of the angular distributions coefficients can be well described.
