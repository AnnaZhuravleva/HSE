We discuss the production of the exotic doubly-charmed tetraquark mesons ${\rm T}_{{\rm c}{\rm c}}({\rm c}{\rm c}\bar{\rm u}\bar{\rm d})$ from electron-positron collisions. ${\rm T}_{{\rm c}{\rm c}}({\rm c}{\rm c}\bar{\rm u}\bar{\rm d})$ is a compact exotic hadron whose binding energy is provided by the diquark correlations. We evaluate the production cross section in the electron-positron collisions using the nonrelativistic QCD framework, and investigate the difference of the production cross section for different color configurations in two charm quarks (antitriplet and sextet), where the mixing of different configurations is suppressed in the heavy quark limit. The total cross section is estimated by modeling the nonperturbative fragmentation process of the charm quark pair into the tetraquark by the wavefunction of the tetraquark and the probability of picking up the light quarks. We find that the internal color configurations are distinguishable by the qualitative features of the differential cross sections which are independent of the nonperturbative matrix elements.
