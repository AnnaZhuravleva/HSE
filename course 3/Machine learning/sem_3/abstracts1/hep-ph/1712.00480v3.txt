Inclusive jet cross section measurements from the ATLAS, CDF, CMS, D0, H1, STAR, and ZEUS experiments are explored for determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{\text{s}}(M_{\text{Z}})$. Various jet cross section data sets are reviewed, their consistency is examined, and the benefit of their simultaneous inclusion in the $\alpha_{\text{s}}(M_{\text{Z}})$ determination is demonstrated. Different methods for the statistical analysis of these data are compared and one method is proposed for a coherent treatment of all data sets. While the presented studies are based on next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), they lay the groundwork for determinations of $\alpha_{\text{s}}(M_{\text{Z}})$ at next-to-next-to-leading order.
