We have presented the results for the single and double spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings for proton in a light front quark-diquark model. The asymmetries generated by the T-even TMDs are discussed here. The model predictions are found to agree with the available data. We also present our model predictions for the Collins asymmetry for the future electron-ion collider experiments.
