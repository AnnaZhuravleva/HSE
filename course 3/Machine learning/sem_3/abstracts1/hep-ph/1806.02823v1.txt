We explore the constraints and phenomenology of possibly the simplest scenario that could account at the same time for the active neutrino masses and the dark matter in the Universe within a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, namely right-handed neutrino dark matter. We find that null searches from lepton and hadron colliders require dark matter with a mass below 900 GeV to annihilate through a resonance. Additionally, the very strong constraints from high-energy dilepton searches fully exclude the model for $ 150 \, \text{GeV} < m_{Z'} < 3 \, \text{TeV}$. We further explore the phenomenology in the high mass region (i.e. masses $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1) \, \text{TeV}$) and highlight theoretical arguments, related to the appearance of a Landau pole or an instability of the potential, disfavoring large portions of this parameter space. Collectively, these considerations illustrate that a minimal extension of the Standard Model via a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry with a viable thermal dark matter candidate is difficult to achieve without fine-tuning. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the model that relieve tension with collider constraints by reducing the gauge coupling required to produce the correct relic abundance.
