We consider a baryogenesis scenario via the oscillation of right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses of the order of GeV, which are also responsible for neutrino masses by the seesaw mechanism. We study how the initial condition alters the prediction of the present baryon asymmetry by this mechanism. It is usually assumed that the abundance of right-handed neutrinos is zero after the reheating of the inflationary universe and they are produced in scattering processes by the renomalizable Yukawa interaction. However, the higher-dimensional operator with right-handed neutrinos may provide an additional production which is most effective at the reheating epoch. It is shown that such an initial abundance of right-handed neutrinos can significantly modify the prediction when the strong washout of the asymmetry is absent. This leads to the parameter space of the model for the successful baryogenesis being enlarged.
