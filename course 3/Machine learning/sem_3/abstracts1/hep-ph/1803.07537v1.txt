We perform a global fit of parton distribution functions (PDFs) together with the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the quark masses $m_c$, $m_b$ and $m_t$ at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. The analysis applies the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}\, $ renormalization scheme for $\alpha_s$ and all quark masses. It is performed in the fixed-flavor number scheme for $n_f=3, 4, 5$ and uses the same data as the previous fit of the ABMP16 PDF at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). The new NLO PDFs complement the set of ABMP16 PDFs and are to be used consistently with NLO QCD predictions for hard scattering processes. At NLO we obtain the value $\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z) = 0.1191 \pm 0.0011$ compared to $\alpha_s^{(n_f=5)}(M_Z) = 0.1147 \pm 0.0008$ at NNLO.
