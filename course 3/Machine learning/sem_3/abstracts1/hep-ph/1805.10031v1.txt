Within the framework of residual symmetry, two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ type associated $\mu\tau$-interchange symmetries robustly constrain the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ in a model independent way. Both of them predict simultaneous maximality of $\delta$ and the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$. This seems to be in tension with the present global status of the neutrino oscillation parameters. Still there is a scope of large deviation in $\delta$ from its maximal value for the near maximality of $\theta_{23}$. Therefore, we ask to analyze the generalized versions of the associated $\mu\tau$-interchange symmetries, referred to as associated $\mu\tau$-mixing which are the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries that accompany a $\mu\tau$-mixing symmetry. The proposed symmetry allows one of the mentioned parameters to be nonmaximal while the other being maximal. We show that the parameter that generalizes $\mu\tau$-interchange to $\mu\tau$-mixing, cannot be arbitrarily large. Even a small departure from the $\mu\tau$-interchange, or in other words, even a weak $\mu\tau$-mixing could result in a large deviation in $\delta$.
