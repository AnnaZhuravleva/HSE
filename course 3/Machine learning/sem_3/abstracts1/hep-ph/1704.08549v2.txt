I present higher-order radiative corrections from collinear and soft gluon emission for the associated production of a charged Higgs boson with a $W$ boson. The calculation uses expressions from resummation at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy. From the resummed cross section I derive analytical formulas at approximate NNLO and N$^3$LO. Total cross sections are presented for the process $b{\bar b} \rightarrow H^- W^+$ at various LHC energies. The transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the charged Higgs boson are also calculated.
