We have no certain knowledge of the early history of dark matter (DM). In this paper we propose a scenario where DM is produced post-recombination but prior to the cosmic dawn. It helps to relax the bounds on DM interactions, in particular with baryons, from the CMB. It may be of interest in some circumstances, for example, to understand the recent cosmic dawn 21-cm signal anomaly. We argue that the cosmic gas cooling mechanism via the minicharged DM-baryon scattering may be viable even if it takes up the total DM budget. We also investigate the possibility of a gluon-philic mediator of a few 10 keV, to find that the most reliable exclusion is from the neutron scattering.
