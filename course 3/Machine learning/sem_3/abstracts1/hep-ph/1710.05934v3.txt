The prediction for $p_T$ spectra of various resonances produced in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at the LHC in equilibrium and non-equilibrium models is made. It includes the $\eta$, $\rho$(770), $\Sigma$(1385), $\Lambda$(1520), and $\Xi$(1530). The apparent differences may allow to distinguish between the models.
