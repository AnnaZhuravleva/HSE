Peripheral nucleon-nucleus collisions occur at the high energies mainly through the interaction with one constituent quark from the incident nucleon. The central collisions should involve all three constituent quarks and each of them can interact several times. We calculate the average number of quark-nucleus interactions for both the cases in good agreement with the experimental data on $\phi$-meson, $K^{*0}$ and all charged secondaries productions in $p+Pb$ collisions at LHC energy $\sqrt s = 5$ TeV.
