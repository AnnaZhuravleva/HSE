Under the assignment of $a_0(1450)$ as the ground isovector scalar meson, the strong decays of $a_0(1950)$ and $a_0(2020)$ are evaluated in the $^3P_0$ model. Our calculations suggest that $a_0(1950)$ and $a_0(2020)$ can be regarded as the same resonance referring to $a_0(3^3P_0)$. The masses and strong decays of $a_0(2^3P_0)$ and $a_0(4^3P_0)$ are also predicted, which can be useful in the search for radially excited scalar mesons in the future.
