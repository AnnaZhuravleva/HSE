The dark axion portal is a recently introduced portal between the standard model and the dark sector. It connects both the dark photon and the axion (or axion-like particle) to the photon simultaneously through an anomaly triangle. While the vector portal and the axion portal have been popular venues to search for the dark photon and axion, respectively, the new portal provides new detection channels if they coexist. The dark axion portal is not a result of the simple combination of the two portals, and its value is not determined by the other portal values; it should be tested independently. In this paper, we discuss implications of the new portal for the leptonic g-2 and B-factories. We provide the model-independent constraints on the axion-photon-dark photon coupling and discuss the sensitivities of the recently activated Belle-II experiment, which will play an important role in testing the new portal.
