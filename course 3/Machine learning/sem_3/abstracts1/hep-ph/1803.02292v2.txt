In this work, we perform a analysis of semi-leptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of heavy baryons: $\Lambda_{b},\Xi_{b},\Omega_{b}$ and $\Lambda_{c},\Xi_{c},\Omega_{c}$. For nonleptonic decay modes, we study only the factorizable channels induced by the external W-emission. The two spectator quarks in baryonic transitions are treated as a diquark and form factors are calculated in the light-front approach. Using the results for form factors, we also calculate some corresponding semi-leptonic and nonleptonic decay widths. We find that our results are comparable with the available experimental data and other theoretical predictions. Decay branching fractions for many channels are found to reach the level $10^{-3}\sim10^{-2}$, which are promising to be discovered in the future measurements at BESIII, LHCb and BelleII. The SU(3) symmetry in semi-leptonic decays is examined and sources of symmetry breaking are discussed.
