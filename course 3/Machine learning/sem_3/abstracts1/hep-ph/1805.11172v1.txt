We consider a fermionic dark matter particle as a singlet Majorana fermion which carrying magnetic dipole moment to explore its contribution on the polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. We show that this type of interaction leads to the B-mode polarization in presence of primordial scalar perturbations which is in contrast with standard scenario for the CMB polarization. We numerically calculate the B-mode power spectra and plot $C_l^{BB}$ for different dark matter masses and the $r$-parameter. We show that the dark matter with masses about few MeV have valuable contribution on $C_l^{BB}$. Meanwhile, the dark matters with mass $m_d\leq0.5MeV$ for $r=0.07$ ( $m_d\leq8MeV$ for $r=0.09$) can be excluded experimentally. Furthermore, our results put a bound on the magnetic dipole moment about $M\leq 10^{-15} e\,\,cm$ in agreement with the other reported constraints.
