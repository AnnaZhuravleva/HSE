As an improvement of the QCD sum rule method to study modifications of light vector mesons in nuclear matter and/or at finite temperature, we calculate the Wilson coefficients of all independent gluonic non-scalar operators up to dimension 6 in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the vector channel for light quarks. To obtain the gluon part of the light quark OPE from the heavy quark one, we also compute the heavy quark expansion of the relevant quark condensates. Together with the results for the quark operators that are already available in the literature, this completes the OPE of the vector channel in a hot or dense medium for operators up to dimension 6.
