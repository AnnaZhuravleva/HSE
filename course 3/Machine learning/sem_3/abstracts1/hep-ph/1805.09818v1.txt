In this work we analyze quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations considering the Open Quantum System framework and oscillations through matter for three neutrino families. Taking DUNE as a case study we performed sensitivity analyses for two neutrino flux configurations finding limits for the decoherence parameters. We also offer a physical interpretation for a new peak which arises at the $\nu_{e}$ appearance probability with decoherence. The best sensitivity regions found for the decoherence parameters are $\Gamma_{21}\le 1.2\times10^{-23}\,\text{GeV}$ and $\Gamma_{32}\le 7.7\times10^{-25}\,\text{GeV}$ at $90\%$ C. L.
