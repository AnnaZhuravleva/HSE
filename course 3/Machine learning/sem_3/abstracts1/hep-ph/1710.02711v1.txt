We compute the correlation of the net baryon number with the electric charge ($\chi_{BQ}$) for an interacting hadron gas using the S-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics. The observable $\chi_{BQ}$ is particularly sensitive to the details of the pion-nucleon interaction, which are consistently incorporated in the current scheme via the empirical scattering phase shifts. Comparing to the recent lattice QCD studies in the $(2+1)$-flavor system, we find that the natural implementation of interactions and the proper treatment of resonances in the S-matrix approach lead to an improved description of the lattice data over that obtained in the hadron resonance gas model.
