Motivated by the recent finding of five $\Omega_c$ states by the LHCb collaboration, and the successful reproduction of three of them in a recent approach searching for molecular states of meson-baryon with the quantum numbers of $\Omega_c$, we extend these ideas and make predictions for the interaction of meson-baryon in the beauty sector, searching for poles in the scattering matrix that correspond to physical states. We find several $\Omega_b$ states: two states with masses 6405~MeV and 6465~MeV for $J^P= \frac{1}{2}^-$; two more states with masses 6427~MeV and 6665~MeV for $\frac{3}{2}^-$; and three states between 6500 and 6820~MeV, degenerate with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-,\,\frac{3}{2}^-$, stemming from the interaction of vector-baryon in the beauty sector.
