We revisit the minimal supersymmetric $SU(5)$ grand unified theory with three right-handed neutrinos in which universality conditions for soft-supersymmetry breaking parameters are imposed at an input scale above the unification scale. If the Majorana masses for the neutrinos are around $10^{15}~\mathrm{GeV}$, large mixing angles and phases in the neutrino sector lead to flavor-violation and $CP$-violation in the right-handed down squark and left-handed slepton sectors. Since the observed Higgs boson mass and the proton decay constraints indicate sfermions have masses larger than a few TeV, flavor and $CP$ constraints are less restrictive. We explore the constraints on models with a universal soft-supersymmetry breaking input parameters coming from proton stability, electric dipole moments, $\mu\to e\gamma$ decays, and the Higgs mass observed at the LHC. Regions compatible with all constraints can be found if non-zero $A$-terms are taken.
