We derive the fully differential cross section of the Higgs-strahlung process $f \bar{f} \to Z \to Z (\to f_Z \bar{f}_Z) X (\to f_X \bar{f}_X)$, where $f$, $f_Z$, and $f_X$ are arbitrary fermions and $X$ is a spin-zero particle with arbitrary couplings to $Z$ bosons and fermions. This process with $f = e$ and $X = h$ ($h$ denotes the Higgs boson) is planned to be measured at the ILC. Using the derived fully differential cross section, we can obtain an analytical expression for an observable connected with the Higgs-strahlung and convenient to be measured at the ILC. Thus, as soon as this observable is measured, we will be able to put some constraints on the Higgs boson couplings to a pair of $Z$ bosons.
