The Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) is a method that can be used to infer the value of an unknown quantity in a set of probability functions. In this work we review two applications of MEP: one giving a precise inference of the Higgs boson mass value; and the other one allowing to infer the mass of the axion. In particular, for the axion we assume that it has a decay channel into pairs of neutrinos, in addition to the decay into two photons. The Shannon entropy associated to an initial ensemble of axions decaying into photons and neutrinos is then built for maximization.
