We investigate Higgs-boson pair production at the LHC when the final state system arises from decays of vector-like quarks coupling to the Higgs boson and the Standard Model quarks. Our phenomenological study includes next-to-leading-order QCD corrections, which are important to guarantee accurate predictions, and focuses on a detailed analysis of a di-Higgs signal in the four $b$-jet channel. Whereas existing Run II CMS and ATLAS analyses are not specifically designed for probing non-resonant, vector-like-quark induced, di-Higgs production, we show that they nevertheless offer some potential for these modes. We then investigate the possibility of distinguishing between the various di-Higgs production mechanisms by exploiting the kinematic properties of the signal.
