In this paper we calculate the total and fiducial cross sections as well as differential distributions for the Higgs-strahlung or VH process p p -> VH -> l nu/l- l+ + H, (V = W or Z ) including QCD and electro-weak corrections up to next-to-leading order by using the before and after reweighting photon PDFs of NNPDF2.3qed,NNPDF3.0qed, MRST2004qed, CT14QEDinc, and LUXqed at the LHC with 13 TeV and Higgs-boson mass M=125 GeV. The predictions from the various photon PDFs before and after reweighting against each other are in good agreement. The photon PDF uncertainties of the photon induced cross sections decrease significantly with the reweighting-PDFs.
