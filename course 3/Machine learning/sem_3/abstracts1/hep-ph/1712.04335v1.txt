The oscillating probabilities of lepton flavor changing neutrino oscillation processes, where neutrinos are detected by charged-current and neutral-current interactions, are calculated in a quantum field-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations based on a modification of the Feynman propagator in the momentum reprsentation. The approach is most similar to the standard Feynman diagram technique in the momentum representation. It is found that the oscillating distance-dependent probabilities of detecting an electron in experiments with neutrino production in the muonic decay of $\pi^+$-meson and the detection of the produced neutrino by charged-current and neutral-current interactions exactly coincide with the corresponding probabilities calculated in the standard approach.
