The particle discovered in the Higgs boson searches at the LHC with a mass of about 125 GeV can be identified with one neutral Higgs boson in a variety of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories with an extended Higgs sector. Limits on the couplings between additional Higgs fields to the electroweak gauge-bosons in such theories can be obtained by model-independent Higgs searches at lepton colliders. We present an extrapolation of the limits obtained at LEP for a future lepton collider and can show that the ILC with polarized beams and a total luminosity of ${\cal L}=2000$~fb$^{-1}$ is very sensitive to such reduced Higgs-gauge-boson couplings up to about 4%. We apply the extrapolated limits on BSM models with an extended Higgs-sector.
