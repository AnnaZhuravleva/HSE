We perform a non-perturbative study of the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) in the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) by deriving a dimensionally-reduced high-temperature effective theory for the model, and matching to known results for the phase diagram of the effective theory. We find regions of the parameter space where the theory exhibits a strong first order phase transition. In particular, our findings are consistent with previous perturbative results suggesting that the primary signature of a strong EWPT in the 2HDM is $m_{A_0} > m_{H_0} + m_Z$.
