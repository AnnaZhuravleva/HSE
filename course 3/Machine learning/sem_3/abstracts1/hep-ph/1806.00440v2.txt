The double quarkonium production in single and double diffractive processes is investigated considering $pp$ collisions at the Run 2 LHC energy. Using the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism for the quarkonium production and the Resolved Pomeron model to describe the diffractive processes, we estimate the rapidity and transverse momentum dependencies of the cross sections for the $J/\Psi J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon \Upsilon$ production. The contributions of the color-singlet and color-octet channels are estimated and predictions for the total cross sections in the kinematical regions of the LHC experiments are also presented. Our results demonstrate that the double quarkonium production in diffractive processes is not negligible and that its study can be useful to test the underlying assumptions present in the description of the single and double diffractive processes.
