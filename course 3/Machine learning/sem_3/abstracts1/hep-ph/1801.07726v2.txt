We consider a light dark matter candidate which is produced by the freeze-out mechanism with $3\rightarrow2$ annihilations, the so called Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs). SIMPs are identified as dark pions in dark chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) where both light mass and strong coupling needed for SIMPs can be realized by strong dynamics. In QCD-like theories with $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R /SU(3)_V$ flavor symmetry, including dark vector mesons in the hidden local symmetry scheme, we illustrate that dark vector mesons unitarize the dark ChPT efficiently, thus determine the correct relic density condition within the validity of the dark ChPT.
