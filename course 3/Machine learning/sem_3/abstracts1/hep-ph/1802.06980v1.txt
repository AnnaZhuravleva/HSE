We propose low-virtuality leptoproduction of open-charm, $p^\uparrow l\to D^0+X$, as a probe of the gluon Sivers function (GSF). At leading-order, this process directly probes the gluon content of the proton, making detection of a trasverse single-spin asymmetry in the process a clear indication of a non-zero GSF. Considering the kinematics of the proposed future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we present predictions for asymmetry using fits of the GSF available in literature. We also study the asymmetry at the level of muons produced in D-meson decays and find that the asymmetry is preserved therein as well.
