The present work introduces two possible extensions of the Standard Model Higgs sector. In the first case, the Zee-Babu type model for the generation of neutrino mass is augmented with a scalar triplet and additional singly charged scalar singlets. The second scenario, on the other hand, generalizes the Type-II seesaw model by replicating the number of the scalar triplets. A $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry is imposed in case of both the scenarios, but, allowed to be violated by terms of mass dimension two and three for generating neutrino masses and mixings. We examine how the models so introduced can explain the experimental observation on the muon anomalous magnetic moment. We estimate the two-loop contribution to neutrino mass induced by the scalar triplet, in addition to what comes from the doubly charged singlet in the usual Zee-Babu framework, in the first model. On the other hand, the neutrino mass arises in the usual Type-II fashion in the second model. In addition, the role of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry in suppressing lepton flavor violation is also elucidated.
