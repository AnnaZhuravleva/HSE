The measurement of the triple Higgs coupling is a key benchmark for the LHC and future colliders. It directly probes the Higgs potential and its fundamental properties in connection to new physics beyond the Standard Model. There exist two phase space regions with an enhanced sensitivity to the Higgs self-coupling, the Higgs pair production threshold and an intermediate top pair threshold. We show how the invariant mass distribution of the Higgs pair offers a systematic way to extract the Higgs self-coupling, focusing on the leading channel $pp\to hh\to b\bar b\ \gamma\gamma+X$. We utilize new features of the signal events at higher energies and estimate the potential of a high-energy upgrade of the LHC and a future hadron collider with realistic simulations. We find that the high-energy upgrade of the LHC to 27 TeV would have the potential to reach 30% accuracy to measure the SM Higgs self-coupling and a future 100 TeV collider could improve the measurement to better than 10%.
