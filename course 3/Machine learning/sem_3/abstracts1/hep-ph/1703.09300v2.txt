We discuss a dark family of lepton-like particles with their own "private" gauge bosons under a local SU'(2)xU'(1) symmetry. The product of dark and visible gauge groups SU'(2)xU'(1)xSU_w(2)xU_Y(1) is broken dynamically to the diagonal (vector-like) subgroup SU(2)xU(1) through the coupling of two scalar fields M_i to the Higgs field and the dark lepton-like particles. After substituting vacuum expectation values for the fields M_i, the Higgs doublet couples in the standard way to the left-handed SU'(2) doublet and right-handed singlets of the dark gauge group, but not to the extra gauge bosons. This defines a new Higgs portal, where the "dark leptons" can contribute to the dark matter and interact with Standard Model matter through Higgs exchange. It also defines a dark matter model with internal interactions. At low energies, the Standard Model Higgs boson aligns the two electroweak-type symmetry groups in the visible and dark sectors and generates the masses in both sectors. We also identify charge assignments in the dark sector which allow for the formation of dark atoms as bound states of dark lepton-like particles. The simplest single-component dark matter version of the model predicts a dark matter mass around 96 GeV, but the corresponding nucleon recoil cross section is ruled out by the xenon based experiments. However, multi-component models or models with a dark SU'(2) doublet mediator instead of the Higgs portal would still be viable.
