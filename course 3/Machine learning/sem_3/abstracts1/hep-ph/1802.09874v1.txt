We have investigated the production potential of the spin-1/2 excited muons, predicted by the preonic models, at the four SPPC (Super Proton-Proton Collider)-based muon-proton colliders in different center-of-mass energies. For the signal process \mu p\rightarrow\mu^{\star}X\rightarrow\mu\gamma X, the production cross-section and the decay width values of the excited muons have been calculated. The pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the final state particles of muons and photons have been obtained to be determine the kinematical cuts best suited for discovery of the excited muons. By applying these cuts we have gotten the discovery, observation and exclusion mass limits of the excited muons for two compositeness scale values. It is shown that the discovery limits on the excited muons in case the compositeness scale equals to 100 TeV are 2.7, 3.9, 3.1 and 6.7 TeV for center-of-mass energies of 10.3, 14.2, 14.6 and 20.2 TeV, respectively.
