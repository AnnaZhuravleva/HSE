The $\phi$ scalar boson is a new mediator proposed to describe the direct light-by-light scattering observed recently in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) with ATLAS detector where two photons interact directly to gives two photons in the final state. The proposed lagrangian present a description to the forbidden process. The description presented in this paper consist the interaction terms, the coupling to the Higgs boson to generate the mass for this new resonance and the simulation using proton proton in order to observe this process in other nominal LHC collisions, since the process is observed in heavy-ions collisions.
