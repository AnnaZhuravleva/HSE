Now that the NOvA experiment is approaching two years run time and has released some preliminary data, some constraints for the oscillation parameters can be inferred. Currently the best fits for NOvA are three separate results, the reason they are indistinct is that they produce almost degenerate probability curves. It has been postulated that these degeneracies can be resolved by running antineutrinos at NOvA and/or combining its data with T2K. However, this degeneracy resolution power can be compromised if sterile neutrinos are present due to additional degrees of freedom that can significantly alter the oscillation probability for any of the current best fits. We aim to investigate this degradation in predictive power and the effect of the DUNE experiment on it.
