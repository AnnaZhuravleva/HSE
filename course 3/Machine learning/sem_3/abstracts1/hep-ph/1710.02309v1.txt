Transport calculations are the tool to study medium modifications of heavy-flavour particle distributions in high-energy nuclear collisions. We give a brief overview on their state-of-the art as well as on the questions remaining open, from the evaluation of the transport coefficients to the effects of in-medium hadronization, from the rescattering in the hadronic phase to the possible presence of hot-medium effects also in small systems, like proton-nucleus collisions.
