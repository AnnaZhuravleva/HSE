The existing anomalies appearing in decays of the form $b\to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ constitute a possible hint for new physics. We point out that modifications to the SM results due to heavy neutrinos could account for the observed deviations while satisfying existing constraints from lepton flavor violating processes. The required mixing angle, however, is an order of magnitude larger than suggested by recent global fits to lepton flavor conserving processes. We frame our discussion in terms of a Type-I seesaw model, but it can be made more general.
