In the $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{(B-L)/2}$ extension of the standard model, a minimal (but asymmetric) scalar sector consists of one $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{(B-L)/2}$ doublet and one $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ bidoublet.   Previous and recent studies have shown that this choice is useful for understanding neutrino mass as well as dark matter. The constraints from flavor changing neutral currents mediated by the scalar sector are discussed in the context of the latest experimental data.
