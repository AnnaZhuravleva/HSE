We present new results for the suppression of high transverse momentum charmonium [$J/\psi, \psi(2S)$] and bottomonium [$\Upsilon(1S),\Upsilon(2S),\Upsilon(3S)$] states in Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Our theoretical formalism combines the collisional dissociation of quarkonia, as they propagate in the quark-gluon plasma, with the thermal wavefunction effects due to the screening of the $Q\bar{Q}$ attractive potential in the medium. We find that a good description of the relative suppression of the ground and higher excited quarkonium states, transverse momentum and centrality distributions is achieved, when comparison to measurements at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV is performed. Theoretical predictions for the highest Pb+Pb center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV at the LHC, where new experimental results are being finalized, are also presented.
