The new module SMZp is developed for the Monte-Carlo generator Sherpa that extends simulations of the Standard model (SM) processes with the Abelian $Z'$ boson in the model-independent approach. The special derived earlier relations between the $Z'$ couplings to the SM fields proper to the renormalizable theories are taken into account. Using this module, dependence of the $Z'$ production cross section on the $Z-Z'$ mixing angle $\theta_0$ in the Drell-Yan process is investigated within the range of 1 TeV $\leq m_{Z'} \leq$ 5 TeV. It is shown that if it is essential to keep the $Z'$ theory renormalizable, $\theta_0$ cannot be neglected as it is often done, even if it is small.
