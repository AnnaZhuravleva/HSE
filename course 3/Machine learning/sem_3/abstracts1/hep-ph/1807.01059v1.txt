We study the electromagnetic form factors of the doubly charmed baryons, using covariant chiral perturbation theory within the extended on-mass-shell (EOMS) scheme. Vector-meson contributions are also taken into account. We present results for the baryon magnetic moments, charge and magnetic radii. While some of the chiral Lagrangian parameters could be set to values determined in previous works, the available lattice results for $\Xi_{cc}^+$ and $\Omega_{cc}^+$ only allow for robust constraints on the low-energy constant (LEC) combination, $c_{89}(=-\frac{1}{3}c_8+4c_9)$. The couplings of the doubly charmed baryons to the vector mesons have been estimated assuming the Okubo--Zweig--Iizuka (OZI) rule. We also give the expressions for the form factors of the double beauty baryons considering the masses predicted in the framework of quark models. A comparison of our results with those obtained in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT) at the same chiral order is made.
