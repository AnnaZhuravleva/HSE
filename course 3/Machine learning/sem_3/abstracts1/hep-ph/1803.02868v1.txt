The Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) is a popular particle physics candidate for the dark matter (DM). It can annihilate and/or decay to neutrino and antineutrino pair. The proposed 50 kt Magnetized Iron CALorimeter (MagICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) can observe these pairs over the conventional atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino fluxes. If we do not see any excess of events in ten years, then INO-Magical can place competitive limits on self-annihilation cross-section ($\langle\sigma v\rangle$) and decay lifetime ($\tau$) of dark matter at 90\% C.L.: $\langle\sigma v\rangle\leq 1.87\,\times\,10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 4.8\,\times\,10^{24}$ s for $m_\chi$ = 10 GeV assuming the NFW as DM density profile.
