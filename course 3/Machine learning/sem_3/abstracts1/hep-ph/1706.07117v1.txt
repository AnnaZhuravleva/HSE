We have studied the 1-loop corrections to the scalar-photon vertex interactions of a minimal Lorentz-violating and CPT-odd scalar electrodynamics with the photon having a sufficiently small mass. The CPT-odd term is the well known Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) which only modifies the kinetic term of the photon field. We have observed the radiative generation of the UV finite term $igw_\mu \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu} \left[ \phi^\dagger{D}_\nu\phi-\phi({D}_\nu\phi) ^\dagger \right] $, a dimension-5 operator which behaves like an anomalous magnetic moment for the scalar particle. The current bounds for photon mass and CPT violation are used to estimate a upper-bound for the coupling $% \left|{g{w_{z}}} \right| < 1 \times{10^{- 13}}\text{eV}^{-1}$. In order to estimate another upper-bound for the generated coupling, we have also analyzed its contribution to the pionic (kaonic) hydrogen energy. In this case, the experimental data for the 1S strong shift transitions are used to compute the upper-limit $\left|g w_{z}\right| < 1.1 \times{10^{-12}}\text{eV}% ^{-1}$.
