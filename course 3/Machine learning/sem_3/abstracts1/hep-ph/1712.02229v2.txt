We compute the leading colour contributions to five-gluon scattering at two loops in massless QCD. The integrands of all independent helicity amplitudes are evaluated using d-dimensional generalised unitarity cuts and finite field reconstruction techniques. Numerical evaluation of the integral basis is performed with sector decomposition methods to obtain the first benchmark results for all helicity configurations of a 2 to 3 scattering process in QCD.
