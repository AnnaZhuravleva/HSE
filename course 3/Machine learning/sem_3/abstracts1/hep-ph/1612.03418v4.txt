In the light of the latest data by LHCf collaboration of the LHC on leading neutrons spectra it is possible to obtain total pion-proton cross-sections in the TeV energy region. In this work the exact extraction procedure is shown. Final numbers for the pion-proton cross-section are collected at several different values of the colliding energy and compared with some popular theoretical predictions. Errors of results are estimated.
