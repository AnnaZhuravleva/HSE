We study the propagation of a linearly polarized laser beam in the external transverse magnetic field taking into consideration the vacuum polarization by arbitrary spin particles. Induced ellipticity of the beam are evaluated using the effective Lagrangian. With the help of the PVLAS experimental data, we obtain bounds on masses of charged higher spin particles contributed to ellipticity.
