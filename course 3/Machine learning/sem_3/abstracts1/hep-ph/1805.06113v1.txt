Assuming for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) a Maxwellian velocity distribution in the Galaxy we explore in a systematic way the relative sensitivity of an extensive set of existing and projected Dark Matter direct detection experiments to each of the 14 couplings that parameterize the most general non-relativistic effective Hamiltonian allowed by Galilean invariance for the elastic scattering off nuclei of WIMPs up to spin 1/2. We perform our analysis in terms of two free parameters: the WIMP mass $m_{\chi}$ and the ratio between the WIMP-neutron and the WIMP-proton couplings $c^n/c^p$. We include the modified signal spectral shape due to non-standard interactions when it is needed in the determination of the bound, such as in the case of background subtraction or of the application of the optimal-interval method. For each coupling, in the $m_{\chi}$-$c^n/c^p$ plane we provide contour plots of the most stringent 90% C.L. bound on the WIMP-nucleon cross section and show the experiment providing it. We find that 9 experiments out of the 15 present Dark Matter searches considered in our analysis provide the most stringent bound on some of the effective couplings for a given choice of $(m_{\chi},c^n/c^p)$: this is evidence of the complementarity of different target nuclei and/or different combinations of count-rates and energy thresholds when the search of DM is extended to a wide range of possible interactions.
