The strong decays of the two resonances $\eta(2225)$ and $\phi(2170)$ are discussed for selected decay channels. The two resonances are considered as the $\Lambda \bar{\Lambda}$ bound states in the molecular scenario. The phenomenological hadronic molecular approach is employed for the calculation of respective decay modes using effective Lagrangians. Our results show that the decay modes $\eta(2225)\to K^*K$ and $\phi(2175) \to KK$ dominate over the partial decay widths of $\eta(2275)\to VV (\phi\phi, \omega\omega, K^*K^*)$ and $\phi(2175)\to VS (\omega\sigma, K^*K^*_0(800), \phi f_0(980))$ due to phase space and couplings.
