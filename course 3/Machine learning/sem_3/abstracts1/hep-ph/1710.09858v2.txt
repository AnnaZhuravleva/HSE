We report on the first global QCD analysis of the quark transversity distributions in the nucleon from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS), using a new Monte Carlo method based on nested sampling and constraints on the isovector tensor charge $g_T$ from lattice QCD. A simultaneous fit to the available SIDIS Collins asymmetry data is compatible with $g_T$ values extracted from a comprehensive reanalysis of existing lattice simulations, in contrast to previous analyses which found significantly smaller $g_T$ values. The contributions to the nucleon tensor charge from $u$ and $d$ quarks are found to be $\delta u = 0.3(2)$ and $\delta d = -0.7(2)$ at a scale $Q^2 = 2$ GeV$^2$.
