We develop a comprehensive description of three flavor neutrino oscillations inside the Earth in terms of neutrino oscillograms in the whole range of nadir angles and for energies above 0.1 GeV. The effects of the 1-2 mass splitting and mixing as well the interference of the 1-2 and 1-3 modes of oscillations are quantified. The 1-2 mass splitting and mixing lead to the appearance, apart from the resonance MSW peaks, of the parametric resonance peak for core-crossing trajectories at E_nu ~= 0.2 GeV. We show that the interference effects, in particular CP violation, have a domain structure with borders determined by the solar and atmospheric magic lines and the lines of the interference phase condition. The dependence of the oscillograms on the Dirac CP-violating phase is studied. We show that for sin^2(2 theta13) < 0.1 the strongest dependence of the oscillograms on delta is in the 1-2 and 1-3 resonance regions.
