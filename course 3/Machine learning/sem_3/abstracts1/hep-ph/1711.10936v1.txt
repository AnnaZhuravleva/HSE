We study the three-body radiative decays $B\to \phi(\rho) K\gamma$ induced by a flavor-changing neutral current in the perturbative QCD approach. Pseudoscalar-vector ($PV$) distribution amplitudes (DAs) are introduced for the final-state $\phi K$ ($\rho K$) pair to capture important infrared dynamics in the region with a small $PV$-pair invariant mass. The dependence of these $PV$ DAs on the parton momentum fraction is parametrized in terms of the Gegenbauer polynomials, and the dependence on the meson momentum fraction is derived through their normalizations to time-like $PV$ form factors. In addition to the dominant electromagnetic penguin, the subleading chromomagnetic penguin, quark-loop and annihilation diagrams are also calculated. After determining the $PV$ DAs from relevant branching-ratio data, the direct $CP$ asymmetries and decay spectra in the $PV$-pair invariant mass are predicted for each $B\to \phi(\rho) K\gamma$ mode.
