We propose a simple model of supersymmetric dark matter that can explain recent results from PAMELA and ATIC experiments. It is based on a U(1)_B-L extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The dark matter particle is a linear combination of the U(1)_B-L gaugino and Higgsino partners of Higgs fields that break the B-L around one TeV. The dominant mode of dark matter annihilation is to the lightest of the new Higgs fields, which has a mass in the GeV range, and its subsequent decay mainly produces taus or muons by the virtue of B-L charges. This light Higgs also results in Sommerfeld enhancement of the dark matter annihilation cross section, which can be >~ 10^3. For a dark matter mass in the 1-2 TeV range, the model provides a good fit to the PAMELA data and a reasonable fit to the ATIC data. We also briefly discuss the prospects of this model for direct detection experiments and the LHC.
