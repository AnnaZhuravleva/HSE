Instead of the usual dijet decay, the coloron may mainly decay into its own "Higgs bosons", which subsequently decay into many jets. This is a general feature of the renormalizable coloron model, where the corresponding "Higgs bosons" are a color-octet $\Theta$ and a color-singlet $\phi_I$. In this paper, we perform a detailed collider study for the signature of $pp \rightarrow G' \rightarrow (\Theta \rightarrow gg) (\phi_I \rightarrow gg q\bar{q})$ with the coloron $G'$ as a six-jet resonance. For a light $\phi_I$ below around 0.5 TeV, it may be boosted and behave as a four-prong fat jet. We also develop a jet-substructure-based search strategy to cover this boosted $\phi_I$ case. Independent of whether $\phi_I$ is boosted or not, the 13 TeV LHC with 100 fb$^{-1}$ has great discovery potential for a coloron with the mass sensitivity up to 5 TeV.
