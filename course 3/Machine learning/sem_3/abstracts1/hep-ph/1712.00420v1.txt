Successful leptogenesis within the conventional TeV-scale left-right implementation of type-I seesaw has been shown to require that the mass of the right-handed $W_R^\pm$ boson should have a lower bound much above the reach of the Large Hadron Collider. This bound arises from the necessity to suppress the washout of lepton asymmetry due to $W_R^\pm$-mediated $\Delta L\neq 0$ processes. We show that in an alternative quark seesaw realization of left-right symmetry, the above bound can be avoided. Lepton asymmetry in this model is generated not via the usual right-handed neutrino decay but rather via the decay of new heavy scalars producing an asymmetry in the $B-L$ carrying Higgs triplets responsible for type-II seesaw, whose subsequent decay leads to the lepton asymmetry. This result implies that any evidence for $W_R$ at the LHC 14 will point towards this alternative realization of left-right symmetry, which is also known to solve the strong CP problem.
