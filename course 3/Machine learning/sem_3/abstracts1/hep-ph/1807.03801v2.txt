We consider the phenomenology of glueball production and decay in theories with hidden glue. We focus on the case of folded supersymmetry (FSUSY) , where there is an unbroken $SU(3)$ gauge theory in the absence of light matter, leading to the formation of glueballs. We study their production through the annihilation of folded squarks into hidden gluons at the LHC, and model their fragmentation into glueballs. We obtain the distribution of displaced vertices, which is directly determined by the folded squark mass scale. Although here we specifically apply it to FSUSY, the procedure to model the hidden glue fragmentation into glueballs can be generalized to other similar theories.
