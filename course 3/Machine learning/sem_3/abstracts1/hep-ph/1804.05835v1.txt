In this paper, we study the cosmological phase transitions (PTs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in the singlet Majoron model. With one extra Higgs singlet been introduced besides the Standard Model Higgs doublet, the model should be dealt as a two-field problem properly. We firstly calculate the effective potential for the two classical scalars in the framework of finite temperature field theory, then make use of the public available Python package 'CosmoTransitions' to study the cosmological phase transitions, finally analyze the properties of gravitational waves generated by first order PTs. We find patterns of cosmological phase transitions in this model turns to be quite fruitful, usually there are multi-step PTs, either being first or higher orders, happening along distinguished directions. By confronting the PTGWs with space-borne gravitational wave interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, TAIJI and TianQin, we conclude only these vevs $v_{BL}$ with small values (smaller than $\sim {\cal O}(10)~{\rm GeV}$) may lead to astronomically interested GW signals.
