The decays of the negative $G$-parity meson $J/\psi$ into even numbers of pions violate $G$-parity. Such decays, as well as other $J/\psi$ decays into hadrons, can be parameterised in terms of three main intermediate virtual states: one photon, $\gamma$, three gluons, $ggg$ or two gluons and a photon, $gg \gamma$. Since the electromagnetic interaction does not conserve $G$-parity, $J/\psi$ decays into positive $G$-parity final states should be dominantly electromagnetic. Nevertheless, the one-photon contribution to $J/\psi\to\pi^+\pi^-$, that can be estimated by exploiting the cross section $\sigma(e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-)$, differs from the observed decay probability for 4.3 standard deviations. We present a computation of the $gg\gamma$ amplitude based on a phenomenological description of the decay mechanism in terms of dominant intermediate states $\eta\gamma$ and $\eta'\gamma$. The obtained value is of the order of the electromagnetic contribution.
