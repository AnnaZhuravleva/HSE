We study the three-body baryonic $B$ decays with one of the final states being the $\eta$ or $\eta'$ meson. Particularly, we predict that ${\cal B}(B^-\to\Lambda\bar p\eta,\Lambda\bar p\eta') =(4.3\pm 1.1,1.8\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-6}$ or $(2.7\pm 0.8,3.6\pm 0.7)\times 10^{-6}$ in two different scenarios due to the interfering effects, to be tested by the experimental measurements at BELLE and LHCb. For the corresponding baryonic $\bar B_s^0$ decays, we find that ${\cal B}(\bar B^0_s\to \Lambda\bar \Lambda \eta)=(0.7-1.4)\times 10^{-6}$ and ${\cal B}(\bar B^0_s\to \Lambda\bar \Lambda \eta')=(0.8-2.0)\times 10^{-6}$, which are accessible to the LHCb experiments.
