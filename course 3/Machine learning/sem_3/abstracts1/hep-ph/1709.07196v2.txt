Using the Regge-like formula $(M-m_Q)^2=\pi\sigma L$ between hadron mass $M$ and angular momentum $L$ with a heavy quark mass $m_Q$ and a string tension $\sigma$, we analyze all the heavy-light systems, i.e., $D/D_s/B/B_s$ mesons and charmed and bottom baryons.Numerical plots are obtained for all the heavy-light mesons of experimental data whose slope becomes nearly equal to 1/2 of that for light hadrons. Assuming that charmed and bottom baryons consist of one heavy quark and one light cluster of two light quarks (diquark), we apply the formula to all the heavy-light baryons including recently discovered $\Omega_c$'s and find that these baryons experimentally measured satisfy the above formula. We predict the average mass values of $B$, $B_s$, $\Lambda_b$, $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi_c$, and $\Omega_c$ with $L=2$ as 6.01, 6.13, 6.15, 3.05, 3.07, and 3.34 GeV, respectively. Our results on baryons suggest that these baryons can be safely regarded as heavy quark-light cluster configuration. We also find a universal description for all the heavy-light mesons as well as baryons, i.e., one unique line is enough to describe both of charmed and bottom heavy-light systems. Our results suggest that instead of mass itself, gluon flux energy is essential to obtain a linear trajectory.
