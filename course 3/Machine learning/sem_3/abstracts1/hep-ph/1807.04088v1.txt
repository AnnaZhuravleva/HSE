The energy evolution of the fluctuating proton structure is studied by solving the JIMWLK renormalization group equation. The initial condition at moderate $x$ is obtained by fitting the charm reduced cross section data from HERA, requiring that the proton size remains compatible with the diffractive vector meson production measurements. Additionally, we show that the nucleon shape fluctuations are visible in exclusive vector meson production off nuclei.
