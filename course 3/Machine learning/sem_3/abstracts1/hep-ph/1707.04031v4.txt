The mass and the wave function of doubly charmed $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ (ccu) baryon are evaluated using Green Function Monte Carlo method to solve the three-body problem with Cornell potential. The mass of $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ with spin $1/2$ is in a good agreement with the LHCb value. Simulation of the wave function by random walks resulted in a configuration of the quark-diquark type. The radius of $\Xi^{++}_{cc}$ is much larger than the size needed for a large isospin splitting. The prediction for the $\Omega_{cc}$ mass is presented.
