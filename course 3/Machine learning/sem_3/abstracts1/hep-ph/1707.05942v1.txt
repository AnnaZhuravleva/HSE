We propose a scale invariant model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking via top condensation within the minimal top condensate see-saw model. The classical scale invariance is realized nonlinearly by introducing conformal compensator scalar field, the dilaton, which plays crucial role in successful predictions for the Higgs boson. The dilaton mass and its mixing with the composite Higgs boson appears only at 2-loop level, both being proportional to the hierarchy between the electroweak and compositeness scales, $\propto v/\Lambda$. The mass scales in our model are generated via the mechanism of dimensional transmutation and the hierarchy $v/\Lambda \ll 1$ is radiatively stable, thus resolving the fine-tuning problem of the standard top condensate models.
