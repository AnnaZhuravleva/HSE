We consider a long range scalar force that mainly couples to dark matter and unstable Standard Model states, like the muon, with tiny strength. Probing this type of force would present a challenge to observations. We point out that the dependence of the induced background scalar field on dark matter number density can cause the mass of the unstable particles to have spatial and temporal variations. These variations, in turn, leave an imprint on the value of the fine structure constant $\alpha$, through threshold corrections, that could be detected in astronomical and cosmological measurements. Our mechanism can accommodate the mild preference of the Planck data for such a deviation, $(\alpha_{\rm CMB}-\alpha_{\rm present})/\alpha_{\rm present} = (-3.6\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-3}$. In this case, the requisite parameters typically imply that violations of Equivalence Principle may be within reach of future experiments.
