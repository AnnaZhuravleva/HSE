We describe SuperIso Relic, a public program for the calculation of dark matter relic density and direct and indirect detection rates, which includes in addition the SuperIso routines for the calculation of flavour physics observables. SuperIso Relic v4 incorporates many new features, namely the possibility of multiprocessor calculation of the relic density, new cosmological models, and the implementations of the calculation of the observables related to direct and indirect detection experiments. Furthermore, the new version includes an implementation of the nuclear and astrophysical uncertainties, from namely nuclear form factors, dark matter density and velocity, as well as cosmic ray propagation through the galactic medium.
