Because of color confinement hypothesis, which states that colored objects are always confined to color singlet states, there are several definitions for charm-quark mass, which one of the most popular definition is charm-quark pole mass $m_c^{\rm pole}$. This Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) analysis attempts to extract charm quark-pole mass from H1-ZEUS combined (H1Z), LHCb and H1Z$+$LHCb charm production cross section data and then investigate its pure impact on proton parton distribution functions (PDFs). To reach this goal we makes several fits based on the very recently updated fixed flavor number scheme from ABM (FF ABM) at the next-to-leading order (NLO). We show that the pure contribution of charm-quark pole mass in the improvement of the fit quality, when it is considered as an extra fit parameter in perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (pQCD) level is $\sim 0$~\%~, $\sim 25$~\% and $\sim 21$~\% corresponding to H1-ZEUS combined, LHCb and H1Z$+$LHCb charm production cross section data, respectively.
