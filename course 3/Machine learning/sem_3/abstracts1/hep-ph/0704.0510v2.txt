We show that axinos, which are dominantly generated by the decay of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles produced from the leptonic $Q$-ball ($L$-ball), become warm dark matter suitable for the solution of the missing satellite problem and the cusp problem. In addition, $\Omega_b - \Omega_{DM}$ coincidence is naturally explained in this scenario.
