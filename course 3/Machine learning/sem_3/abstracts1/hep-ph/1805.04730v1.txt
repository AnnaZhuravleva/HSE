The Inverse Seesaw scenario relates the smallness of the neutrino masses to a small $B-L$ breaking parameter. We investigate a possible dynamical generation of the Inverse Seesaw neutrino mass mechanism from the spontaneous breaking of a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$. To obtain an anomaly free theory we need to introduce additional fermions which exhibit an interesting phenomenology. Additionally, we predict a $Z'$ boson associated to the broken $B-L$ which preferentially interacts with the dark sector formed by the extra fermions making it particularly elusive.
