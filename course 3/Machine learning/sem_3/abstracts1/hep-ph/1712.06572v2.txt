Many new physics models that explain the intriguing anomalies in the $b$-quark flavour sector are severely constrained by $B_s$-mixing, for which the Standard Model prediction and experiment agreed well until recently. The most recent FLAG average of lattice results for the non-perturbative matrix elements points, however, in the direction of a small discrepancy in this observable. Using up-to-date inputs from standard sources such as PDG, FLAG and one of the two leading CKM fitting groups to determine $\Delta M_s^{\rm SM}$, we find a severe reduction of the allowed parameter space of $Z'$ and leptoquark models explaining the $B$-anomalies. Remarkably, in the former case the upper bound on the $Z'$ mass approaches dangerously close to the energy scales already probed by the LHC. We finally identify some model building directions in order to alleviate the tension with $B_s$-mixing.
