In heavy quarkonia, hadronic transitions serve as an enlightened probe for the structure and help to establish the understanding of light quark coupling with a heavy degree of freedom. Moreover, in recent years, hadronic transitions revealed remarkable discoveries to identify the new conventional heavy quarkonia and extracting useful information about the so called "XYZ" exotic states. In this contribution, we present our predictions for heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) breaking hadronic transitions of higher $S$ and $D$ wave vector charmonia based on our recently proposed model (inspired by Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model) to create light meson(s) in heavy quarkonium transitions. We also suggest spectroscopic quantum numbers $(^{2S+1}L_J)$ for several observed charmoniumlike states. Our analysis indicates that the $Y(4360)$ is most likely to be a $3D$ dominant state.
