Quark-hadron phase transition in QCD in the presence of magnetic field is studied. It is shown that both the temperature of a phase transition and latent heat decrease compared to the case of zero magnetic field. The phase diagram in the plane temperature--magnetic field is presented. Critical point, T_\ast=104 MeV, \sqrt{eH_\ast}=600 MeV, for which the latent heat goes to zero, is found.
