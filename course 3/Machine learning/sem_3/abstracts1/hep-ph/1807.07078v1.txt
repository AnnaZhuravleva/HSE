We discuss a simple and elegant $SU(3)\times SO(10)$ family unified gauge theory in 6d compactified on a torus with the orbifold $T_2/Z_2^3$ and supplemented by a $Z_6\times Z_3$ discrete symmetry. The orbifold boundary conditions generate all the desired $SU(3)$ breaking vacuum alignments, including the $(0,1,-1)$ and $(1,3,-1)$ alignments of the Littlest Seesaw model for atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing, as well as the usual $SO(10)$ breaking with doublet-triplet splitting. The absence of driving and messenger fields considerably simplifies the field content of the model. It naturally explains why there are three families of quarks and leptons, and accounts for all their masses, mixing angles and CP phases via rather elegant looking Yukawa and Majorana matrices in the theory basis. The resulting model controls proton decay and allows successful Leptogenesis.
