Inspired by the recent discovery of the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by the LHCb collaboration, we study the magnetic moments of the spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons up to the next-to-leading order in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory with the extend-on-mass-shell renormalization scheme. There are three low energy constants at this order, $a_1$, $a_2$ and $g_a$. The latest lattice QCD simulations allow us to fix a combination of $a_1$ and $a_2$, while the axial-vector coupling $g_a$ can be obtained in three deferent ways, either by fitting to the lattice QCD data, or by the quark model, or by the heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. The magnetic moments of the spin-1/2 doubly charmed baryons $\Xi^d_{cc}$ and $\Xi^s_{cc}$ can then be predicted. We compare our results with those obtained in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and other approaches.
