In this paper, we calculated the branching ratios of the quasi-two-body decays $B \to \eta_c (1S ,2S)$ $[\rho(770), \rho(1450),\rho(1700)\to ] \pi\pi$ by employing the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach. The contributions from the $P$-wave resonances $\rho(770)$, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$ were taken into account. The two-pion distribution amplitude $\Phi_{\pi\pi}^{\rm P}$ is parameterized by the vector current time-like form factor $F_{\pi}$ to study the considered decay modes. We found that (a) the PQCD predictions for the branching ratios of the considered quasi-two-body decays are in the order of $10^{-7} \sim 10^{-6}$, while the two-body decay rates ${\cal B}(B \to \eta_c{(1S,2S)} (\rho(1450),\rho(1700)))$ are extracted from those for the corresponding quasi-two-body decays; (b) the whole pattern of the pion form factor-squared $|F_\pi|^2$ measured by the BABAR Collaboration could be understood based on our theoretical results; (c) the general expectation based on the similarity between $B \to \eta_c \pi\pi$ and $B \to J/\psi \pi\pi$ decays are confirmed: $R_2(\eta_c)\approx 0.45$ is consistent with the measured $R_2(J/\psi)\approx 0.56\pm 0.09$ within errors; and (d) new ratios $R_3(\eta_c(1S))$ and $R_4(\eta_c(2S))$ among the branching ratios of the considered decay modes are defined and could be tested by future experiments.
