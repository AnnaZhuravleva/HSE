Many $P-$wave mixing heavy-light $1^+$ states have not been discovered by experiment, some of them have been discovered but without the information of width, or with large uncertainty widths. In this paper, we study the strong decays of $P-$wave mixing heavy-light $1^+$ states $D^0$, $D^\pm$, $D_s^\pm$, $B^0$, $B^\pm$ and $B_s$ by the improved Bethe-Salpeter(B-S) method in two conditions of mixing angle $\theta$: one is $\theta=35.3^\circ$; another is considering the correction to mixing angle $\theta=35.3^\circ+\theta_1$. And we get some valuable predictions of the strong decay widths: $\Gamma(D_1^{\prime0})=232$ MeV, $\Gamma(D_1^0)=21.5$ MeV,   $\Gamma(D_1^{\prime\pm})=232$ MeV, $\Gamma(D_1^\pm)=21.5$ MeV, $\Gamma(D_{s1}^{\prime\pm})=0.0101$ MeV, $\Gamma(D_{s1}^{\pm})=0.950$ MeV, $\Gamma(B_1^{\prime\pm})=263$ MeV, $\Gamma(B_1^{\pm})=16.8$ MeV, $\Gamma(B_{s1}^{\prime})=0.01987$ MeV and $\Gamma(B_{s1})=0.412$ MeV. We find that the decay widths of $D_{s1}^{\pm}$ and $B_{s1}$ are very sensitive to the mixing angle. And our results will provide the theoretical assistance by the future experiments.
