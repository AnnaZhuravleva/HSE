We investigate the leading twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of vector meson in the framework of large momentum effective theory. We derive the matching equation for the LCDAs and quasi distribution amplitudes. The matching coefficients are determined to one loop accuracy, both in the ultraviolet cut-off and dimensional regularization schemes. This calculation provides the possibility of studying the full $x$ behavior of LCDAs and extracting LCDAs of vector mesons from lattice simulations.
