Recent experimental results provided by the CMS and LHCb, Belle and BaBar collaborations are showing a tension with the SM predictions in $R_{K^{(*)}}$, which might call for an explanation from new physics. In this work, we examine this tension in the type-III two-Higgs doublet models. We focus on the contributions of charged Higgs boson to the observable(s) $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and other rare processes $\Delta M_q$ ($q=s,d$), $B \to X_s \gamma$ $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^{-}$ and $B_q \to X_s \mu^+ \mu^{-}$, which are governed by the same effective Hamiltonian. It is found that regions of large $\tan\beta$ and light charged Higgs mass $m_{H^\pm}$ can explain the measured value of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and accommodate other B physics data as well. In contrast, the type-II two-Higgs doublet model can not.
