We have investigated shear viscosity of quark matter in presence of a strong uniform magnetic field background where Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model has been considered to describe the magneto-thermodynamical properties of the medium. In presence of magnetic field, shear viscosity coefficient gets splitted into different components because of anisotropy in tangential stress of the fluid. Those splitted components normalized by entropy density in fact measure the fluidity of magnetized quark matter. A nearly perfect fluid nature is found even in weakly interacting quark matter at high temperature and high magnetic field zone which is not possible in the case of vanishing magnetic field. Our results indicate that the magnetic field may be regarded as one of the possible sources that can increase the fluidity of quark matter.
