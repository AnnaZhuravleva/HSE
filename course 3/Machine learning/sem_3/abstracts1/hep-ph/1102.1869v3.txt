We present a novel approach for constraining nonstandard neutrino interaction (NSI) coupling parameters ({\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL} and {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}) in low energy flavor conserving {\nu}_{e}e and {\nu}_{e}e-scattering processes. Here we exploit an important phenomenon of interference and assuming that {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL} and {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} are same for both the processes as g_{L} and g_{R} in the standard model (SM). Using this approach we obtain the absolute values {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL}=8.7x10^-3 and {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}=3.8x10^-1, while the bounds obtained using the said processes are -0.11<{\epsilon}_{ee}^{eL}<0.13 and 0.35<{\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR}<0.41. It is noteworthy that the lower bound on {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} exclude the negative region. Furthermore, our bounds on {\epsilon}_{ee}^{eR} are more stringent than the existing ones.
