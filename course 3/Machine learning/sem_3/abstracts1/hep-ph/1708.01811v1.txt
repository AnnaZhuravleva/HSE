We present some general remarks on supersymmetric extensions of fermion-scalar and three-fermion preonic models with an assumption of supersymmetry is realized at preonic level. The motivation and the requirement of this assumption are briefly given. In general, supersymmetric extensions of fermion-scalar (three-fermion) models predict 4 (10) "super" partners for each Standard Model fermion.
