We point out that the study of the density dependences of the masses of heavy-light mesons give some clues to the chiral symmetry structure in nuclear matter. We include the omega meson effect as well as the sigma meson effect at mean field level on the density dependence of the masses of heavy-light mesons with chiral partner structure. It is found that the omega meson affects the masses of the heavy-light mesons and their antiparticles in the opposite way, while it affects the masses of chiral partners in the same way. This is because the omega meson is sensitive to the baryon number of the light degrees included in the heavy-light mesons. We also show that the mass difference between chiral partners is proportional to the mean field of sigma, reflecting the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the nuclear matter. In addition to the general illustration of the density dependence of the heavy-light meson masses, we consider two concrete models for nuclear matter, the parity doublet model and skyrmion crystal model in the sense of mean field approximation.
