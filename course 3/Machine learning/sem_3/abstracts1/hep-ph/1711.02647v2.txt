In the paper we include Bose-Einsten correlations for identical gluons, in the evolution of the double parton densities at low $x$ (high energies). We show that these correlations result in a faster increase of the double densities, in comparison with the product of two single parton densities.   In addition, we find that the typical momentum in the double parton cross section, is of the order of the hard scales in the process, including the saturation momentum. This result is in agreement with recently published experimental data.
