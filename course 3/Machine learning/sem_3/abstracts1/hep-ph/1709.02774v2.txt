In this article, we calculate the magnetization and other thermodynamical quantities for strongly magnetized quark matter within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at zero temperature. We assume two scenarios, chemically equilibrated charge neutral matter present in the interior of compact stars and zero-strangeness isospin-symmetric matter created in nuclear experiments. We show that the magnetization oscillates with density but in a much more smooth form than what was previously shown in the literature. As a consequence, we do not see the unphysical behavior in the pressure in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field that was previously found. Finally, we also analyze the effects of a vector interaction on our results.
