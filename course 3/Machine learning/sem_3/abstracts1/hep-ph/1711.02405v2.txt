In this study, we investigate the potential of the process $pp\rightarrow p\gamma^{*} p\rightarrow p \tau \bar{\nu}_{\tau}q^{\prime} X$ at the LHC to examine the anomalous electromagnetic moments of the tau lepton. We obtain $95\%$ confidence level bounds on the anomalous coupling parameters with various values of the integrated luminosity and center-of-mass energy. The improved bounds have been obtained on the anomalous coupling parameters of electric and magnetic moments of the tau lepton $a_{\tau}$ and $\vert$$d_{\tau}$$\vert$ compared to the current experimental sensitivity bounds. The $\gamma p$ mode of photon reactions at the LHC have shown that it has great potential for the electromagnetic dipole moments studies of the tau lepton.
