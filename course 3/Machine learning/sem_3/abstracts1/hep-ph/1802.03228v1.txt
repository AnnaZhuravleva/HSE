Based on the underlying geometrical structure of the tangent bundle a generalized theory of electroweak interaction is developed without a priory assumption of a phenomenological determined gauge group but with internal (gauge) symmetries arising from transformations of tangent vectors leaving the scalar product invariant and described by the little groups $% SU(2)\otimes E^{c}(2)$ ($E^{c}(2)$ is the central extended Euclidian group).The Laplacian on this group yields the known internal quantum numbers of iso-spin and hypercharge, but in addition the $E^{c}$-charge $\varkappa $ and the family quantum number $n$ which explains the unsolved family problem in the standard model (SM). The connection coefficients (gauge potentials) derived by the covariant derivative on horizontally lifted curves in the TB describe the SM gauge bosons but incorporate additional extra neutral and charged gauge bosons and other hypothetical particles such as a Higgs family. Most remarkable is that besides the SM particles candidate stable and instable Dark Matter (DM) particles such as DM fermions, DM scalars and DM vector bosons arise on a common root with SM particles without additional a priory phenomenological model assumption.
