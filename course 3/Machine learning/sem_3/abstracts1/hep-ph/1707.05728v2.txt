In this work we study the implications of light-quark pionic matter at finite temperatures on the properties of open and hidden charm mesons. The meson-meson interactions are described by means of a chiral unitary approach accounting for coupled channels effects. The in-medium Lippmann-Schwinger Equations, which consider the change in self-energy that the mesons acquire from interacting with the surrounding pionic matter, are solved self-consistently, and the spectral functions of the mesons in the hot pion bath are obtained. It is observed that the charmed mesons develop a quite substantial pion-induced width, being of several tens at a temperature of 150 MeV. The $J/\Psi$ meson stays narrow, but its pionic width at 150 MeV, found to be around 0.1 MeV, is already larger that its vacuum width.
