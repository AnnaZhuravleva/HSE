We complete the set of QCD light-cone sum rules for $B\to \pi\pi$ transition form factors, deriving a new sum rule for the timelike-helicity form factor $F_t$ in terms of dipion distribution amplitudes. This sum rule, in the leading twist-2 approximation, is directly related to the pion vector form factor. Employing a relation between $F_t$ and other $B\to \pi\pi$ form factors we obtain also the longitudinal-helicity form factor $F_0$. In this way, all four (axial-)vector $B\to \pi\pi$ form factors are predicted from light-cone sum rules with dipion distribution amplitudes. These results are valid for small dipion masses with large momentum.
