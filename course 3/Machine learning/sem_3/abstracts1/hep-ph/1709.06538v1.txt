We present QCD Laplace sum-rule predictions of ground state masses of heavy-light open-flavour hybrid mesons. Having computed leading-order diagonal correlation functions, including up to dimension six gluon condensate contributions, we extract hybrid mass predictions for all $J^P \in \{0^\pm, 1^\pm\}$, and explore possible mixing effects with conventional meson states. Similarities are found in the mass hierarchy in both charm and bottom systems with some exceptions that are discussed.
