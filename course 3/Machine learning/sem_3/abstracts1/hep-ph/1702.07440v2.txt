We propose a novel phenomenological model of mean transverse momentum fluctuations based on the Geometrical Scaling hypothesis. Bose-Einstein correlations between two gluons generated from an identical color flux tube are taken into account as a source of the fluctuation. We calculate an event-by-event fluctuation measure $\sqrt{C_m}/\langle p_{\rm T}\rangle$ and show that ALICE data observed at $\sqrt s=$0.90 TeV for $p$+$p$ collisions are reproduced. By fitting our model to the experimental data, we evaluate the transverse size of the color flux tube as a function of the multiplicity.
