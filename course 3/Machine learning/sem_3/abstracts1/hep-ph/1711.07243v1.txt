The Circular Electron-Positron Collider is proposed by the Chinese high energy community to operate at 240 - 250 GeV and produce about one million Higgs bosons. We evaluate the upper bounds on the branching ratios of the charged lepton flavor violating Higgs decays $H\to e^\pm\mu^\mp$, $e^\pm\tau^\mp$ and $\mu^\pm\tau^\mp$ given by expected measurements at the collider, by simulating the signal samples and corresponding major background samples. The results read $\mathcal{B}(H\to e^\pm\mu^\mp) < 1.2\times 10^{-5}$, $\mathcal{B}(H\to e^\pm\tau^\mp) < 1.6\times 10^{-4}$ and $\mathcal{B}(H\to \mu^\pm\tau^\mp) < 1.4\times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% confidence level. We also give the resulting constraints on the Higgs couplings with the corresponding leptons, the new physics cut-off scales in the Standard Model effective field theory, in Randall-Sundrum models and in models with heavy neutrinos.
