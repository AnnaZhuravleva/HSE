We study the phenomenon of the decoherence for neutrinos propagating in long baseline experiments. We show that, the presence of an off-diagonal term in the dissipative matrix induces oscillation formulas for Dirac neutrinos different from the ones for Majorana neutrinos. The decoherence leads also to the violation of the $CPT$ symmetry. We use the values of the experimental parameters in order to relate our theoretical proposal with experiments.
