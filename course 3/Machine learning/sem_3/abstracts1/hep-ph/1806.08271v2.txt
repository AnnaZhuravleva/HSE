The framed standard model (FSM), constructed initially for explaining the existence of three fermion generations and the hierarchical mass and mixing patterns of quarks and leptons, suggests also a "hidden sector" of particles including some dark matter candidates. It predicts in addition a new vector boson $G$, with mass of order TeV, which mixes with the $\gamma$ and $Z$ of the standard model yielding deviations from the standard mixing scheme, all calculable in terms of a single unknown parameter $m_G$. Given that standard mixing has been tested already to great accuracy by experiment, this could lead to contradictions, but it is shown here that for the three crucial and testable cases so far studied (i) $m_Z - m_W$, (ii) $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow \ell^ + \ell^-)$, (iii) $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow$ hadrons), the deviations are all within the present stringent experimental bounds provided $m_G > 1$ TeV, but should soon be detectable if experimental accuracy improves. This comes about because of some subtle cancellations, which might have a deeper reason that is not yet understood. By virtue of mixing, $G$ can be produced at the LHC and appear as a $\ell^+ \ell^-$ anomaly. If found, it will be of interest not only for its own sake but serve also as a window on to the "hidden sector" into which it will mostly decay, with dark matter candidates as most likely products.
