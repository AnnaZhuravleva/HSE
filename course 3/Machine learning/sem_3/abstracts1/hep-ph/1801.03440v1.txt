In this work we study an extension of the commonly used 5F scheme, where $b$ quarks are treated as massless partons, in which full mass effects are retained in both the initial and in the final state. We name this scheme 5F massive scheme (5FMS). We implement this scheme in the \Sherpa Monte Carlo event generator at MEPS@NLO accuracy, and we compare it for two relevant cases for the LHC: $b\bar{b} \rightarrow H$ and $pp\rightarrow Zb$.
