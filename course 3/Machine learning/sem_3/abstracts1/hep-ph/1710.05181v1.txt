We study neutrino spin oscillations in background matter under the influence of strong electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The neutrino spin evolution is treated quasiclassically. We derive the effective Hamiltonian governing spin oscillations of a neutrino moving in the vicinity of a black hole and interacting with a relativistic magnetized accretion disk around a black hole. Applications for the studies of spin oscillations of astrophysical neutrinos are considered.
