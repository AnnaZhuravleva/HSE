Experimental measurement of observables sensitive to underlying event (UE) in $Z$-boson events have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. However, in the busy LHC environment, these observables receive substantial contribution from extra jets. We probe if using event shape observables in conjunction with UE observables can help us to disentangle the effect of UE from extra jets.
