We discuss the minimal seesaw model for the Dirac CP violating phase of the lepton mixing matrix. We introduce two right-handed Majorana neutrinos and obtain several textures of the tri-maximal lepton mixing matrices. Moreover, we discuss the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe through the leptogenesis mechanism. As the result, we obtain the specific model which predicts the negative sign of maximal Dirac CP violating phase and normal hierarchy of neutrino masses.
