In the littlest Higgs model with T-parity, we study associated production of a Higgs and a single top quark at the 14 TeV LHC. We focus on the Higgs to two photons decay and the semileptonic top decay channel. By performing a fast detector simulation, we find that the $thj$ search in the selected channel can excluded the top partner mass $m_{T_{+}}$ up to 805 (857) GeV for case A (case B) at $2\sigma$ confidence level at 14 TeV LHC with the integrated luminosity $L= 3 \rm ab^{-1}$.
