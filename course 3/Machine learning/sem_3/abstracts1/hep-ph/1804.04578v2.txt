The quark and lepton mixing matrices are here both parametrised in terms of the corresponding four independent mass ratios of each fermion sector. This realization is studied under two different approaches: a general discussion on the conditions to achieve it and through the examination of a particular example. In the former approach, the sole dependence on the mass ratios is exploited to investigate the properties that a mixing matrix will possess under such a parametrization. Already at this first stage, the observed fermion mixing can be roughly understood. Thereafter, in the second approach, a particular implementation which was recently proposed is considered. The procedure is revisited and both its weak and strong points are discussed. The purpose of this work is not to present a model but to explore the possibility of reviving an old idea, that of parametrizing the mixing matrices with the fermion masses.
