I suggest a particle model which introduces a dark sector with the local $SU(2)_{D}\otimes U(1)_{D'}$ symmetry besides the SM sector. The new particles of the model inhabit in the dark sector, they bring about many fruitful physics beyond the SM through the dark symmetry breaking. The inflaton decay not only provides the universe inflation and heating, but also leads to the baryon asymmetry and the asymmetric CDM. The model can completely explain the common origin of the tiny neutrino mass, the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the CDM. In addition, it is very feasible to test the model predictions and probe the dark sector physics in near future experiments.
