We propose a search for Higgs decays with as many as eight leptons in the final state. This signal can arise in a simple model with a hidden vector that gets mass via a hidden scalar vacuum expectation value. The 125 GeV Higgs can then decay $H\rightarrow h_d h_d \rightarrow 4A_d\rightarrow 8f$, where $f$ are Standard Model fermions. We recast current searches and show that a branching ratio of $H\rightarrow h_dh_d$ as large as 10% is allowed. We also describe a dedicated search that could place bounds on BR($H\rightarrow h_dh_d$) as low as $10^{-5}$ using only current data, with significant improvements coming from greater integrated luminosity.
