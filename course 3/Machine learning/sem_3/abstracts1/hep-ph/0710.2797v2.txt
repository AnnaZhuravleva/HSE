We construct the holographic dual theory of unparticles. The Randall-Sundrum type hard wall model is shown to produce deconstructing particles, whose spectrum has a finite mass gap proportional to the inverse of the fifth direction segment. The introduction of new scale corresponds to setting a brane in ${\rm AdS}_5$. The broken conformal symmetry due to this brane is restored when it is moved to infinity. Unparticles then emerge as an infinite tower of massless particles.
