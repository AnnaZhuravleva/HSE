We investigate thermalization process in relativistic heavy ion collisions in terms of the Husimi-Wehrl (HW) entropy defined with the Husimi function, a quantum distribution function in a phase space. We calculate the semiclassical time evolution of the HW entropy in Yang-Mills field theory with the phenomenological initial field configuration known as the McLerran-Venugopalan model in a non-expanding geometry, which has instabilty triggered by initial field fluctuations. HW-entropy production implies the thermalization of the system and it reflects the underlying dynamics such as chaoticity and instability. By comparing the production rate with the Kolmogorov-Sina\"i rate, we find that the HW entropy production rate is significantly larger than that expected from chaoticity. We also show that the HW entropy is finally saturated when the system reaches a quasi-stationary state. The saturation time of the HW entropy is comparable with that of pressure isotropization, which is around $1$ fm/c in the present calculation in the non-expanding geometry.
