The implementation of the process $\gamma\gamma \to ZZ$ at the one-loop level within {\tt SANC} system multi-channel approach is considered.   The derived one-loop scalar form factors can be used for any cross channel after an appropriate permutation of their arguments -- Mandelstam variables $s,t,u$.   To check of the correctness of the results we observe the independence of the scalar form factors on the gauge parameters and the validity of Ward identity (external photon transversality). We present the complete analytical results for the covariant and tensor structures and helicity amplitudes for this process. We make an extensive comparison of our analytical and numerical results with those existing in the literature.
