We report the multiplicity dependence of charged particle productions for $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, $\overline{p}$ and $\phi$ meson at $|y| < 1.0$ in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{\rm s}$ = 200 GeV with $\rm PYTHIA$ simulation. The impact of parton multiple interactions and gluon contributions is studied and found to be possible sources of the particle yields splitting as a function of $p_T$ with respect to multiplicity. No obvious particle species dependence for the splitting is observed. The multiplicity dependence on ratios of $K^-/\pi^-$, $K^+/\pi^+$, $\overline{p}/\pi^-$, $p/\pi^+$ and $\Lambda/K^{0}_{s}$ in mid-rapidity in p+p collisions is found following the similar tendency as that in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV from RHIC, which heralds the similar underlying initial production mechanisms despite the differences in the initial colliding systems.
