An NJL-type three-flavor quark model with a complete set of explicit chiral symmetry breaking terms is extended to include vector and axial vector effective interaction terms. The bosonized Lagrangian is written up to quadratic order in the bosonic fields and the role of the new interactions is analysed in detail. The model's parameters are fitted to yield reasonable values to the four low-lying spin 0 and spin 1 meson nonets' masses.
