Search for the bottom squarks (sbottoms) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently assumed a heightened focus in the hunt for Supersymmetry (SUSY). The popular framework of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) could conceive a naturally light sbottom which could easily be consistent with available constraints from the experiments at the LHC. Phenomenology of such sbottoms could in principle be as striking as that for a light top squark (stop) thanks to a rather nontrivial neutralino sector (with appreciable mixing among the neutral higgsinos and the singlino) that the scenario gives rise to. Nonetheless, finding such sbottoms might require a moderately large amount of data ($\sim 300$ $\text{fb}^{-1}$) at the 13 TeV run of the LHC. A multi-channel analysis establishing a generic depletion of events in the usual $2b$-$jets$ +$\text{\sout{E}}_T$ final state while registering, in conjunction, characteristically significant rates in various multi-lepton final states accompanied by $b$-$jets$ might point not only to the presence of light sbottom(s) but could also shed crucial light on their compositions and the (singlino) nature of the lightest SUSY particle (LSP).
