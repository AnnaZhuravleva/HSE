Centrality-dependent double-differential transverse momentum spectra of charged pions and kaons and (anti)protons produced in mid-(pseudo)rapidity interval in 200 GeV gold-gold and deuteron-gold collisions with different centralities at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, as well as in 2.76 TeV lead-lead and 5.02 TeV proton-lead collisions with different centralities at the Large Hadron Collider are analyzed by the blast-wave model with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics in the framework of Hagedorn model. The model results are in approximate agreement with the experimental data in special transverse momentum ranges measured by the PHENIX and ALICE Collaborations. It is showed that the kinetic freeze-out temperature of emission source and the transverse flow velocity of produced particles increase or do not change obviously with the increases of centrality and energy.
