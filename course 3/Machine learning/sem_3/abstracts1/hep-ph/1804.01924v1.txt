We review the gauged $U(1)$ clockwork models as portals for new physics to obtain effectively hierarchical couplings of the Standard Model (SM) particles from genuine couplings of order one. Nearest-neighbor mass mixing between multiple $U(1)$ gauge bosons lead to the localization of the zero mode gauge boson, realizing the milicharged gauge boson in the effective theory. We discuss some of interesting examples utilizing the gauged clockwork beyond the SM.
