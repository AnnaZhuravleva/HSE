We show that polar materials are ideal targets for direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter due to the presence of gapped optical phonons as well as acoustic phonons with high sound speed. We take the example of Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), which has the properties needed for experimental realization, and where many results can be estimated analytically. We find GaAs has excellent reach to dark photon absorption, can completely cover the freeze-in benchmark for scattering via an ultralight dark photon, and is competitive with other proposals to detect sub-MeV dark matter scattering off nuclei.
