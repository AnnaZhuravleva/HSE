In this paper, we investigate the prospects of measuring the strong and weak dipole moments of the top quark at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Measurements of these couplings provide an excellent opportunity to probe new physics interactions as they have quite small magnitudes in the Standard Model. Our analyses are through studying the production cross sections of $t\bar{t}WW$ and $t\bar{t}ZZ$ processes in the same sign dilepton and four-lepton final states, respectively. The sensitivities to strong and weak top quark dipole interactions at the $95\%$ confidence level for various integrated luminosity scenarios are derived and compared with other studies. In addition to using the total cross sections, a novel handle based on an angular observable is introduced which is found to be sensitive to variations of the top quark strong dipole moments. We also investigate the sensitivity of the invariant mass of the system to the strong and weak dipole moments of the top quark.
