Observations of rare processes containing large rapidity gaps at high energy colliders may be exceptionally informative. However the cross sections of these events are small in comparison with that for the inclusive processes since there is a large probability that the gaps may be filled by secondary particles arising from additional soft interactions or from gluon radiation. Here we review the calculations of the probability that the gaps survive population by particles from these effects for a wide range of different processes.
