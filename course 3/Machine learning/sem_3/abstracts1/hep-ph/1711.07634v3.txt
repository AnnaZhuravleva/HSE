In the type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, there exists a $B-L$ symmetry, whose breaking leads to the lepton number violating mass of the heavy Majorana neutrinos. This would imply the existence of a new neutral scalar associated with the $B-L$ symmetry breaking, analogous to the Higgs boson of the Standard Model. If in such models, the heavy neutrino decays are also responsible for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via the leptogenesis mechanism, the new seesaw scalar interactions with the heavy neutrinos will induce additional dilution terms for the heavy neutrino and lepton number densities. We make a detailed study of this dilution effect on the lepton asymmetry in three generic classes of seesaw models with TeV-scale $B-L$ symmetry breaking, namely, in an effective theory framework and in scenarios with global or local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. We find that requiring successful leptogenesis imposes stringent constraints on the mass and couplings of the new scalar in all three cases, especially when it is lighter than the heavy neutrinos. We also discuss the implications of these new constraints and prospects of testing leptogenesis in presence of seesaw scalars at colliders.
