We consider a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking with a partially composite Goldstone Higgs. The model is based on a strongly-interacting fermionic sector coupled to a fundamental scalar sector via Yukawa interactions. The SU(4) x SU(4) global symmetry of these two sectors is broken to a single SU(4) via Yukawa interactions. Electroweak symmetry breaking is dynamically induced by condensation due to the strong interactions in the new fermionic sector which further breaks the global symmetry SU(4) to Sp(4). The Higgs boson arises as a partially composite state which is an exact Goldstone boson in the limit where SM interactions are turned off. Terms breaking the SU(4) global symmetry explicitly generate a mass for the Goldstone Higgs. The model realizes in different limits both (partially) composite Higgs and (bosonic) Technicolor models, thereby providing a convenient unified framework for phenomenological studies of composite dynamics. It is also a dynamical extension of the recent elementary Goldstone-Higgs model.
