The spectroscopic parameters and partial widths of the strong decay channels of the vector meson $ Y(4660)$ are calculated by treating it as a bound state of a diquark and antidiquark. The mass and coupling of the $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ tetraquark $ Y(4660) $ are evaluated in the context of the two-point sum rules method by taking into account the quark, gluon and mixed condensates up to dimension ten. The widths of the $Y(4660)$ resonance's strong $S$-wave decays to $J/\psi f_{0}(980)$ and $\psi(2S) f_{0}(980)$, as well as to $J/\psi f_{0}(500)$ and $\psi(2S) f_{0}(500)$ final states are computed. To this end, strong couplings in the relevant vertices are extracted from QCD sum rules on the light-cone supplemented by the technical methods of the soft approximation. The obtained result for the mass of the resonance $m_Y=4677^{+71}_{-63}\ \mathrm{MeV}$, and prediction for its total width $\Gamma_{Y}= (64.8 \pm 10.8)\ \mathrm{MeV}$ are in nice agreements with the experimental information.
