We propose a left-right symmetric framework with universal seesaw mechanism for the generation of masses of the Standard Model quarks and leptons. Heavy vector-like singlet quarks and leptons are required for generation of Standard Model-like quark and lepton masses through seesaw mechanism. A softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry distinguishes the lepton sector and the quark sector of the model. This leads to the presence of some lepton-specific interactions that can produce unique collider signatures which can be explored at the current Large Hadron Collider run and also future colliders.
