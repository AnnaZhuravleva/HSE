In this letter, we consider an idea that induces flavor structure from inner products in noncommutative geometry. Assuming proper components of vectors $v_{(L,R) i}$ in enlarged representation space for fermions, we can induce the waterfall texture for Yukawa matrices retaining gauge interactions are universal. The hierarchy of the Yukawa interactions is a consequence of "misalignment" between the vectors $v_{Li}$ and $v_{Rj}$.
