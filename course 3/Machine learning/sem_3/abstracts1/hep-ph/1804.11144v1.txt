We compute systematically for the planar double box Feynman integral relevant to top pair production with a closed top loop the Laurent expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$. This is done by transforming the system of differential equations for this integral and all its sub-topologies to a form linear in $\varepsilon$, where the $\varepsilon^0$-part is strictly lower triangular. This system is easily solved order by order in the dimensional regularisation parameter $\varepsilon$. This is an example of an elliptic multi-scale integral involving several elliptic sub-topologies. Our methods are applicable to similar problems.
