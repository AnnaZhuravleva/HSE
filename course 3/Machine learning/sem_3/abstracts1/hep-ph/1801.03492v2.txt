Chiral electroweak anomalies predict fermion interactions that violate baryon ($B$) and lepton number ($L$), and can be dressed with large numbers of Higgs and gauge bosons. The estimation of the total $B+L$ violating rate from an initial two-particle state --potentially observable at colliders-- has been the subject of an intense discussion, mainly centered on the resummation of boson emission, which is believed to contribute to the cross-section with an exponential function of the energy, yet with an exponent (the "holy-grail" function) which is not fully known in the energy range of interest. In this article we focus instead on the effect of fermions beyond the Standard-Model (SM) in the polynomial contributions to the rate. It is shown that $B+L$ processes involving the new fermions have a polynomial contribution that can be several orders of magnitude greater than in the SM, for high centre-of-mass energies and light enough masses. We also present calculations that hint at a simple dependence of the holy grail function on the heavy fermion masses. Thus, if anomalous $B+L$ violating interactions are ever detected at high-energy colliders, they could be associated with new physics.
