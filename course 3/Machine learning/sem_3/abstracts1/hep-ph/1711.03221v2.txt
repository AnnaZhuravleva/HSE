A charged lepton mass formula $(m_e +m_\mu + m_\tau)/(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^2 =2/3$ is well-known. Since we can, in general, have two relations for three quantities, we may also expect another relation for the charged lepton masses. Then, the relation will be expressed by a form of $\sqrt{m_e m_\mu m_\tau}/(\sqrt{m_e}+\sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau})^3$. According to this conjecture, a scalar potential model is speculated.
