We present a study for two-quark light-cone distribution amplitudes for the $1^3D_2$ light tensor meson states with quantum number $J^{PC}=2^{--}$. Because of the G-parity, the chiral-even two-quark light-cone distribution amplitudes of this tensor meson are antisymmetric under the interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark in the SU(3) limit, while the chiral-odd ones are symmetric. The asymptotic leading-twist LCDAs with the strange quark mass correction are shown. We estimate the relevant parameters, the decay constants $f_T$ and $f_T^\perp$, and first Gegenbauer moment $a_1^\perp$, by using the QCD sum rule method. These parameters play a central role in the investigation of $B$ meson decaying into the $2^{--}$ tensor mesons.
