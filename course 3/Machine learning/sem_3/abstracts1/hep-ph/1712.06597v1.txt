We discuss universal signals of consistent models of pseudoscalar mediators for collider searches for Dark Matter. Keeping only the degrees of freedom that can not be decoupled due to consistency conditions, we present a universality class of simplified models with pseudoscalar mediators and renormalizable couplings to Standard Model fields. We compute stability and perturbativity constraints, constraints from electroweak precision measurements, collider searches for new heavy particles as well as constraints from relic density measurements and indirect detection experiments searching for signals of Dark Matter annihilation into photons. We find that the mono-$Z$ final state is the strongest, universal signal of this class of models, with additional signatures present in the different ultraviolet completions that can be used to distinguish between them.
