We consider the double-soft limit of a generic QCD process involving massless partons and integrate analytically the double-soft eikonal functions over the phase-space of soft partons (gluons or quarks) allowing for an arbitrary relative angle between the three-momenta of two hard massless radiators. This result provides one of the missing ingredients for a fully analytic formulation of the nested soft-collinear subtraction scheme recently proposed by some of us.
