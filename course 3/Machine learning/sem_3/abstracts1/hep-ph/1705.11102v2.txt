We analyse the Lorentz structure of the matrix elements of the transitions "neutron <-->proton", induced by the charged hadronic vector current. We show that the term maintaining conservation of the charged hadronic vector current even for different masses of the neutron and proton (see T. Leitner et al., Phys. Rev. C 73, 065502 (2006) and A. M. Ankowski, arXiv:1601.06169 [hep-ph]) has a dynamical origin, related to the G-even first class current contribution. We show that because of invariance of strong low-energy interactions under the G-parity transformations, the G-odd contribution with the Lorentz structure $q_{\mu}$, where $q_{\mu}$ is a momentum transferred, does not appear in the matrix elements of the ``neutron <-> proton' transitions.
