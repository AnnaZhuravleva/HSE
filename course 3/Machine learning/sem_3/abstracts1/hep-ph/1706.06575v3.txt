The LHCb collaboration has recently reported a 2.5 $\sigma$ discrepancy with respect to the predicted value in a test of lepton universality in the ratio $R_{K^*}= \hbox{BR}(B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-) / \hbox{BR}(B \to K^* e^+ e^-)$. Coupled with an earlier observation of a similar anomaly in $R_{K}$, this has generated significant excitement. A number of new physics scenarios have been proposed to explain the anomaly. In this work we consider simplified limits on $Z'$ models from ATLAS and CMS searches for new resonances in dilepton and dijet modes, and we use the simplified limits variable $\zeta$ to correlate the results of the resonance and B-decay experiments. By examining minimal $Z'$ models that can accomodate the observed LHCb results, we show that the high-mass resonance search results are begining to be sensitive to these models and that future results will be more informative.
