Recent measurements have revealed a number of intriguing deviations from the Standard Model predictions in $B$ meson decays, in particular in observables testing lepton flavour universality. We review their experimental status and theoretical description in terms of effective Hamiltonians. We also discuss possible new physics interpretations in terms of simplified models and summarise their status in view of the stringent constraints from flavour physics and high-$p_T$ collider searches.
