An analytical result for Euler-Heisenberg effective action, valid for electron spin $g-$factor $|g|<2$, was extended to the domain $|g|>2$ via discovered periodicity of the effective action. This allows for a simplified computation of vacuum instability modified by the electrons measured $g=2.002319$. We find a strong suppression of vacuum decay into electron positron pairs when magnetic fields are dominant. The result is reminiscent of mass catalysis by magnetic fields.
