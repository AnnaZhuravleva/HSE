In this talk we review the recent progress on the numerical determination of the Hadronic Light-by-Light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and we discuss the role of experimental data on the accuracy of its determination. Special emphasis on the main contribution, the pseudoscalar piece, is made. Gathering recent progress in the light-by-light scattering contribution we consider $a_{\mu}^{{\mathrm{HLBL}}} = (12.1\pm3.0)\times10^{-10}$ as a good summary of the state-of-the-art calculations which still claims for a $4\sigma$ deviation between theory and experiment for the $(g-2)_{\mu}$.
