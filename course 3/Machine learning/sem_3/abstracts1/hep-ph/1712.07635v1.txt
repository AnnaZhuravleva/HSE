We construct a UV completion of the relaxion in a warped extra dimension. We identify the relaxion with the zero mode of the fifth component of a bulk gauge field and show how hierarchically different decay constants for this field can be achieved by different localizations of anomalous terms in the warped space. This framework may also find applications for other axion-like fields. The cutoff of the relaxion model is identified as the scale of the IR brane where the Higgs lives, which can be as high as $10^6$ GeV, while above this scale warping takes over in protecting the Higgs mass.
