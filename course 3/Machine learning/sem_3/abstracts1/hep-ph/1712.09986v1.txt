Following the operator definition of the fragmentation function developed by Collins and Soper, we compute the gluon-to-$h_c$ fragmentation function at the lowest order in the velocity expansion in NRQCD factorization approach. Utilizing some modern technique developed in the area of multi-loop calculation, we are able to analytically deduce the infrared-finite color-singlet short-distance coefficient associated with the fragmentation function. The fragmentation probability for gluon into $h_c$ is estimated to be order $10^{-6}$.
