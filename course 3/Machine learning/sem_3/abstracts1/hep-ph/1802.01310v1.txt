The multiple-solution problem in determining the three-interfering-resonances' parameters from a fit to an experimentally measured distribution is considered in a mathematical viewpoint. In this paper it is shown that there are four numerical solutions for the fit with three coherent Breit-Wigner functions. Although the explicit analytical formulae can not be derived in this case, we provide some constraint equations between the four solutions. For the cases of nonrelativistic and relativistic Breit-Wigner forms of amplitude functions, numerical method is provided to derive the other solutions from the already obtained one based on the obtained constraint equations. In real experimental measurements with more complicated amplitude forms similar to Breit-Wigner functions, the same method can be deduced and performed to get numerical solutions. The well agreement between the solved solutions using this mathematical method and those from the fit directly verifies the correctness of the supplied constraint equations and mathematical methodology.
