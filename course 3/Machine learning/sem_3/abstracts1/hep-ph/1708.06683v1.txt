We report on some recent developments concerning parton-to-photon fragmentation functions. We briefly summarize the main theoretical concepts on which the currently available extractions of these fragmentation functions rely: evolution and the vector meson dominance model. We present comparisons of the available sets. We argue that the single-inclusive photon production process $pp\to\gamma X$ possesses only little sensitivity to the fragmentation contribution. Instead, the semi-inclusive process $pp\to(\text{jet}\,\gamma)X$, for which the photon is observed inside a fully reconstructed jet and is part of the jet, is shown to offer much potential for providing valuable new information.
