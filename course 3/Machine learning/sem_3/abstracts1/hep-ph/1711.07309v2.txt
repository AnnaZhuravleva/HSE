By investigating the very closely lied $D_{s1}\bar{D}_{s}+c.c.$ and $D_{s0}\bar{D}^*_{s}+c.c.$ thresholds at about 4.43 GeV we propose that the $\psi(4415)$ and $\psi(4160)$ can be mixing states between the dynamic generated states of the strong $S$-wave $D_{s1}\bar{D}_{s}+c.c.$ and $D_{s0}\bar{D}^*_{s}+c.c.$ interactions and the quark model states $\psi(4S)$ and $\psi(2D)$. We investigate the $J/\psi K\bar{K}$ final states and invariant mass spectrum of $J/\psi K$ to demonstrate that nontrivial lineshapes can arise from such a mechanism. This process, which goes through triangle loop transitions, is located in the vicinity of the so-called "triangle singularity (TS)" kinematics. As a result, it provides a special mechanism for the production of exotic states $Z_{cs}$, which is the strange partner of $Z_c(3900)$, but with flavor contents of $c\bar{c}q\bar{s}$ (or $c\bar{c}s\bar{q}$) with $q$ denoting $u/d$ quarks. The lineshapes of the $e^+e^-\to J/\psi K\bar{K}$ cross sections and $J/\psi K \ (J/\psi \bar{K})$ spectrum are sensitive to the dynamically generated state, and we demonstrate that a pole structure can be easily distinguished from open threshold CUSP effects if an exotic state is created. A precise measurement of the cross section lineshapes can test such a mixing mechanism and provide navel information for the exotic partners of the $Z_c(3900)$ in the charmonium spectrum.
