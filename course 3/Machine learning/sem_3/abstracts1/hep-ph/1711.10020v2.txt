The non extensive statistics proposed by C. Tsallis has found wide applicability, being present even in the description of experimental data from high energy collisions. A system with a fractal structure in its energy-momentum space, named thermofractal, was shown to be described thermodynamically by the non extensive statistics. Due to the many common features between thermofractals and Hagedorn's fireballs, this system offers the possibility to investigate the origins of non extensivity in hadronic physics and in QCD. In this regard, the investigation of the scaling properties of thermofractals through the renormalization group equation, known as Callan-Symanzik equation, can be an interesting approach.
