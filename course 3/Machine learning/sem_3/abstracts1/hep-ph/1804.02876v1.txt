We propose a minimal model of a fermionic dark matter with a pseudoscalar mediator and N generation of vector-like quarks. We calculate the relic density and obtain new constraint on the generation of the aforementioned quarks. Concerning phenomenological aspects, we probe the presenting model via direct and indirect approaches. Finally, as an illustrative example, we evaluate a resonance case which has been (would be) the subject of major experiments aiming to detect new particles. Performing this analysis results in significant constraints on the coupling strength of the vector-like quarks.
