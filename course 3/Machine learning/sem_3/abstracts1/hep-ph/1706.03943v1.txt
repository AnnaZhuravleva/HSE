The LHCb Collaboration has recently measured the difference of time-integrated $CP$ asymmetry in $D^{0}\rightarrow K^{+}K^{-}$ and $D^{0}\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays, more precisely. The reported value is $ \Delta A_{CP}=-0.10 \pm 0.08 (\text{stat}) \pm 0.03 (\text{syst})\% $ which indicates no evidence for $CP$ violation. We consider the possible unparticle physics contribution in this quantity and by using the LCHb data try to constrain the parameter space of unparticle stuff.
