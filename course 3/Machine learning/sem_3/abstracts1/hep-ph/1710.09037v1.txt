In this proceeding, we present our recent work on decay behaviors of the $P_c$ hadronic molecules, which can help to disentangle the nature of the two $P_c$ pentaquark-like structures. The results turn out that the relative ratio of the decays of $P^+_c(4380)$ to $\bar{D}^* \Lambda_c$ and $J/\psi p$ is very different for $P_c$ being a $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ or $\bar D\Sigma_c^*$ bound state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$. And from the total decay width, we find that $P_c(4380)$ being a $\bar D\Sigma_c^*$ molecule state with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $P_c(4450)$ being a $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ molecule state with $J^P=\frac{5}{2}^+$ is more favorable to the experimental data.
