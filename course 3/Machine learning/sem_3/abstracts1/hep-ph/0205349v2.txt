We study the implications of thermal leptogenesis for neutrino parameters. Assuming that decays of N_1, the lightest of the heavy Majorana neutrinos, initiate baryogenesis, we show that the final baryon asymmetry is determined by only four parameters: the CP asymmetry epsilon_1, the heavy neutrino mass M_1, the effective light neutrino mass \tilde{m}_1, and the quadratic mean \bar{m} of the light neutrino masses. Imposing the CMB measurement of the baryon asymmetry as constraint on the neutrino parameters, we show, in a model independent way, that quasi-degenerate neutrinos are incompatible with thermal leptogenesis. For maximal CP asymmetry epsilon_1, and neutrino masses in the range from (\Delta m^2_{sol})^{1/2} to (\Delta m^2_{atm})^{1/2}, the baryogenesis temperature is T_B = O(10^{10}) GeV.
