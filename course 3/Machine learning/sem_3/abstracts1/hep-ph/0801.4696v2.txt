Chaotic inflation predicts a large gravitational wave signal which can be tested by the upcoming Planck satellite. We discuss a SUGRA implementation of chaotic inflation in the presence of moduli fields, and find that inflation does not work with a generic KKLT moduli stabilisation potential. A viable model can be constructed with a fine-tuned moduli sector, but only for a very specific choice of Kahler potential. Our analysis also shows that inflation models satisfying \partial_{i} W_{\rm inf}=0 for all inflation sector fields \phi_i can be combined successfully with a fine-tuned moduli sector.
