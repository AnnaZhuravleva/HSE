The physics related to the form factors of the energy momentum tensor spans a wide spectrum of problems, and includes gravitational physics, hard exclusive reactions, hadronic decays of heavy quarkonia, and the physics of exotic hadrons described as hadroquarkonia. It also provides access to the "last global unknown property:" the D-term. We review the physics associated with the form factors of the energy-momentum tensor and the D-term, their interpretations in terms of mechanical properties, their applications, and the current experimental status.
