In this paper, we present a model for sub-MeV dark matter with strong self interactions which can solve some of the small scale crisis of the $\Lambda$CDM. The dark matter is a Majorana fermion with only off-diagonal interactions with a hidden $U(1)_D$ gauge boson. The relic density is obtained by freeze-out of Boltzmann suppressed annihilations to a light fermionic species. The self interaction is a one loop process and constrained to be between 0.1 to 1 cm$^2$/g. Severe constraints from the BBN on $N_{eff}$ require that the dark and visible sector are not in thermal equilibrium during freeze-out. The effect of this temperature asymmetry is studied.
