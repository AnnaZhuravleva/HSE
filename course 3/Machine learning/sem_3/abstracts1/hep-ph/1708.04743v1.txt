We study hadronic molecular states in a coupled system of $J/\psi N - \Lambda_c\bar{D}^{(*)} - \Sigma_c^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ in $I(J^P) = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ channel, using the complex scaling method combined with the Gaussian expansion method. We construct the potential including one pion exchange and one $D^{(*)}$ meson exchange with $S$-wave orbital angular momentum. We find that the both mass and width of the pentaquark $P_c(4380)$ can be reproduced within a reasonable parameter region, and that its main decay mode is $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^*$. We extend our analysis to a coupled system of $\Lambda_c D^{(*)} - \Sigma_c^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ in $I(J^P) = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ channel. We find that there exists a doubly charmed baryon of $ccqq\bar{q}$ type as a hadronic molecule, the mass and width of which are quite close to those of $P_c(4380)$.
