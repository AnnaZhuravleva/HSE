While the paradigm of a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) has guided our search strategies for dark matter in the past decades, their null-results have stimulated growing interest in alternative explanations pointing towards non-standard signatures. In this article we discuss the phenomenology of dark matter models that predict long-lived particle at the LHC. We focus on models with a $Z_2$-odd dark sector where - in decreasing order of the dark matter coupling - a coannihilation, conversion-driven freeze-out or superWIMP/freeze-in scenario could be realized.
