The particle phenomenology and various hadron models suggest that radially excited light mesons lie on approximately linear Regge-like trajectories with nearly universal slope. The value of slope is an important quantity in non-perturbative QCD and gives rise to the scale of meson masses in the light quark sector. We put forward a new phenomenological method for calculating the slope of radial trajectories from values of vacuum condensates. The method is based on a large-Nc extension of borelized version of QCD sum rules. We apply our approach to the light non-strange vector, axial, and scalar mesons. The extracted values of slopes proved to be approximately universal and are in the interval $1.4\pm0.1$ GeV$^2$. As a by-product, the given method leads to prediction of the second scalar radial trajectory with ground state mass lying near 0.6 GeV.
