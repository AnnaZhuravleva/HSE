We consider the possibility of a gravitational wave signal in an asymmetric dark matter model. In this model a generative sector produces both the baryon asymmetry and a dark matter asymmetry in a strong first-order phase transtion. Bubble collisions during the phase transition lead to sound waves in the plasma which are a source of a stochastic gravitational wave background. We consider the prospects of future graviational wave observatories such as LISA and BBO detecting such a signal. Constraints on the model from Halo ellipticity, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ and direct detection experiments are also discussed.
