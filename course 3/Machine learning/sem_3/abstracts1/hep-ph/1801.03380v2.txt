While the LHC has not directly observed any new particle so far, experimental results from LHCb, BELLE and BABAR point towards the violation of lepton flavour universality in $b\to s\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ and $b\to c\ell\nu$. In this context, also the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be interpreted as a sign of lepton flavour universality violation. Here we discuss how these hints for new physics can also be explained by introducing leptoquarks as an extension of the Standard Model. Indeed, leptoquarks are good candidates to explain the anomaly in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon because of an $m_{t}/m_{\mu}$ enhanced contribution giving correlated effects in $Z$ boson decays which is particularly interesting in the light of future precision experiments.
