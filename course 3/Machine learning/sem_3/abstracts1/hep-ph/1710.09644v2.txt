Flavour physics represents a unique test bench for the Standard Model (SM). New analyses performed at the LHC experiments are now providing unprecedented insights into CKM metrology and new evidences for rare decays. The CKM picture can provide very precise SM predictions through global analyses. We present here the results of the latest global SM analysis performed by the UTfit collaboration including all the most updated inputs from experiments, lattice QCD and phenomenological calculations. In addition, the Unitarity Triangle (UT) analysis can be used to constrain the parameter space in possible new physics (NP) scenarios. We update here also the UT analysis beyond the SM by the UTfit collaboration. All of the available experimental and theoretical information on $\Delta F=2$ processes is reinterpreted including a model-independent NP parametrisation. We determine the allowed NP contributions in the kaon, $D$, $B_d$, and $B_s$ sectors and, in various NP scenarios, we translate them into bounds for the NP scale as a function of NP couplings.
