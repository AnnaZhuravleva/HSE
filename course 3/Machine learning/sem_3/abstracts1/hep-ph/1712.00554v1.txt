We study neutral and charged meson properties in magnetic field. Taking bosolization method in a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we derive effective meson Lagrangian density with minimal coupling to the magnetic field, by employing derivative expansion for both the meson fields and Schwinger phases. We extract from the effective Lagrangian density the meson curvature, pole and screening masses. As the only Goldstone mode, the neutral pion controls the thermodynamics of the system and propagates the lang range quark interaction. The magnetic field breaks down the space symmetry, and the quark interaction region changes from a sphere in vacuum to a ellipsoid in magnetic field.
