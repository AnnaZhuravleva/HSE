Transverse momentum spectra of negative and positive pions produced at mid-(pseudo)rapidity in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions over a center-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s}$, range from a few GeV to more than 10 TeV are analyzed by the blast-wave model with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics. The model results are approximately in agreement with the experimental data measured by the NA61/SHINE, PHENIX, STAR, ALICE, and CMS Collaborations. It is shown that both the excitation functions of kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_0$) of emission source and transverse flow velocity ($\beta_T$) of produced particles have a hill at $\sqrt{s}\approx10$ GeV, a drop at dozens of GeV, and then an increase from dozes of GeV to more than 10 TeV.
