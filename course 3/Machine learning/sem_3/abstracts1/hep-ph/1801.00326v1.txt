A model with a mirror symmetry whose particles content consist of the ordinary SM particles (plus the right handed neutrinos) and their parity mirror partners, can provide a multicomponent dark matter consist of cold and warm dark matter components. I add to the original mirror model a singlet scalar and its mirror partner, whose quantum numbers are the same as the singlet right handed electron (and its mirror-partner). The new scalar can have a zero VEV, while its mirror partner VEV is non zero. As consequences mirror photon will obtain mass whose order is around the neutral mirror weak boson mass, rendering the mirror electromagnetic-like interaction similar like a mirror weak interaction. There is a mixing among the ordinary neutrinos, mirror neutrinos, the singlet and the doublet mirror electrons. As a result the mirror doublet electrons can have masses in the keV order, becoming the warm dark matter component of this model. The cold dark matter component comes from the mirror nucleons that can have mass larger than the ordinary nucleons. The Big Bang Nucleosynthesys constraint can be avoided by a large entropy production in the ordinary sector due to a slow decay of mirror singlet electrons. The temperature ratio of the two sectors is approximately proportional to the ratio of the VEV's of the ordinary and mirror Higgs, and this also will determine the cold-warm dark matter contribution to the cosmic energy density.
