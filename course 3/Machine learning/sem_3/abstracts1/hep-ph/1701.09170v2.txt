We present a new analysis of $A_N$ in $p^\uparrow p\to \pi\, X$ within the collinear twist-3 factorization formalism. We incorporate recently derived Lorentz invariance relations into our calculation and focus on input from the kinematical twist-3 functions, which are weighted integrals of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) functions. In particular, we use the latest extractions of the Sivers and Collins functions with TMD evolution to compute certain terms in $A_N$. Consequently, we are able to constrain the remaining contributions from the lesser known dynamical twist-3 correlators.
