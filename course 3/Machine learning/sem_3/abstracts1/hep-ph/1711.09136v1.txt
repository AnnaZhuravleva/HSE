We present a formulation of soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) in the two-jet sector as a theory of decoupled sectors of QCD coupled to Wilson lines. The formulation is manifestly boost-invariant, does not require the introduction of ultrasoft modes at the hard matching scale Q, and has manifest power counting in inverse powers of Q. The spurious infrared divergences which arise in SCET when ultrasoft modes are not included in loops disappear when the overlap between the sectors is correctly subtracted, in a manner similar to the familiar zero-bin subtraction of SCET. We illustrate this approach by analyzing deep inelastic scattering in the endpoint region in SCET and comment on other applications.
