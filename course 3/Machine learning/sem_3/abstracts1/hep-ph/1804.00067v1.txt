We analyze a displaced dilepton signal expected at the LHC for a tau left sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle with a mass in the range $45$-$100$ GeV. The sneutrinos are pair produced via a virtual $W$, $Z$ or $\gamma$ in the $s$ channel and, given the large value of the tau Yukawa coupling, their decays into two dileptons or a dilepton plus missing transverse energy from neutrinos can be significant. The discussion is carried out in the $\mu \nu$SSM, where the presence of $R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves the $\mu$ problem and can reproduce the neutrino data. To probe the tau left sneutrinos we compare the predictions of the $\mu \nu$SSM with the ATLAS search for long-lived particles using displaced lepton pairs in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt s= 8$ TeV, allowing us to constrain the parameter space of the model. We also consider an optimization of the trigger requirements used in existing displaced-vertex searches by means of a High Level Trigger that exploits tracker information. This optimization is generically useful for a light metastable particle decaying into soft charged leptons. The constraints on the sneutrino turn out to be more stringent. We finally discuss the prospects for the $13$ TeV LHC searches as well as further potential optimizations.
