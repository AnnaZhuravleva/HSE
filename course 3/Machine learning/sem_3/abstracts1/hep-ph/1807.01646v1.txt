In this paper, we evaluate and analyze hard photons flow emission at $s\bar b\to\gamma g$ quarks system interaction in annihilation processes due to a quantum field theory in high energy physics. Two quantum wave vectors are assumed to localize quark and anti-quark in quantum space for higher thermal energy system. Quantum postulate theory and perturbative theory take into account the photonic flow emission rate that gets produced according to quantum model. The photonic flow rate is evaluated depending on physical parameters: activation coupling strength, electric charge of quark system, fugacity, transition momentum, quantum color number, photonic energies, total charge quark system, Euler factor, critical temperature and temperature of the quarks system. The photonic flow rate for $s\bar b\to\gamma g$ quarks system production in one loop Annihilation processes depends on the activation coupling strength, thermal energy, critical temperature, and fugacity. The rate increases with decreases in activation coupling strength and the critical temperature and with increases in the temperature and vice versa. However, the photonic flow rate increases with the fugacity at one-loop based on Juttner distribution and vice versa.
