The Randall-Sundrum model with a small curvature is considered in which five-dimensional Planck scale lies in the TeV region, and a spectrum of Kaluza-Klein gravitons reminds that in one flat extra dimension. The cross sections for interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos with nucleons are calculated. It is shown that effects related with massive graviton excitations can be detected in deeply penetrating inclined air showers induced by these neutrinos. The expected number of air showers at the Auger Observatory is estimated as a function of two parameters of the model.
