In this work, the molecular states from the \bar{K}^{*}\Sigma interaction are studied in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We consider the exchanges of vector (\rho,\omega and \phi) mesons and pseudoscalar (\pi and \eta) mesons to describe the \bar{K}^{*}\Sigma interaction with the coupling constants determined by the SU(3) symmetry, The poles of the scattering amplitude are searched for to find the molecular states dynamically generated from the \bar{K}^{*}\Sigma interaction. A bound state with quantum number I(J^{p})=1/2(5/2^{+}) is produced, which can be associated to the \Xi(2030) baryon. Other bound states with J\le{}5/2 are also searched for and it is found that there exist bound states with quantum numbers I(J^P)=1/2(1/2^-), 1/2(3/2^{-}), and 1/2(3/2^+). The \Xi(2120) may be a candidate for one of these three bound states. In addition, we also find two bound states with isospin 3/2 and spin parities 1/2^- and 1/2^+.
