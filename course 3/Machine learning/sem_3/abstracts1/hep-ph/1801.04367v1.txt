Using the local hidden gauge approach, we study the possibility of the existence of bottomed strange molecular states with isospin 0. We find three bound states with spin-parity $0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$ generated by the $\bar{K}^*B^*$ and $\omega B_s^*$ interaction, among which the state with spin 2 can be identified as $B_{s2}^*(5840)$. In addition, we also study the $\bar{K}^*B$ and $\omega B_s$ interaction and find a bound state which can be associated to $B_{s1}(5830)$. Besides, the $\bar{K}B^*$ and $\eta B_s^*$ and $\bar{K}B$ and $\eta B_s$ systems are studied, and two bound states are predicted. We expect that further experiments can confirm our predictions.
