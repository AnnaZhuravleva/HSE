Supersymmetric theories supplemented by an underlying flavor-symmetry $\mathcal{G}_f$ provide a rich playground for model building aimed at explaining the flavor structure of the Standard Model. In the case where supersymmetry breaking is mediated by gravity, the soft-breaking Lagrangian typically exhibits large tree-level flavor violating effects, even if it stems from an ultraviolet flavor-conserving origin. Building on previous work, we continue our phenomenological analysis of these models with a particular emphasis on leptonic flavor observables. We consider three representative models which aim to explain the flavor structure of the lepton sector, with symmetry groups $\mathcal{G}_f = \Delta(27)$, $A_4,$ and $S_3$.
