In this paper, we reanalyze the $I=0$ scalar channel with the improved Monte-Carlo based QCD sum rules, which combines the rigorous H\"older-inequality-determined sum rule window and a two Breit-Wigner type resonances parametrization for the phenomenological spectral density that satisfies the the low-energy theorem for the scalar form factor. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD parameters and the experimental masses and widths of the scalar resonances $\sigma$ and $f_0(980)$, we obtain a prediction for light quark mass $m_q(2\,\textrm{GeV})$ = $\frac{1}{2}(m_u(2\,\textrm{GeV})$ + $m_d(2\,\textrm{GeV}))$ = $4.7^{+0.8}_{-0.7}\,\textrm{MeV}$, which is consistent with the PDG (Particle Data Group) value and QCD sum rule determinations in the pseudoscalar channel. This agreement provides a consistent framework connecting QCD sum rules and low-energy hadronic physics. We also obtain the decay constants of $\sigma$ and $f_0(980)$ at 2 GeV, which are approximately $0.64-0.83$ GeV and $0.40-0.48$ GeV respectively.
