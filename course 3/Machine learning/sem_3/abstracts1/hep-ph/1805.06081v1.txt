We show that the effective $B-L$ violating couplings of scalar and vector leptoquarks can naturally induce dimension seven $B-L$ violating operators leading to very interesting nucleon decay modes such as $n \rightarrow e^- \pi^+, e^-K^+,\mu^- \pi^+, \mu^-K^+$ and $p \rightarrow \nu \pi^+$. This opens a new window to probe the nature and couplings of the scalar and vector leptoquarks in an ultraviolet model independent way which can provide an orthogonal probe for scalar and vector leptoquark solutions to the recent anomalous $B$-decay data. Furthermore, these $B-L$ violating interactions pave a new way to understand the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.
