The extension of the standard model by a real gauge singlet scalar is the simplest but the most studied model with sometimes controversial ideas on the ability of the model to address the dark matter and the electroweak phase transition issues separately or simultaneously. For this model, we obtain analytically the condition for strongly first-order electroweak phase transition and apply that in computation of the dark matter relic density where the real scalar plays the role of the dark matter particle. Despite some previous results in the literature, we show that the scalar in this model can be responsible for all or part of the dark matter abundance, while at the same time gives rise to a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition required for the baryogenesis. When the constraint from the recent direct detection experiments such as LUX/XENON1t is considered the model is closely excluded. If the XENON100 bound is considered, the viable dark matter mass is in the range $80-250$ GeV.
