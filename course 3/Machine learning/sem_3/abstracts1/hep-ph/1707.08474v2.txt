Models based on chiral symmetry predict pentaquarks that have relatively low masses. We briefly review both theoretical and experimental status of exotica in the light sector. Next, shall show how to extend chiral models to baryons with one heavy quark and show that one expects exotica also in this case. Finally, we interpret recently discovered by the LHCb collaboration five $\Omega^*_c$ resonances in terms of regular and exotic excitations of the ground state $\Omega_c$.
