We study composite electron production at the FCC-based three electron-proton colliders with the center-of-mass energies of $3.46$, $10$ and $31.6$ TeV. For the signal process of $ep\rightarrow e^{\star}X\rightarrow e\gamma X$ , the production cross-sections and decay widhts of the excited electrons have been calculated. The differences of some kinematical quantities of the final state particles between the signal and background have been analyzed. For this purpose, transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of electron and photon have been obtained and the kinematical cuts for discovery of the excited electrons have been assigned. We have finally determined the mass limits of excited electrons for observation and discovery by applying these cuts. It is shown that the mass limit for discovery obtained from the collider with $\sqrt{s}=31.6$ TeV (called PWFA-LC$\otimes$FCC) is $22.3$ TeV for the integrated luminosity $L_{int}=10$ $fb^{-1}$.
