We consider a generalization of Einstein's general theory of relativity such that it respects local scale invariance. This requires the introduction of a scalar and a vector field in the action. We show that the theory naturally displays both dark energy and dark matter. We solve the resulting equations of motion assuming an FRW metric. The solutions are found to be almost identical to those corresponding to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model
