In this article, we assign the $Z_c^\pm(3900)$ to be the diquark-antidiquark type axialvector tetraquark state, study its magnetic moment with the QCD sum rules in the external weak electromagnetic field by carrying out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension 8. We pay special attention to matching the hadron side with the QCD side of the correlation function to obtain solid duality, the routine can be applied to study other electromagnetic properties of the exotic particles.
