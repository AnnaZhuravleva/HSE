Based on general considerations rather than model-dependent fits to specific scenarios, we argue that an increase with energy of the positron fraction in cosmic rays, suggested by several experiments at E>~7 GeV, most likely requires a primary source of electron-positron pairs. We discuss the possible alternatives, and find none of them plausible on astrophysical or particle physics grounds. Further observational ways to test different scenarios are discussed.
