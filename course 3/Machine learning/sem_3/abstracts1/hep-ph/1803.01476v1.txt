After the experimental establishment of doubly heavy baryons, baryons with three quarks are the last missing pieces of the lowest-lying baryon multiplets in quark model. In this work we study semileptonic and nonleptonic weak decays of triply heavy baryons, $\Omega_{ccc}^{++}, \Omega_{ccb}^{+}, \Omega_{cbb}^{0}, \Omega_{bbb}^{-}$. Decay amplitudes for various channels are parametrized in terms of a few SU(3) irreducible amplitudes. We point out that branching fractions for Cabibbo allowed processes, $\Omega_{ccc}\to (\Xi_{cc}^{++} \overline K^0, \Xi_{cc}^{++}K^-\pi^+, \Omega_{cc}^{+}\pi^+, \Xi_{c}^+ D^+, \Xi_{c}^{\prime} D^+, \Lambda_c D^+\overline K^0, \Xi_{c}^+ D^0 \pi^+, \Xi_{c}^0 D^+\pi^+)$ may reach a few percents. We suggest our experimental colleagues to perform a search at hadron colliders and the electron and positron collisions in future, which will presumably lead to discoveries of triply heavy baryons and complete the baryon multiplets. Using the expanded amplitudes, we derive a number of relations for the partial widths which can be examined in future.
