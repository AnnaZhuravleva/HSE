Particle production mechanisms in proton+proton and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies are discussed. An attempt is made to connect p+p to heavy-ion collisions in understanding the final state observables. New emerging phenomena like Multipartonic Interactions (MPI) and Color Reconnection (CR) mechanism are important in understanding heavy-ion like behaviors in high-multiplicity p+p events. Particle spectra, Multipartonic Interactions, Strangeness enhancement, Nuclear modification factor etc. are few of the aspects, which are discussed in this presentation.
