We investigate the azimuthal correlations of the glasma in p-p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=7$ TeV by using the CGC formalism. As expected, the azimuthal correlations show two peaks at $\Delta\phi=0$ and $\pi$ which represent collimation production in CGC. Beyond that, azimuthal correlations show fine structures, i.e. bumps or shoulders between the two peaks, when at least one gluon has small $x$. The structures are demonstrated to be associated with saturation momentum, and likely appear at transverse momentum around $2Q_{\mathrm{sp}}=1.8$ GeV$/$c.
