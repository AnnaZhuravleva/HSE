We set constraints on millicharged particles (mCPs) based on electron scattering data from MiniBooNE and the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND). Both experiments are found to provide new (and leading) constraints in certain mCP mass windows: 5 - 35 MeV for LSND and 100 - 180 MeV for MiniBooNE. Furthermore, we provide projections for the ongoing SBN program, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and the proposed Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment. Both DUNE and SHiP are capable of probing parameter space for mCP masses ranging from 5 MeV - 5 GeV that is significantly beyond the reach of existing bounds, including those from collider searches and SLAC's mQ experiment.
