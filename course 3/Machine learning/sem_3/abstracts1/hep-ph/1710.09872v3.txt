In this addendum to Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 95}, 054018 (2017) we recompute the rates for the decays of the Higgs boson to a vector quarkonium plus a photon, where the vector quarkonium is $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, or $\Upsilon(3S)$. We correct an error in the Abel-Pad\'e summation formula that was used to carry out the evolution of the quarkonium light-cone distribution amplitude in Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 95}, 054018 (2017). We also correct an error in the scale of quarkonium wave function at the origin in Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 95}, 054018 (2017) and introduce several additional refinements in the calculation.
