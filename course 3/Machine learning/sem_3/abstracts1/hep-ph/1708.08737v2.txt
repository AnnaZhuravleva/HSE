We propose Dirac type active neutrino with rank two mass matrix and a Majorana fermion dark matter candidate with an alternative local $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of neutrinophilic two Higgs doublet model. Our dark matter candidate can be stabilized due to charge assignment under the gauge symmetry without imposing extra discrete $Z_2$ symmetry and the relic density is obtained from $Z'$ boson exchanging process. Taking into account collider constraints on $Z'$ boson mass and coupling, we estimate the relic density.
