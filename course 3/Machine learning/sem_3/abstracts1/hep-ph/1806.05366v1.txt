In this paper, we analyzed the experimentally available radially excited charm mesons to predict the similar spectra for the n=2 bottom mesons. In the heavy quark effective theory, we explore the flavor independent parameters to calculate the masses for the experimentally unknown n=2 bottom mesons B(2S), B(2P), Bs(2S) and Bs(2P). We have also analyzed these bottom masses by applying the QCD and 1/mQ corrections to the lagrangian leading to the modification of flavor symmetry parameters as. Further strong decay widths are determined using these calculated masses to check the sensitivity of these corrections for these radially excited mesons. The calculated decay widths are in the form of strong coupling constant geHH, egSH and egTH. We concluded that these corrections are less sensitive for n=2 masses as compared to n=1 masses. Branching ratios and branching fractions of these states are calculated to have a deeper understanding of these states. These predicted values can be confronted with the future experimental data.
