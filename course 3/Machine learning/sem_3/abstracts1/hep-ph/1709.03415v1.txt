The origin of flow-like effects in small systems, such as those produced in ultra-relativistic proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, is still widely debated. In this paper the goal is to look at possible consequences if indeed a mini-Quark-Gluon Plasma is formed in these collisions. It is argued that this could indicate a duality between the QGP phase and the color fields in hadrons. A qualitative dense field picture is presented for this duality and discussed.
