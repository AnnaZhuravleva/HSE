The exact solution of N- dimensional radial Schr\"odinger equation with the generalized Cornell potential has been obtained using the Laplace transformation (LT) method. The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions for any state have been determined. The eigenvalues for some special cases of the generalized Cornell potential are obtained. The present results are applied to calculate the mass spectra of heavy quarkonium systems such as charmonium and bottomonium and the bc meson. A comparison is discussed with the experimental data and recent works. The present results are improved in comparison with other recent studies and are in a good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of the dimensional number (N) on the meson masses has been studied. We note that the meson masses increase in higher dimensions.
