Existence of heavy mirror analogs of ordinary fermions could explain a thinkable paradox within the Standard Model direct parity violation. This paradox is an objectionable possibility to distinguish physically the left-handed and right-handed coordinate systems. Arguments are presented here that mirror states can also participate in the formation of the observed SM quark and lepton mass spectra and their weak mixing properties. 1. With participation of mirror generations, the quark mixing matrix is similar to the experimentally observed form. The latter is determined by the restrictions imposed by the weak symmetry SU(2) and by the quark mass hierarchy. 2. Under identical conditions and with participation of mirror particles, the lepton mixing (neutrino mixing) can become very different from its quark analog, the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, i.e., it can acquire the qualities prompted by experiment. Such character of mixing evidences in favor of the inverse SM neutrino mass spectrum and the Dirac (non-Majorana) nature of neutrino.
