Assuming that the pion-pion scattering amplitude and its absorptive part are analytic inside an ellipse in $t$- plane with foci $t=0$, $u=0$ and right extremity $t=4 m_{\pi}^2 +\epsilon $, ($\epsilon > 0$), except for cuts prescribed by Mandelstam representation for $t\geq 4 m_{\pi}^2$, $u\geq 4 m_{\pi}^2$ , and bounded by $s^N$ on the boundary of this domain, we prove that for $s\rightarrow \infty$, \sigma_{inel} (s) > \frac{Const}{s^{5/2} }\exp {[-\frac{\sqrt{s}}{4} (N+5/2) \ln {s} ]}.
