We perform a numerical study of the matter-neutrino resonance in a multi-angle calculation in the vicinity of an accretion disk. We assume thermally distributed neutrino and anti-neutrino fields emitted by two-dimensional disk that is homogeneous and isotropic; the electrons are assumed to be at constant density. We compare the the result of this computation to that obtained using single-angle approximation. We investigate the robustness of matter-neutrino resonance in environment surrounding accretion disks by progressively relaxing the single angle approximation. We find that the multi-angle results in the present simplified model do not support a robust resonance mechanism as suggested by the single angle treatment. We also discuss the context under which matter-neutrino resonance may be important in future studies.
