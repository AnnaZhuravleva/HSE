The unexpectedly strong 21cm absorption signal detected by the EDGES experiment suggests that the baryonic gas was colder at redshift $z\sim 17$ than predicted in the standard scenario. We discuss a mechanism to lower the baryon temperature after recombination. We introduce a stable, negatively-charged particle with a non-negligible cosmological abundance, such that the universe remains charge-neutral but the electron and proton numbers are no longer equal. The deficit of electrons during recombination results in an earlier decoupling of the baryon gas temperature from that of the CMB. This implies a smaller ratio of the gas and CMB temperature at $z\sim 17$. The parameter space of the mechanism where the 21 cm absorption signal is significantly enhanced is probed by the CMB spectrum, cooling of stars and supernovae, and colliders. Nevertheless, we find viable regions corresponding to sub-eV or MeV-scale milli-charged particles, or to TeV-scale multi-charged particles.
