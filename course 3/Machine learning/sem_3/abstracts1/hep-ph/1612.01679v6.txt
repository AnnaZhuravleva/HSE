We present calculations of coherent photoproduction of vector mesons ($J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$) with leading-order parton distribution functions to check new kinds of corrections of the DGLAP equations and nuclear modifications. The input gluon distribution of the proton is the dynamical parton model from the DGLAP equations with GLR-MQ-ZRS (Gribov-Levin-Ryskin, Mueller-Qiu, Zhu-Ruan-Shen) modifications. From comparison between several other gluon distribution models, we find that the dynamical gluon distribution fits with the results of meson photoproduction experiments in the high energy region. The calculation of the differential cross sections using dynamical and other gluon distributions is compared with the experimental data from the HERA, ZEUS and LHCb Collaborations. Although there is little data for the rapidity distribution of vector meson photoproduction near zero rapidity, the dynamical gluon distribution works well with the data in the large rapidity region.
