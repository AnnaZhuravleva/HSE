Several methods exist to measure $CP$ violation observables related to the $C\!K\!M$ angle $\gamma$. These observables are different for every $B$ meson decay channel. However, the information they contain on $\gamma$ is encoded in a similar way for all of them. This paper describes a strategy for a simultaneous measurement including several $B$ meson decay channels, while taking into account any possible correlations between them.
