We present the results of an updated fit of short-baseline neutrino oscillation data in the framework of 3+1 active-sterile neutrino mixing. We first consider $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ disappearance in the light of the Gallium and reactor anomalies. We discuss the implications of the recent measurement of the reactor $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum in the NEOS experiment, which shifts the allowed regions of the parameter space towards smaller values of $|U_{e4}|^2$. The beta-decay constraints allow us to limit the oscillation length between about 2 cm and 7 m at $3\sigma$ for neutrinos with an energy of 1 MeV. We then consider the global fit of the data in the light of the LSND anomaly, taking into account the constraints from $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance experiments, including the recent data of the MINOS and IceCube experiments. The combination of the NEOS constraints on $|U_{e4}|^2$ and the MINOS and IceCube constraints on $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ lead to an unacceptable appearance-disappearance tension which becomes tolerable only in a pragmatic fit which neglects the MiniBooNE low-energy anomaly. The minimization of the global $\chi^2$ in the space of the four mixing parameters $\Delta{m}^2_{41}$, $|U_{e4}|^2$, $|U_{\mu4}|^2$, and $|U_{\tau4}|^2$ leads to three allowed regions with narrow $\Delta{m}^{2}_{41}$ widths at $ \Delta m^2_{41} \approx 1.7 $ (best-fit), 1.3 (at $2\sigma$), 2.4 (at $3\sigma$) eV$^2$. The restrictions of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with respect to our previous global fits are mainly due to the NEOS constraints. We present a comparison of the allowed regions of the mixing parameters with the sensitivities of ongoing experiments, which show that it is likely that these experiments will determine in a definitive way if the reactor, Gallium and LSND anomalies are due to active-sterile neutrino oscillations or not.
