We present cross section predictions for the isolated diphoton production in next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD using the computational framework MATRIX. Both the integrated and the differential fiducial cross sections are calculated. We found that the arbitrary setup of the isolation procedure introduces uncertainties comparable to the scale systematic errors. This fact is taken into account in the final result.
