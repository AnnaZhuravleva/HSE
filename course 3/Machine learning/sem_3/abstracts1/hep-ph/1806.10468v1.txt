In this paper we develop the DGLAP evolution for the system of produced gluons in the process of diffractive production in DIS, directly from the evolution equation in Color Glass Condensate approach. We are able to describe the available experimental data with small value of the QCD coupling ($\bar{\alpha_S} \approx 0.1$). We conclude that in diffractive production, we have a dilute system of emitted gluons and in the order to describe them, we need to develop the next-to-leading order approach in perturbative QCD.
