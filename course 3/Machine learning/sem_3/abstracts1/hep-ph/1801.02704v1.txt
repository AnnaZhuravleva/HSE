Models of hadronization of hard jets in QCD are often presented in terms of Feynman-graph struc- tures that can be thought of as effective field theory approximations to dynamical non-perturbative physics in QCD. Such models can be formulated as a kind of multiperipheral model. We obtain gen- eral constraints on such models in order for them to be self-consistent, and we relate the constraints to the space-time structure of hadronization. We show that appropriate models can be considered as implementing string-like hadronization. When the models are put in a multiperipheral form, the effective vertices and/or lines must be momentum non-conserving: they take 4-momentum from the external string-like field.
