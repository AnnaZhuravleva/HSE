We have analysed the observable consequences from the interactions of spin-1 resonances coupled to the invariant fermionic currents that arise in a $SO(5)$ Composite Higgs set-up. The phenomenology entailed by the latter approach is thoroughly analysed via heavy resonances production and their decays modes that are explored along a viable resonance mass range. Additionally, the production of double and single-partner final states has been scanned along the partner mass scale. QCD drives such production, as well as the SM gauge, Higgs, plus the intermediation of charged and neutral resonances. Non-zero modifications are induced as long as extra fermion-resonance effects are accounted for. Finally, the recent LHC searches for vector-like quarks production in $pp$-collisions at 13 TeV have been imposed to exclude regions of the parameter spaces underlying our framework. Specifically, we explore the allowed regions by bounding the decays of a heavy vector-like quark into the $Wb$-channel according with the latest experimental limits. Generically, the impact of the extra fermion-resonance couplings will substantially reduce the permitted regions, leading us to roughly estimate the sensitivity of the parametric dependence in the shed light of exotic matter interactions.
