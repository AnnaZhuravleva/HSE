We use gauge/string duality to model a doubly heavy diquark in a color antitriplet moving in a thermal plasma at temperatures near the critical. With the assumption that there is no relative motion between the constituents, we calculate the drag force on the diquark. At high enough speed we find that diquark string configurations develop a cusp. In addition, we estimate the spatial string tension at non-zero baryon chemical potential, and also briefly discuss an extension to a triply heavy triquark in a color triplet.
