Leptoquarks provide some of the simplest explanations to the hints of lepton flavor non-universality in $B$ decays. In particular, a new confining gauge group can provide a natural and appealing origin for the leptoquarks. So far, direct collider searches have been based on two body decays, namely to a quark and a lepton. We study how composite dynamics can give rise to additional states resulting in modified collider signatures of leptoquarks, as well as new production modes in cascade decays of heavier states. Instead of the standard signature, each leptoquark can result in as many as four jets and a lepton. We reinterpret relevant ATLAS and CMS searches to set limits on this scenario, show how this can relax the current bounds, and propose ways to better constrain this class of models in the future. For example, we show that a leptoquark related to the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly could still be as light as 500 GeV.
