We propose a quasi-degenerate dark matter scenario to simultaneously explain the $1.4\,\textrm{TeV}$ peak in the high-energy cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum reported by the DAMPE collaboration very recently and the $3.5\,\textrm{keV}$ X-ray line observed in galaxies clusters and from the Galactic centre and confirmed by the Chandra and NuSTAR satellites. We consider a dark $SU(2)'\times U(1)'$ gauge symmetry under which the dark matter is a Dirac fermion doublet composed of two $SU(2)'$ doublets with non-trivial $U(1)'$ charges. At one-loop level the two dark fermion components can have a mass split as a result of the dark gauge symmetry breaking. Through the exchange of a mediator scalar doublet the two quasi-degenerate dark fermions can mostly annihilate into the electron-positron pairs at tree level for explaining the $1.4\,\textrm{TeV}$ positron anomaly, meanwhile, the heavy dark fermion can very slowly decay into the light dark fermion with a photon at one-loop level for explaining the $3.5\,\textrm{keV}$ X-ray line. Our dark fermions can be also verified in the direct detection experiments.
