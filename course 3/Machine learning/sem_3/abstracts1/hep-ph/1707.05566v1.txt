Global string networks may be relevant in axion production in the early Universe, as well as other cosmological scenarios. Such networks contain a large hierarchy of scales between the string core scale and the Hubble scale, log(f/H) around 70, which influences the network dynamics by giving the strings large tensions T = pi f^2 log(f/H). We present a new numerical approach to simulate such global string networks, capturing the tension without an exponentially large lattice.
