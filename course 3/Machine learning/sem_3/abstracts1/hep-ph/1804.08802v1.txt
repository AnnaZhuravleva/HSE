The strong decay amplitudes and radiative partial widths of orbital and radially excited states of $B$ and $B_s$ mesons are presented. These results are obtained with a nonrelativistic potential quark model, the nonrelativistic reduction of the electromagnetic transition operator, and the "$^3P_0$" model of strong decays. The predictions are compared to experiment where possible and assignments for the recently discovered states, $B_1(5721)$, $B_2^*(5747)$, $B_J(5840)$, $B_J(5970)$, $B_{s1}(5830)$, and $B_{s2}^*(5840)$, are made.
