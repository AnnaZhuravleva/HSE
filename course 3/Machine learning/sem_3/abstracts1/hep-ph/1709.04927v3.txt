In the large $N_c$ limit both heavy and light baryons are described by the universal mean field, which allows us to relate the properties of heavy baryons to light ones. With the only input from the decays of light octet baryons (due to the universality of the chiral mean field), excellent description of strong decays of both charm and bottom sextets is obtained. The parameter-free prediction for the widths of exotic anti-decapentaplet ($\overline{\boldsymbol{15}}$) baryons is also made. The exotic heavy baryons should be anomalously narrow despite of large phase space available. In particular, the widths of $\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\Omega_c(3119)$, interpreted as members of $\overline{\boldsymbol{15}}$-plet, are very small: 0.48~MeV and 1.12~MeV respectivly. This result is in very good agreement with the measurements of the LHCb Collaboration and provides natural and parameter free explanation of the LHCb observation that $\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\Omega_c(3119)$ have anomalously small widths among five recently observed states.
