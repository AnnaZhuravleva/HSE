We build a model containing two scalar doublets and a scalar singlet with a specific discrete symmetry. After spontaneous symmetry breaking, the model has Standard Model-like phenomenology, as well as a hidden scalar sector which provides a viable dark matter candidate. We show that CP violation in the scalar sector occurs exclusively in the hidden sector, and consider possible experimental signatures of this CP violation.
