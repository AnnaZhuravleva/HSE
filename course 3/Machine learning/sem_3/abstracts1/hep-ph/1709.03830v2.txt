If supersymmetry is broken at TeV scale, particles from sector responsible for supersymmetry breaking - goldstino and sgoldstinos - can reveal themselves already at the LHC experiments. We discuss bounds on supersymmetry breaking scale from the LHC searches for events with a jet plus missing momentum signature focusing on the case of TeV scale sgoldstinos. We show that contribution of light sgoldstinos to the cross section of of gravitino pair production with a jet can be sizable and the bounds on the gravitino mass can be stronger by up to a factor of 2 as compared to those obtained in the heavy sgoldstino limit. We compare these bounds on parameters of the model to those obtained with the results of ATLAS and CMS searches for dijet resonances.
