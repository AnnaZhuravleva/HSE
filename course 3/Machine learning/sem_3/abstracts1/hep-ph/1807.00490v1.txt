The freeze-out of massless particles is investigated. The effects due to quantum statistics, Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein, of all particles relevant for the process are analyzed. Solutions of appropriate Boltzmann equation are compared with those obtained using some popular approximate methods. As an application of general results the relic density of dark radiation in Weinberg's Higgs portal model is discussed.
