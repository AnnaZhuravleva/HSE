The speed of sound $C_{s}$ in the SU(3) and (2+1)QCD is calculated within the Field Correlator Method using the nonperturbative colour magnetic confinement and Polyakov loop interaction in the deconfined region.The resulting $C_{s}$ displays a discontinuity at $T=T_{c}$ in the SU(3) case. It is shown numerically and analytically that $ C^{2}_{s}$ never exceeds $\frac{1}{3}$ both for SU(3) and (2+1) QCD for vanishing chemical potential.A good agreement is found of our numerical results with the corresponding lattice data.
