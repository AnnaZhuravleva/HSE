We show that the static properties of a nucleus could arise from a single quark moving in a mean field generated by all other constituents of this nucleus. The resulting model provides a way for determining the nuclear sizes characteristic of the liquid drop model, and reasonably accurate values of magnetic moments of different nuclei with the aid of two parameters $\alpha_s$ and $\sigma$ appearing in the Cornell potential intended for use in quarkonium physics.
