Using the latest global determination of neutrino oscillation parameters from~\cite{deSalas:2017kay} we examine the status of the simplest revamped version of the BMV (Babu-Ma-Valle) model, proposed in~\cite{Morisi:2013qna}. The model predicts a striking correlation between the "poorly determined" atmospheric angle $\theta_{23}$ and CP phase $\delta_{CP}$, leading to either maximal CP violation or none, depending on the preferred $\theta_{23}$ octants. We determine the allowed BMV parameter regions and compare with the general three-neutrino oscillation scenario. We show that in the BMV model the higher octant is possible only at $99\%$ C.L., a stronger rejection than found in the general case. By performing quantitative simulations of forthcoming DUNE and T2HK experiments, using only the four "well-measured" oscillation parameters and the indication for normal mass ordering, we also map out the potential of these experiments to corner the model. The resulting global sensitivities are given in a robust form, that holds irrespective of the true values of the oscillation parameters.
