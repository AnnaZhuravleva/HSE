The novel massive spinor-helicity formalism of Arkani-Hamed, Huang and Huang provides an elegant way to calculate scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics for arbitrary quark spin projections. In this note we compute two families of tree-level QCD amplitudes with one massive quark pair and n-2 gluons. The two cases include all gluons with identical helicity and one opposite-helicity gluon being color-adjacent to one of the quarks. Our results naturally incorporate the previously known amplitudes for both quark spins quantized along one of the gluonic momenta. In the all-multiplicity formulae presented here the spin quantization axes can be tuned at will, which includes the case of the definite-helicity quark states.
