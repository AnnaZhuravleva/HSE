We study the Wigner distributions for a physical electron, which reveal the multidimensional images of the electron. The physical electron is considered as a composite system of a bare electron and photon. The Wigner distributions for unpolarized, longitudinally polarized and transversely polarized electron are presented in transverse momentum plane as well as in impact parameter plane. The spin-spin correlations between the bare electron and the physical electron are discussed. We also evaluate all the leading twist generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) for electron.
