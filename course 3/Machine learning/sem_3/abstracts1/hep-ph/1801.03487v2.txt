The constant-roll inflation is studied where the inflaton is taken as a tachyon field. Since in this approach the second slow-roll parameter is assumed to be of order one instead of being small, then the perturbation parameters will be considered again. The results are compared with observational data, and it is confirmed that the model could stand as a proper candidate for inflation.
