The standard model (SM)-like Higgs boson $h$ has spin zero and light mass around weak scale, so it has the potential to mediate a new and relatively strong force for the particle $\phi$ in the new physics (NP) sector; then $\phi$ may form bound state $B_h$ via exchanging $h$. This phenomena may arise in a wide context, for instance composite Higgs, supersymmetry (SUSY) and radiative neutrino (or more widely in the models with a strong Higgs portal for triggering classical scale symmetry breaking or strong first-order phase transition). For illustration we focus on two typical examples, the stop/sbottom sector and an inert Higgs doublet. Furthermore, we point out that $B_h$ must give rise to a clear resonant di-Higgs signature, which recently has been extensively searched for at the large hadron collider (LHC). Moreover, Higgs radiative decay such as to di-photon probably will be significantly modified provided that $\phi$ is charged or/and colored.
