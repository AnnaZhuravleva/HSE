We introduce a novel jet substructure method which exploits the variation of observables with respect to a sampling of phase-space boundaries quantified by the variability. We apply this technique to identify boosted W boson and top quark jets using telescoping subjets which utilizes information coming from subjet topology and that coming from subjet substructure. We find excellent performance of the variability, in particular its robustness against finite detector resolution. The extension to telescoping jet grooming and other telescoping jet substructure observables is also straightforward. This method provides a new direction in heavy particle tagging and suggests a systematic approach to the decomposition of jet substructure.
