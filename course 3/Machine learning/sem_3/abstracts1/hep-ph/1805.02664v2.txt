The oldest and most robust technique to search for new particles is to look for `bumps' in invariant mass spectra over smoothly falling backgrounds. This is a powerful technique, but only uses one-dimensional information. One can restrict the phase space to enhance a potential signal, but such tagging techniques require a signal hypothesis and training a classifier in simulation and applying it on data. We present a new method for using all of the available information (with machine learning) without using any prior knowledge about potential signals. Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such model independent approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel that would not be covered with existing techniques.
