The $DD^{*}$ potentials are studied within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory. We have obtained the effective potentials of the $DD^{*}$ system up to $O(\epsilon^2)$ at one loop level. In addition to the one-pion exchange contribution, the contact and two-pion exchange interactions are also investigated in detail. Furthermore, we have searched for the possible molecular states by solving Schr\"odinger equation with the potentials. We notice that the contact and two-pion exchange potentials are non-negligible numerically and important for the existence of a bound state. In our results, no bound state is found in the $I=1$ channel but there is a molecular state with the binding energy around 21.5 MeV in the $I=0$ channel.
