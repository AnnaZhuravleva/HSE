The linear dilaton geometry in five dimensions, rediscovered recently in the continuum limit of the clockwork model, may offer a solution to the hierarchy problem which is qualitatively different from other extra-dimensional scenarios and leads to distinctive signatures at the LHC. We discuss the structure of the theory, in particular aspects of naturalness and UV completion, and then explore its phenomenology, suggesting novel strategies for experimental searches. In particular, we propose to analyze the diphoton and dilepton invariant mass spectra in Fourier space in order to identify an approximately periodic structure of resonant peaks. Among other signals, we highlight displaced decays from resonantly-produced long-lived states and high-multiplicity final states from cascade decays of excited gravitons.
