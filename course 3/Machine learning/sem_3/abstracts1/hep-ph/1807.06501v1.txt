We study the sensitivity of the NO$\nu$A near detector to MeV-GeV dark matter while operating symbiotically with the neutrino program. We find that NO$\nu$A could explore a large new region of parameter space over the next few years for dark matter masses below 100 MeV, reaching the thermal target for a scalar dark matter particle for some masses. This result represents a significant improvement over existing probes such as Babar, E137, and LSND.
