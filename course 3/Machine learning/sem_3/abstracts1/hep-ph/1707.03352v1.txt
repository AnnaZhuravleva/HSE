It has recently been shown that the phenomenologically successful pattern of cobimaximal neutrino mixing ($\theta_{13} \neq 0$, $\theta_{23} = \pi/4$, and $\delta_{CP} = \pm \pi/2$) may be achieved in the context of the non-Abelian discrete symmetry $A_4$. In this paper, the same goal is achieved with $S_3 \times Z_2$. The residual lepton $Z_3$ triality in the case of $A_4$ is replaced here by $Z_2 \times Z_2$. The associated phenomenology of the scalar sector is discussed.
