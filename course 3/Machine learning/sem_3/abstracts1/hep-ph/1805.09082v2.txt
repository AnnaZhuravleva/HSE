Recent simulation studies indicate that right-handed neutrinos may be discovered at future high luminosity LHC runs as long as a new neutral gauge boson, $Z^{\prime}$, have been discovered first. In this case, when $Z^{\prime}$ is resonantly produced at the LHC it, subsequently, decays into pair of right-handed neutrinos with mass up to TeV scale. Then the decay of these neutrinos leave as signature tri-lepton final states and/or same-sign di-muon and a boost di-boson. The prospect of discovering right-handed neutrinos through this mechanism has been developed within abelian gauge extension of the standard model. In this work we study the processes involved in this discovery mechanism within the framework of the 3-3-1 model.
