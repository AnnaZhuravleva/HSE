We consider the collider phenomenology of a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM), which consists of an EW isospin $3/2$ scalar, $\Delta$ and a pair of EW isospin $1$ vector like fermions, $\Sigma$ and $\bar{\Sigma}$, responsible for generating tiny neutrino mass via the effective dimension seven operator. This scalar quadruplet with hypercharge Y = 3 has a plethora of implications at the collider experiments. Its signatures at TeV scale colliders are expected to be seen, if the quadruplet masses are not too far above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. In this article, we study the phenomenology of multi-charged quadruplet scalars. In particular, we study the multi-lepton signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment, arising from the production and decays of triply and doubly charged scalars. We studied Drell-Yan (DY) pair production as well as pair production of the charged scalars via photon-photon fusion. For doubly and triply charged scalars, photon fusion contributes significantly for large scalar masses. We also studied LHC constraints on the masses of doubly charged scalars in this model. We derive a lower mass limit of 725 GeV on doubly charged quadruplet scalar.
