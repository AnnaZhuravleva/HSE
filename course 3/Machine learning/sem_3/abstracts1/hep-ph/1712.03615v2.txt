We use the method of light-cone sum rules to study the electromagnetic transition of the $\Xi^{*++}_{cc}$ into $\Xi^{++}_{cc}\gamma$, whose decay width is estimated to be $13.7~{^{+17.7}_{-~7.9}}$ keV. This value is large enough for the $\Xi^{*++}_{cc}$ to be observed in the $\Xi^{++}_{cc}\gamma$ channel, and we propose to continually search for it in future LHCb and BelleII experiments.
