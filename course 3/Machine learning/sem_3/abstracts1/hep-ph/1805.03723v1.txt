If dark matter (DM) contains equal numbers of u,d,s quarks, the ratio of DM and ordinary matter densities is shown to follow from the Boltzmann distribution in the Quark Gluon Plasma. For sexaquark DM in the 1860-1880 MeV mass range (assuring sexaquark and nuclear stability) and quark masses and transition temperature from lattice QCD, the observed Omega_{DM}/Omega_b = 5.3 is in the predicted range, with <~ 15% uncertainty. The prediction is insensitive to the current form of DM, which could be sexaquarks, strange quark matter nuggets, primordial black holes from their collapse, or a mixture of these.
