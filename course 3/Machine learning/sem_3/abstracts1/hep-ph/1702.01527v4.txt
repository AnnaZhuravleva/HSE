We investigate the lower bounds of sfermion masses from the constraints of chromoelectric dipole moments (CEDMs) in the natural SUSY-type sfermion mass spectrum, in which stop mass $m_{\tilde t}$ is much smaller than the other sfermion masses $m_0$. The natural SUSY-type sfermion mass spectrum has been studied since the supersymmetric (SUSY) flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNC) are suppressed because of large sfermion masses of the first two generations, and the weak scale is stabilized because of the light stop. However, this type of sfermion mass spectrum is severely constrained by CEDM, because the light stop contributions to the up quark CEDM are not decoupled in the limit $m_0\rightarrow\infty$, while the down quark CEDM is decoupled in the limit. It is important that the constraints are severe even if SUSY-breaking parameters (and Higgsino mass) are taken to be real because complex diagonalizing matrices of Yukawa matrices, which are from complex Yukawa couplings, generate nonvanishing CP phases in off-diagonal elements of sfermion mass matrices. We calculate the CEDM of up and down quarks numerically in the minimal SUSY standard model, and give the lower bounds for stop mass and the other sfermion masses. We show that the lower bound of stop mass becomes 7 TeV to satisfy the CEDM constraints from Hg EDM. The result is not acceptable if the weak scale stability is considered seriously. We show that if the up-type Yukawa couplings are taken to be real at the grand unification scale, the CEDM constraints are satisfied even if $m_{\tilde t}\sim 1$ TeV.
