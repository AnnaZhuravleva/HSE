We present estimates from the covariant spectator quark model for the electromagnetic transition form factors for the resonances $N(1440)\frac{1}{2}^+$, $N(1535)\frac{1}{2}^-$, $N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $\Delta(1232)\frac{3}{2}^+$, at intermediate and large square momentum transfer ($Q^2$). The calculations associated to the $N(1440)\frac{1}{2}^+$, $N(1535)\frac{1}{2}^-$ and $N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^-$ states are based exclusively on the parametrizations derived for the nucleon. In the case of the $\Delta(1232)\frac{3}{2}^+$ (isospin 3/2), we use lattice QCD data to estimate the radial structure, and take into account the well known effects associated with the pion cloud dressing of the baryons. Our estimates are based mainly on the valence quark degrees of freedom and are in good agreement with the data for $Q^2 > 2$ GeV$^2$, with a few exceptions. The present predictions can be tested in a near future for large $Q^2$ at the Jefferson Lab -- 12 GeV upgrade.
