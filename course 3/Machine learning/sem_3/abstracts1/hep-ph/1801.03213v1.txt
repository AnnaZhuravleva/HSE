The chiral order-parameter $\sigma$ field and its higher-order cumulants of fluctuations are calculated within the functional renormalization group approach. The influence of the glue dynamics on the fluctuations of $\sigma$ field is investigated, and we find that the $\sigma$-field fluctuations are weakly affected by the glue dynamics. This is in sharp contrast to the baryon number fluctuations, which are sensitive to the glue dynamics and involve information of the color confinement. Implications of our calculated results on theoretical and experimental efforts to search for the QCD critical ending point are discussed.
