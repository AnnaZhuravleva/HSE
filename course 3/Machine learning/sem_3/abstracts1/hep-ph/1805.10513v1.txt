The Higgs boson pair production at a linear $e^+e^-$ collider is analyzed in the $4\tau$ final state at lepton-specific or type IV 2HDM. The Higgs boson pairs (HA) are produced through off-shell $Z^*$ production and decay to $\tau$-jets which is the main decay channel for neutral Higgs bosons in type IV. Using a detector simulation based on SiD detector at ILC, the 4$\tau$ signal is studied through the $\tau$-jet pair invariant mass reconstruction. Several benchmark scenarios are considered for center of mass energies of 500 GeV and 1000 GeV at integrated luminosity of 500$fb^{-1}$. Among Standard Model (SM) background processes, the main background is $e^+e^- \to ZZ$ followed by $Z \to \tau\tau$. This background is however, well under control. Results indicate that signals of $H/A \to \tau\tau$ are well observable at 500 and 1000 GeV collisions at the mentioned integrated luminosity.
