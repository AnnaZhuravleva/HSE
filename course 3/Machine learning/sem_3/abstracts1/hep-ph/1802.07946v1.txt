We present a new version of $\texttt{SecDec}$, a program for the numerical computation of parametric integrals in the context of dimensional regularization. By its modular structure, the $\texttt{python}$ rewrite $\texttt{pySecDec}$ is much more customizable than earlier versions of $\texttt{SecDec}$. The numerical integration is accelerated using code optimization available in $\texttt{FORM}$. With the new $\texttt{C++}$ interface, $\texttt{pySecDec}$ can provide numerical solutions of analytically unknown integrals in user-defined code.
