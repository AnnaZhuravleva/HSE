The standard model of particle physics is extended by adding a purely neutrinophilic dark sector. It is shown that theories which accommodate standard model neutrinos as dark radiation are resurrected. Sterile neutrinos bridge the visible and the dark sector and can keep their mutual interactions effective even after the epoch of big bang nucleosythesis. This prolonged contact between dark matter and standard model neutrinos solves the well-known small-scale structure problems of the cosmological standard model. The dark sector presented in this work satisfies all experimental and observational constraints from particle physics and cosmology.
