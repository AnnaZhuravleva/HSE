We study the phenomenology of the ground-state (pseudo-)scalar charmonia $\eta_c$ and $\chi_{c0}$ in the framework of a $U(4)_r \times U(4)_l$ symmetric linear sigma model with (pseudo-)scalar and (axial-) vector mesons. Based on previous results for the spectrum of charmonia and the spectrum and (OZI-dominant) strong decays of open charmed mesons, we extend the study of this model to OZI-suppressed charmonia decays. This includes decays into 'ordinary' mesons but also particularly interesting channels with scalar-isoscalar resonances $f_0(1370),\, f_0(1500),\, f_0(1710)$ that may include sizeable contributions from a scalar glueball. We study the variation of the corresponding decay widths assuming different mixings between glueball and quark-antiquark states. We also compute the decay width of the pseudoscalar $\eta_c$ into a pseudoscalar glueball. In general, our results for decay widths are in reasonable agreement with experimental data where available. Order of magnitude predictions for as yet unmeasured states and channels are potentially interesting for BESIII, Belle II, LHCb as well as the future PANDA experiment at the FAIR facility.
