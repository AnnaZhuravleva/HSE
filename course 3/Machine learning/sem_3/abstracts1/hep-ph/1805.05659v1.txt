This work summarizes the current status of the measured semileptonic branching fractions $B^{0,+} \to X_c \mu\nu$. The sum of exclusive measurements is compared with the inclusive determination, accounting for isospin extrapolation. Further derived quantities are computed, taking into account different explanations for the unmeasured components of the total branching fraction. These quantities focus on the charge breakdown of the final states, and are designed for use as inputs or comparisons in future experimental measurements.
