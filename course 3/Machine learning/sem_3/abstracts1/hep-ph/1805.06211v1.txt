While Jarlskog-like flavor invariants are adequate for estimating CP-violation from closed fermion loops, non-invariant structures arise from rainbow-like processes. For the CKM contributions to the quark electric dipole moments (EDMs), or the PMNS contributions to lepton EDMs, the dominant diagrams have a rainbow topology whose flavor structure does not collapse to flavor invariants. Numerically, they are found typically much larger, and not necessarily correlated with, Jarlskog-like invariants. The flavor structures in the quark and lepton sectors are systematically studied, assuming different mechanisms for generating neutrino masses. In addition, the combined study of both Jarlskog-like and rainbow-like flavor structures shed new lights on the possible correlations between quark and lepton EDMs.
