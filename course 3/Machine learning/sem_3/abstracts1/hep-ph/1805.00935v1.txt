The European School of High-Energy Physics is intended to give young physicists an introduction to the theoretical aspects of recent advances in elementary particle physics. These proceedings contain lecture notes on the theory of the Weak interaction and Higgs physics, flavour physics and CP violation, neutrinos, theories beyond the Standard Model, physics at the LHC Run-2 and beyond, practical statistics for high-energy physicists, and cosmology and dark matter.
