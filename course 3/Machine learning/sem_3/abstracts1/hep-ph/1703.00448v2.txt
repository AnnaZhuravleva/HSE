We investigate the ability of the upcoming Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) neutrino experiment to detect new physics phenomena beyond the standard, three-massive-neutrinos paradigm; namely the existence of a fourth, sterile neutrino or weaker-than-weak, non-standard neutrino interactions. With both beam-based neutrinos from the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) and atmospheric neutrinos, Hyper-K is capable of exploring new ranges of parameter space in these new-physics scenarios. We find that Hyper-K has comparable capability to the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), and that combining both beam- and atmospheric-based data can clear up degeneracies in the parameter spaces of interest. We also comment on the potential improvement in searches for new physics if a combined analysis were performed using Hyper-K and DUNE data.
