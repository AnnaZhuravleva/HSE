The behavior of charged and neutral pion masses in the presence of a static uniform magnetic field is studied in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Analytical calculations are carried out employing the Ritus eigenfunction method. Numerical results are obtained for definite model parameters, comparing the predictions of the model with present lattice QCD (LQCD) results.
