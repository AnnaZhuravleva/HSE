The process of jet-gap-jet (JGJ) production is briefly described. The JGJ scattering amplitude parametrisation is discussed. On the basis of full amplitude calculations, the parametrisation formulas for the leading logarithmic (LL) and next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximations are obtained. For each case a sum over all conformal spins is considered. The obtained agreement is better than 0.25% for LL and 1% for NLL.
