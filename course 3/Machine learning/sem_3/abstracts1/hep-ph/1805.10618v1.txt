A new type of gamma ray spectrum is predicted in a general hadronic framework if considering the gluon condensation effects in proton. The result presents the power-law with a sharp break in the gamma ray spectra at the TeV-band. We suggest to probe this GC-signature in the Earth limb gamma-ray spectra using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer and the CALorimetric Electron Telescope on orbit.
