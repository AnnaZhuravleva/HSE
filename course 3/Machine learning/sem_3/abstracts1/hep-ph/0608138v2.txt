The smallness of the neutrino masses may be related to inflation. The minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with small Dirac neutrino masses already has all the necessary ingredients for a successful inflation. In this model the inflaton is a gauge-invariant combination of the right-handed sneutrino, the slepton, and the Higgs field, which generate a flat direction suitable for inflation if the Yukawa coupling is small enough. In a class of models, the observed microwave background anisotropy and the tilted power spectrum are related to the neutrino masses.
