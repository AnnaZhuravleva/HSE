The measured charged particle multiplicity distribution in the forward rapidity region of the p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 TeV, 7 TeV and 8 TeV at the LHC have been described using the Weibull distribution function. The higher order (up to $5^{th}$ order ) normalized moments and the factorial moments are also calculated using the extracted parameters. The multiplicity distributions in forward region are observed to be well described by the Weibull regularity and the higher order moment calculations confirm the violation of KNO scaling that has been observed at mid-rapidity and lower energies. The Weibull parameters and moments for p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are also estimated for the forward region.
