We use the chiral quark-soliton model to interpret five excited $\Omega_c$ states recently reported by the LHCb collaboration and confirmed by Belle. We briefly recapitulate the model and its application to light baryons. We then show how the model can be extended to the case of baryons with one heavy quark. We test the model against ground state heavy baryons and then examine possible excitations. We argue that it is not possible to accommodate all five $\Omega_c$'s within five parity minus excitations predicetd by the model and propose to interpret two narrowest states split by 70 MeV as pentaquarks belonging to the SU(3) representation $\overline{15}$.
