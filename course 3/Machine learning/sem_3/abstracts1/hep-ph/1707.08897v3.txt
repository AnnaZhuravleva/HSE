A minimal fermion-scalar preonic model containing two fermionic and one scalar preons is proposed. This scheme allows to prevent the occurrence of undesired SM-level particles, namely leptons and quarks with unusual electric charges. Similar to the previous FS models, color-octet leptons and color-sextet quarks, which are expected to have masses much lower than the compositeness scale, are predicted. Observation of these particles could provide first indications of preonic models. FCC (SppC) pp option will give opportunity to probe $m_{q_{6}}$ up to 48 (75) TeV and $m_{l_{8}}$ up to 15 (27) TeV within one year operation at nominal luminosity. FCC/SppC based ep and $\mu$p colliders will essentially enlarge covered mass region, namely, $m_{e_{8}}$ up to 23/27 TeV and $m_{\mu_{8}}$ up to 68/80 TeV.
