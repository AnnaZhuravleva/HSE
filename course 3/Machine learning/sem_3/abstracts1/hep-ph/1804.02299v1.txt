We suggest to isolate the loop-induced gluon-initiated component ($gg\to ZH$) for associated $ZH$ production by using the similarity of the Drell-Yan-like component for $ZH$ production to the $WH$ process. We argue that the cross-section ratio of the latter two processes can be predicted with high theoretical accuracy. Comparing it to the experimental $ZH/WH$ cross-section ratio should allow to probe for New Physics in the $gg\to ZH$ component at the HL-LHC. We consider typical BSM scenarios in order to exemplify the effect they would have on the proposed observable.
