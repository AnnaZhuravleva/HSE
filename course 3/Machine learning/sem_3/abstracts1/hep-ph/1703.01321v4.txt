The product of the gluon dressing function and the square of the ghost dressing function in the Landau gauge can be regarded to represent, apart from the inverse power corrections 1/Q^{2n}, a nonperturbative generalization A(Q^2) of the perturbative QCD running coupling a(Q^2)=alpha_s(Q^2)/pi. Recent large volume lattice calculations for these dressing functions indicate that the coupling defined in such a way goes to zero as A(Q^2)~Q^2 when the squared momenta Q^2 go to zero (Q^2<<1 GeV^2). In this work we construct such a QCD coupling A(Q^2) which fulfills also various other physically motivated conditions. At high momenta it becomes the underlying perturbative coupling a(Q^2) to a very high precision. And at intermediate low squared momenta Q^2~1 GeV^2 it gives results consistent with the data of the semihadronic tau lepton decays as measured by OPAL and ALEPH. The coupling is constructed in a dispersive way, resulting as a byproduct in the holomorphic behavior of A(Q^2) in the complex Q^2-plane which reflects the holomorphic behavior of the spacelike QCD observables. Application of the Borel sum rules to tau-decay V+A spectral functions allows us to obtain values for the gluon (dimension-4) condensate and the dimension-6 condensate, which reproduce the measured OPAL and ALEPH data to a significantly better precision than the perturbative MSbar coupling approach.
