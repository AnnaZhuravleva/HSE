The hierarchy problem and the identity of dark matter are two of the central driving forces in particle physics. Twin Higgs models provide an elegant solution to the little hierarchy problem, while Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs) provide an appealing dark matter candidate. Here we show that SIMPs can easily be embedded in the Twin Higgs setup, such that dark matter and the hierarchy problem can be addressed in a single framework. This also provides a natural explanation to the proximity between the confinement scale of SIMP dark matter and the strong scale of QCD.
