We introduce the Hyperbolic Higgs, a novel solution to the little hierarchy problem that features Standard Model neutral scalar top partners. At one-loop order, the protection from ultraviolet sensitivity is due to an accidental non-compact symmetry of the Higgs potential that emerges in the infrared. Once the general features of the effective description are detailed, a completion that relies on a five dimensional supersymmetric framework is provided. Novel phenomenology is compared and contrasted with the Twin Higgs scenario.
