We investigate the transverse charge densities of the deuteron in a soft-wall AdS/QCD model by considering both the unpolarized and the transversely polarized cases. The deuteron form factors are derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD model and it is shown that the calculated results agree with the phenomenological parametrization and experimental data. The transverse charge densities of the deuteron are also derived from the soft-wall AdS/QCD model, and we notice slight deviations from those of the phenomenological parametrization.
