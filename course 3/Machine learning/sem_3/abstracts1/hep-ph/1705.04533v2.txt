We study proton-lead collisions with a new model for the Fock states of the incoming proton. The number of collisions which the proton experiences selects the appropriate Fock state of the proton which generates a multiple of pp-like rapidity distributions. We take as input the pp maximum entropy distributions shifting the respective cm-rapidities and reducing the available energies. A comparison with existing data at 5 TeV is made and results for 8 TeV are presented. We also explore the high multiplicity data in this model.
