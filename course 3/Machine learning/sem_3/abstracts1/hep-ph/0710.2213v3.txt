We investigate gravitino dark matter scenarios in which the primordial ^6Li production is catalyzed by bound-state formation of long-lived negatively charged particles X^- with ^4He. In the constrained minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) with the stau^- as the X^-, the observationally inferred bound on the primordial ^6Li abundance allows us to derive a rigid lower limit on the gaugino mass parameter for a standard cosmological history. This limit can have severe implications for supersymmetry searches at the Large Hadron Collider and for the reheating temperature after inflation.
