We discuss the current minimisation strategies adopted by research projects involving the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) through the training of neural networks. We present a short overview of a proton PDF determination obtained using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) optimisation algorithm. We perform comparisons between the CMA-ES and the standard nodal genetic algorithm (NGA) adopted by the NNPDF collaboration.
