In the framework of Perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach we study the direct $CP$ asymmetry for the decay channel $\bar{B}_{s}\rightarrow P\pi^+\pi^-$ around the resonance range via the $\rho-\omega$ mixing mechanism (where P refer to pseudoscalar meson). We find that the $CP$ asymmetry can be enhanced by $\rho-\omega$ mixing when the masses of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs are at the area of $\rho-\omega$ resonance, and the maximum $CP$ asymmetry can reach 59{\%} for the relevant decay channels.
