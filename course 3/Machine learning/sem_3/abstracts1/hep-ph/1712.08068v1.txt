The perturbative effective potential calculated in Landau gauge suffers from infrared problems due to Goldstone boson loops. These divergences are spurious and can be removed by a resummation procedure that amounts to a shift of the mass of soft Goldstones. We prove this to all loops using an effective theory approach, providing a compact recipe for the shift of the Goldstone mass that relies on the use of the method of regions to split soft and hard Goldstone contributions.
