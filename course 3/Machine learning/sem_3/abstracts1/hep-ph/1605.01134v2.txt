In the framework of the color-magnetic interaction, we systematically investigate the mass spectrum of the tetraquark states composed of four heavy quarks with the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ configuration in this work. We also show their strong decay patterns. Stable or narrow states in the $bb\bar{b}\bar{c}$ and $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ systems are found to be possible. We hope the studies shall be helpful to the experimental search for heavy-full exotic tetraquark states.
