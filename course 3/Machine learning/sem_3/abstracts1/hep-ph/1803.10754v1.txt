In the present paper, we have studied that the implication of a large value of the effective Majorana neutrino mass in case of neutrino mass matrices having either two equal elements and one zero element (popularly known as hybrid texture) or two equal cofactors and one zero minor (popularly known as inverse hybrid texture) in the flavor basis. In each of these cases, four out of sixty phenomenologically possible patterns predict near maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing angle in the limit of large effective Majorana neutrino mass. This feature remains irrespective of the experimental data on solar and reactor mixing angles. In addition, we have also performed the comparative study of all the viable cases of hybrid and inverse hybrid textures at 3$\sigma$ CL.
