We calculate the electromagnetic multipole moments of the $P_c^+(4380)$ pentaquark by modeling it as the diquark-diquark-antiquark and $\bar D^*\Sigma_c$ molecular state with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. In particular, the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments of this particle are extracted in the framework of light-cone QCD sum rule. The values of the electromagnetic multipole moments obtained via two pictures differ substantially from each other, which can be used to pin down the underlying structure of $P_c^+(4380)$. The comparison of any future experimental data on the electromagnetic multipole moments of the $P_c^+(4380)$ pentaquark with the results of the present work can shed light on the nature and inner quark organization of this state.
