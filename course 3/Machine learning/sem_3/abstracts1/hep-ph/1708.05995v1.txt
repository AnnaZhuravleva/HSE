A Fermi liquid model for hadrons has been suggested for the hadrons in medium. The hadrons are supposed to behave like quasi particle as Fermi excitation while in the medium and the effective mass of the hadrons have been estimated using Fermi liquid model. Considering a momentum dependent potential inside the medium to describe the interaction, the effective masses of the hadrons are estimated. The temperature dependence of effective masses has also been studied. The possibility of describing masses of the quarks as Fermi excitation has been investigated. Compressibility, specific heats, density of states in medium has been studied. The potential depth for light and singly heavy baryons in medium has been extracted. The results are found to be very interesting and compared with the other studies available in literature.
