Spin precession of channelled particles in bent crystals at the LHC gives unique possibility for measurements as electric and magnetic moments of charm, beauty and strange charged baryons so and constants determining CP ($T_{odd}, P_{odd}$) violation interactions and $P_{odd}, T_{even}$ interactions of baryons with electrons and nucleus (nucleons). For a particle moving in a bent crystal a new effect caused by nonelastic processes arises: in addition to the spin precession around the direction of the effective magnetic field (bend axis), the direction of electric field and the direction of the particle momentum, the spin rotation to the mentioned directions also appears.
