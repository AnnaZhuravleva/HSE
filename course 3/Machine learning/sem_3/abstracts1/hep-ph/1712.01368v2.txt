We present a three-site Pati-Salam gauge model able to explain the Standard Model flavor hierarchies while, at the same time, accommodating the recent experimental hints of lepton-flavor non-universality in $B$ decays. The model is consistent with low- and high-energy bounds, and predicts a rich spectrum of new states at TeV scale that could be probed in the near future by the high-$p_T$ experiments at the LHC.
