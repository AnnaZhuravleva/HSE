Selecting the newly observed $\Xi_b(6227)^-$ by LHCb as a study example, we decode its inner structure by giving the mass spectrum analysis and the investigation of its two-body strong decay behaviors. Our result indicates that the $\Xi_b(6227)^-$ is a good candidate of $P$-wave $\Xi_b^{\prime}$ state with $J^P=3/2^-$ or $5/2^-$. In addition, we further provide the information of the properties of the partners of the $\Xi_b(6227)^-$. These predicted states include three $2S$ states and the remaining $1P$ states in bottom-strange baryon family. The calculated sizable OZI-allowed decay widths of these partners show that experimental search for them becomes possible via LHCb. We have a reason to believe that the present study can be treated as a start point for constructing the highly excited bottom baryon spectroscopy.
