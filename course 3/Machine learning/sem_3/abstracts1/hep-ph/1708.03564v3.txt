We consider the gauged $U(1)$ clockwork theory with a product of multiple gauge groups and discuss the continuum limit of the theory to a massless gauged $U(1)$ with linear dilaton background in five dimensions. The localization of the lightest state of gauge fields on a site in the theory space naturally leads to exponentially small effective couplings of external matter fields localized away from the site. We discuss the implications of our general discussion with some examples, such as mediators of dark matter interactions, flavor-changing $B$-meson decays as well as D-term SUSY breaking.
