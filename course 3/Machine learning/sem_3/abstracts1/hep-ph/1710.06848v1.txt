The one-loop renormalization of the action for a set Dirac fermions and a set of scalars spanning an arbitrary manifold coupled via Yukawa-like and gauge interactions is presented. The computation is performed with functional methods and in a geometric formalism that preserves at all stages the symmetries of the action. The result is then applied to Higgs effective field theory to obtain the renormalization group evolution. In the Standard Model limit of this EFT the RGE equations collapse into a smaller linearly independent set; this allows to probe the dynamics of the scalar discovered at LHC via de-correlations in the running of couplings.
