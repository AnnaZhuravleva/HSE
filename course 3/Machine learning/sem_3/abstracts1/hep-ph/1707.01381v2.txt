We discuss the main signatures of the Bilepton Model at the Large Hadron Collider, focusing on its gauge boson sector. The model is characterised by five additional gauge bosons, four charged and one neutral, beyond those of the Standard Model, plus three exotic quarks. The latter turn into ordinary quarks with the emission of bilepton doublets $(Y^{++},Y^{+})$ and $(Y^{--},Y^{-})$ of lepton number $L=-2$ and $L=+2$ respectively, with the doubly-charged bileptons decaying into same-sign lepton pairs. We perform a phenomenological analysis investigating processes with two doubly-charged bileptons and two jets at the LHC and find that, setting suitable cuts on pseudorapidities and transverse momenta of final-states jets and leptons, the model yields a visible signal and the main Standard Model backgrounds can be suppressed. Compared to previous studies, our investigation is based on a full Monte Carlo implementation of the model and accounts for parton showers, hadronization and an actual jet-clustering algorithm for both signal and Standard Model background, thus providing an optimal framework for an actual experimental search.
