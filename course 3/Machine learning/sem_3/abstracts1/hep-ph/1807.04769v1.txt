We compare the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on jet images with dense neural networks (DNNs) trained on $n$-subjettiness variables to study the distinguishing power of these two separate techniques applied to boosted hadronic $Z$ boson and top quark decays. We find that they perform almost identically once jet mass information is included in a consistent manner, which suggests they are accessing the same underlying information which can be intuitively understood as being contained in 4-, 5-, and 6-body kinematic phase spaces depending on the sample. This suggests both of these methods are highly useful for heavy object tagging and provides a tentative answer to the question of what the image network is actually learning.
