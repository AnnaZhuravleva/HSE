New hidden particles could potentially be emitted and discovered in rare nuclear transitions. In this work we investigate the production of hidden vector bosons with primarily axial couplings to light quarks in nuclear transitions, and we apply our results to the recent anomaly seen in $^8$Be decays. The relevant matrix elements for $^8{\rm Be}^*(1^+) \rightarrow ^8{\rm Be} (0^+)$ transitions are calculated using ${\it ab \, initio}$ methods with inter-nucleon forces derived from chiral effective field theory and the in-medium similarity renormalization group. We find that the emission of a light axial vector with mass $m_X \simeq 17\, {\rm MeV}$ can account for the anomaly seen in the $1^+\to 0^+$ isoscalar transition together with the absence of a significant anomaly in the corresponding isovector transition. We also show that such an axial vector can be derived from an anomaly-free ultraviolet-complete theory that is consistent with current experimental data.
