The single charmed excited $\Xi_c(2930)$ state was discovered many years ago by BABAR collaboration and recently confirmed by Belle experiment. However, both of these experiments, unfortunately, could not fix the quantum numbers of this particle and its nature is under debates. In the present study, we calculate its mass and width of its dominant decay to $ \Lambda_c K $. To this end we consider $\Xi_c(2930)$ state once as angularly excited and then radially excited single charmed baryon in $ \Xi_c$ channel. Comparison of the obtained results with the experimental data suggests assignment of $\Xi_c(2930)$ state as the angular excitation of the ground state $\Xi_c$ baryon with quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$.
