We show that the discrete anomaly constraints governing popular non-Abelian symmetries of use in (e.g.) flavoured, supersymmetric, and dark matter model building typically subdivide into two classes differentiated by the simple restrictions they impose on the number of fields transforming under certain irreducible representations of the relevant groups. These constraints lead us both to generic conclusions for common Beyond-the-Standard-Model constructions (including rather powerful statements for Grand Unified theories) as well as to simplified formulae that can be rapidly applied to determine whether a given field and symmetry content suffers from gauge and gravitational anomalies.
