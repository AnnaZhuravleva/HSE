We build a viable and predictive extension of the SM with a heavy vector in the fundamental $SU\left( 2\right) _{L}$ representation and nine SM singlet scalar fields, consistent with the current pattern of SM fermion masses and mixings. The masses of the light active neutrinos are generated from radiative seesaw mechanism at one loop level mediated by the neutral components of the heavy vector as well as by the left handed Majorana neutrinos. We carry out an analysis of the predictions in the lepton sector, where the model is only viable for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy.
