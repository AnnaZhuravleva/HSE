We investigate the interplay between the (light-light quark) chiral condensate and heavy-light quark condensate induced by the QCD Kondo effect, which is described by an effective Lagrangian with four-point interactions and the mean-field approximation. We find that the appearance of Kondo condensates decreases the critical chemical potential of the chiral condensate. In the region near the critical chemical potential, a coexistence phase with two kinds of condensates can appear. The behavior of such an interplay at finite temperature and with nonzero current light-quark mass is also discussed.
