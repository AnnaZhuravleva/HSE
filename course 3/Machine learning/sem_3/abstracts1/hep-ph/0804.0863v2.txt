We address the cosmological moduli/gravitino problems and the issue of too little thermal but excessive non-thermal dark matter from the decays of moduli. The main examples we study are the G2-MSSM models arising from M theory compactifications, which allow for a precise calculation of moduli decay rates and widths. We find that the late decaying moduli satisfy both BBN constraints and avoid the gravitino problem. The non-thermal production of wino LSPs, which is a prediction of G2-MSSM models, gives a relic density of about the right order of magnitude.
