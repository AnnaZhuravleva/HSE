I present a model addressing coherently the naturalness problem of the electroweak scale and the observed pattern of deviations from the Standard Model in semi-leptonic decays of $B$ mesons. The Higgs and the two scalar leptoquarks responsible for the $B$-physics anomalies, $S_1 = ({\bf \bar 3}, {\bf 1}, 1/3)$ and $S_3 = ({\bf \bar 3}, {\bf 3}, 1/3)$, arise as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons of a new strongly coupled sector at the multi-TeV scale. I focus on an explicit realization of such a dynamics in terms of a new strongly coupled gauge interaction and extra vectorlike fermions charged under it. The model presents a very rich phenomenology, ranging from flavour observables, Higgs and electroweak precision measurements, and direct searches of new states at the LHC.
