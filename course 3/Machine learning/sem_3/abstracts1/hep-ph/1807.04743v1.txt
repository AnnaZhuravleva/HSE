We study vector boson fusion production of new scalar singlets at high energy lepton colliders. We find that CLIC has the potential to test single production cross-sections of a few tens of attobarns in di-Higgs and di-boson final states. In models with a sizeable Higgs mixing, these values correspond to a precision in Higgs couplings of order 0.1% or better. We compare our sensitivities with those of the LHC and interpret our results in well-motivated models like the Twin Higgs, the NMSSM and axion-like particles. Looking forward to even higher energy machines, we show that the reach of muon colliders like LEMMA overcomes the one of future hadron machines like FCC-hh. We finally study the pair production of the new scalar singlets via an off-shell Higgs. This process does not vanish for small mixings and will constitute a crucial probe of models generating a first order electro-weak phase transition.
