The LHC is making strides in the exploration of the properties of the newly discoverd Higgs boson, $h$. In Refs.~\cite{vonBuddenbrock:2015ema,Kumar:2016vut,vonBuddenbrock:2016rmr} the compatibility of the proton-proton data reported in the Run I period with the presence of a heavy scalar, $H$, with a mass around 270\,GeV and its implications were explored. This boson would decay predominantly to $H\rightarrow Sh$, where $S$, is a lighter scalar boson. The production cross-section of $pp\rightarrow H(\rightarrow Sh) + X$ is considerable and it would significantly affect the inclusive rate of $h$. The contamination from this new production mechanism would depend strongly on the final state used to measure the rate of $h$. The contamination in the rate measurement of $Vh(\rightarrow b\overline{b}), V=Z,W$ is estimated to be small. This statement does not depend strongly on assumptions made on the decay of $S$.
