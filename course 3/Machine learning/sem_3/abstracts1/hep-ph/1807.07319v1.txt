Single top quark production cross sections at hadron colliders are traditionally used to extract the modulus of the $V_{tb}$ element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix under the following assumption: $|V_{tb}| \gg |V_{td}|, |V_{ts}|$. We show that direct limits on $|V_{td}|$ and $|V_{ts}|$ can be extracted from differential measurements of single top quark cross sections in $t$-channel as a function of the rapidity of the light jet recoiling against the top quark, its angular distance from the reconstructed top quark, and the rapidity of the $b$ quark from top quark decay. We perform a global fit of top quark related CKM elements to experimental data from the LHC Runs 1 and 2 and Tevatron. Experimental data include inclusive and differential single top cross sections in $t$-channel, inclusive tW production cross section, and top quark branching ratio to b quark and W boson. We present bounds on $|V_{tb}|$, $|V_{ts}|$ and $|V_{td}|$ using current data and project the results for future LHC data sets corresponding to luminosities of 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$.
