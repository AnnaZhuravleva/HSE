In this paper we study the cosmological CPT-violation and its implications in baryo/leptogenesis and CMB polarization. We propose specifically a variant of the models of gravitational leptogenesis. By performing a global analysis with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we find the current CMB polarization observations from the three-year WMAP (WMAP3) and the 2003 flight of BOOMERANG (B03) data provide a weak evidence for our model. However to verify and especially exclude this type of mechanism for baryo/leptogenesis with cosmological CPT-violation, the future measurements on CMB polarization from PLANCK and CMBpol are necessary.
