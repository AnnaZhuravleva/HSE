We study the production of charmed baryons in the antiproton-proton and antiproton-nucleus interactions within a fully covariant model that is based on an effective Lagrangian approach. The baryon production proceeds via the $t$-channel $D^0$ and $D^{*0}$ meson-exchange diagrams. We have also explored the production of the charm-baryon hypernucleus $^{16}_{\Lambda_c^+}$O in the antiproton - $^{16}$O collisions. For antiproton beam momenta of interest to the ${\bar P}ANDA$ experiment, the 0$^\circ$ differential cross sections for the formation of $^{16}_{\Lambda_c^+}$O hypernuclear states with simple particle-hole configurations, have magnitudes in the range of a few $\mu$b/sr.
