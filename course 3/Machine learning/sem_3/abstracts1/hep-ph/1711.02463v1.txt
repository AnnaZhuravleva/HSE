The complementarity of direct, indirect and collider searches for dark matter has improved our understanding concerning the properties of the dark matter particle. In this short review, we present a step toward the fundamental nature of dark matter with direct detection experiments only, go through some of the potential dark matter signals in gamma-rays, x-rays, and anti-matter, and lastly discuss the prospects of WIMPs in the next decade.
