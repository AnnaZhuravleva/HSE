A study of cross sections and azimuthal correlation moments for the inclusive production of two, light charged hadrons featuring large transverse momenta and well separated in rapidity at LHC energies, including BFKL resummation effects with NLA accuracy, is presented. This reaction shares the same theoretical setup with the well konwn Mueller-Navelet jet production and can be thought of as a new and complementary channel to access the BFKL dynamics at proton colliders.
