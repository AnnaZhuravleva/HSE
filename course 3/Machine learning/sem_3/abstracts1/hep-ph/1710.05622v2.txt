We briefly report on some particular aspects of new physics searches concerning, on the one side, the CKM paradigm and, on the other, the global fit to rare $b\to s \ell\ell$ observables including lepton flavour universality ones. We put special emphasis on the state-of-the-art of hadronic uncertainties of $b\to s\mu\mu$ observables and LFUV in SM and in presence of New Physics. Finally, we discuss the latest experimental and theoretical developments concerning long-distance charm contributions.
