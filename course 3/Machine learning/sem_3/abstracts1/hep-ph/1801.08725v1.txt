Stimulated by the renewed observation of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ signal and its updated mass value $(2318.3\pm1.2\pm1.2)~\mbox{MeV}/c^{2}$ in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow D_{s}^{*+}D_{s0}^{*}(2317)^{-}+c.c.$ by BESIII Collaboration, we devote to reinvestigate $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ as a $0^{+}$ tetraquark state from QCD sum rules. Technically, four different possible currents are adopted and high condensates up to dimension $12$ are included in the operator product expansion (OPE) to ensure the quality of QCD sum rule analysis. In the end, we obtain the mass value $2.37^{+0.50}_{-0.36}~\mbox{GeV}$ for the scalar-scalar current, which agrees well with the experimental data of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ and could support its explanation as a $0^{+}$ scalar-scalar tetraquark state. The final result for the axial-axial configuration is calculated to be $2.51^{+0.61}_{-0.43}~\mbox{GeV}$, which is still consistent with the mass of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ considering the uncertainty, and then the possibility of $D_{s0}^{*}(2317)$ as a axial-axial tetraquark state can not be excluded. For the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar and the vector-vector cases, their unsatisfactory OPE convergence makes that it is of difficulty to find rational work windows to further acquire hadronic masses.
