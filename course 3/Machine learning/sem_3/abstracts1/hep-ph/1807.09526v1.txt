We apply the convection stability criterion to a fluid in global thermodynamic equilibrium with a rigid rotation or with a constant acceleration along the streamlines. Different equations of state describing strongly interacting matter are considered and for each of them the analysed system is found to be stable with respect to convection. This finding brings new evidence for physical relevance of non-static global equilibrium states. Our results can be directly used for other similar media to check their convective stability.
