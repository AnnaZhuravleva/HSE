Our community has to apply {\em non}-perturbative QCD on different levels of flavor dynamics in strange, charm \& beauty hadrons and even for top quarks. We need {\em consistent} parameterization of the CKM matrix and describe weak decays of beauty hadrons with {\em many-body} final states. It is crucial to use the {\em Wilsonian} OPE as much as possible and discuss "duality" in the worlds of quarks and hadrons. The pole mass of heavy quarks is {\em not} well-defined on the {\em non}-perturbative level -- i.e., it is {\em not} Borel summable in total QCD. We need a novel team to combine the strengths of our tools from MEP and HEP.
