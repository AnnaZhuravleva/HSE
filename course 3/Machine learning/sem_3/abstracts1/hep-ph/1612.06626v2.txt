A precise measurement of the Higgs $h \to Z \gamma$ decay is very challenging at the LHC, due to the very low %SM $h \to Z \gamma\, (Z \to \ell \ell)$ branching fraction and the shortage of kinematic handles to suppress the large SM $Z \gamma$ background. We show how such a measurement would be significantly improved by considering Higgs production in association with a hard jet. We compare the prospective HL-LHC sensitivity in this channel with other Higgs production modes where $h$ is fairly boosted, e.g.~weak boson fusion, and also to the potential $h \to Z \gamma$ measurement achievable with a future $e^{+}e^{-}$ circular collider ({\sl fcc-ee}). Finally, we discuss new physics implications of a precision measurement of $h \to Z \gamma$.
