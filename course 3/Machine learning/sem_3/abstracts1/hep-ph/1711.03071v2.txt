We study the effect of a strong constant magnetic field, generated in relativistic heavy ion collisions, on the heavy quark complex potential. We work in the strong magnetic field limit with the lowest Landau level approximation. We find that the screening of the real part of the potential increases with the increase in the magnetic field. Therefore, we expect less binding of the $ Q\bar{Q} $ pair in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The imaginary part of the potential increases in magnitude with the increase in the magnetic field, leading to an increase of the width of the quarkonium state with the magnetic field. All of these effects result in the early dissociation of $ Q\bar{Q} $ states in a magnetized hot quark-gluon plasma medium.
