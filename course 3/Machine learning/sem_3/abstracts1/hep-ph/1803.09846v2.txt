In response to the present status that searching for SUSY particles has been unsuccessful, we propose a bold scenario that SUSY particles are confined inside hadrons with a required condition of $P_R=1$ in analog to the color confinement for quarks. The scenario seems to be able to reconcile the beautiful SUSY theory and non-observation at present experiments. On other aspects, some loopholes in the proposal emerge and require to be answered in the future research.
