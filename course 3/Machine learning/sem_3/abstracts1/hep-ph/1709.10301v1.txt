Possible realistic scenarios are investigated in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) Higgs sector extended by dimension-six effective operators. The CP-odd Higgs boson with low mass around 30--90 GeV could be consistently introduced in the regime of large threshold corrections to the effective MSSM two-doublet Higgs potential.
