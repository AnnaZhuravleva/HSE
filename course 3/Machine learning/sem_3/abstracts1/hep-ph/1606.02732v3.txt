We suggest to use the state $Y(4630)$, which decays predominantly to $\Lambda_c\bar\Lambda_c$, as a window to the landscape of tetraquarks. We propose a simple criterion to decide whether a state is a genuine stringy exotic hadron - a tetraquark - or a "molecule". If it is the former it should be on a (modified) Regge trajectory. We present the predictions of the mass and width of the higher excited states on the $Y(4630)$ trajectory. We argue that there should exist an analogous "$Y_b$" state that decays to $\Lambda_b\bar\Lambda_b$ and describe its trajectory. We conjecture also a similar trajectory for tetraquarks containing strange quarks, and the modified Regge trajectories can in fact be predicted for any resonances found decaying to a baryon-antibaryon pair. En route to the results regarding tetraquarks, we also make some additional predictions on higher excited charmonium states. We briefly discuss the zoo of exotic stringy hadrons and in particular we sketch all the possibilities of tetraquark states.
