We systematically study the semileptonic decays of bottom/bottom-strange mesons into 1$D$ and 2$D$ states of charmed/charmed-strange mesons in the framework of the covariant light-front quark model. Our numerical results indicate that the semileptonic decays under discussion have considerable branching ratios so that it is possible to experimentally search for $D$-wave charmed/charmed-strange mesons via the semileptonic decays.
