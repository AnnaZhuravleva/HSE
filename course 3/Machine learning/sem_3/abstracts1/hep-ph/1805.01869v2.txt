We study the LHC sensitivity to a $W'$ produced via bottom and charm quarks and decaying to $\tau$ flavor leptons in the mass range 200-1000 GeV. We show that the extra $b$ quarks necessitated by the production mechanism can improve the background rejection compared to an inclusive analysis relying solely on $\tau$-tagging and $E_{T}^{\text{miss}}$. We present prospective limits on the couplings and compare them to the best fit to the $R(D^{(\ast)})$ anomalies in $B$ meson decays.
