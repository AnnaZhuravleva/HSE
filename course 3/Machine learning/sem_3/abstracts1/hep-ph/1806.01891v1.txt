Many experiments that are conducted to study the hadron spectrum rely on peripheral resonance production. Hereby, the rapidity gap allows the process to be viewed as an independent fragmen- tation of the beam and the target, with the beam fragmentation dominated by production and decays of meson resonances. We test this separation by determining the kinematic regimes that are dominated by factorizable contributions, indicating the most favorable regions to perform this kind of experiments. In doing so, we use a Regge model to analyze the available world data of charge exchange meson production with beam momentum above 5 GeV in the laboratory frame, that are not dominated by either pion or Pomeron exchanges. We determine the Regge residues and point out the kinematic regimes which are dominated by factorizable contributions.
