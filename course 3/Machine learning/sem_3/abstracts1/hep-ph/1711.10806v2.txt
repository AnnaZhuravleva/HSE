The current status of our knowledge of the 3-neutrino mixing parameters and of the CP violation in the lepton sector is summarised. The discrete symmetry approach to understanding the observed pattern of neutrino mixing and the related predictions for neutrino mixing angles and leptonic Dirac CP violation are reviewed.
