We present the first fully analytic calculation of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) event shape observable Energy-Energy Correlation in electron-positron annihilation at Next-To-Leading Order (NLO). This result sheds light on the analytic structure of the event shape observables beyond Leading Order (LO) and serves as a motivation to employ our methods in the investigation of other event shape observables that so far have not been calculated analytically.
