We investigate a model with local U(1)$_{B-L}$ and discrete $Z_2$ symmetries where two types of weak isospin singlet neutrinos, vector-like charged lepton and exotic scalar fields are introduced. The linear seesaw mechanism is induced at one-loop level through Yukawa interactions associated with the standard model leptons and exotic fields. We also discuss lepton flavor violation and muon anomalous dipole magnetic moment induced by the new Yukawa interaction. In addition, our model has dark matter candidate which is the lightest $Z_2$ odd neutral particle. We calculate the relic density and constraints from direct detection.
