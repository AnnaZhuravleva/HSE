In the high energy regime, the proton structure consists of a very large number of particles called partons (quarks and gluons) that interact with each other, according to the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Through QCD, the number of partons in the proton is described by equations of parton evolution that depend on kinematic variables. These equations can be linear, the DGLAP equations, and nonlinear, the GLR-MQ equation. We have studied some analytic solutions of the equations of parton evolution. In order to generate the preliminary results, we used an ansatz for the solution of the equations of evolution of the gluon distribution, and compared with results of parametrizations of Parton Distributions Functions (PDFs). Another method proposed in the literature is the solution via Laplace transform that will be applied in the future.
