The $\gamma N \to \pi^0 N$ and $\gamma N \to \eta N$ reactions at photon beam energies above 4 GeV are investigated within Regge models. The models include $t$-channel exchanges of vector ($\rho$ and $\omega$) and axial vector ($b_1$ and $h_1$) mesons. Moreover, Regge cuts of $\rho{\mathbb P}$, $\rho f_2$, $\omega{\mathbb P}$, and $\omega f_2$ are investigated. A good description of differential cross sections and polarization observables at photon beam energies from 4 to 15 GeV can be achieved.
