The contribution from the axial-vector meson exchange to the potential of the muon-proton interaction in muonic hydrogen induced by anomalous axial-vector meson coupling to two photon state is calculated. It is shown that such contribution to the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen is large and important for a comparison with precise experimental data. In the light of our result, the proton radius "puzzle" is discussed.
