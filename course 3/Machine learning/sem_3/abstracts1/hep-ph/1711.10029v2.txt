In this talk I discuss the widespread impact of the top quark on phenomena in elementary particle physics as codified through the Standard Model (SM), its important role in motivating the possiblity of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), and its use as a signal for detailed studies of the SM and searches for BSM physics.
