We investigate the prospects for determining the octant of $\theta_{23}$ in the future long baseline oscillation experiments. We present our results as contour plots on the ($\theta_{23}-45^\circ$, $\delta$)--plane, where $\delta$ is the CP phase, showing the true values of $\theta_{23}$ for which the octant can be experimentally determined at 3$\,\sigma$, 2$\,\sigma$ and 1$\,\sigma$ confidence level, in particular, the impact of the non-unitarity of neutrino mixing.
