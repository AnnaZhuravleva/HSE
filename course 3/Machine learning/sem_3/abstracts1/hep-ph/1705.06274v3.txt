The LHCb measurements of certain ratios of decay modes testing lepton flavour non-universality might open an exciting world of new physics beyond the standard model. The latest LHCb measurements of R_K* offer some new insight beyond the previous measurement of R_K. We work out the present significance for non-universality, and argue that claims of 5 sigma deviations from the SM based on all present b -> s l+l- data including the ratios are misleading and are at present still based on guesstimates of hadronic power corrections in the b -> s l+l- angular observables.   We demonstrate that only a small part of the luminosity of 50 fb^-1 foreseen to be accumulated by the LHCb will be needed to offer soon a definite answer to the present question whether we see a very small glimpse of lepton flavour non-universal new physics or not.   We also present new predictions for other ratios based on our analysis of the present measurements of the ratios R_K^(*) and analyse if they are able to differentiate between various new physics options within the effective field theory at present or in the near future.
