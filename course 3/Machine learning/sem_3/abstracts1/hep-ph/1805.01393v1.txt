We study the four body decay $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda ( \rightarrow p \pi) \mu^{+} \mu^{-}$ in the Randall-Sundrum model with custodial protection $(\text{RS}_c)$. By considering the constraints coming from the direct searches of the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the gluon, electroweak precision tests and from the measurements of the Higgs signal strengths at the LHC, we perform a scan of the parameter space of the $\text{RS}_c$ model and obtain the maximum allowed deviations of the Wilson coefficients $\Delta C^{(\prime)}_{7,\; 9\; 10}$ for different values of the lightest KK gluon mass $M_{g^{(1)}}$. Later, their implications on the observables such as differential branching fraction, longitudinal polarization of the daughter baryon $\Lambda$, forward-backward asymmetry with respect to leptonic, hadronic and combined lepton-hadron angles are discussed where we present the analysis of these observables in different bins of di-muon invariant mass squared $s (= q^2)$. It is observed that with the current constraints the Wilson coefficients in $\text{RS}_c$ model show slight deviations from their Standard Model values and hence can not accommodate the discrepancies between the Standard Model calculations of various observables and the LHCb measurements in $\Lambda_b$ decays.
