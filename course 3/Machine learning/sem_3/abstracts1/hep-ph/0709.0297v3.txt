Neutralino dark matter is well motivated, but also suffers from two shortcomings: it requires gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking, which generically violates flavor constraints, and its thermal relic density \Omega is typically too large. We propose a simple solution to both problems: neutralinos freezeout with \Omega ~10-100, but then decay to ~1 GeV gravitinos, which are simultaneously light enough to satisfy flavor constraints and heavy enough to be all of dark matter. This scenario is naturally realized in high-scale gauge-mediation models, ameliorates small scale structure problems, and implies that ``cosmologically excluded'' models may, in fact, be cosmologically preferred.
