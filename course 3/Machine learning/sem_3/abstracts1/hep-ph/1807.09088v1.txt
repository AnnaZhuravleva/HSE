Top-squarks (stops) play a crucial role for the naturalness of supersymmetry (SUSY). However, searching for the stops at the LHC is a tough task especially for some corners of parameter space. To dig the stops out of the huge LHC data, various expert-constructed kinematic variables or cutting-edge analysis techniques have been invented. In this paper, we propose to represent events as graphs and use the message passing neutral network to search for the stops through the process $pp \to \tilde{t}_1\tilde{t}^*_1 \to t\bar{t}\chi^0_1 \chi^0_1$ at the LHC. We find that the signal and background events can be efficiently discriminated by the patterns of event graphs. Such an approach can thus greatly improve the current LHC sensitivity for the stops.
