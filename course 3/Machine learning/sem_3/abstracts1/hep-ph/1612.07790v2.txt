We extend the CGC approach to calculation of the double inclusive gluon production by including high-density effect in the CGC wave function of the projectile (proton). Our main result is that these effects lead to the appearance of odd harmonics in the two-particle correlation C(k,p). We find that in the high momentum limit, |k|,|p|>>Q_s, this results in a positive c_1{2}. Additionally when the magnitudes of the two momenta are approximately equal, |k|/|p| ~ 1, the density effects also generate a positive third harmonic c_3{2}, which translates into a non-vanishing v_3 when the momenta of the trigger and associated particle are in the same momentum bin. The sign of c_3{2} becomes negative when |k|/|p|>1.1 suggesting an interesting experimental signature.
