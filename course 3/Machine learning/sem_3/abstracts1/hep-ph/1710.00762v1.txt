Two theoretically well-motivated gauge extensions of the standard model are $SU(3)_C \times SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ and $SU(3)_q \times SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_l \times SU(3)_R$, where $SU(3)_q$ is the same as $SU(3)_C$ and $SU(3)_l$ is its color leptonic counterpart. Each as three variations, according to how $SU(3)_R$ is broken. It is shown here for the first time that a built-in dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry exists in all six versions, and may be broken to discrete $Z_2$ dark parity. The available dark matter candidates in each case include fermions, scalars, as well as {\it vector gauge bosons}. This work points to the unity of matter with dark matter, the origin of which is not {\it ad hoc}.
