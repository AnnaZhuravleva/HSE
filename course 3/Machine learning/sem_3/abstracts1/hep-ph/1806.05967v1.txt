We propose a new physics model which has a cold dark matter candidate and can explain the b -> s mu+ mu- anomaly at the same time. Our model includes a scalar quark \widetilde{q} and a scalar lepton \widetilde{\ell} which are SU(2)_L-doublet as well as a Dirac fermion N which is SU(2)_L-singlet. The new particles are charged under a gauged U(1)_X group which is spontaneously broken to a discrete Z_2 symmetry by a dark scalar S. The remnant Z_2 symmetry stabilizes the dark matter. Box diagrams with \widetilde{q}, \widetilde{\ell}, and N running inside the loop can generate the correct Wilson coefficients C_9^\mu = -C_{10}^\mu to accommodate the b -> s mu+ mu- anomaly while avoiding constraints such as B_s-\overline{B}_s mixing. The dark matter annihilation into a second generation lepton pair via t-channel \widetilde{\ell}-exchanging process plays an important role in producing the current dark matter relic abundance of the universe, showing a strong interplay between the flavor and dark matter physics. We also discuss dark-gauge-interaction-dominated and Higgs-portal-dominated scenarios for dark matter physics.
