We investigate the use of jets to measure transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs). The example we use to present our framework is the dijet momentum decorrelation at lepton colliders. Translating this momentum decorrelation into an angle $\theta \ll 1$, we analyze the factorization of the cross section for the cases $\theta \gg R$, $\theta \sim R$ and $\theta \ll R$, where $R$ is the jet radius. Critically, for the Winner-Take-All axis, the jet TMD has the same double-scale renormalization group evolution as TMD fragmentation functions for all radii $R$. TMD fragmentation functions in factorization theorems may then simply be replaced by the jet TMDs we calculate, and all ingredients to perform the resummation to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy are available. Our approach also applies to semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), where a jet instead of a hadron is measured in the final state, and we find a clean method to probe the intrinsic transverse momentum of quarks and gluons in the proton that is less sensitive to final-state nonperturbative effects.
