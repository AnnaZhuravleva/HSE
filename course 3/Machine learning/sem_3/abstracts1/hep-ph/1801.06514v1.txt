In this paper we rewrite the neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences in matter given, in our original paper, in a notation that is more conventional for the reader. Replacing the usual neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences in the expressions for the vacuum oscillation probabilities with these matter mixing angles and mass squared differences gives an excellent approximation to the oscillation probabilities in matter. Comparisons for T2K, NOvA, T2HKK and DUNE are also given for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, disappearance and appearance channels, normal ordering and inverted ordering.
