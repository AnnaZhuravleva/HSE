We consider Higgs boson production through gluon fusion at large transverse momentum in hadronic collisions. We present the analytic expressions of the relevant one-loop QCD amplitudes including the effects of the complete set of dimension-six operators. The latter correspond to modifications of the top and bottom Yukawa couplings, to an effective point-like Higgs coupling to gluons and to the chromomagnetic operator of the top quark. The quantitative impact of the chromomagnetic operator is also studied. Our results confirm previous findings that the effect of the chromomagnetic operator at high $p_T$ can be large and should not be neglected.
