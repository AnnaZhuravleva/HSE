We use QCD Laplace sum-rules to study meson-hybrid mixing in vector ($1^{--}$) heavy quarkonium. We compute the QCD cross-correlator between a heavy meson current and a heavy hybrid current within the operator product expansion. In addition to leading-order perturbation theory, we include four- and six-dimensional gluon condensate contributions as well as a six-dimensional quark condensate contribution. We construct several single and multi-resonance models that take known hadron masses as inputs. We investigate which resonances couple to both currents and so exhibit meson-hybrid mixing. Compared to single resonance models that include only the ground state, we find that models that also include excited states lead to significantly improved agreement between QCD and experiment. In the charmonium sector, we find that meson-hybrid mixing is consistent with a two-resonance model consisting of the $J/\psi$ and a 4.3~GeV resonance. In the bottomonium sector, we find evidence for meson-hybrid mixing in the $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon(3S)$, and $\Upsilon(4S)$.
