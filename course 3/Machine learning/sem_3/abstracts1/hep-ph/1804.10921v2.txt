The magnetic dipole moments of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ doubly heavy baryons are extracted in the framework of light-cone QCD sum rule. The electromagnetic properties of the doubly heavy baryons encodes important information of their internal structure. The results for the magnetic dipole moments of doubly heavy baryons acquired in this work are compared with the predictions of the other theoretical approaches.
