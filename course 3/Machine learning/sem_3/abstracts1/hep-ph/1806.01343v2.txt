We examine the parameter space of supersymmetric models with $R$-parity violating interactions of the form $\lambda' L Q D^c$ to explain the various anomalies observed in $b \rightarrow s \ell \ell$ transitions. To generate the appropriate operator in the low energy theory, we are led to a region of parameter space where loop contributions dominate. In particular, we concentrate on parameters for which diagrams involving winos, which have not been previously considered, give large contributions. Many different potentially constraining processes are analyzed, including $\tau \rightarrow \mu \mu \mu$, $B_s-\bar{B}_s$ mixing, $B \rightarrow K^{(*)} \nu \bar{\nu}$, $Z$ decays to charged leptons, and direct LHC searches. We find that it is possible to explain the anomalies, but it requires large values of $\lambda'$, which lead to relatively low Landau poles.
