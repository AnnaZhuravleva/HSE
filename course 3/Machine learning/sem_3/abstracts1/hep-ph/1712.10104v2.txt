We study the two-photon production of the Higgs boson, $\rm \gamma\gamma\to H$, at the Future Circular Collider (FCC) in ultraperipheral PbPb and pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39$ and 63 TeV. Signal and background events are generated with MADGRAPH 5, including $\gamma$ fluxes from the proton and lead ions in the equivalent photon approximation, yielding $\rm \sigma(\gamma\gamma\to H)$ = 1.75 nb and 1.5 pb in PbPb and pPb collisions respectively. We analyse the H$\,\to b\bar{b}$ decay channel including realistic reconstruction efficiencies for the final-state $b$-jets, showered and hadronized with PYTHIA 8, as well as appropriate selection criteria to reduce the dominant exclusive $\gamma\gamma\to b\bar{b}$ continuum background. Observation of $\rm PbPb\xrightarrow{\gamma\gamma}(Pb)\,H\,(Pb)$ is achievable in the first year with the expected PbPb integrated luminosities.
