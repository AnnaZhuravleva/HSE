Properties of $\rho$-meson in symmetric nuclear matter are investigated in a light-front constituent quark model (LFCQM), using the in-medium inputs calculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The LFCQM used in this study was already applied for the studies of the electromagnetic properties of $\rho$-meson in vacuum, namely, the charge~$G_0$, magnetic~$G_1$, and quadrupole~$G_2$ form factors, electromagnetic charge radius, and electromagnetic decay constant. We predict that the electromagnetic decay constant, charge radius, and quadrupole moment are enhanced as increasing the nuclear matter density, while the magnetic moment is slightly quenched. Furthermore, we predict that the value $Q^2_{\rm zero}$, which crosses zero of the charge form factor, $G_0(Q^2_{\rm zero})=0$ ($Q^2 = -q^2 > 0$ with $q$ being the four-momentum transfer), decreases as increasing the nuclear matter density.
