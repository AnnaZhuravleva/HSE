In present work, we investigate the spectrum of several low-lying $sscq\bar{q}$ pentaquark configurations employing the constituent quark model, within which the hyperfine interaction between quarks is taken to be mediated by Goldstone boson exchange. Our numerical results show that four $sscq\bar{q}$ configurations with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ or $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ lie at energies very close to the recently observed five $\Omega_{c}^{0}$ states by LHCb collaboration, this indicates that the $sscq\bar{q}$ pentaquark configurations may form sizable components of the observed $\Omega_{c}^{0}$ resonances.
