Two of the most powerful methods currently used to determine the angle $\gamma$ of the CKM Unitarity Triangle exploit $B^+ \to DK^+$, $D \to K_{\rm S}^0\pi^+\pi^-$ decays and $B^0 \to DK^+\pi^-$, $D \to K^+K^-$, $\pi^+\pi^-$ decays. It is possible to combine the strengths of both approaches in a "double Dalitz plot" analysis of $B^0 \to DK^+\pi^-$, $D \to K_{\rm S}^0\pi^+\pi^-$ decays. The potential sensitivity of such an analysis is investigated in the light of recently published experimental information on the $B^0 \to DK^+\pi^-$ decay. The formalism is also expanded, compared to previous discussions in the literature, to allow $B^0 \to DK^+\pi^-$ with any subsequent $D$ decay to be included.
