We calculate the magnetic moments of spin-$3\over 2$ singly charmed baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT). The analytical expressions are given up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. The heavy quark symmetry is used to reduce the number of low energy constants (LECs). With the Lattice QCD simulation data as the magnetic moments of the charmed baryons, the numerical results are given up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ in three scenarios. In the first scenario, we use the results in the quark model as the leading order input. In the second scenario, we use the heavy quark symmetry and neglect the contribution of heavy quark. In the third scenario, the heavy quark contribution is considered on the basis of the scenario II and the magnetic moments of singly bottom baryons are given as a by-product.
