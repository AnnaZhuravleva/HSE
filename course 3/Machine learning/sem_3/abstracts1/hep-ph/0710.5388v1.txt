Recently, it has been shown that the standard Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is not able to reproduce the correct QCD behavior of the gap equation at large density, and therefore a different cutoff procedure at large momenta has ben proposed. We found that, even with this density dependent cutoff procedure, the pure quark phase in neutron stars (NS) interiors is unstable, and we argue that this could be related to the lack of confinement in the original NJL model.
