We study hadronic polarization and the related anisotropy of the dilepton angular distribution for the reaction $\pi N \to Ne^+e^-$. We employ consistent effective interactions for baryon resonances up to spin-5/2 to compute their contribution to the anisotropy coefficient. We show that the spin and parity of the intermediate baryon resonance is reflected in the angular dependence of the anisotropy coefficient. We present results for the anisotropy coefficient including the $N(1520)$ and $N(1440)$ resonances, which are essential at the collision energy of the recent data obtained by the HADES collaboration on this reaction. We conclude that the anisotropy coefficient provides useful constraints for unraveling the resonance contributions to this process.
