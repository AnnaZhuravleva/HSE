I present higher-order corrections from soft-gluon emission for the associated production of a top quark with a $Z$ boson via anomalous $t$-$q$-$Z$ couplings at LHC energies. Approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (aNNLO) double-differential cross sections are derived from soft-gluon resummation at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy. The total $tZ$ production cross sections and the top-quark transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions are calculated at aNNLO for various LHC energies. It is shown that the soft-gluon corrections are dominant and large for this process.
