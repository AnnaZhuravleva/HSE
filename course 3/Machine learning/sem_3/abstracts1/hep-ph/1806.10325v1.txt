The renormalization-scheme and scale dependence of the truncated QCD perturbative expansions is one of the main sources of theoretical error of the Standard Model predictions, especially at intermediate energies. Recently, a class of renormalization schemes, parametrized by a single real number $C$, has been defined and investigated in the frame of the standard perturbation expansions in powers of the coupling. In the present paper we investigate the $C$-scheme variation of a modified QCD perturbation series, which implements information about the large-order divergent character of perturbation theory by means of an optimal conformal mapping of the Borel plane. In these new expansions, the powers of the strong coupling are replaced by a set of expansion functions with properties which resemble those of the expanded correlators, having in particular a singular behaviour at the origin of the complex coupling plane. On the other hand, the new expansions have a tamed behaviour at high orders, as demonstrated by previous studies in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme. Using as examples the Adler function and the hadronic decay width of the $\tau$ lepton, we find good convergence properties of the new expansions also in the $C$-scheme, which is a further argument in favour of this version of QCD perturbation theory at intermediate energies.
