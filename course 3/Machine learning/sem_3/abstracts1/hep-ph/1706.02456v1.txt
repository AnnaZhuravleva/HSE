We present a detailed discussion on neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu \beta \beta)$ within left-right symmetric models based on the gauge symmetry of type $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ as well as $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_{X}$ where fermion masses including that of neutrinos are generated through a universal seesaw mechanism. We find that one or more of the right-handed neutrinos could be as light as a few keV if left-right symmetry breaking occurs in the range of a few TeV to 100 TeV. With such light right-handed neutrinos, we perform a detailed study of new physics contributions to $0\nu \beta \beta$ and constrain the model parameters from the latest experimental bound on such a rare decay process. We find that the dominant new physics contribution to $0\nu \beta \beta$ in such a scenario comes from large light-heavy neutrino mixing and can saturate the existing experimental bounds even if the right handed sector gauge bosons are beyond the reach of present collider experiments. We also find the constraints on these models from the latest experimental bounds on charged lepton flavour violating decays like $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$.
