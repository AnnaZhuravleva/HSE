We perform a self-consistent calculation of collective neutrino oscillations including the effect of back scattered neutrinos (Halo effect) in the `single-angle' approximation, within a spherically symmetric supernova model. We find that due to the Halo effect the onset of flavor transformations is pushed to smaller radii, by a few kilometers. The celebrated phenomenon of the spectral split is found to be robust under the present inclusion of the Halo effect.
