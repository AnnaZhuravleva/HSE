Standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis at baryonic density as inferred by WMAP implies a primordial Li7 abundance factor of two to three larger than that inferred by observations of low--metallicity halo stars. Recent observations of Li6 in halo stars suggest a pre--galactic origin of this isotope, which is exceedingly difficult to explain by putative high redshift cosmic ray populations. We investigate if one or both of these lithium problems may be solved by late decaying relic particles in the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) coupled to gravity. Assuming that the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) we find that in large parts of the CMSSM parameter space either of these problems can be potentially solved. In particular, we also find solutions where both lithium problems may be solved simultaneously. These entail the hadronic decay of relic 1 TeV staus into 100 GeV gravitinos at 1000 sec after the Big Bang, as proposed by one of us before. Moreover, the produced gravitinos naturally contribute a large fraction, or all, to the by WMAP required dark matter density. A prediction of this model is the dark matter to be lukewarm with free--streaming lengths of the order of a 4 keV early freezing--out relic particle. Such lukewarm gravitino dark matter may have beneficial effects to the formation of galactic structures and may be constrained by the reionisation history of the Universe. The current version of the paper presents results for both cases (a) when catalytic nuclear reations are included and (b) when they are neglected.
