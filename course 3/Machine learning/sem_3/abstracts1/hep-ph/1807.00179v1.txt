I. Light Scalars as Four-quark States II. Isotensor Tensor Tensor E(1500-1600) State III. X(3872) State as Charmonium \chi_{c1}(2P) IV. Two-gluon Annihilation of Charmonium \chi_{c2}(2P) There are considered problems of the exotic states, in which the author with his collaborators has made clear physical predictions, considerable part of wich is supported by experement already
