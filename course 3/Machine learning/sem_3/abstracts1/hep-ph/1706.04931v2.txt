We investigate the electroweak vacuum stability in an extended version of the Standard Model which incorporates two additional singlet scalar fields and three right handed neutrinos. One of these extra scalars plays the role of dark matter while the other scalar not only helps in making the electroweak vacuum stable but also opens up the low mass window of the scalar singlet dark matter (< 500 GeV). We consider the effect of large neutrino Yukawa coupling on the running of Higgs quartic coupling. We have analyzed the constraints on the model and identify the range of parameter space which is consistent with neutrino mass, appropriate relic density and direct search limits from the latest XENON 1T preliminary result as well as in realizing the stability of the electroweak vacuum upto the Planck scale.
