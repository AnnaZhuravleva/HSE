Indirect search for color octet electron at Plasma Wake Field Accelerator- Linear Collider (PWFA-LC) has been considered. It is shown that color octet electron masses can be probed up to 17.7 TeV at PWFA-LC with three years integrated luminosity. In addition, the compositeness scale can be probed up to 38.5 TeV.
