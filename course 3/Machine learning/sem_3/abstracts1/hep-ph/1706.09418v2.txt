We investigate the phenomenology of the MSSM extended by a single R-parity violating coupling at the unification scale. For all R-parity violating couplings, we discuss the evolution of the particle spectra through the renormalization group equations and the nature of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) within the CMSSM, as an example of a specific complete supersymmetric model. We use the nature of the LSP to classify the possible signatures. For each possible scenario we present in detail the current LHC bounds on the supersymmetric particle masses, typically obtained using simplified models. From this we determine the present coverage of R-parity violating models at the LHC. We find several gaps, in particular for a stau-LSP, which is easily obtained in R-parity violating models. Using the program CheckMATE we recast existing LHC searches to set limits on the parameters of all R-parity violating CMSSMs. We find that virtually all of them are either more strongly constrained or similarly constrained in comparison to the R-parity conserving CMSSM, including the $\bar U\bar D\bar D$ models. For each R-parity violating CMSSM we then give the explicit lower mass bounds on all relevant supersymmetric particles.
