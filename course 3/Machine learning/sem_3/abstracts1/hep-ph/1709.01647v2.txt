The pion - nucleon scattering phase shifts in $s$ and $p$ waves are analyzed using PKU unitarization approach that can separate the phase shifts into different contributions from poles and branch cuts. It is found that in $S_{11}$ and $P_{11}$ channels, there exist large and positive missing contributions when one compares the phase shift from known resonances plus branch cuts with the experimental data, which indicates that those two channels may contain sizable effects from $N^*(1535)$ and $N^*(1440)$ shadow poles. Those results are obtained using tree level results of the $\pi N$ amplitude.
