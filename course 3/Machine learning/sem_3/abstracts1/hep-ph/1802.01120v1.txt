A recent set of articles considers the effect of Earth's gravity on the magnetic moments of fermions. The authors conclude that the gravitational effects cancel out for measurements of the electron anomalous magnetic moment, but for the muon measurements, given that they are performed on highly relativistic muons, the effect is large enough to explain the discrepancy between measured and theoretical values. In this paper this effect is shown to be too small given experimental resolutions, and has been absorbed into the systematic uncertainties of experiments performed to date. Future experiments will require muon momentum tuning at the keV/c level to see this effect.
