We demonstrate that in a class of $U(1)'$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), under which all the SM matter fields are uncharged and the additional neutral gauge boson $Z'$ couples to a set of heavy nonstandard fermions, dark matter (DM) production mediated by $Z'$ can proceed through the generation of Generalized Chern-Simons (GCS) couplings. The origin of the GCS-terms is intimately connected to the cancellation of gauge anomalies. We show that the DM production cross section triggered by GCS-couplings is sufficient even for an intermediate scale $Z'$. A large range of DM and $Z'$ masses is then allowed for reasonably high reheating temperature ($T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim 10^{10}~\text{GeV}$). This type of scenario opens up a new paradigm for unified models. We also study the UV completion of such effective field theory (EFT) constructions, augmenting it by a heavy fermionic spectrum. The latter, when integrated out, generates the GCS-like terms and provides a new portal to the dark sector. Presence of a number of derivative couplings in the GCS-like operators induces a high temperature dependence to the DM production rate. The mechanism has novel consequences and leads to a new reheating dependence of the relic abundance.
