The single vector-like top partner hadroproduction in association with top quark in the five and the six-flavour schemes at the LHC is investigated. The inclusive cross section and the differential distributions are evaluated for many benchmark scenarios at leading and next-to-leading orders, both for fixed-order and fixed-order matched to parton shower. The associated Higgs production with a top quark pair, where the final state arises from the decay of the vector-like top partner into a Higgs boson and a top quark, is examined.
