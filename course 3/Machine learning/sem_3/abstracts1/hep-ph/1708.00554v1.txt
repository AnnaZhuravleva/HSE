The low energy behaviour of Quantum Chromodynamics makes unreliable an expansion in terms of its coupling strength, since nothing guarantees the convergence of such expansion. To overcomer such difficulty one resorts to Lattice QCD or Effective Field Theories. In this thesis we compute hadronic processes at low energies, using Resonance Chiral Lagrangians as the effective theory of QCD. The processes we study are important background on the search for Lepton Flavor Violation, Lepton Universality Violation, Lepton Number Violation, Second Class Currents and study the Hadronic light-by-light contribution to the Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the muon. All such processes are of great interest since all of them are to be studied with an increased precision in the very near future by different experiments.
