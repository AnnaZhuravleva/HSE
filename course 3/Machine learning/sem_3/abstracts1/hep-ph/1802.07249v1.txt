We study the Wigner distributions of quarks and gluons in light-front dressed quark model using the overlap of light front wave functions (LFWFs). We take the target to be a dressed quark, this is a composite spin $-1/2$ state of quark dressed with a gluon. This state allows us to calculate the quark and gluon Wigner distributions analytically in terms of LFWFs using Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We analyze numerically the Wigner distributions of quark and gluon and report their nature in the contour plots. We use an improved numerical technique to remove the cutoff dependence of the Fourier transformed integral over ${\bf \Delta}_\perp$.
