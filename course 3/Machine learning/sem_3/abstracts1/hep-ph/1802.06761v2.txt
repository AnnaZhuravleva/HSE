Scattering amplitudes with spinning particles are shown to decompose into multiple copies of simple building blocks to all loop orders, which can be used to efficiently reduce these amplitudes to sums over scalar integrals. Absence of unphysical kinematic singularities cleanly exposed by the method uncover novel consistency relations among master integrals and their coefficients. Analytic results are obtained for the five gluon, two loop, and four gluon, three loop planar scattering amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory as well as for leading singularities to even higher orders.
