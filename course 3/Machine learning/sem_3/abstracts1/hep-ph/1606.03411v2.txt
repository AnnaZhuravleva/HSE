We show that by combining the elementary-Goldstone-Higgs scenario and supersymmetry it is possible to raise the scale of supersymmetry breaking to several TeVs by relating it to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking one. This is achieved by first enhancing the global symmetries of the super-Higgs sector to SU(4) and then embedding the electroweak sector and the Standard-Model fermions. We determine the conditions under which the model achieves a vacuum such that the resulting Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. The main results are: the supersymmetry-breaking scale is identified with the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking scale of SU(4) which is several TeVs above the radiatively induced electroweak scale; intriguingly the global symmetry of the Higgs sector predicts the existence of two super-Higgs multiplets with one mass eigenstate playing the role of the pseudo-Goldstone Higgs; the symmetry-breaking dynamics fixes $\tan \beta = 1$ and requires a supplementary singlet chiral superfield. We finally discuss the spectrum of the model that now features superpartners of the Standard-Model fermions and gauge bosons in the multi-TeV range.
