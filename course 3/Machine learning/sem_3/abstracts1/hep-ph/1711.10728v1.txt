In this article, we construct the scalar-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type interpolating currents, and study the masses and pole residues of the $J^{P}=\frac{3}{2}^{\pm}$ hidden-charmed pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules. In calculations, we use the formula $\mu=\sqrt{M^2_{P}-(2{\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to determine the energy scales of the QCD spectral densities. We obtain the masses of the hidden-charm pentaquark states with the strangeness $S=-1$ and $S=-2$, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future.
