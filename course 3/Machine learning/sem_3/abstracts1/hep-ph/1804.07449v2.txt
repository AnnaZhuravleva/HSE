We study generic effects of new physics on the rare decay modes $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar\nu$ and $K^+ \to \pi^+ \nu \bar\nu$. We discuss several cases: left-handed neutrino couplings; right handed neutrino couplings; neutrino lepton flavour violating (LFV) interactions; and $\Delta I =3/2$ interactions. The first of these cases has been studied before as it covers many new physics extensions of the standard model; the second one requires the existence of a new light (sterile) right-handed neutrino and its contribution to both branching ratios is always additive to the SM. The case of neutrino LFV couplings introduces a CP conserving contribution to $K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar\nu$ which affects the rates in a similar manner as a right handed neutrino as neither one of these interferes with the standard model amplitudes. Finally, we consider new physics with $\Delta I =3/2$ interactions to go beyond the Grossman-Nir bound. We find that the rare kaon rates are only sensitive to new physics scales up to a few GeV for this scenario.
