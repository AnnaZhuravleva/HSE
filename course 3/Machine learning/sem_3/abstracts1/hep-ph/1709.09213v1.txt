We have carried out phenomenological implication of R-parity violating ($\NEG% {R}_{p}$) Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) via analyses of pure leptonic($% M\rightarrow \nu \bar{\nu}$) and semileptonic decays of pseudo-scalar mesons(% $M\rightarrow X\nu \bar{\nu}$). These analyses involve prediction of branching fraction of pure leptonic decays by using experimental limits/bounds derived from the study of semileptonic decays on $\NEG{R}_{p}$ parameters. We have found, in general that $\NEG{R}_{p}$ contribution dominates over the SM contribution i.e., by a factor of $10^{2}$ for the semleptonic decays of $K^{0}$, $10$ for the pure leptonic decays of $K_{L,S}$ , while $10^{2}~$\& $10^{4}$ in case of $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ respectively. This demonstrates the role of $\NEG{R}_{p}$ as a viable model for the study of NP contribution in rare decays.
