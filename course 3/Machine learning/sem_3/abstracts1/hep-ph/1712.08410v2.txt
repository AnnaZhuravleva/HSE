We present an improved study of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and of the Roper-nucleon transition using an extended version of the effective action of soft-wall AdS/QCD. We include novel contribution from additional non-minimal terms, which do not renormalize the charge and do not change the normalization of the corresponding form factors, but the inclusion of these terms results in an important contribution to the momentum dependence of the form factors and helicity amplitudes.
