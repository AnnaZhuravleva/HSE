We present the results of a holographic model for heavy vector mesons inside a plasma at finite temperature and density. The spectral function shows a nice description of the dissociation of the mesons in the medium, corresponding to the decrease in the height of the peaks as the temperature and (or) the density increase. We consider the case of bottomonium states at finite temperature and also the case of charmonium dissociation at zero temperature but finite chemical potential.
