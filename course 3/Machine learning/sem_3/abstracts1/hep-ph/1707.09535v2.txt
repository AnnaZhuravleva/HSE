We investigate the equation of state(EoS) and the effect of the hadron-quark phase transition of strong interaction matter in compact stars. The hadron matter is described with the relativistic mean field theory,and the quark matter is described with the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach of QCD. The complete EoS of the hybrid star matter is constructed with not only the Gibbs construction but also the 3-window interpolation. The mass-radius relation of hybrid stars is also investigated. We find that, although the EoSs of both the hadron matter with hyperon and $\Delta$-baryon and the quark matter are generally softer than that of the nucleon matter, the 3-window interpolation construction may provide an EoS stiff enough for a hybrid star with mass exceeding 2$M_{\odot}^{}$ and, in turn, solve the so called "hyperon puzzle".
