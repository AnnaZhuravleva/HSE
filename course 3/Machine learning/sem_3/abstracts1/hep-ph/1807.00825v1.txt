Simple power counting arguments in the dilute-dense framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory predict that even and odd azimuthal anisotropy harmonics of two-particle correlations in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC will respectively satisfy v^2_{2n} ~ N_{ch}^0 and v^2_{2n+1} ~ N_{ch}, where N_{ch} denotes the number of charged particles. We show that these expectations are borne out qualitatively, and even quantitatively, within systematic uncertainties, for v_2 and v_4 in comparisons with data from the ATLAS collaboration. We also observe that ATLAS data for the v_3 azimuthal harmonic are in excellent agreement with our qualitative expectation; quantitative comparisons are numerically challenging at present. The lessons from this study fully complement those gained by the recent comparison of the CGC dilute-dense framework [arXiv:1805.09342] to data from the PHENIX collaboration on small system collisions at RHIC.
