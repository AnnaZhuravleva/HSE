In the present work, we intend to predict the production rates of the Higgs bosons in the simplest extension of the Standard Model (SM) by a neutral complex singlet (cSMCS). This model has an additional source of CP violation and provides strong enough first-order electroweak phase transition to generate the baryon asymmetry of universe (BAU). The scalar spectrum of the cSMCS includes three neutral Higgs particles with the lightest one considered to be the 125 GeV Higgs boson found at LHC. The SM-like Higgs boson comes mostly from the SM-like SU(2) doublet, with a small correction from the singlet. To predict the production rates of the Higgs bosons, we use a conventional effective LO QCD framework and the unintegrated parton distribution functions (UPDF) of Kimber-Martin-Ryskin (KMR). We first compute the SM Higgs production cross-section and compare the results to the existing theoretical calculations from different frameworks as well as the experimental data from the CMS and ATLAS collaborations. It is shown that our framework is capable of producing sound predictions for these high-energy QCD events in the SM. Afterwards we present our predictions for the Higgs boson production in the cSMCS.
