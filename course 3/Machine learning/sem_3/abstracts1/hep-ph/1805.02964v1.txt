The strong coupling constants of newly observed $\Omega_c^0$ baryons with spin $J = \frac{1}{2}$ and $J = \frac{3}{2}$ decaying into $\Xi_c^{+} K^{-}$ are estimated within light cone QCD sum rules. The calculations are performed within two different scenarios on quantum numbers of $\Omega_c$ baryons: a) all newly observed $\Omega_c$ baryons are negative parity baryons, i.e., the $\Omega_c(3000)$, $\Omega_c(3050)$, $\Omega_c(3066)$, and $\Omega_c(3090)$ have quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ states respectively; b) the states $\Omega_c(3000)$ and $\Omega_c(3050)$ have quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^+$, while the states $\Omega_c(3066)$ and $\Omega_c(3090)$ have the quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^+$, respectively. By using the obtained results on the coupling constants, we calculate the decay widths of the corresponding decays. The results on decay widths are compared with the experimental data of LHC Collaboration. We found out that the predictions on decay widths within these scenarios are considerably different from the experimental data, i.e., both considered scenarios are ruled out.
