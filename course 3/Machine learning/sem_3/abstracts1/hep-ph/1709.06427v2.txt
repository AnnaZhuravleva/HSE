The new heavy vector-like top partner~($T$) is one of typical features of many new physics models beyond the standard model. In this paper we study the discovery potential of the LHC for the vector-like $T$-quark both in the leptonic $T\to bW$ and $T\to t_{\rm lep}Z_{\rm lep}$ (trilepton) channels at $\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV in the single production mode. Our analysis is based on a simplified model including a $SU(2)_L$ singlet with charge $2/3$ with only two free parameters, namely the $TWb$ coupling parameter $g^{\ast}$ and the top partner mass $m_T$. The $2\sigma$ exclusion limits, $3\sigma$ evidence and the $5\sigma$ discovery reach in the parameter plane of $g^{\ast}-m_T$, are, respectively, obtained for some typical integrated luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC. Finally we analyze the projected sensitivity in terms of the production cross section times branching fraction for two decay channel.
