Gauged U(1)$_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model can provide for additional contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment by means of a loop involving the $Z^{\prime}$ gauge boson. However, the parameter space of such models is severely constrained if one combines the latest muon $(g-2)$ data with various neutrino experiments such as, neutrino trident production, $\nu -e$ and $\nu -q$ elastic scattering, etc. In a supersymmetric U(1)$_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model, a larger region of parameter space opens up, thus enabling one to explore otherwise forbidden regions of parameter space in non-supersymmetric models. We show that the minimal model with the MSSM field content is strongly disfavored from Z-boson decay and neutrino data. We also show that the non-minimal model with two extra singlet superfields can lead to correct neutrino masses and mixing involving both tree level and one-loop contributions. We find that, in this model, both muon $(g-2)$ and neutrino data may be simultaneously explained in a parameter region consistent with experimental observations.
