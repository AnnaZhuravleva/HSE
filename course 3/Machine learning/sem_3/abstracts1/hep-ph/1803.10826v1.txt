We review the viability of the sterile neutrino hypothesis in accounting for three observational problems of the Standard Model of particle physics: neutrino masses and lepton mixing, dark matter and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We present two alternative scenarios for the implementation of the sterile fermion hypothesis: the $\nu$MSM and the Inverse Seesaw.
