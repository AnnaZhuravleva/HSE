In this article, we distinguish the contributions of the positive parity and negative parity $\Omega_c$ states, study the masses and pole residues of the 1S, 1P, 2S and 2P $\Omega_c$ states with the spin $J=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{3}{2}$ using the QCD sum rules in a consistent way, and revisit the assignments of the new narrow excited $\Omega_c^0$ states. The predictions support assigning the $\Omega_c(3000)$ to be the 1P $\Omega_c$ state with $J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^-$, assigning the $\Omega_c(3090)$ to be the 1P $\Omega_c$ state with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-$ or the 2S $\Omega_c$ state with $J^P={\frac{1}{2}}^+$, and assigning $\Omega_c(3119)$ to be the 2S $\Omega_c$ state with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^+$.
