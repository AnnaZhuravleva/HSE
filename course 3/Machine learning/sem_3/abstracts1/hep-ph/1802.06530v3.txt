Alternative renormalizable minimal non-SUSY SO(10) GUT model is proposed. Instead of a ${\bf 126}$-dimensional Higgs field, a ${\bf 120}$-dimensional Higgs filed is ntroducedin addition to a ${\bf 10}$-dimensional Higgs field and plays a crucial role to reproduce the realistic charged fermion mass matrices. With contributions of ${\bf 120}$ Higgs field, the original Witten's scenario of inducing the right-handed Majorana neutrino mass through 2-loop diagrams becomes phenomenologically viable. This model inherits the nice features of the conventional renormalizable minimal SO(10) GUT model with ${\bf 10}+{\bf \overline{126}}$ Higgs fields, while supplemented with a low scale seesaw mechanism due to the 2-loop induced right-handed Majorana neutrino mass.   %
