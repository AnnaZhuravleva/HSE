We analyse the sensitivity of all experimentally observable asymmetries and energy distributions for the neutron beta-decay with a polarised neutron and unpolarised decay proton and electron and the lifetime of the neutron to contributions of order 10^(-4) of interactions beyond the Standard model (SM).
