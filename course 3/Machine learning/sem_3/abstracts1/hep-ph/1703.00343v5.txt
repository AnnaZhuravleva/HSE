The next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model can host light neutralino dark matter with mass of order GeV scale. It is dominated by the singlino component as a result of approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This paper is devoted to address the question how light such neutralino dark matter can be in the light of the LHC Run 1 data as well as the latest LUX and Xenon1T limits. In particular, we show the sensitivity of parameter space of dark matter mass with respect to $Z$ boson and SM Higgs invisible decay.
