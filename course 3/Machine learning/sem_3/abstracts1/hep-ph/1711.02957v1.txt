Exclusive vector meson photoproduction associated with a leading baryon ($B = n, \Delta^+, \Delta^0$) in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated using the color dipole formalism and taking into account nonlinear effects in the QCD dynamics. In particular, we compute the cross sections for $\rho$, $\phi$ and $J/\Psi$ production together with a $\Delta$ and compare the predictions with those obtained for a leading neutron. Our results show that the $V + \Delta$ cross section is almost 30 % of the $V + n$ one. Our results also show that a future experimental analysis of these processes is, in principle, feasible and can be useful to study leading particle production.
