We calculate the electromagnetic Pauli form factor of quark induced by the nontrivial topological fluctuations of QCD vacuum called instantons. It is shown that such contribution is significant. We discuss the possible implications of our result in the photon-hadron reactions and in the dynamics of quark-photon interactions in the dense/hot quark matter.
