I briefly discuss the main phenomenological features and constraints of the Clockwork/Linear Dilaton (CW/LD) 5D geometry. This contribution is based on the work of ref. arXiv:1711.08437, to which the reader is referred for an extensive discussion of the subject and the full list of relevant references. The only original result of this proceeding is adding the constraint arising from the CMS analysis CMS-PAS-EXO-17-017 to the summary plot.
