Understanding the properties of dark matter has been proved to be one of the most challenging problems of particle phenomenology. In this paper, we tried to understand the phenomenology of dark matter in light of very well understood properties of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy. To connect these two, inflation and its subsequent evolution known as reheating phase play the important role. Following previous analysis, we first established one to one correspondence between the CMB power spectrum and the reheating temperature assuming perturbative reheating scenario. Further by incorporating a possible dark matter candidate through radiation annihilation process during reheating and the current value of dark matter abundance, we constrain the dark matter parameter space through the inflationary power spectrum for different inflationary models.
