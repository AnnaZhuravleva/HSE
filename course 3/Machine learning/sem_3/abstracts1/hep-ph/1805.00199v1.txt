We study the Higgs inflation and the cosmological electroweak phase transition with the N-scalars extended standard model of particle physics (SM). The number of N is strictly bounded by the unitarity, the Higgs precisions and electroweak precision observables (EWPO). When the scalars respects an extra $O(N)$ symmetry, the masses of the N scalars are bounded to TeV scale in the inflation viable parameter regions, and therefore impossible to saturate the DM candidates. The EWPO bound the N to be smaller than 4 and therefore make the cosmological electroweak phase transition never being strongly first order. The $O (N)$ symmetry preserved by the N scalar can be spontaneous broken to be $O (N-1)$ with remnant $N-1$ Goldstones, which can fake the neutrinos or gain masses through non-perturbative gravity effects and therefore contribute to dark radiations. The cosmological phase transition has been investigated in the Higgs inflation feasible parameter spaces, where the phase transition can be strongly first order through one-step or two-step types. The mixing of extra heavy Higgs with the SM Higgs confronts with severely constraints from LHC, CEPC, ILC, and FCC-ee. The bounds of the mixing angle might preclude the possibility to obtain the slow-roll Higgs inflations and a strong first order Electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT).
