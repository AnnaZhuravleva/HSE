It is imperative that any proposal of new physics possesses a Higgs-like boson with 125 GeV of mass and couplings with the standard particles that recover the branching ratios and signal strengths as measured by CMS and ATLAS. We address this issue within the supersymmetric version of the minimal 3-3-1 model. For this we develop the Higgs potential with focus on the lightest Higgs provided by the model. Our proposal is to verify if it recovers the properties of the standard Higgs. With respect to its mass, we calculate it up to one loop level by taking into account all contributions provided by the model. In regard to its couplings, we restrict our investigation to couplings of the Higgs-like boson with the standard particles, only. We then calculate the dominant branching ratios and the respective signal strengths and confront our results with the recent measurements of CMS and ATLAS. As distinctive aspects, we remark that our Higgs-like boson intermediates flavor changing neutral processes and then argue that its signature is the decay $t \rightarrow h+c$. We calculate its branching ratio and compare it with current bounds. We also show that the potential is stable for the region of parameter space employed in our calculations.
