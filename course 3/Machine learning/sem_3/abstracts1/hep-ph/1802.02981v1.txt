We present a next-to-leading order calculation of H+jet in gluon fusion including the effect of a finite top quark mass $m_t$ at large transverse momenta. Using the recently published two-loop amplitudes in the high energy expansion and our previous setup that includes finite $m_t$ effects in a low energy expansion, we are able to obtain $m_t$-finite results for transverse momenta below 225 GeV and above 500 GeV with negligible remaining top quark mass uncertainty. The only remaining region that has to rely on the common leading order rescaling approach is the threshold region $\sqrt{\hat s}\simeq 2m_t$. We demonstrate that this rescaling provides an excellent approximation in the high $p_T$ region. Our calculation settles the issue of top quark mass effects at large transverse momenta. It is implemented in the parton level Monte Carlo code MCFM and is publicly available immediately in version 8.2.
