Scalar tops in the supersymmetric model affect the potential of the standard model-like Higgs at the quatum level. In light of the equivalence theorem, the deviation of the potential from the standard model can be traced by longitudinal gauge bosons. In this work, high energy longitudinal W boson scattering is studied in a TeV-scale scalar top scenario. O(1-10%) deviation from the standard model prediction in the differential cross section is found depending on whether the observed Higgs mass is explained only by scalar tops or by additional contributions at a higher scale.
