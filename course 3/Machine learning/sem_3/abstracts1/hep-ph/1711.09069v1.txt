If the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the only new physics around the TeV-scale, it has to account for the entire dark matter relic density, or else it will cease to be `minimal'. We use this expectation to obtain the best quantitative explanation of the galactic centre $\gamma$-ray excess. The $\gamma$-ray data/flux limits from other astrophysical sources are also taken into account, together with all laboratory constraints. The lower limit on the relic density, together with the latest direct dark matter search constraints and the shape of the galactic centre $\gamma$-ray spectrum, makes the MSSM fits appear rather poor. A comparison with similar fits of the Higgs boson mass from indirect and direct search results makes one suspicious that the MSSM is not a good explanation of data related to dark matter.
