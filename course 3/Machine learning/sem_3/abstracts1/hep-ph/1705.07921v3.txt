We investigate the sensitivity to weakly interacting scalar dark matter from future determination of electroweak oblique parameters in the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) project. As illuminating examples, three dark matter models with scalar electroweak multiplets are studied. The multiplet couplings to the standard model Higgs doublet can break the mass degeneracy among the components, leading to nonzero contributions to oblique parameters. The dark matter candidate in these model is either a CP-even or CP-odd scalar, whose trilinear coupling to the Higgs boson could induce direct detection signals. For some moderate coupling values, we find that the CEPC sensitivity can be better than current direct detection experiments, exploring up to a TeV mass scale.
