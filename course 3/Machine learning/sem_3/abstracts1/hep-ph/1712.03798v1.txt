In this Letter we put forward a novel phenomenological paradigm in which particle physics beyond the Standard Model may be tested by radio astronomy if they are related to a first order phase transition in the early Universe. For this type of Dark Matter models, the first order phase transition takes place at KeV scales, and hence, induces the production of a stochastic gravitational wave background that can be detected from Pulsar timing measures. We demonstrate this hypothetical feasibility by studying a class of Majoron Dark Matter model, which is related to a first order phase transition of the $U(1)_{L}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry and is consequently dubbed as {\it violent Majoron}. This phenomenon are expected to be examined by the ongoing and forthcoming radio experiments, including FAST, SKA and IPTA.
