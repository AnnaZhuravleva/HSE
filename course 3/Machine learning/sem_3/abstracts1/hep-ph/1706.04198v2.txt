We study the phenomenological credibility of a vectorial dark matter, coupled to a $Z'$ portal through Chern-Simons interaction. We scrutinize two possibilities of connecting a $Z'$ with the Standard Model: (1) through kinetic mixing and (2) from a second Chern-Simons interaction. Both scenarios are characterized by suppressed nuclear recoil scatterings, rendering direct detection searches not promising. Indirect detection experiments, on the other hand, furnish complementary limits for TeV scale masses, specially with the CTA. Searches for mono-jet and dileptons signals at the LHC are important to partially probe the kinetic mixing setup. Finally we propose an UV completion of the Chern-Simons Dark Matter framework.
