Motivated by the experimental findings of some new exotic states decaying into channels like $J/\psi \phi$, we investigate the formation of resonances/bound states in the $D^*_s\bar D^*_s$ system using QCD sum rules. To do this we start with a current of the type vector times vector and use spin projectors to separate the spin 0, 1 and 2 contributions to the correlation function. We find three states with isospin 0, nearly spin degenerate, with a mass around 4.1 GeV. We have also investigated the decay of these states to $J/\psi \phi$ and provide the corresponding partial widths. Such information should be useful for experimental studies in future.
