In this paper we study a general framework to perform leading log high energy resummation with complete dependence from the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the studied system. As an application, high energy resummed expression for the Higgs boson production in the effective field theory framework will be derived. Explicit result for this process will be cross-checked against fixed order evaluations up to NNLO. Consistency with known high energy resummation for single differential rapidity or transverse momentum distribution, as well as for inclusive cross section, will also be shown.
