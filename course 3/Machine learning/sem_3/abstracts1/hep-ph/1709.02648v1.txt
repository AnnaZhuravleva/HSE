We present a calculation of prompt photon and associated photon-jet production at next-to-leading order that is consistently matched to parton showers with POWHEG. Specific issues that appear in photon radiation are discussed. Numerical results are compared to pp collision data at RHIC energies and shown to describe the data better than inclusive next-to-leading order calculations or those with leading order Monte Carlo generators like PYTHIA alone.
