We investigate neutralino dark matter from a string/M-theory perspective. Using the Kallosh-Linde (KL) scenario to stabilize the string moduli requires supersymmetry breaking for uplifting to a de Sitter vacuum. We consider the free magnetic dual description of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD with massive flavours, the Intriligator-Seiberg-Shih model (ISS), as an F-term dynamical SUSY breaking sector. This framework allows for a gravitino mass in the TeV range. Moreover, due to the plethora of particles from the ISS sector, we investigate the consequences of coupling the MSSM with the KL-ISS setup to obtain constraints from both late entropy production and the dark matter relic density. In addition to thermal neutralino production, we consider neutralino production via the decays of gravitinos and ISS fields.
