We investigate whether the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with the scalar masses of the third generation distinct from the first two, in order to be able to accommodate the muon anomalous magnetic moment, is consistent with the latest results from LHCb, direct collider bounds from the ATLAS and CMS experiments. In particular, we show that this class of models allows for satisfying both the constraints from the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ experiment and various bounds from the LHC. In addition, such models can also explain the observed dark matter relic density.
