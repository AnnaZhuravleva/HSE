We investigate the detectability as well as reconstructibility of a light pseudoscalar particle $A$, of mass in the 50 - 60 GeV range, which is still allowed in a Type-X (lepton-specific) two-Higgs doublet scenario. Such a pseudoscalar can be pair-produced in the decay $h\to AA$ of the 125 GeV scalar $h$. The light pseudoscalar in the aforementioned range, helpful in explaining the muon anomalous magnetic moment, has not only substantial branching ratio in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel but also one of about $0.35\%$ in the $\mu^+\mu^-$ final state. We show how to faithfully reconstruct the $A$ mass using the $\mu^+\mu^-$ mode, and establish the existence of a pseudoscalar around 50 - 60 GeV, using the process $pp\to h \to AA\to \mu^+\mu^-\,\tau^+\tau^-$. This is the most reliable way of reconstructing the light $A$ mass, and is possible for an integrated luminosity of about $100~\rm{fb}^{-1}$ or less at 14 TeV, with a statistical significance that amounts to discovery.
