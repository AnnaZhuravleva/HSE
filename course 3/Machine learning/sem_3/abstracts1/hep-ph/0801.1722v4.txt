Inflationary scenarios based on simple non-minimal coupling and its generalizations are studied. Generalizing the form of non-minimal coupling to "K(phi)R" with an arbitrary function K(phi), we show that the flat potential still is obtainable when V(phi)/K^2(phi) is asymptotically constant. Very interestingly, if the ratio of the dimensionless self-coupling constant of the inflaton field and the non-minimal coupling constant is small the cosmological observables for general monomial cases are in good agreement with recent observational data.
