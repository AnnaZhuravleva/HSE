The processes $e^{+}e^{-}\!\to\! (f_1(1285), a_1(1260))\gamma$ in threshold domain are considered in the framework of the extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. The channels with the ground $\rho(770)$, $\omega(782)$ and radially excited $\rho(1450)$, $\omega(1420)$ intermediate meson states are taken into account. It is shown that in the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to f_1(1285)\gamma$, the probability of the subprocesses with $\rho$-mesons significantly exceeds the probability of the subprocesses with $\omega$-mesons, whereas, in the process $e^{+}e^{-} \to a_1(1260) \gamma$, $\rho$- and $\omega$-channels give approximately equal contributions. The mechanism of this effect is discussed. The radiative decay widths of $\rho(1450)\!\to\! f_{1}(1285)\gamma$, $\omega(1420)\!\to\! f_{1}(1285)\gamma$, $\rho(1450)\!\to\! a_1(1260)\gamma$ and $\omega(1420)\!\to\! a_1(1260)\gamma$ are calculated.
