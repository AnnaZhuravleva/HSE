The Randall-Sundrum model with a deformed metric can generate light Kaluza-Klein (KK) Higgs modes consistent with the electroweak precision analysis for a certain range of parameters. The first KK mode of the Higgs ($h_{1}$) in such a model could lie in the mass range varying from 800 GeV to 1.3 TeV. We find that the $h_{1}$ is gaugephobic and decays dominantly into a $t\bar{t}$ pair. The search strategy for $h_{1}$ decaying to $t\bar{t}$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in this low mass range has been studies. We have used substructure tools to suppress the large QCD background associated with this channel. We find that $h_{1}$ can be probed at the LHC.
