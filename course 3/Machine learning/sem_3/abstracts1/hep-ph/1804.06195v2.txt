In this article, we study the axialvector-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type charmed pentaquark states with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^\pm$ with the QCD sum rules by carrying out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension $13$ in a consistent way. In calculations, we separate the contributions of the negative parity and positive parity pentaquark states unambiguously, and choose three sets input parameters to study the masses and pole residues of the charmed pentaquark states $uuuc\bar{u}$ and $sssc\bar{s}$ in details. Then we estimate the masses of the charmed pentaquark states $ssuc\bar{u}$, $susc\bar{u}$, $ssdc\bar{d}$ and $sdsc\bar{d}$ with $J^P={\frac{3}{2}}^-$ to be $3.15\pm0.13\,\rm{GeV}$ according to the $SU(3)$ breaking effects, which is compatible with the $\Omega_c(3050)$, $\Omega_c(3066)$, $\Omega_c(3090)$, $\Omega_c(3119)$.
