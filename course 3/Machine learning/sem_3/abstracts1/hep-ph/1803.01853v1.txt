We present an update of the global fit of the Standard Model electroweak sector to latest experimental results. We include new kinematic top quark and $W$ boson mass measurements from the LHC, a $\sin^2\theta^{\ell}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ result from the Tevatron, and a new evaluation of the hadronic contribution to $\alpha(M_Z^2)$. We present tests of the internal consistency of the electroweak Standard Model and updated numerical predictions of key observables. The electroweak data combined with measurements of the Higgs boson coupling strengths and flavour physics observables are used to constrain parameters of two-Higgs-doublet models.
