We propose $S_4$ symmetric four-generation models for charged leptons. Although an $S_4$ symmetric four-generation model has been already proposed, there are some additional symmetries in the model. We construct four-generation models for charged leptons with only requirement of exact $S_4$ symmetry. It turned out that at least one of the models is consistent with observations of charged lepton masses and predicts the mass of the charged lepton of the fourth generation to be 556 GeV.
