Our contribution sets out to investigate the phenomenology of a gauge model based on an $SU_{L}(2) \times U_{R}(1)_{Q} \times U(1)_{Q'}$-symmetry group. The model can accommodate, through its symmetry-breaking pattern, a candidate to a heavy $Z'$-boson at the TeV-scale. The extended Higgs sector introduces a heavy scalar whose mass lies in the region $1.2-3.7 \, \mbox{TeV}$. The fermion sector includes an exotic candidate to Dark Matter that mixes with the right-handed neutrino component in the Higgs sector, so that the whole field content ensures the cancellation of the $U(1)$-quiral anomaly. The masses are fixed according to the particular way the symmetry breaking takes place. In view of the possible symmetry breakdown pattern, we study the phenomenological implications in a high-energy scenario. We worek out the magnetic dipole momentum (MDM) of the exotic fermion and the transition MDM due to its mixing with the right-neutrino.
