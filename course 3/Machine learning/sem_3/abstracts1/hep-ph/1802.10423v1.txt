We calculate the cross-sections for the processes $\rho J/\psi\rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0$, $\rho J/\psi\rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^{0*}$ ($D^{0*}\bar{D}^{0}$) and $\rho J/\psi\rightarrow D^{0*}\bar{D}^{0*}$ using a QCD-motivated many-body overlap factor to modify the usual sum of two-body interaction model. The realistic Cornell potential has been used for pairwise interaction in the four quark Hamiltonian and noted to give lesser cross-sections as compared to the quadratic potential. The Resonating group method is employed along with the Born approximation which decouples its integral equations. It is pointed out that the additional QCD effect (a gluonic field ovelap factor) result in a significant suppression in the cross sections as compared to the more popular sum of two-body interaction.
