We make a careful analysis of $W^\pm\gamma$ production at the LHC, identifying the $W^\pm$ through leptonic decays, with a view to exploring the sensitivity of the machine to anomalous $CP$-conserving $WW\gamma$ interactions. All the available kinematic variables are used, but we find that the most useful one is the opening angle in the transverse plane between the decay products of the $W^\pm$. It is shown that even a simple-minded analysis using this variable can lead to a much greater sensitivity at the LHC than the current constraints on the relevant parameters.
