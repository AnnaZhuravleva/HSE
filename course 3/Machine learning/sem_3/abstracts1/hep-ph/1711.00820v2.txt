We model interaction of photons, pseudoscalars and vector mesons within the resonance chiral symmetric theory with the SU(3) breaking. The couplings of the model are fitted to the experimental data. Within the developed model we predict the light-by-light contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $a_{\mu}^P = (82.8 \pm 3.4)\times 10^{-11}$. The error covers also the model dependence within the class of models considered in this paper. The model was implemented into the Monte Carlo event generator Ekhara to simulate the reactions $e^+e^-\to e^+e^- P$, $P=\pi^0,\eta,\eta'$ and into the Monte Carlo event generator Phokhara to simulate the reactions $e^+e^-\to P\gamma(\gamma)$.
