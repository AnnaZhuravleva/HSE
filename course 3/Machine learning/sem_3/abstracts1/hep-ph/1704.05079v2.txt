We propose to realize (natural) NMSSM spectrum from deflected AMSB with new messenger-matter interactions. With additional messenger-matter interactions involving ${\bf 10}\oplus{\bf \overline{10}}$ representation messengers, the muon g-2 anomaly can be solved at $2\sigma$ (or $3\sigma$) level with the corresponding gluino mass range $2.8~{\rm TeV}<m_{\tilde{g}}<5.4~ {\rm TeV}$ (or $2.6 ~{\rm TeV}<m_{\tilde{g}}<7.3~ {\rm TeV}$). Besides, our scenario is fairly natural within which the involved fine tuning can be as low as 47. So, in the framework of AMSB-type scenarios, NMSSM can be advantageous in explaining the muon g-2 anomaly in compare with MSSM.
