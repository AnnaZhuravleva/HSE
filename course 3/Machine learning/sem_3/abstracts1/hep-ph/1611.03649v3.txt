We study the role of soft/nonperturbative correlations in the multi parton interactions in the central kinematics relevant for double parton scattering (DPS) and underlying event (UE) measurements at ATLAS and CMS. We show that the effect of soft correlations is negligible for DPS regime (typical transverse momenta larger than 10-20 GeV), but may be important for UE (several GeV scale). The characteristic scale where soft correlations become important increases with decrease of $x$ (energy increase) leading to approximately constant \effs at small x.
