The potential of the $e^+e^-\to\nu \bar{\nu} H$ process in the first stage of CLIC considering center of mass energy of 380 GeV and assuming the baseline integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$ is examined to probe CP conserving dimension-six operators in a model-independent Standard Model effective field theory framework. In the analysis, a detailed fast simulation on $e^+e^-\to\nu \bar{\nu} H$ signal processes and dominant backgrounds are performed including parton showering with PYTHIA and detector simulation based on ILD type detector with DELPHES in MadGraph. The obtained best limits on the $\bar{c}_{HB} $, $\bar{c}_{W}=- \bar{c}_{B}$ and $\bar{c}_{HW} $ are $[-4.82;1.53]\times10^{-2}$, $[-5.11;4.13]\times10^{-3}$ and $[-6.58;5.55]\times10^{-3}$, respectively.
