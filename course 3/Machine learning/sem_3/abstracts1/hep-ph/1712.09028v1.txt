We consider the standard model extension to explore the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of the muon. In the QED part of the theory for the CP and CPT-even Lorentz parameter $c_{\mu\nu}$, all independent electromagnetic form factors depend on a new scalar as $p'.c.p$. Therefore, the form factors, even in zero momentum transfer, can be energy dependent. We examine the magnetic form factor to find such an energy dependent up to the one loop level at the leading order of $c_{\mu\nu}$. We show that at the high energy limit (but low enough to satisfy $p^2/m^2\ll1$) there is an enhancement on the muon anomalous magnetic moment. For the first time, we find a bound on the $c_{\mu\nu}$ components for the muon as $[c_{TT}+0.35(c_{XX}+c_{YY})+0.28c_{ZZ}]$, which is about $10^{-11}$ in a terrestrial experiment
