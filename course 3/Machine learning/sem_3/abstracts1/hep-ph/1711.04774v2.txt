Dismissing traditional naturalness concerns while embracing the Higgs boson mass measurement and unification motivates careful analysis of trans-TeV supersymmetric theories. We take an effective field theory (EFT) approach, matching the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) onto the Standard Model (SM) EFT by integrating out heavy superpartners, and evolving MSSM and SMEFT parameters according to renormalization group equations in each regime. Our matching calculation is facilitated by the recent covariant diagrams formulation of functional matching techniques, with the full one-loop SUSY threshold corrections encoded in just 30 diagrams. Requiring consistent matching onto the SMEFT with its parameters (those in the Higgs potential in particular) measured at low energies, and in addition requiring unification of bottom and tau Yukawa couplings at the scale of gauge coupling unification, we detail the solution space of superpartner masses from the TeV scale to well above. We also provide detailed views of parameter space where Higgs coupling measurements have probing capability at future colliders beyond the reach of direct superpartner searches at the LHC.
