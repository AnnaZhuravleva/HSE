In this work, the hydrogen's ionization energy was used to constrain the free parameter $b$ of three Born-Infeld-like electrodynamics namely Born-Infeld itself, Logarithmic electrodynamics and Exponential electrodynamics. An analytical methodology capable of calculating the hydrogen ground state energy level correction for a generic nonlinear electrodynamics was developed. Using the experimental uncertainty in the ground state energy of the hydrogen atom, the bound $b>5.37\times10^{20}K\frac{V}{m}$, where $K=2$, $4\sqrt{2}/3$ and $\sqrt{\pi}$ for the Born-Infeld, Logarithmic and Exponential electrodynamics respectively, was established. In the particular case of Born-Infeld electrodynamics, the constraint found for $b$ was compared with other constraints present in the literature.
