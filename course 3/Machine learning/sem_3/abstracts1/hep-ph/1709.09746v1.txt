The spectrum of the doubly heavy baryons is estimated with respect to the new observation from the LHCb collaboration [Aaij:2017ueg] by using the chiral partner structure and heavy quark spin-flavor symmetry. The effects of heavy quark flavor symmetry breaking and light quark flavor symmetry are considered. The mass splitting of doubly heavy baryons with the same spin but opposite parity arises from the generalized Goldberger-Treiman relation. The intermultiplet one-pion transition and intramultiplet radiative transitions are also be estimated.
