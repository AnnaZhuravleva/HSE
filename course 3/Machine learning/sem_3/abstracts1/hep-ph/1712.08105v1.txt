We present calculations of single inclusive jet transverse momentum and energy spectra at forward rapidity ($5.2\!<\!y\!<\!6.6$) in proton-lead collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The predictions are obtained with the KaTie Monte Carlo event generator, which allows to calculate interactions within the High Energy Factorisation framework. The tree-level matrix element results are subsequently interfaced with the CASCADE Monte Carlo event generator to account for hadronisation. The effects of the saturation of the gluon density, leading to suppression of the cross section, are investigated.
