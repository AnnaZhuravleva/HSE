Following Refs. \cite{vonBuddenbrock:2015ema,Kumar:2016vut,vonBuddenbrock:2016rmr}, in this paper we focus on multi-lepton signatures arising from two new scalar bosons $H$ and $S$ at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These two new bosons are an extension to the Standard Model (SM) and interact with the SM Higgs boson, $h$. We consider two production modes for $H$, one being gluon fusion ($gg$F) and the other being in association with top quarks. The $H \to S h$ decay mode is considered, where leptonic final sates are studied. The CP properties of $S$ are characterised by considering effective couplings derived from dimension six operators through $SW^+W^-$ vertices. The nature of the $S$ boson is considered in two separate contexts. Firstly in a simplified model, it is considered to have Higgs-like couplings. Secondly, we consider a heavy neutrino model and its interactions with the $Z, W^\pm$ and $S$ bosons. The predictions of the model are compared both to ATLAS and CMS results at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ and $13$ TeV. Comparisons to the data are made, when appropriate. The compatibility of the data with the parameters obtained in Ref. \cite{vonBuddenbrock:2015ema} is discussed. A number of regions of the phase-space are suggested to the experiments for further exploration.
