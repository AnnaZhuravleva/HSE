It is shown that neutrino oscillation processes can be consistently described in the framework of quantum field theory. Namely, the oscillating electron survival probabilities in experiments with neutrino detection by charged-current and neutral-current interactions are calculated in the quantum field-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations based on a modification of the Feynman propagator. The approach is most similar to the standard Feynman diagram technique in the momentum representation. It is found that the oscillating distance-dependent probabilities of detecting an electron in experiments with neutrino detection by charged-current and neutral-current interactions exactly coincide with the corresponding probabilities calculated in the standard approach.
