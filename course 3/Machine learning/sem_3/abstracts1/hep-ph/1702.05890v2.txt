The expression of the HTL resumed gluon propagator in the light cone gauge is derived. In the real time mechanism, using the Mandelstam Leibbrant prescription of $(n\cdot K)^{-1}$, we calculate the transverse and longitudinal parts of the gluon HTL self-energy and prove the transverse and longitudinal parts do not have divergence. We also calculate the quark self energy in the HTL approximation, and find it gauge independent. We analytically calculate the damping rates of the hard quark and gluon with this HTL resumed gluon propagator.
