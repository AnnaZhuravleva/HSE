We present short review of two methods for obtaining functional equations for Feynman integrals. Application of these methods for finding functional equations for one- and two- loop integrals is described in detail. It is shown that with the aid of functional equations Feynman integrals in general kinematics can be expressed in terms of simpler integrals. Similarities between functional equations for Feynman integrals and addition theorem for Abel integrals are shortly discussed.
