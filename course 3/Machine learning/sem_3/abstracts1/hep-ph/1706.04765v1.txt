We study one possible production mechanism for hidden charm pentaquark in e+e- collision, where it is produced via a color-octet c \bar c pair fragmentation. The pentaquark production at B factory energy is dominated by e+e- to c \bar c g to Pc + X. At Z^0 pole, for the pentaquark production, there are several partonic processes playing significant role. Our results show that it is possible to search for the direct pentaquark production signal at e+e- colliders, which is important to understand the properties of pentaquark.
