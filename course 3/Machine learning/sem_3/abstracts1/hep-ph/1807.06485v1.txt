We study the $\bar{K} \Xi$ decay mode of the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ assuming that the $\Omega(2012)$ is a dynamically generated state with spin-parity $J^P = 3/2^-$ from the coupled channel $S$-wave interactions of $\bar{K}\Xi(1530)$ and $\eta \Omega$. In addition we also calculate its $K\pi\Xi$ three-body decay mode. It is shown that the so-obtained total decay width is in fair agreement with the experimental data. We compare our results with those of other recent studies and highlight differences among them.
