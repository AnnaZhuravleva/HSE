In recent work, Hill and Paz apply the operator product expansion to forward doubly virtual Compton scattering. The resulting large-$Q^2$ form of the amplitude $W_1(0,Q^2)$ is compatible with the one we obtain by extrapolation of low-$Q^2$ results from a chiral effective field theory, providing support for our approach. That paper also presents a result for the two-photon contribution to the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen that has a much larger uncertainty than in previous work. We show that this arises from the inclusion of the proton pole term in the subtracted dispersion relation for $W_1$, not from the treatment of the non-pole Born term.
