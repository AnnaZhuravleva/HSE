This is a brief review for particle physicists on cosmological impact of neutrinos and on restrictions on neutrino properties from cosmology. The paper includes discussion of upper bounds on neutrino mass and possible ways to relax them, methods to observe the cosmic neutrino background, bounds on the cosmological lepton asymmetry which are strongly improved by neutrino oscillations, cosmological effects of breaking of spin-statistics theorem for neutrinos, bounds on mixing parameters of active and possible sterile neutrinos with the account of active neutrino oscillations, bounds on right-handed currents and neutrino magnetic moments, and some more.
