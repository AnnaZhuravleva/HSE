We discuss a scenario that gravitinos produced non-thermally by an inflaton decay constitute dark matter in the present universe. We find that this scenario is realized for wide ranges of the inflaton mass and the vacuum expectation value. What is intriguing about this scenario is that the gravitino dark matter can have a relatively large free streaming length at matter-radiation equality, which can be probed by future observation on QSO-galaxy strong lens system.
