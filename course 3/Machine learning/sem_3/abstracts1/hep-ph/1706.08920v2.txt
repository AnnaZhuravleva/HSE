We study the stability of the electroweak vacuum in low-scale inflation models whose Hubble parameter is much smaller than the instability scale of the Higgs potential. In general, couplings between the inflaton and Higgs are present, and hence we study effects of these couplings during and after inflation. We derive constraints on the couplings between the inflaton and Higgs by requiring that they do not lead to catastrophic electroweak vacuum decay, in particular, via resonant production of the Higgs particles.
