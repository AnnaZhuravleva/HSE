The van der Waals interaction is implemented in a Hadron Resonance Gas model. It is shown that this model can describe Lattice QCD data of different thermodynamical quantities satisfactorily with the van der Waals parameters $a = 1250 \pm 150$ MeV fm$^3$ and $r = 0.7 \pm 0.05$ fm. Further, a phase transition is observed in this model with the critical point at temperature, $T = 62.1$ MeV and baryon chemical potential, $\mu_B = 708$ MeV.
