We present the next-to-leading-order calculation of the partial decay widths of the light CP-even Higgs boson decaying into four fermions in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model. The four different renormalization schemes applied in the calculation are described as well as the calculation and its implementation into the analysis tool Prophecy4f. Some sample results show the size of the next-to-leading-order correction as well as the overall size of the deviation from the Standard Model prediction.
