Within the framework of the color flux-tube model with a multibody confinement potential, we systematically investigate the hidden charmed states observed in recent years. It can be found that most of them can be described as the compact tetraquark states $[cq][\bar{c}\bar{q}]$ ($q=u,d$ and $s$) in the color flux-tube model. The multibody confinement potential based on the color flux-tube picture is a dynamical mechanism in the formation and decay of the compact tetraquark states.
