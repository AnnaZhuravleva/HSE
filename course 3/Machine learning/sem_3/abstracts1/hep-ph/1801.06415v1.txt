This talk discusses recent results for next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to jet cross sections and transverse momentum distributions. The results are obtained in the NNLOJET code framework, which provides an implementation of the antenna subtraction method for the handling of infrared singular contributions at NNLO. We briefly describe the NNLOJET implementation, with particular emphasis on the construction of the real radiation phase space, which is tailored to ensure stability in all infrared sensitive regions.
