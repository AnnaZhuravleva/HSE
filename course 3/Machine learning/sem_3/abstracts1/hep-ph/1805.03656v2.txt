It was recently proposed that the disagreement in the experimental measurements of the lifetime of the neutron might be eradicated if the neutron decays to particles responsible for the dark matter in the Universe. In this paper we construct a proto- type self-interacting dark matter model which, apart from reproducing the correct relic abundance, resolves all small-scale problems of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The theory is compatible with all present cosmological observations and astrophysical bounds.
