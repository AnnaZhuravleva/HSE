Using the 2+1 flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the Polyakov loop, we determine the structure of the QCD phase diagram in an external magnetic field. Beyond the usual NJL model with constant couplings, we also consider a variant with a magnetic field dependent scalar coupling, which reproduces the Inverse Magnetic Catalysis (IMC) at zero chemical potential. We conclude that the IMC affects the location of the Critical End Point, and found indications that, for high enough magnetic fields, the chiral phase transition at zero chemical potential might change from an analytic to a first-order phase transition.
