We compute perturbative corrections to matching coefficients of QCD to HQET for the matrix element of the $\Delta B=2$ operator that determines the mass difference in $B^0-\bar{B}^0$ system of states. This involves the technical point of choosing the operator basis in HQET, separating physical operators from evanescent ones. We obtain an analytical result for some of the two-loop corrections at order $\alpha_s^2$.
