Sub-GeV halo dark matter that enters the Sun can potentially scatter off hot solar nuclei and be ejected much faster than its incoming velocity. We derive an expression for the rate and velocity distribution of these reflected particles taking into account the Sun's temperature and opacity. We further demonstrate that future direct detection experiments could use these energetic reflected particles to probe light dark matter in parameter space that cannot be accessed via ordinary halo dark matter.
