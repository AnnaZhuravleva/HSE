The Real Compton Scattering in ultraperipheral $pPb$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and predictions for the squared transverse momentum ($t$) and rapidity ($Y$) distributions are presented. The scattering amplitude is assumed to be given by the sum of the Reggeon and Pomeron contributions and the Pomeron one is described by the Color Dipole formalism taking into account the non - linear (saturation) effects in the QCD dynamics. We demonstrate that the behaviour of the cross sections at large -- $t$ and/or $Y$ is dominated by the Pomeron contribution and is strongly affected by the non -- linear effects present in the QCD dynamics. These results indicate that a future experimental analysis of this process can be useful to probe the QCD dynamics at high energies.
