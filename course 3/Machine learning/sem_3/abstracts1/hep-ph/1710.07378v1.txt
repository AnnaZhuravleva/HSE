It has been proposed to determine the mass hierarchy of neutrinos by exploiting the beat between the oscillation frequencies corresponding to the two neutrino mass squared differences. JUNO is based on this concept and uses a large liquid scintillator detector at a distance of 53km from a powerful nuclear reactor complex. We argue that the micro-structure present in antineutrino fluxes from nuclear reactors makes it essential to experimentally determine a reference spectrum with an energy resolution very similar to the one of JUNO.
