We consider soft-gluon evolution at the amplitude level. Our evolution includes Coulomb exchanges and applies to generic hard-scattering processes involving any number of coloured partons. We emphasise the special role played by a Lorentz-invariant evolution variable, which coincides with the transverse momentum of the latest emission in a suitably defined dipole zero-momentum frame. We also relate the evolution algorithm, which was used originally in the derivation of super-leading logarithms, to renormalization group evolution equations that have been encountered recently. Handling large colour matrices presents the most significant challenge to numerical implementations and we present a means to expand systematically about the leading colour approximation.
