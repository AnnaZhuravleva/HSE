Motivated by the crucial role played by the discrete flavour symmetry groups in explaining the observed neutrino oscillation data, we consider the $A_4$ realization of linear seesaw by extending the standard model (SM) particle content with two types of right-handed neutrinos along with the flavon fields, and the SM symmetry with $A_4\times Z_4\times Z_2$ and a global symmetry $U(1)_X$ which is broken explicitly by the Higgs potential. We scrutinize whether this model can explain the recent results from neutrino oscillation experiments by searching for parameter space that can accommodate the observables such as the reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, the CP violating phase $\delta_{CP}$, sum of active neutrino masses $\Sigma_{i} m_i$, solar and atmospheric mass squared differences, and the lepton number violating parameter called as effective Majorana mass parameter, in line with recent experimental results. We also discuss the scope of this model to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe through Leptogenesis. We also investigate the possibility of probing the non-unitarity effect in this scenario, but it is found to be rather small.
