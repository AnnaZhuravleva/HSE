We study numerically classical collisions of waves in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory. These processes correspond to multiparticle scattering in the semiclassical regime. Parametrizing initial and final wavepackets by energy $E$ and particle numbers $N_{i}$, $N_{f}$ we find classically allowed region in the parameter space. We describe properties of the scattering solutions at the boundary of the classically allowed region. We comment on implications of our results for multiparticle production in quantum regime.
