In this article, we construct the axialvector-diquark-axialvector-antidiquark type currents to interpolate the scalar, axialvector, vector, tensor doubly charmed tetraquark states, and study them with QCD sum rules systematically by carrying out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension 10 in a consistent way, the predicted masses can be confronted to the experimental data in the future. We can search for those doubly charmed tetraquark states in the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka super-allowed strong decays to the charmed meson pairs.
