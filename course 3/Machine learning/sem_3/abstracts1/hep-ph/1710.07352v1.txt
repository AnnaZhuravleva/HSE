We discuss the impact of the determination of the nucleon tensor charge on searches for physics Beyond the Standard Model. We also comment on the future extraction of the subleading-twist PDF $e(x)$ from Jefferson Lab soon-to-be-released Beam Spin Asymmetry data as well as from the expected data of CLAS12, as the latter is related to the scalar charge. These analyses are possible through the phenomenology of Dihadron Fragmentation Functions related processes, which we report on here as well.
