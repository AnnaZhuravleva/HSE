Indications of lepton flavor universality violation in semileptonic $B$ decays to $K$ or $K^*$ and muons or electrons can be explained by leptoquark exchange. I present a model in which the leptoquark is a bound state of constituents charged under a new confining SU($N_{\rm HC}$) hypercolor interaction. The lightest neutral bound state in the theory is an asymmetric dark matter candidate, that might be directly detectable through its magnetic dipole moment interaction.
