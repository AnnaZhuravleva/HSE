Collectivity, as interpreted to mean flow of a dense medium in high-energy A-A collisions described by hydrodynamics, has been attributed to smaller collision systems -- p-A and even p-p collisions -- based on recent analysis of LHC data. However, alternative methods reveal that some data features attributed to flows are actually manifestations of minimum-bias (MB) jets. In this presentation I review the differential structure of single-particle $p_t$ spectra from SPS to LHC energies in the context of a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production. I relate the spectrum hard component to measured properties of isolated jets. I use the spectrum TCM to predict accurately the systematics of ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ in p-p, p-A and A-A collision systems over a large energy interval. Detailed comparisons of the TCM with spectrum and correlation data suggest that MB jets play a dominant role in hadron production near midrapidity. Claimed flow phenomena are better explained as jet manifestations agreeing quantitatively with measured jet properties.
