Recent results on the slope of the $pp$ diffraction cone measured by TOTEM at $7$ and $8$ GeV show an unexpected rapid rise in $s$, close to $B(s)\sim \ln^2$, rather than $\ln s$, typical of the Regge-pole predictions. We show that the new phenomenon can be accommodated by the inclusion of unitarity corrections to a simple Regge (pomeron) pole exchange. Interestingly, the odderon may also promote the acceleration of $B(s)$. The onset of the new regime may be indicative of the approach to the asymptotic dynamics of strong interactions. We analyse the new data together with other available forward measurable in a unitarized Regge dipole. Unitarization proves crucial in fitting the data, especially those on the slope $B(s)$ showing a change from the $\ln (s)$ to $\ln^2 (s)$ behavior. Having fitted the free parameters of the unitarized model to the data, we predict the behavior of the cross sections and the slope at still higher energies, including those asymptotic.
