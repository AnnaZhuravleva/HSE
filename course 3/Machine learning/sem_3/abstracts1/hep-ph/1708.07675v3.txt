The lowest dimension three-gluon currents that couple to the exotic $0^{\pm-}$ glueballs have been constructed using the helicity formalism. Based on the constructed currents, we obtain new QCD SRs that have been used to extract the masses and the decay constants of the scalar exotic $0^{\pm-}$ glueballs. We estimate the masses for the scalar state and for the pseudoscalar state to be ${m_+=9.8^{+1.3}_{-1.4}}$ GeV and $m_-=6.8^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ GeV.
