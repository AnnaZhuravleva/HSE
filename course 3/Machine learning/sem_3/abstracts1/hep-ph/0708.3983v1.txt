We propose a simple model where a {\it gauge invariant inflaton} is responsible for cosmic inflation and generates the seed for structure formation, while its relic {\it thermal} abundance explains the missing matter of the universe in the form of cold dark matter. The inflaton self-coupling also explains the observed neutrino masses. All the virtues can be attained in a minimal extension of the Standard Model gauge group around the TeV scale. We can also unveil these properties of an inflaton in forthcoming space and ground based experiments.
