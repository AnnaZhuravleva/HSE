For a continued progress in the pursuit of neutrino oscillation parameters, we require to have a precise knowledge of the pion production processes which act as a source of backgrounds and systematic uncertainties in neutrino oscillation experiments because pions can mimic a final state electron (positron). Therefore a pion production principal interaction may appear to be quasi-elastic if the pion is absorbed in the final state interactions. Charged-current single pion production processes induced by $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$ interactions with hydrocarbon target $(CH_{2})$ has been studied using NuWro event generator and the cross-sections so obtained have been compared with the results of Miner$\nu$A experiment.
