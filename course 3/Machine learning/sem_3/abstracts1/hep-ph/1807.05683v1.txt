We present a novel solution of the fermionic mass hierarchy among and within the three fermionic families within the framework of the standard model using simple $\mathcal{Z}_2$ and $\mathcal{Z}_3$ discrete symmetries. In this solution, masses of individual fermions from the third to first family appear in terms of the ascending power of the expansion parameter $ \dfrac{\text{ {\dn k}}} { \Lambda} $.
