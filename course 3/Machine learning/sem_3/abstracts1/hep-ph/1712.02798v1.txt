We present a comprehensive study of the three-active plus $N$ sterile neutrino model as a framework for constraining leptonic unitarity violation induced at energy scales much lower than the electroweak scale. We formulate a perturbation theory with expansion in small unitarity violating matrix element $W$ while keeping (non-$W$ suppressed) matter effect to all orders. We show that under the condition of sterile state masses $0.1\, {\rm eV}^2 \lesssim m^2_{J} \lesssim 1\, {\rm MeV}^2$, we can derive a very simple form of the oscillation probability which consists only of zeroth-order terms with the unique exception of probability leaking term $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha \beta}$ of $\mathcal{O} (W^4)$. We argue, based on our explicit computation to fourth-order in $W$, that all the other terms are negligibly small after using the suppression due to the sterile mass condition. Then, we identify a limited energy region in which this suppression is evaded and the effects of order $W^2$ corrections plus $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha\beta}$ may be observable. Its detection would provide another way, in addition to detecting $\mathcal{C}_{\alpha \beta}$, to distinguish between low-scale and high-scale unitarity violation. We also solve analytically the zeroth-order system in uniform density matter to provide a basis for numerical evaluation of non-unitary neutrino evolution.
