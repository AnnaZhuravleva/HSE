We analyze in details the effects associated with mixing of fermionic fields. In a system with an arbitrary number of Majorana or Dirac particles, a simple proof of factorizability of residues of non-diagonal propagators at the complex poles is given, together with a prescription for finding the "square-rooted" residues to all orders of perturbation theory, in an arbitrary renormalization scheme. Corresponding prescription for the scalar case is provided as well.
