The radiative decay of $f_1(1285)$ to vector mesons $\rho$ and $\phi$ is calculated in a non-relativistic approach. The results obtained are compared to experimental data to estimate the glue content of $f_1$. We find a small or nonexistent glue content when our results are compared to the PDG data. However a large glue content for $f_1(1285)$ was found when we compared our results to the CLAS data.
