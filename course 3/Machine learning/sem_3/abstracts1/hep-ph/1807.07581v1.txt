We study the predictions of generic ultraviolet completions of two-Higgs doublet models. We assume that at the matching scale between the two-Higgs doublet model and a ultraviolet complete theory -- which can be anywhere between the TeV and the Planck scale -- arbitrary but perturbative values for the quartic couplings are present. We evaluate the couplings down from the matching scale to the weak scale and study the predictions for the scalar mass spectrum. In particular, we show the importance of radiative corrections which are essential for both an accurate Higgs mass calculation as well as determining the stability of the electroweak vacuum. We study the relation between the mass splitting of the heavy Higgs states and the size of the quartic couplings at the matching scale, finding that only a small class of models exhibit a sizeable mass splitting between the heavy scalars at the weak scale. Moreover, we find a clear correlation between the maximal size of the couplings and the considered matching scale.
