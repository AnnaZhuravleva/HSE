With the availability of high luminosity electron beam at the accelerators, there is now the possibility of studying weak quasielastic hyperon production off the proton, i.e. $e^-p \to \nu_e Y(Y=\Lambda,\Sigma^0)$, which will enable the determination of the nucleon-hyperon vector and axial-vector transition form factors at high $ Q^2$ in the strangeness sector and provide test of the Cabibbo model, G-invariance, CVC, PCAC hypotheses and SU(3) symmetry. In this work, we have studied the total cross section, differential cross section as well as the longitudinal and perpendicular components of polarization of the final hyperons ($ \Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ produced in these reactions) and presented numerical results for these observables and their sensitivity to the transition form factors.
