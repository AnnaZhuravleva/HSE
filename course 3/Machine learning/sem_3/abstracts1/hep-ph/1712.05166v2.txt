We formulate a method to find the meromorphic solutions of higher-order recurrence relations in the form of the sum over poles with coefficients defined recursively. Several explicit examples of the application of this technique are given. The main advantage of the described approach is that the analytical properties of the solutions are very clear (the position of poles is explicit, the behavior at infinity can be easily determined). These are exactly the properties that are required for the application of the multiloop calculation method based on dimensional recurrence relations and analyticity (the DRA method).
