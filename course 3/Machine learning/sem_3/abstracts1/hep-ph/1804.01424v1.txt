In the quark sector, Jarlskog rephasing invariant parameter $J_{CP}$ has important implications for the CP violation as well as phase structure of the quark mass matrices. In fact all CP violating effects in this sector are proportional to the magnitude of the imaginary part of $J_{CP}$ . With the observation of non-zero and large "reactor mixing angle", it is widely believed that CP might be violated in the leptonic sector. In this context, we have examined in detail the relationship of CP odd invariants for texture specific mass matrices. In particular, we have calculated the predicted ranges of Jarlskog rephasing invariant parameter and other weak basis invariants for all the seven viable cases for texture two zero mass matrices.
