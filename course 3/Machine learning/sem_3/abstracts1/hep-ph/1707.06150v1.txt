Light meson ( $\pi,\ \sigma,\ a_0$) properties in the environment with chiral imbalance are analyzed with the help of meson effective Lagrangian associated with QCD. New spatial parity violating decays of scalar mesons arise as a result of mixing of $\pi$ and $a_0$ mesons under influence of chiral charge density. The pion electromagnetic form-factor gets an unusual parity-odd contribution. Pion effective masses depend on their velocities and may vanish in flight. The possible determination of chiral chemical potential in heavy ion collisions based on above mentioned phenomena is discussed.
