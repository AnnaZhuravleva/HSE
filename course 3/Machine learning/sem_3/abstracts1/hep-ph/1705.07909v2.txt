Results for the two-loop corrections to the Higgs-boson masses of the MSSM with complex parameters of $\mathcal{O}{\left(\alpha_t^2+\alpha_t\alpha_b+\alpha_b^2\right)}$ from the Yukawa sector in the gauge-less limit are presented. The corresponding self-energies and their renormalization have been obtained in the Feynman-diagrammatic approach. The impact of the new contributions on the Higgs spectrum is investigated. Furthermore, a comparison with an existing result in the limit of the MSSM with real parameters is carried out. The new results will be included in the public code $\texttt{FeynHiggs}$.
