The decay $\eta'\rightarrow\pi^0\gamma\gamma$ is studied theoretically in the framework of the Vector Meson Dominance model (VMD). We find theoretically a significant contribution of the interference of $\omega-\rho$ and provide theoretical Dalitz-plots. Comparison with the experimental results of BES-III \cite{BES-III} is done. We find some tension between our predicted value and the observed result. Our calculations can be also checked using the data of GAMS-$4\pi$.
