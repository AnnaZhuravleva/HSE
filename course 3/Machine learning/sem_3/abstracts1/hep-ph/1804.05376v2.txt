In this work, we revisit the thermodynamical self-consistency of quasiparticle model with finite baryon chemical potential adjusted to lattice QCD calculations. Here, we investigate the possibility where the effective quasiparticle mass is also a function of its momentum, $k$, in addition to temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. It is found that the thermodynamic consistency can be expressed in terms of an integro-differential equation concerning $k$, $T$, and $\mu$. We further discuss two special solutions, both expressed in terms of a particle differential equation whose boundary condition can be determined by the lattice QCD data at vanishing baryon chemical potential. The first case is shown to be equivalent to those previously discussed by Peshier et al. The second one, on the other hand, is an intrinsically different solution where the momentum dependence of the particle mass can be obtained by solving the equation along with its boundary condition. By numerical calculations, we show that both solutions can reasonably reproduce the recent lattice QCD results of the Wuppertal-Budapest Collaboration, and in particular, those concerning finite baryon density. Possible implications are discussed.
