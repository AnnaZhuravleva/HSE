We propose a natural realization of inverse seesaw model with right-handed and flavor dependent $U(1)$ gauge symmetries, in which we formulate the neutrino mass matrix to reproduce current neutrino oscillation data in a general way. Also we study a possibility to provide predictions to the neutrino sector by imposing an additional flavor dependent $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry that also satisfies the gauge anomaly cancellation conditions associated with $U(1)_R$. Then we analyze collider physics on a extra gauge boson and show a possibility of detection.
