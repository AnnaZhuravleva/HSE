Wilson is a Python library for matching and running Wilson coefficients of higher-dimensional operators beyond the Standard Model. Provided with the numerical values of the Wilson coefficients at a high new physics scale, it automatically performs the renormalization group evolution within the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), matching onto the weak effective theory (WET) at the electroweak scale, and QCD/QED renormalization group evolution below the electroweak scale down to hadronic scales relevant for low-energy precision tests. The matching and running encompasses the complete set of dimension-six operators in both SMEFT and WET. The program builds on the Wilson coefficient exchange format (WCxf) and can thus be easily combined with a number of existing public codes.
