We investigate the helicity dependent generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in momentum as well as transverse position (impact) spaces for up and down quarks in a proton when the momentum transfer in both the transverse and longitudinal directions are nonzero. The GPDs are evaluated using the light-front wavefunctions of a quark-diquark model for nucleon where the wavefunctions are constructed by the soft-wall AdS/QCD correspondence. We also express the GPDs in the boost-invariant longitudinal position space.
