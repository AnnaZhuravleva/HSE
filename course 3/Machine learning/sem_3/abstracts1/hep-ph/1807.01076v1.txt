We study the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of pion for non-zero skewness by considering the leading $| q \bar{q} \rangle$ Fock state component. Inspired from AdS/QCD light-front wave functions, we calculate the pion GPDs. By taking the Fourier transforms we obtain the results for impact-parameter dependent parton distribution functions (ipdpdf) and for GPDs in longitudinal boost-invariant space. We also calculate the charge density and gravitational form factor of the pion. The pion unpolarized transverse momentum distribution (TMD) have also been calculated. The results provide rich information on the internal structure of pion.
