The real-time dissociation of the heavy quarkonium in a strongly coupled boost-invariant non-Abelian plasma relaxing towards equilibrium is analyzed in a holographic framework. The effects driving the plasma out of equilibrium are described by boundary quenching, impulsive variations of the boundary metric. Quarkonium is represented by a classical string with endpoints kept close to the boundary. The evolution of the string profile is computed in the time-dependent geometry, and the dissociation time is evaluated for different configurations with respect to the direction of the plasma expansion. Dissociation occurs fastly for the quarkonium placed in the transverse plane.
