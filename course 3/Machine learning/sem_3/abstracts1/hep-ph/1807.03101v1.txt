The discovery of doubly heavy baryon provides us with a new platform for precisely testing Standard Model and searching for new physics. As a continuation of our previous works, we investigate the FCNC processes of doubly heavy baryons. Light-front approach is adopted to extract the form factors, in which the two spectator quarks are viewed as a diquark. Results for form factors are then used to predict some phenomenological observables, such as the decay width and the forward-backward asymmetry. We find that most of the branching ratios for $b\to s$ processes are $10^{-8}\sim10^{-7}$ and those for $b\to d$ processes are $10^{-9}\sim10^{-8}$. The flavor SU(3) symmetry and symmetry breaking effects are explored. Parametric uncertainties are also investigated.
