A large separation of scales is frequently required by theories describing physics beyond the Standard Model. In mass-split models with some massless (light) and some heavy flavors, large scale separation arises by construction if the system is conformal in the ultraviolet but chirally broken in the infrared. Due to the presence of a conformal fixed point, such chirally broken systems show hyperscaling and have a highly constrained resonance spectrum that is significantly different from the QCD spectrum. We present numerical evidence for hyperscaling of both light-light and heavy-heavy meson resonances and show that they only depend on the ratio of the light and heavy flavor masses. The heavy-heavy spectrum is qualitatively different from QCD. The mass of heavy-heavy quarkonia e.g. is not proportional to the constituent quark mass.
