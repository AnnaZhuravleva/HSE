The issue of deriving $ZH\eta$ vertex in the simplest Little Higgs (SLH) model is revisited. Special attention is paid to the treatment of non-canonically-normalized scalar kinetic matrix and vector-scalar two-point transitions. We elucidate a general procedure to diagonalize a general vector-scalar system in gauge theories and apply it to the case of SLH. The resultant $ZH\eta$ vertex is found to be different from those which have already existed in the literature for a long time. We also present an understanding of this issue from an effective field theory viewpoint.
