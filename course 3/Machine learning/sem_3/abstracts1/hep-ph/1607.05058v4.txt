A new approach to problem of glueball search is presented. It refers to early J. Rosner's attempts to detect the tensor glueball. In the present description the glueball state is treated equally with singlet $q\bar{q}$ one. Mixing glueball with $q\bar{q}$ nonet creates decuplet. Glueball can be detected as its component. Our approach is based on hypothesis of vanishing exotic commutators described as VEC model. The model describes all multiplets of light mesons. This makes possible to compare the mass patterns of different multiplets. According to VEC description some abnormal nonets can be interpreted as incomplete decuplets. This makes possible to relate the anomaly of the nonet to a glueball component of decuplet. The model reflects rich diversity of strong interaction properties. The treatment presented is quite elementary: only masses of physical states are required to be known.
