The gluon condensation (GC)-effects in high energy cosmic rays are investigated. After a brief review of the GC, two dozen examples including gamma-, electron-, positron-, proton- and antiproton-spectra in a broad GeV$\sim $TeV region are examined as the GC-evidence. We find that the GC in proton may break the power-law of the cosmic ray spectra if the energy of accelerated protons exceeds the GC-threshold. The nuclear dependence of the GC-effects are predicted based on the QCD evolution equation. The results are used to expose the GC-effects in neutron star and at the next high energy hadron colliders. Particularly, the galactic center GeV excess and the increase of the positron and antiproton fractions in cosmic rays are understood in Quantum Chromodynamics theory rather than in the special dark matter models.
