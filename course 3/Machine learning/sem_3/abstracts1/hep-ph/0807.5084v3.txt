We investigate effects of D-term contributions to the anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. If we introduce an E6 GUT motivated D-term, it is possible that slepton mass squared is positive at weak scale even if there are no other D-term contributions. Moreover, as a consequence of additional D-term contributions to scalar masses, we obtain various soft supersymmetry breaking mass spectra, which are different from those obtained in the conventional anomaly mediation scenario. Then there would be a distinct signature of this scenario at the LHC. For example, in several cases, there exist mass splittings between the right-handed sfermion and the left-handed sfermion. We also discuss some characteristic features of the neutralino dark matter in this model.
