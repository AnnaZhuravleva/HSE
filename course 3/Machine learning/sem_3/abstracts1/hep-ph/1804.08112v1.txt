A new Regge-like mass relation for excited light mesons is presented in relativized quark model which supports an universality that the quark mass dependence of the light meson spectroscopy is suppressed significantly and the confining parameter is nearly family independent. It is obtained by using auxiliary field method and quasi-linearizing the solution to the mass relation solved from the model. The resulted mass predictions are in good agreement with the observed masses for the orbitally-excited trajectory family of $\pi/b$, $\rho/a$, $\eta/h$, $\omega/f$, $K^{\ast}$ and $\phi/f^{\prime}$. A semiclassical argument is given that the inverse slopes on the radial and angular-momentum Regge trajectories are equal in the massless limit of quarks.
