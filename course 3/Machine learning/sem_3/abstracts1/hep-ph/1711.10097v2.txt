We revisit thermal Majorana dark matter from the viewpoint of minimal effective field theory. In this framework, analytic results for dark matter annihilation into standard model background are derived. The dark matter parameter space subject to the latest LUX, PandaX-II and Xenon-1T limits is presented in a model-independent way. Applications to singlet-doublet, MSSM, and MSSM with vector-like lepton model are work out.
