In this proceeding we shall explore the potential of a future $e^- \,p$ collider to probe the CP-even scalars in a two Higgs doublet model. We consider Type-I in this study. The mass of the lighter scalar particle is considered to be the Higgs-boson, $m_h = 125$ GeV, and a heavy scalar $m_H = 270$ GeV. The centre of mass energy for the $e^-\,p$ collision is considered as in the Large Hadron Electron Collider and the Future Circular Hadron Electron Collider configurations, by fixing the proton beam energy to be $E_p = 7$ and 50 TeV, respectively, and an electron beam energy of $E_e = 60$ GeV. Production cross sections of these scalars are also shown at higher electron beam energies. Future prospects of these studies are also discussed.
