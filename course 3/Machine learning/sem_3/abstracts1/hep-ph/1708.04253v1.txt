We show that the coherent oscillations of a spin-2 field from bimetric theory can easily account for the observed dark matter abundance. We obtain the equation of motion for the field in a cosmological setting and discuss in detail the phenomenology of the model. The framework is testable in precision measurements of oscillating electric charge in atomic clocks, using atomic spectroscopy and in dedicated resonant mass detectors as well as in axion-like-particles experiments, which therefore provide a new window to probe and test gravity itself. We also comment on possible multimetric extensions of the framework that straightforwardly implement the clockwork mechanism for gravity.
