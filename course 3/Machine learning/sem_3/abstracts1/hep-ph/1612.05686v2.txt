Over the past $\sim\!\! 10$ years, the topic of the nucleon's nonperturbative or $\textit{intrinsic}$ charm (IC) content has enjoyed something of a renaissance, largely motivated by theoretical developments involving quark modelers and PDF fitters. In this talk I will briefly describe the importance of intrinsic charm to various issues in high-energy phenomenology, and survey recent progress in constraining its overall normalization and contribution to the momentum sum rule of the nucleon. I end with the conclusion that progress on the side of calculation has now placed the onus on experiment to unambiguously resolve the proton's intrinsic charm component.
