We proposed the spontaneous CP-violation in the Simplest Little Higgs model. In this model, the pseudoscalar field can acquire a nonzero vacuum expected value. It leads to a mixing between the two scalars with different CP-charge, which means spontaneous CP-violation happens. It is also a connection between composite Higgs mechanism and CP-violation. Facing the experimental constraints, the model is still alive for both scenarios in which the extra scalar appears below or around the electro-weak scale. We also discussed the future collider tests on CP-violation in the scalar sector through measuring $h_2ZZ$ and $h_1h_2Z'$ vertices (see the definitions of the particles in the text) which provides new motivations on future $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ colliders. It also shows the importance of the vector-vector-scalar- and vector-scalar-scalar-type vertices to discover CP-violation effects in the scalar sector.
