Extra dimensions provide a unique tool for building new physics models. Here we extend the kinetic mixing/dark photon mediator scenario for the case of complex scalar dark matter interacting with the Standard Model to 5-D. We assume that the inverse size of the new, flat extra dimension is $\sim 10 - 1000$ MeV, the mass range of interest in numerous current experiments, and discuss the resulting phenomenology. Here we see that 5-D constructions can be used to soften some of the possible tuning issues which are sometimes encountered in the corresponding 4-D models.
