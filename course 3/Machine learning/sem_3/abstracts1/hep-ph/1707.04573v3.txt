We propose a local $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model to explain $b \to s \mu^+ \mu^-$ anomaly observed at the LHCb   and Belle experiments. The model also has a natural dark matter candidate $N$. We introduce $SU(2)_L$-doublet colored scalar $\widetilde{q}$ to mediate $b \to s$ transition at one-loop level. The $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously by the scalar $S$. All the new particles are charged under $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$. We can obtain $C_9^{\mu,{\rm NP}} \sim -1$ to solve the $b \to s\mu^+\mu^-$ anomaly and can explain the correct dark matter relic density of the universe, $\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2 \approx 0.12$, simultaneously, while evading constraints from electroweak precision tests, neutrino trident experiments and other quark flavor-changing loop processes such as $b \to s \gamma$ and $B_s-\overline{B}_s$ mixing. Our model can be tested by searching for $Z'$ and new colored scalar at the LHC and $B \to K^* \nu \overline{\nu}$ process at Belle-II.
