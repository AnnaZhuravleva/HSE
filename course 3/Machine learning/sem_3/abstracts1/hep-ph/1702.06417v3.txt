We look for minimal extensions of Standard Model with vector like fermions leading to precision unification of gauge couplings. Constraints from proton decay, Higgs stability and perturbativity are considered. The simplest models contain several copies of vector fermions in two different (incomplete) representations. Some of these models encompass Type III seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses whereas some others have a dark matter candidate. In all the models, at least one of the candidates has non-trivial representation under $SU(3)_{color}$. In the limit of vanishing Yukawa couplings, new QCD bound states are formed, which can be probed at LHC. The present limits based on results from 13 TeV already probe these particles for masses around a TeV. Similar models can be constructed with three or four vector representations, examples of which are presented.
