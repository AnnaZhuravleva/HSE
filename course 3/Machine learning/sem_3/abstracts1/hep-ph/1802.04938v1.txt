In this work, we study higher bottomonia up to the $nL=8S$, $6P$, $5D$, $4F$, $3G$ multiplets using the modified Godfrey-Isgur (GI) model, which takes account of color screening effects. The calculated mass spectra of bottomonium states are in reasonable agreement with the present experimental data. Based on spectroscopy, partial widths of all allowed radiative transitions, annihilation decays, hadronic transitions, and open-bottom strong decays of each state are also evaluated by applying our numerical wave functions. Comparing our results with the former results, we point out difference among various models and derive new conclusions obtained in this paper. Notably, we find a significant difference between our model and the GI model when we study $D, F$, and $G$ and $n\ge 4$ states. Our theoretical results are valuable to search for more bottomonia in experiments, such as LHCb, and forthcoming Belle II.
