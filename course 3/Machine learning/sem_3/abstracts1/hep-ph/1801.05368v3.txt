The rotating relativistic fermion system is considered. The consideration is based on the Dirac equation written in the laboratory (non - rotating) reference frame. Rotation in this approach gives rise to the effective magnetic and electric fields that act in the same way both on positive and negative electric charges. In the presence of external electric field in the given system the electric current appears orthogonal to both the electric field and the axis of rotation. The possible applications to the physics of quark - gluon plasma are discussed.
