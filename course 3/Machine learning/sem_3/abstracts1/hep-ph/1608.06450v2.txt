The Kondo effect is a universal phenomena observed in a variety of fermion systems containing a heavy impurity particle whose interaction is governed by the non-Abelian interaction. At extremely high density, I study the Kondo effect by color exchange in quark matter containing a single heavy (charm or bottom) quark as an impurity particle. To obtain the ground state with the Kondo effect, I introduce the condensate mixing the light quark and the heavy quark (Kondo cloud) in the mean-field approximation. I estimate the energy gain by formation of the Kondo cloud, and present that the Kondo cloud exhibits the resonant structure. I also evaluate the scattering cross section for the light quark and the heavy quark, and discuss its effect to the finite size quark matter.
