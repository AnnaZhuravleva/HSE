Following our previous proposal [1], we construct a class of good "lattice cross sections" (LCSs), from which we could study partonic structure of hadrons from ab initio lattice QCD calculations. These good LCSs, on the one hand, can be calculated directly in lattice QCD, and on the other hand, can be factorized into parton distribution functions (PDFs) with calculable coefficients, in the same way as QCD factorization for factorizable hadronic cross sections. PDFs could be extracted from QCD global analysis of the lattice QCD generated data of LCSs. We also show that proposed functions for lattice QCD calculation of PDFs in the literature are special cases of these good LCSs.
