Single inclusive forward hadron production in high-energy hadron collisions can provide an important test of the Color Glass Condensate picture at small $x$. Recent studies of this process at next-to-leading order have led to problematic results, with cross sections becoming negative at large transverse momenta. We study a new formulation of this quantity proposed recently by Iancu et al. We show that it leads to physical results up to large transverse momenta at fixed coupling. Taking into account running coupling effects in a way that is consistent with existing DIS calculations still poses a challenge.
