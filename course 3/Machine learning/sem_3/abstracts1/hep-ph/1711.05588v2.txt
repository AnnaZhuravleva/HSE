We study a seesaw model with $A_4$ flavor symmetry with two Higgs singlets and it's physics phenomenological consequences. After symmetry breaking, the model leads to the neutrino mixing matrix that satisfies the current data of neutrino oscillation experiments. We then study how the low energy CP violation parameter, $J_{CP}$, associate with the Dirac CP violation phase $\delta$. We also study the high energy CP violation associate with the decay of heavy right handed neutrino in leptogenesis process in order to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe, $\eta_B$. Numerically, we find a correlation between $J_{CP}$ and $\eta_B$. It is shown that our prediction for $J_{CP}$, and hence for the Dirac CP violating phase $\delta$, for some high energy's fixed parameters can be constrained by the current data of $\eta_B$.
