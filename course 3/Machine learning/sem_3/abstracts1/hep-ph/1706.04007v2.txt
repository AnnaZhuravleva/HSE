This paper explores the effects of finite width in processes of pair production of a heavy eXtra Quark (XQ) with charge 2/3 and its subsequent decay into a Dark Matter (DM) candidate -- either scalar or vector -- and Standard Model (SM) up-type quarks at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This dynamics has been ignored so far in standard experimental searches of heavy quarks decaying to DM and we assess herein the regions of validity of current approaches, based on the assumption that the XQ has a narrow width. Further, we discuss the configurations of masses, widths and couplings where the latter breaks down.
