We present a new release of the program iHixs. This easy-to-use tool allows to derive state of the art predictions for the inclusive production cross section of a Higgs boson at hadron colliders in the gluon fusion production mode. This includes the most up-to-date corrections in perturbative QCD and electro-weak theory, effects due to finite quark masses as well as an option to perform threshold resummation. In particular, exact perturbative QCD corrections through N3LO are included in the heavy top quark effective theory. Furthermore, iHixs contains automatic routines that allow to assess residual uncertainties on the prediction for the Higgs boson production cross section according to well established standard definitions. iHixs can be obtained from https://github.com/dulatf/ihixs .
