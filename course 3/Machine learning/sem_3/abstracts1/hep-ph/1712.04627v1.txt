Spontaneous and closely related to it gravitational baryogenesis are critically analyzed. It is shown that the coupling of the curvature scalar to baryonic current, which induces nonzero baryonic asymmetry of the universe, simultaneously leads to higher order gravitational equations, which have exponentially unstable solutions. It is shown that this instability endangers the standard cosmology.
