Chiral anomaly induces a new kind of macroscopic quantum behavior in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, including the chiral magnetic effect. In this talk we present two new quantum effects present in fluids that contain charged chiral fermions: 1) the turbulent inverse cascade driven by the chiral anomaly; 2) quantized chiral magnetic current induced by the reconnections of magnetic flux. We also discuss the implications for the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.
