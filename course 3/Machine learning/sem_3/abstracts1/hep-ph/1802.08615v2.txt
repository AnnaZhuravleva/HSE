We consider a neutrino Two Higgs Doublet Model ($\nu$THDM) in which neutrinos obtain {\it naturally} small Dirac masses from the soft symmetry breaking of a global $U(1)_X$ symmetry. We extended the model so the soft term is generated by the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ by a new scalar field. The symmetry breaking pattern can also stabilize a scalar dark matter candidate. After constructing the model, we study the phenomenology of the dark matter: relic density, direct and indirect detection.
