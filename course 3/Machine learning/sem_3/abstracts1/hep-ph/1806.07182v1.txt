We propose a natural realization of linear seesaw model with hidden gauge symmetry in which $SU(2)_L$ triplet fermions, one extra Higgs singlet, doublet and quartet scalar are introduced. Small neutrino mass can be realized by two suppression factors that are small vacuum expectation value of quartet scalar and inverse of Dirac mass for triplet. After formulating neutrino mass matrix, we discuss collider phenomenology of the model focusing on signals from exotic charged particles production at the LHC.
