We explore the parameter space of the singlet fermionic cold dark matter model with respect to constraints on, first, the relic density and second, gamma-ray lines up to 10 TeV. We compare our result with the latest experimental data from H.E.S.S., and show that except for the resonance regions, the parameter space of this model is not excluded.
