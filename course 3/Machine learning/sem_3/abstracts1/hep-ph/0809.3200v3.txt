Many string constructions have a classical no-scale structure, resulting in a one-parameter model (OPM) for the supersymmetry breaking soft terms. As a highly constrained subset of mSUGRA, the OPM has the potential to be predictive. Conversely, if the observed superpartner spectrum at LHC is a subset of the OPM parameter space, then this may provide a clue to the underlying theory at high energies. We investigate the allowed supersymmetry parameter space for a generic one-parameter model taking into account the most recent experimental constraints. We find that in the strict moduli scenario, there are no regions of the parameter space which may satisfy all constraints. However, for the dilaton scenario, there are small regions of the parameter space where all constraints may be satisfied and for which the observed dark matter density may be generated. We also survey the possible signatures which may be observable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Finally, we compare collider signatures of OPM to those from a model with non-universal soft terms, in particular those of an intersecting D6-brane model. We find that it may be possible to distinguish between these diverse scenarios at LHC.
