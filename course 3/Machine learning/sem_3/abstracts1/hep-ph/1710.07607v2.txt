Using a novel observable that relies on the momentum difference of the two most energetic subjets within a jet $\Delta S_{12}$ we study the internal structure of high-energy jets simulated by several Monte Carlo event generators that implement the partonic energy-loss in a dense partonic medium. Based on inclusive jet and di-jet production we demonstrate that $\Delta S_{12}$ is an effective tool to discriminate between different models of jet modifications over a broad kinematic range. The new quantity, while preserving the colinear and infrared safety of modern jet algorithms, it is experimentally attractive because of its inherent resiliance against backgrounds of heavy-ion collisions.
