We calculated the form factors of $B_{c}$ transitions into $\eta^{(')}$ meson, where the $B_{c}$ meson is a bound state of two different heavy flavors and is treated as a nonrelativistic state, while the masses of the mesons $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are smaller enough compared to the transition momentum scale and are treated as light-cone objects. The mechanism of two gluon transition into $\eta^{(')}$ dominated the form factors of $B_{c}$ decays into $\eta^{(')}$. We considered the $\eta-\eta'$ mixing effect, especially the gluonium contributions to the $\eta'$, and then obtained their influences on the form factors. The form factors of $B_{c}$ transitions into $\eta^{(')}$ in the maximum momentum recoil point were obtained as follows: $f^\eta_{0,+}(q^2=0)=3.13^{+0.12}_{-0.09}\times 10^{-3}$ and $f^{\eta'}_{0,+}(q^2=0)=1.09^{+0.15}_{-0.12}\times 10^{-2}$. Also phenomenological discussions for semileptonic $B_{c}\to \eta^{(')}+\ell+\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $D_{s}\to \eta+\ell+\bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays are given.
