In this paper, we investigate how the gravitational vacuum polarization affects stabilities of the electroweak vacuum in the Schwarzschild black-hole background. By using the renormalized vacuum field fluctuation $\left< { \delta \phi }^{ 2 } \right>_{\rm ren}$ which is approximately expressed by the thermal Hawking temperature $T_{\rm H}$ around the black-hole horizon ($r\approx 2M_{BH}$), we discuss the vacuum stability around the Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we newly investigate the stability of the electroweak vacuum around evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) by taking into account the back-reaction effects on the effective Higgs potential $V_{\rm eff}\left( \phi \right)$ which was ignored in past works. By incorporating these effects and analyzing the stability of the vacuum, we show that one evaporating black hole does not cause serious problems in vacuum stability of the standard model Higgs and obtain an upper bound on the evaporating PBH abundance $\beta \lesssim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-21}\right) \left({m_{\rm PBH}}/{10^{9}{\rm g}} \right)^{3/2}$ not to induce any catastrophes.
