We consider an extension of the Standard Model with isotropic nonbirefringent Lorentz violation in the photon sector and restrict the discussion to the case of a "fast" photon with a phase velocity larger than the maximum attainable velocity of the quarks and leptons. With our conventions, this case corresponds to a negative Lorentz-violating parameter $\kappa$ in the action. The decay rate of a neutral pion into two nonstandard photons is calculated as a function of the 3-momentum of the initial pion and the negative Lorentz-violating parameter $\kappa$ of the final photons.
