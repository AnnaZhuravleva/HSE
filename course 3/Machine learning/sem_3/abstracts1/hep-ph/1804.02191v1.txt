We quantitatively study the percentage of fake events present in CCQE and CCRes interactions and the impact of final state interactions on the neutrino oscillation parameters at Dune. Resonance interaction will be the most dominant interaction in the oscillation sensitive region of DUNE. The effect of final-state interactions for DUNE oscillation physics is analysed in an ideal and realistic detector scenario. The $\nu_{\mu}$-disappearance Oscillation channel is studied using LAr detector. We find that nuclear effects and detector thresholds plays an significant role in CCQE and CCRes interactions and these nuclear effects induces a significant bias in the determination of atmospheric oscillation parameters. The impression of nuclear effects on the determination of $\theta_{23}$ is quantified in this work.
