We study the evolution of simple cosmic string loop solutions in an inflationary universe. We show, for the particular case of circular loops, that periodic solutions do exist in a de Sitter universe, below a critical loop radius $R_c H=1/2$. On the other hand, larger loops freeze in comoving coordinates, and we explicitly show that they can survive more $e$-foldings of inflation than point-like objects. We discuss the implications of these findings for the survival of realistic cosmic string loops during inflation, and for the general characteristics of post-inflationary cosmic string networks. We also consider the analogous solutions for domain walls, in which case the critical radius is $R_c H=2/3$.
