We analyze the transverse momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y$) spectra of top quark pairs, hadronic top quarks, and top quarks produced in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. For $p_T$ spectra, we use the superposition of the inverse power-law suggested by the QCD (quantum chromodynamics) calculus and the Erlang distribution resulting from a multisource thermal model. For $y$ spectra, we use the two-component Gaussian function resulting from the revised Landau hydrodynamic model. The modelling results are in agreement with the experimental data measured at the detector level, in the fiducial phase-space, and in the full phase-space by the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Based on the parameter values extracted from $p_T$ and $y$ spectra, the event patterns in three-dimensional velocity ($\beta_x$-$\beta_y$-$\beta_z$), momentum ($p_x$-$p_y$-$p_z$), and rapidity ($y_1$-$y_2$-$y$) spaces are obtained, and the probability distributions of these components are also obtained.
