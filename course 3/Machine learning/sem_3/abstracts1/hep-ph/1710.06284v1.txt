The Georgi-Machacek model is one of many beyond Standard Model scenarios with an extended scalar sector which can group under the custodial $\rm SU(2)_C$ symmetry. There are 5-plet, 3-plet and singlet Higgs bosons under the classification of such symmetry in addition to the Standard Model Higgs boson. In this paper, we study the prospects for detecting the doubly-charged Higgs boson ($\rm H_5^{\pm\pm}$) through the vector boson fusion production at the electron-proton (ep) colliders. We concentrate on our analysis through $\mu$-lepton pair production via pair of same-sign W bosons decay. The $\rm H_5^{\pm\pm}$ discovery potentials at the ep colliders are presented.
