We explore the reach of a 100 TeV proton collider to discover KK gluons in a warped extra dimension. These particles are templates for color adjoint vectors that couple dominantly to the top quark. We examine their production rate at NLO in the six-flavor m-ACOT scheme for a variety of reference models defining their coupling to quarks, largely inspired by the RS model of a warped extra dimension. In agreement with previous calculations aimed at lower energy machines, we find that the NLO corrections are typically negative, resulting in a $K$-factor of around 0.7 (depending on the model) and with a residual scale dependence on the order of $\pm 20\%$, greater than the variation from the scale exhibited by the na\"{i}ve LO estimate.
