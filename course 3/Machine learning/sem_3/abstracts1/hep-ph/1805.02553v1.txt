The large-$N_c$ masses of light vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mesons are calculated from QCD spectral sum rules for a particular ansatz interpolating the radial Regge trajectories. The ansatz includes a linear part plus exponentially degreasing corrections to the meson masses and residues. The form of corrections was proposed some time ago from consistency with analytical structure of Operator Product Expansion of the two-point correlation functions. Two solutions are found and compared with the experimental data.
