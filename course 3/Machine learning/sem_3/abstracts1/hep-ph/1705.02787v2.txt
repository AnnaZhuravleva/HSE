The strong nature of Composite Higgs models manifests at high energies through the growing behavior of the scattering amplitudes of longitudinally polarized weak bosons that leads to the formation of composite resonances as well as non-resonant strong effects. In this work the unitarity of these scattering amplitudes is used as a tool to assess the profile of the composite spectrum of the theory, including non-resonant enhancements, vector resonances and the CP-even scalar excitation. These three signatures are then studied in realistic scattering processes at hadron colliders, aiming to estimate the potential to exclude dynamically motivated scenarios of Composite Higgs models.
