We investigate wide-angle pi^0 photoproduction within the handbag approach to twist-3 accuracy. In contrast to earlier work both the 2-particle as well as the 3-particle twist-3 contributions are taken into account. It is shown that both are needed for consistent results that respect gauge invariance and crossing properties. The numerical studies reveal the dominance of the twist-3 contribution. With it fair agreement with the recent CLAS measurement of the pi^0 cross section is obtained. We briefly comment also on wide-angle photoproduction of other pseudoscalar mesons.
