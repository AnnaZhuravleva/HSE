Primordial cosmological hypermagnetic fields polarize the early   Universe plasma prior to the electroweak phase transition (EWPT).   As a result of the long range parity violating gauge interaction present in the Standard Model their magnitude gets amplified, opening a new, perturbative way, of accounting for the observed intergalactic magnetic fields.
