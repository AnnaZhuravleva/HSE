We study the transition of non-perturbative to perturbative QCD in situations with possible violations of scaling limits. To this end we consider the singly- and doubly-virtual pion transition form factor $\pi^0\to\gamma\gamma$ at all momentum scales of symmetric and asymmetric photon momenta within the Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach. For the doubly virtual form factor we find good agreement with perturbative asymptotic scaling laws. For the singly-virtual form factor our results agree with the Belle data. At very large off-shell photon momenta we identify a mechanism that introduces quantitative modifications to Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage scaling.
