Dark matter, one of the important portion of the universe, could affect the visible matter in neutron stars. An important physical feature of dark matter is due to the spin of dark matter particles. Here, applying the piecewise polytropic equation of state for the neutron star matter and the equation of state of spin polarized self-interacting dark matter, we investigate the structure of neutron stars which are influenced by the spin polarized self-interacting dark matter. The behavior of the neutron star matter and dark matter portions for the stars with different values of the interaction between dark matter particles and spin polarization of dark matter is considered. In addition, we present the value of the gravitational redshift of these stars in different cases of spin polarized and self-interacting dark matter.
