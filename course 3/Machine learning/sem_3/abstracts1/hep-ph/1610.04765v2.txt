We study differential cross sections for the production of three and four jets in multi-Regge kinematics, the main interest lying on azimuthal angle dependences. The theoretical setup is the jet production from a single BFKL ladder with a convolution of two/three BFKL Green functions, where two forward/backward jets are always tagged in the final state. Furthermore, we require the tagging of one/two further jets in more central regions of the detectors with a relative separation in rapidity. We found, as result, that the dependence on transverse momenta and rapidities of the central jets can be considered as a distinct signal of the onset of BFKL dynamics.
