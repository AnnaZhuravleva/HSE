The DAMPE $e^+ e^-$ excess at around 1.4 TeV could be explained in the type-II seesaw model with a scalar dark mater $D$ which is stabilized by a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The simplest scenario is the annihilation $DD \to H^{++} H^{--}$ followed by the subsequent decay $H^{\pm\pm} \to e^\pm e^\pm$, with both the DM and triplet scalars roughly 3 TeV with a small mass splitting. In addition to the Drell-Yan process at future 100 TeV hadron colliders, the doubly-charged components could also be produced at lepton colliders like ILC and CLIC in the off-shell mode, and mediate lepton flavor violating processes $e^+ e^- \to \ell_i^\pm \ell_j^\mp$ (with $i \neq j$). A wide range of parameter space of the type-II seesaw could be probed, which are well below the current stringent lepton flavor constraints.
