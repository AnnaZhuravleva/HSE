These lectures provide an introduction to the physics of particle colliders. Topics covered include a quantitative examination of the design and operational parameters of Large Hadron Collider, kinematics and observables at colliders, such as rapidity and transverse mass, and properties of distributions, such as Jacobian peaks. In addition, the lectures provide a practical introduction to the decay modes and signatures of important composite and elementary and particles in the Standard Model, from pions to the Higgs boson. The aim of these lectures is provide a bridge between theoretical and experimental particle physics. Whenever possible, results are derived using intuitive arguments and estimates rather than precision calculations.
