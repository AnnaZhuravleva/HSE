We present the dark matter (DM) extension (by N) of the minimal supersymmetric standard model to give the recent trend of the high energy positron spectrum of the PAMELA/HEAT experiments. If the trend survives by future experiments, the MSSM needs to be extended. Here, we minimally extend the MSSM with one more DM component N together with a heavy lepton E, and introduce the coupling e_R E_R^c N_R. This coupling naturally appears in the flipped SU(5) GUT models. This N_{DM}MSSM contains the discrete symmetry Z_6, and for some parameter ranges there result two DM components. For the MSSM fields, the conventional R-parity, which is a subgroup of Z_6, is preserved. We also present the needed parameter ranges of these additional particles.
