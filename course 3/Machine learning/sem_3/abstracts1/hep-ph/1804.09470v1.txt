The $(B-L)$ Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM) motivates several Dark Matter (DM) candidates beyond the Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We assess the comparative naturalness of the two models and discuss the potential detection properties of a particular candidate, the Right-Handed (RH) sneutrino.
