We use QCD spectral sum rules (QSSR) and the factorization properties of molecule and four-quark currents to estimate the masses and couplings of the 0+ and 1+ molecules and four-quark at N2LO of PT QCD. We include in the OPE the contributions of non-perturbative condensates up to dimension-six. Within the Laplace sum rules approach (LSR) and in the MS-scheme, we summarize our results in Table 2, which agree within the errors with some of the observed XZ-like molecules or/and four-quark. Couplings of these states to the currents are also extracted. Our results are improvements of the LO ones in the existing literature.
