In this letter, we first resume the results of a previous article (EPJC(2011)71:1620). That work considered a simple model of QCD including a Yukawa interaction with a scalar field. Its two loop effective potential for the scalar field, predicted a 126 GeV Higgs mass after the minimum of the potential was fixed at a mean scalar field giving a 175 GeV Top quark mass. However, a high value of the strong coupling was required (\alpha=g^2/(4 \pi) close to 1) to get these values. After reviewing the results of this study, an idea for extending the work is simply advanced here: to consider the running strong coupling, in order to decide whether or not, the usual values of the strong interactions have the chance of justifying the experimentally known values of the Higgs and Top quark masses. It is underlined that a positive result of the proposed task will suggests the possibility of basing the SM breaking of symmetry, on the so called "second minimum" of this model. This could also identify the essential role of QCD in this effect. Results of the further examination of this question will be presented elsewhere.
