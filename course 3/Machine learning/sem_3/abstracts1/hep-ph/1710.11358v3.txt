In this paper, we studied systematically scalar one-loop two-, three-, and four-point Feynman integrals with complex internal masses. Our analytic results presented in this work are valid for both real and complex internal masses. The calculations were implemented into a {\tt Mathematica} (version $9$) package and {\tt FORTRAN} program. The results were cross-checked numerilcally with {\tt LoopTools} (version $2.14$), {\tt Golem95C} in real as well as complex internal masses. We found a perfect agreement between our numerical results and {\tt LoopTools}, {\tt Golem95C} for all cases. Additionally, this work was applied for evaluating scalar one-loop Feynman integrals developed leading Landau singularities which may appear in real scattering processes at future colliders. Unlike the traditional approach proposed by G.~~'t Hooft and M. Veltman, the method used in this report can also extend to evaluate directly tensor one-loop integrals. Thus, this may open a new approach to solve the so-called Inverse Gram determinant problem analytically.
