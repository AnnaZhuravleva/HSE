Guided by gauge principles we discuss a predictive and falsifiable UV complete model where the Dirac fermion that accounts for the cold dark matter abundance in our universe induces the lepton flavor violation (LFV) decays $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e e e$ as well as $\mu-e$ conversion. We explore the interplay between direct dark matter detection, relic density, collider probes and lepton flavor violation to conclusively show that one may have a viable dark matter candidate yielding flavor violation signatures expected to be fully probed in the upcoming of experiments. Interestingly, keeping the dark matter mass not far from the TeV, our model has an approximate prediction for the maximum LFV signal one could have while reproducing the correct dark matter relic density.
