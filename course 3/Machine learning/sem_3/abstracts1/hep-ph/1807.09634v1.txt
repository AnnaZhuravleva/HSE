In these proceedings we discuss the family of Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) processes, in particular we look at a very recent result from the CMS collaboration where a search was performed for VBS in the four-lepton and two-jet final state using proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. The electroweak production of two Z bosons in association with two jets was measured with an observed (expected) significance of 2.7 (1.6) standard deviations, using a multivariate classifier. Additionally an expected significance of 1.2 standard deviations was found using matrix elements techniques. In this work we discuss the latter approach in detail.
