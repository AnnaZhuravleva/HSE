In this note we report on the new version of FeynCalc, a Mathematica package for symbolic semi-automatic evaluation of Feynman diagrams and algebraic expressions in quantum field theory. The main features of version 9.0 are: improved tensor reduction and partial fractioning of loop integrals, new functions for using FeynCalc together with tools for reduction of scalar loop integrals using integration-by-parts (IBP) identities, better interface to FeynArts and support for SU(N) generators with explicit fundamental indices.
