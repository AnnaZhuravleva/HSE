We show that, in the Regge limit, beam asymmetries in $\eta$ and $\eta'$ photoproduction are sensitive to hidden strangeness components. Under reasonable assumptions about the couplings we estimate the contribution of the $\phi$ Regge pole, which is expected to be the dominant hidden strangeness contribution. The ratio of the asymmetries in $\eta'$ and $\eta$ production is estimated to be close to unity in the forward region $0 < -t/\text{GeV}^2 \leq 1$ at the photon energy $E_\text{lab} = 9$~GeV, relevant for the upcoming measurements at Jefferson Lab.
