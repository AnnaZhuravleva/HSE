Standard model (SM) spin-zero singlets are constrained through their di-Bosonic decay channels via an effective coupling induced by a vector-like quark (VLQ) loop at the LHC for $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. These spin-zero resonances are then considered as portals for scalar, vector or fermionic dark matter particle interactions with SM gauge bosons. We find that the model is validated with respect to the observations from LHC data and from cosmology, indirect and direct detection experiments for an appreciable range of scalar, vector and fermionic DM masses greater than 300 GeV and VLQ masses $\ge$ 400 GeV, corresponding to the three choice of portal masses 270 GeV, 500 GeV and 750 GeV respectively.
