Based on a previous work on scenarios where the Standard Model and dark matter particles share a common asymmetry through effective operators at early time in the Universe and later on decouple from each other (not care), in this work, we study in detail the collider phenomenology of these scenarios. In particular, we use the experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to constrain the viable parameter space. Besides effective operators, we also constrain the parameter space of some representative ultraviolet complete models with experimental results from both the LHC and the Large Electron-Positron Collider. Specifically, we use measurements related to jets + missing transverse energy (MET), di-jets and photon + MET. In the case of ultraviolet models, depending on the assumptions on the couplings and masses of mediators, the derived constraints can become more or less stringent. We consider also the situation where one of the mediators has mass below 100 GeV, in this case we use the ultraviolet model to construct a new effective operator responsible for the sharing of the asymmetry and study its phenomenology.
