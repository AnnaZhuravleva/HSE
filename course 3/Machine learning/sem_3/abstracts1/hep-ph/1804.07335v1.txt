We propose to generate a realistic Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) soft SUSY breaking spectrum from a generalized deflected mirage mediation scenario, in which additional gauge mediation contributions are included to deflect the renormalization group equation (RGE) trajectory. Additional contributions to $m_S^2$ can possibly ameliorate the stringent constraints from the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and 125 GeV Higgs mass. Based on the Wilsonian effective action after integrating out the messengers, we find that the new mixed gauge-modulus mediation contributions, which are missed (albeit trivial) in previous studies with ordinary form of messenger sector, can possibly arise and play a role in the generation of the NMSSM soft SUSY breaking spectrum. The relevant fine-tuning and the dark matter constraints are also discussed. The Barbieri-Giudice type fine-tuning in our scenario can be as low as 10, which indicates that our scenario is fairly natural.
