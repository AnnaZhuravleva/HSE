The Hilbert spaces of particle states are constructed in such a way that the neutrinos are combined in a multiplet with its components being considered as different quantum states of a single particle. The same is done for the charged leptons and the down- and up-type quarks. In a theory based on the Lagrangian of the fermion sector of the Standard Model modified in accordance with this construction, the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations arises as a direct consequence of the general principles of quantum field theory. By the example of the pion decay it is shown that the states of the neutrino produced in the decay process can be described by a superposition of states with different masses and identical canonical momenta with very high accuracy.
