For all the success of the Standard Model (SM), it is on the verge of being surpassed. In this regard we argue, by showing a minimal flavor-structured model, that $U(1)$ mixed-gravitational anomaly cancellation could be of central importance in constraining the fermion contents of a new chiral gauge theory realized in gauge/gravity duality. Such anomaly-free condition together with the SM flavor structure demands a condition $k_1\,X_1/2=k_2\,X_2$ with $X_i$ being a charge of $U(1)_{X_i}$ and $k_i$ being some integers, both of which are flavor dependent. We show that axionic domain-wall condition $N_{\rm DW}$ with the anomaly free-condition depends on both $U(1)_X$ charged quark and lepton flavors; the seesaw scale congruent to the scale of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breakdown can be constrained through constraints coming from astrophysics and particle physics. Then the model can be well flavor-structured in a unique way that $N_{\rm DW}=1$ with the $U(1)_X$ mixed-gravitational anomaly-free condition demands additional Majorana fermion and the flavor puzzles of SM are well delineated by new expansion parameters expressed in terms of $U(1)_X$ charges and $U(1)_X$-$[SU(3)_C]^2$ anomaly coefficients, providing remarkable results on neutrino (hierarchical mass spectra and unmeasurable neutrinoless-double-beta decay rate together with the predictions on atmospheric mixing angle and leptonic Dirac CP phase favored by the recent long-baseline neutrino experiments), QCD axion, and flavored-axion.
