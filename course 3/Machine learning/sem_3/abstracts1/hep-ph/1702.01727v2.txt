Building on recent advances in the understanding of gauge-Yukawa theories we explore possibilities to UV-complete the Standard Model in an asymptotically safe manner. Minimal extensions are based on a large flavor sector of additional fermions coupled to a scalar singlet matrix field. We find that asymptotic safety requires fermions in higher representations of $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L$. Possible signatures at colliders are worked out and include $R$-hadron searches, diboson signatures and the evolution of the strong and weak coupling constants.
