Using gauge/gravity duality methods, we study the relaxation towards equilibrium of strongly interacting non-Abelian matter. We adopt boundary sourcing to drive the system out-of-equilibrium, and analyze the equilibration process through local probes (energy density and pressures) and nonlocal probes (lengths of the geodesics between two boundary points and extremal surfaces having a Wilson loop as contour on the boundary). We also investigate the real-time dissociation of the heavy quarkonium in the out-of-equilibrium plasma. Systematic comparison with the results of a geometry dual to viscous hydrodynamics sheds light on the thermalization process.
