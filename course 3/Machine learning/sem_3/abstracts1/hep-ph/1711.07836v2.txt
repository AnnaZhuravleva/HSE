We point out how to detect experimentally the energy region where asymptotics starts to manifest itself in hadron scattering relating appearance of the secondary dips in the differential cross-section of elastic scattering $d\sigma/dt $ with beginning of the asymptotic energy region. The consideration relies on the differential characteristics. The framework of the impact parameter picture of proton--proton interactions is being used.
