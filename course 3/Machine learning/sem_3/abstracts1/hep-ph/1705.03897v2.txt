We study UV complete theories where the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is extended with a new abelian $U(1)$, and the field content is augmented by an arbitrary number of scalar and fermion SM singlets, potentially including dark matter (DM) candidates. Considerations such as classical and quantum gauge invariance of the full theory and S-matrix unitarity, not applicable within a simplified model approach, are shown to have significant phenomenological consequences. The lack of gauge anomalies leads to compact relations among the $U(1)$ fermion charges, and puts a lower bound on the number of dark fermions. Contrary to naive expectations, the DM annihilation to Zh is found to be p-wave suppressed, as hinted by perturbative unitarity of S-matrix, with dramatic implications for DM thermal relic density and indirect searches. Within this framework, the interplay between dark matter, new vector boson and Higgs physics is rather natural and generic.
