Effects of Glauber gluons in soft collinear factorization, which cause the elastic scattering process between collinear particles, are studied in the frame of soft-collinear effective theory(SCET). Glauber modes are added into the Lagrangian before integrated out, which is helpful in studying on interactions between Glauber gluons and (ultra)soft gluons explicitly. It is proved that effects of interactions after the hard collision cancel out in processes inclusive enough. In these processes, effects of couplings between Glauber gluons and collinear particles cancel out except for that Glauber gluons couple to collinear particles at vertexes adjacent to the final cut or hard vertex. While neglecting couplings between Glauber gluons and soft particles, it is proved that elastic scattering effects between spectators cancel out in processes considered here. Such cancellation is independent of details of couplings involving Glauber gluons in processes without interactions between spectators and active particles except for vertexes at which active particles and spectators are created. Possibility of absorbing Glauber gluon effects into collinear and soft Wilson lines is also discussed. \end{abstract}
