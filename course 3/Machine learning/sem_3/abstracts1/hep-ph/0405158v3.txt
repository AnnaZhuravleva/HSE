The axino is a promising candidate for dark matter in the Universe. It is electrically and color neutral, very weakly interacting, and could be - as assumed in this study - the lightest supersymmetric particle, which is stable for unbroken R-parity. In supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, in which the strong CP problem is solved via the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the axino arises naturally as the fermionic superpartner of the axion. We compute the thermal production rate of axinos in supersymmetric QCD. Using hard thermal loop resummation, we obtain a finite result in a gauge-invariant way, which takes into account Debye screening in the hot quark-gluon-squark-gluino plasma. The relic axino abundance from thermal scatterings after inflation is evaluated. We find that thermally produced axinos could provide the dominant part of cold dark matter, for example, for an axino mass of 100 keV and a reheating temperature of 10^6 GeV.
