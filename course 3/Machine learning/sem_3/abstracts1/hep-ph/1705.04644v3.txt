A new mathematical framework for the diagonalization of the nondiagonal vector--scalar and axial-vector--pseudoscalar mixing in the effective meson Lagrangian is described. This procedure has unexpected connections with the Hadamard product of $n\times n$ matrices describing the couplings, masses, and fields involved. The approach is shown to be much more efficient as compared with the standard methods employed previously. The difference is especially noticeable if the chiral symmetry is broken explicitly. The paper ends with an illustrative application to the chiral model with broken $SU(3)_L\times SU(3)_R$ symmetry.
