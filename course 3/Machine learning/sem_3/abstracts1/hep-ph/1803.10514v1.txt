In this letter, we investigate the anomalous Hall effect in dense QCD matter. When the dual chiral density wave which is the spatially modulated chiral condensate appears in the medium, it gives rise to two Weyl points to the single-particle energy-spectrum and then the anomalous Hall conductivity becomes nonzero. Then, dense QCD matter is analogous to the Weyl semimetal. The direct calculation of the Hall conductivity by way of Kubo's linear response theory gives the term proportional to the distance between the Weyl points. Unlike the Weyl semimetal, there appears the additional contribution induced by axial anomaly.
