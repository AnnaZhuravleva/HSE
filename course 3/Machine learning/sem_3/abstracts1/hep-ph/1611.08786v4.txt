In this paper, we studied the $B_{(s)} \to (D_{(s)},\bar{D}_{(s)}) \rho \to (D_{(s)}, \bar{D}_{(s)})\pi \pi$ decays by employing a framework for the quasi-two-body decays in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach. We use the two-pion distribution amplitudes $\Phi_{\pi\pi}$, which contains both resonant and nonresonant contributions from the pion pair, to describe the final state interactions (FSIs) between the pions in the resonant region. We found that (a) for all considered decays, the PQCD predictions for their branching ratios based on the quasi-two-body and the two-body framework agree well with each other due to ${\cal B}(\rho \to \pi\pi) \approx 100\%$; For $B^+\to \bar{D^0}\rho^+\to \bar{D^0}\pi^+ \pi^0$ and other four considered decay modes, the PQCD predictions do agree well with the measured values within errors; (b) the great difference between the PQCD predictions for ${\cal B}(B\to \bar{D} \rho \to \bar{D} \pi\pi)$ and ${\cal B}(B\to D \rho \to D \pi\pi)$ can be understood by the strong CKM suppression factor $ R_{\rm CKM} \approx 3 \times 10^{-4}$; (c) for the $B_s\to D \rho \to D \pi\pi$ and $B_s\to \bar{D} \rho \to \bar{D} \pi\pi$ decays, however, the PQCD predictions of $R_{\rm s1}\approx 0.13$ and $R_{\rm s2}\approx 0.14$ do agree very well with the moderate CKM suppression factor $R^s_{\rm CKM}\approx 0.14$; and (d) the PQCD predictions for the ratios $R_{D\rho}$ and the strong phase difference $\cos\delta_{D\rho}$ of the three $B \to \bar{D} \rho$ decay modes agree well with the LHCb measurements within one standard deviation.
