We discuss non-Gaussianity and baryonic isocurvature fluctuations in the curvaton scenario, assuming that the baryon asymmetry of the universe originates only from the decay products of the inflaton. When large non-Gaussianity is realized in such a scenario, non-vanishing baryonic isocurvature fluctuations can also be generated unless the baryogenesis occurs after the decay of the curvaton. We calculate the non-linearity parameter f_NL and the baryonic isocurvature fluctuations, taking account of the primordial fluctuations of both the inflaton and the curvaton. We show that, although current constraints on isocurvature fluctuations are severe, the non-linearity parameter can be large as f_NL \sim O(10-100) without conflicting with the constraints.
