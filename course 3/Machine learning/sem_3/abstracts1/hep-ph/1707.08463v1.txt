We present results from a calculation of the electromagnetic transition form factors between ground-state octet and decuplet baryons as well as the octet-only $\Sigma^0$ to $\Lambda$ transition. We work in the combined framework of Dyson-Schwinger equations and covariant Bethe-Salpeter equations with all elements, the baryon three body wave function, the quark propagators and the dressed quark-photon vertex determined from a well-established, momentum dependent approximation for the quark-gluon interaction. We discuss in particular the similarities among the different transitions as well as the differences induced by SU(3)-isospin symmetry breaking. We furthermore provide estimates for the slopes of the electric and magnetic $\Sigma^0$ to $\Lambda$ transitions at the zero photon momentum point.
