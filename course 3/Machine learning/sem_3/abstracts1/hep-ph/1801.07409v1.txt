If the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is already broken during inflation, the decay constant $F_a$ of the axion can be in a wide region from $10^{11}$ GeV to $10^{18}$ GeV for the axion being the dominant dark matter. In this letter we point out that the allowed region of the decay constant $F_a$ is reduced to a rather narrow region for a given tensor-to-scalar ration $r$. For example, if the ratio $r$ is determined as $r \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ in future measurements, we can predict $F_a \simeq (0.1-1.4)\times 10^{12}$ GeV for domain wall number $N_\text{DW}=6$.
