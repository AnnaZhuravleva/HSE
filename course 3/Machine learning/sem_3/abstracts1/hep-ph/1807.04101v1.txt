Form factors of the rare $\Lambda_{b}(\Lambda_{b}^*)\to N\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ decays are calculated in the framework of the light cone QCD sum rules by taking into account of the contributions from the negative parity baryons. Using the obtained results on the form factors, the branching ratios of the considered decays are estimated. The numerical survey for the branching ratios of the $\Lambda_b \rar N\ell^+\ell^- $ and $\Lambda_b^\ast \rar N\ell^+\ell^- $ decays indicate that these transitions could be measurable in LHCb in near future. Comparison of our predictions on the form factors and branching ratios with those existing in the literature is also performed.
