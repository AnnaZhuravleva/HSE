We show that a modification of the model with a low energy scalar leptoquark state carrying hypercharge $Y=7/6$ allows to accommodate both $R_K<1$ and $R_{K^\ast}<1$, through loop effects, consistent with recent observations made at LHCb. We describe details of the model, compute the relevant Wilson coefficient and, after discussing a number of constraints, we examine the phenomenological consequences of the model. The bounds on the lepton flavor violating decay rates, induced by this model, include $\mathcal{B}(Z\to\mu\tau) \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, and $\mathcal{B}(B\to K\mu\tau) \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$. We also comment on the interpretation of the bounds on the leptoquark mass obtained from the direct searches at LHC.
