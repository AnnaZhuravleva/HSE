We investigate the sensitivity of IceCube(-Gen2) to a scalar leptoquark scenario with couplings only to heavy quark flavors which may be connected to solving discrepancies in $B$-meson semileptonic decays. We take into account, for the first time, the non-negligible neutrino-gluon cross section induced by leptoquarks, and we systematically account for indirect and direct constraints which have been overlooked in previous studies. We conclude that IceCube(-Gen2) can only probe the light LQ regime, already disfavored by the combination of flavor physics constraints, electroweak precision data and the direct searches at the LHC.
