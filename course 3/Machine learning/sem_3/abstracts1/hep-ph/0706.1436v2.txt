Inflationary models with a superheavy scale F-term hybrid inflation followed by an intermediate scale modular inflation are considered. The restrictions on the power spectrum P_R of curvature perturbation and the spectral index n_s from the recent data within the power-law cosmological model with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant can be met provided that the number of e-foldings N_HI* suffered by the pivot scale k_*=0.002/Mpc during hybrid inflation is suitably restricted. The additional e-foldings needed for solving the horizon and flatness problems are generated by modular inflation with a string axion as inflaton. For central values of P_R and n_s, the grand unification scale comes out, in the case of standard hybrid inflation, close to its supersymmetric value M_GUT=2.86 x 10^16 GeV, the relevant coupling constant is relatively large (0.005-0.14), and N_HI* is between 10 and 21.7. In the shifted [smooth] hybrid inflation case, the grand unification scale can be identified with M_GUT for N_HI*=21 [N_HI*=18].
