If dark matter stems from the background of a very light gauge boson, this gauge boson could exert forces on test masses in gravitational wave detectors, resulting in displacements with a characteristic frequency set by the gauge boson mass. We outline a novel search strategy to hunt for such dark matter, and show that both ground-based and future space-based gravitational wave detectors have the capability to make a 5$\sigma$ discovery in unexplored parameter regimes.
