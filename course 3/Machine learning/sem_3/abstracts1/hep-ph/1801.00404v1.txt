Using the effective Lagrangian approach, we examine the recently observed charm states $D^{*}_{J}(2460)$, $D_{J}(2560)$, $D_{J}(2740)$, $D_{J}(3000)$ and their spin partners $D^{*}_{J}(2680)$, $D^{*}_{J}(2760)$ and $D^{*}_{J}(3000)$ with $J^{P}$ states $1P_{\frac{3}{2}}2^{+}$, $2S_{\frac{1}{2}}0^{-}$, $1D_{\frac{5}{2}}2^{-}$, $2P_{\frac{1}{2}}1^{+}$ and $2S_{\frac{1}{2}}1^{-}$, $1D_{\frac{5}{2}}3^{-}$, $2P_{\frac{1}{2}}0^{+}$ respectively. We study their two body strong decays, coupling constants and branching ratios with the emission of light pseudo-scalar mesons $(\pi, \eta, K)$. We also analyze the newly observed charm state $D^{*}_{2}(3000)$ and suggest it to be either $1F(2^{+})$ or $2P(2^{+})$ state and justify one of them to be the most favorable assignment for $D^{*}_{2}(3000)$. We study the partial and the total decay width of unobserved states $D(1^{1}F_{3})$, $D_{s}(1 ^{1}F_{3})$ and $D_{s}(1 ^{1}F_{2})$ as the spin and the strange partners of the $D^{*}_{2}(3000)$ charmed meson. The branching ratios and the coupling constants $g_{TH}$, $\widetilde{g}_{HH}$, $g_{YH}$, $\widetilde{g}_{SH}$ and $g_{ZH}$ calculated in this work can be confronted with the future experimental data.
