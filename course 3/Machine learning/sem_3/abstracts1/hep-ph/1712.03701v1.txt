In this contribution we report on the perturbative determination of $\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions for the chiral Ising, chiral XY and chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model around $D=4$ dimensions at four loops and the first Pad\'e extrapolation of critical exponents at non-trivial, infrared stable fixed points to $D=3$ to this order. This talk is based on Ref. [Zerf:2017zqi].
