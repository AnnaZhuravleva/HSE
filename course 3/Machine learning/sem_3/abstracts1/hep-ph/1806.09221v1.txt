New physics beyond the Standard Model could appear as non-standard interactions (NSI) between neutrinos and matter at long baseline experiments. This would make determination of the CP-violating phase $\delta_{13}$ ambiguous due to interference with additional complex phases. In this work we show how plots in biprobabiliity space provide a useful way to represent CP phase degeneracies for nonzero $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ and $\epsilon_{e\tau}$, and the extent to which the energy spectrum can help resolve them. In particular, numerical and analytic results show how NSI can increase or reduce the amount of apparent CP violation, and shifting the energy from the oscillation maximum can separate degenerate probabilities along the CP-conserving direction of biprobability space. Phase degeneracies and their breaking can be characterized in a way that depends on both $\delta_{13}$ and the sum $\delta_{13} + \delta_{e\mu}$ or $\delta_{13} + \delta_{e\tau}$. Finally, we point out some implications of this work for the experimental hints that suggest $\delta_{13} \sim -\pi/2$.
