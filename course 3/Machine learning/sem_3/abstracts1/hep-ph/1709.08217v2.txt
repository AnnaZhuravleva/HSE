Encouraged by recent discovery of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ baryon, we investigate two body non-leptonic weak decays of doubly charmed, $\Xi_{cc}$, baryons. We calculate the branching ratios for CKM-favored and suppressed modes in factorization and pole model approach. We give the first estimates of nonfactorizable W-exchange contributions using pole model. We find that W-exchange contributions to $\Xi_{cc}$ decays being sizable can not be ignored.
