Higgs bosons pair production is well known for its sensitivity to probing the sign and size of Higgs boson self coupling, providing a way to determine whether there is an extended Higgs sector. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model extends the Standard Model (SM) with an $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar field that has one real and one complex components. The Higgs self coupling now has a wider range than that in the SM, with even the possibility of a sign flip. The new heavy singlet Higgs boson $H^{0}_{1}$ can contribute to s-channel production of the $hh$ pairs. In this work, we study non-resonant/resonant Higgs boson pair productions $p p \rightarrow hh$ and $p p \rightarrow H^{0}_{1} \rightarrow hh$, focusing exclusively on the contribution of $H^0_1$. We show the sensitivity for Higgs boson pair production searches at the 13-TeV LHC with the luminosities of $3.2,\ 30$ and $100$~fb$^{-1}$.
