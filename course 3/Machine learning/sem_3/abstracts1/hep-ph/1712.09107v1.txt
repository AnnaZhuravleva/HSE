The physics of heavy quarks becomes a very reach area of study thanks to an excellent operation of hadron colliders and $B$-factories and exciting results from them. Experimental data obtained allows to get some information about the heavy hadron dynamics. In this case, the models for the heavy hadron wave-functions are required to do theoretical predictions for concrete processes under study. In many cases, the light-cone description is enough to obtain theoretical estimates for heavy hadron decays. A discussion of the wave-functions of the $B$-meson and heavy bottom baryons in terms of the light-cone distribution amplitudes is given in this paper. Simple models for the distribution amplitudes are presented and their scale dependence is discussed. Moments of the distribution amplitudes which are entering the branching fractions of radiative, leptonic and semileptonic $B$-mesons decays are also briefly discussed.
