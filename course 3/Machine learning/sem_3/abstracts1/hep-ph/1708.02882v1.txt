The prospects of measuring the Higgs CP mixing angle with $h\to\tau\tau$ decays at the LHC is presented. The analysis is based on a new method used to reconstruct the neutrino from tau decay with high precision, and a matrix element based method used to extract the best sensitivity to the Higgs CP. All major hadronic tau decay modes are included. It is predicted, based on a detailed detector simulation, that with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, a significant improvement of the measurement of the CP mixing angle to a precision of $6.9^\circ$ can be achieved at the LHC.
