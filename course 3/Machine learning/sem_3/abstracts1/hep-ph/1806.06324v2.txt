In this work the low energy kaon-hyperon interaction is studied with nonlinear chiral invariant Lagragians considering kaons, hyperons, and the corresponding resonances in the intermediary states. We show the basic formalism to calculate the total cross sections, angular distributions in the center-of-mass frame of reference, and some diagrams of interest.
