A light baryon is viewed as $N_c$ valence quarks bound by meson mean fields in the large $N_c$ limit. In much the same way a singly heavy baryon is regarded as $N_c-1$ valence quarks bound by the same mean fields, which makes it possible to use the properties of light baryons to investigate those of the heavy baryons. A heavy quark being regarded as a static color source in the limit of the infinitely heavy quark mass, the magnetic moments of the heavy baryon are determined entirely by the chiral soliton consisting of a light-quark pair. The magnetic moments of the baryon sextet are obtained by using the parameters fixed in the light-baryon sector. In this mean-field approach, the numerical results of the magnetic moments of the baryon sextet with spin $3/2$ are just 3/2 larger than those with spin $1/2$. The magnetic moments of the bottom baryons are the same as those of the corresponding charmed baryons.
