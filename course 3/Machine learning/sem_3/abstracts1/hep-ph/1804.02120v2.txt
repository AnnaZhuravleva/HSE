In this work we numerically re-examine the loop-induced WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for the simplified dark matter models and the constraint set by the latest direct detection experiment. We consider a fermion, scalar or vector dark matter component from five simplified models with leptophobic spin-0 mediators coupled only to Standard Model quarks and dark matter particles. The tree-level WIMP-nucleon cross sections in these models are all momentum-suppressed. We calculate the non-suppressed spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections from loop diagrams and investigate the constrained space of dark matter mass and mediator mass by Xenon1T. The constraints from indirect detection and collider search are also discussed.
