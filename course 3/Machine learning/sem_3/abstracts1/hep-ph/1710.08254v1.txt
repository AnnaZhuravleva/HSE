In an Euclidean SU(2) $\otimes$ U(1) gauge theory without fermions, we identify scalar-field variables, functionals of the gauge fields and coming in different representations of isospin, which (i) are of mass dimension one in $d=4$, (ii) couple to their parent gauge fields through suitable gauge-covariant derivatives, and (iii) can be endowed with a hypercharge despite their parents having none. They can be interpreted as projections of the gauge vectors onto an orthonormal basis that is defined by the fields themselves. We inquire as to whether these scalars can perform the usual tasks, normally fulfilled by external scalar fields, of spontaneous symmetry breaking and mass generation through vacuum expectation values. The gauge Lagrangian, expressed in terms of these scalars, automatically has quartic and cubic terms; an extra coupling constant for quartic scalar self-interactions is not needed. There are nine massive Higgs particles, a neutral triplet at a mass of $m_Z \sqrt{2} \,\approx \, 129$ GeV, and three pairs of conjugate charged ones at $m_W \sqrt{2} \, \approx \, 114$ GeV; another triplet of neutrals remains massless. On the other hand among the four scalars populating the potential-energy minimum, there are now two electrically neutral fields capable of forming VEVs; the ratio between the latter is a new and unknown parameter. Formation of the heavy-vector masses is then possible, but the derivation is less predictive than in the standard scenario. It also requires a somewhat more elaborate mixing pattern in defining the physical, charged and neutral vector fields.
