Collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino self interaction inside core-collapse supernovae have now been shown to bring drastic changes in the resultant neutrino fluxes. This would in turn significantly affect the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB), created by all core-collapse supernovae that have exploded in the past. In view of these collective effects, we re-analyze the potential of detecting the DSNB in currently running and planned large-scale detectors meant for detecting both electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. The next generation detectors should be able to observe DSNB fluxes. Under certain conducive conditions, one could learn about neutrino parameters. For instance, it might be possible to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, even if theta_{13} is almost zero.
