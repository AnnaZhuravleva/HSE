We describe the inclusion of the photon as an additional component of the proton's Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in the MMHT framework. The input for the photon is adopted from the recent LUXqed determination. We describe the similarities and differences above the input scale with other photon PDF determinations and the contributions to the MMHT photon from both leading twist and higher twist contributions, and their uncertainties. We study the impact of QED effects on the quark and gluon PDFs and the fit quality, and outline our development of an equivalent set of neutron PDFs.
