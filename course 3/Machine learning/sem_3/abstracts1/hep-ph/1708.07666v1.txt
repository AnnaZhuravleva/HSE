The nonleptonic two-body $B^{\ast}$ ${\to}$ $\bar{D}D$ weak decays are studied phenomenologically with the perturbative QCD factorization approach. It is found that the $B_{s}^{{\ast}0}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}^{-}D_{s}^{+}$, $B_{d}^{{\ast}0}$ ${\to}$ $D_{d}^{-}D_{s}^{+}$, and $B_{u}^{{\ast}+}$ ${\to}$ $\bar{D}_{u}^{0}D_{s}^{+}$ decays have branching ratios ${\gtrsim}$ $10^{-9}$, and might be promisingly measurable at the running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB experiments in the future.
