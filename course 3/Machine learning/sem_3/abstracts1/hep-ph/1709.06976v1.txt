I present theoretical calculations for charged Higgs production in association with a $W$ boson via bottom quark annihilation. I discuss higher-order radiative corrections from collinear and soft gluon emission and show that they are important. I present theoretical results for total cross sections, and for transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions of the charged Higgs boson at LHC energies.
