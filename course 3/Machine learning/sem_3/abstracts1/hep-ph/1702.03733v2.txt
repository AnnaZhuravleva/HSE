We study a radiative seesaw model at one-loop level with a flavor dependent gauge symmetry $U(1)_{\mu-\tau}$, in which we consider bosonic dark matter. We also analyze the constraints from lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$, relic density of dark matter, and collider physics, and carry out numerical analysis to search for allowed parameter region which satisfy all the constraints and to investigate some predictions. Furthermore we find that a simple but adhoc hypothesis induces specific two zero texture with inverse mass matrix, which provides us several predictions such as a specific pattern of Dirac CP phase.
