The standard implementation of the HRG model has been shown to be unable to describe all the available data on QCD matter. Here we show the balance of repulsive and attractive hadronic interactions on QCD thermodynamics through observables both calculated by lattice simulations and measured in experiment. Attractive interactions are mediated by resonance formation, which are here implemented through extra states predicted by the Quark Model, while repulsive interactions are modelled by means of Excluded Volume (EV) effects. Informations on flavour dependent effective sizes are extracted. It is found that EV effects are present in lattice QCD thermodynamics, and are essential for a comprehensive description of higher order fluctuations of conserved charges.
