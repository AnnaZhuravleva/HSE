Inspired by the report of D0 Collaboration on the state $X(5568)$ with four different flavors, a similar state, $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$ is investigated in the present work. The advantage of looking for this state over the state $X(5568)$ with quark contents, $bu\bar{d}\bar{s}$ or $bd\bar{u}\bar{s}$, is that the $BK$ threshold is 270 MeV higher than that of $B_s \pi$, and it allows a large mass region for $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$ to be stable. The chiral quark model and Gaussian expansion method are employed to do the calculations of four-quark states $ud\bar{s}\bar{b}$ with quantum numbers $IJ^{P}$($I=0,1;~ J=0,1,2;~P=+$). Two structures, diquark-antidiquark and meson-meson, with all possible color configurations are considered. The results indicate that energies of the tetraquark with diquark-antiquark configuration are all higher than the threshold of $BK$, but for the state of $IJ^P=00^+$ in the meson-meson structure, the energies are below the corresponding thresholds, where the color channel coupling plays an important role. The distances between two objects (quark/antiquark) show that the state is a molecular one.
