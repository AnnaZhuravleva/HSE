In the present paper, we investigate regularization of the one-loop quantum corrections with infinite Kaluza-Klein (KK) states and evaluate Casimir vacuum energy from extra dimensions. The extra dimensional models always involve the infinite massless or massive KK states, and therefore, the regularization of the infinite KK corrections is highly problematic. In order to avoid the ambiguity, we adopt the proper time integrals and the Riemann zeta function regularization in evaluating the summations of infinite KK states. In the calculation, we utilized the dimensional regularization method without exchanging the summations and the loop integrals. At the same time, we also evaluate the correction by the KK regularization method. Then, we clearly show that the regularized Casimir corrections from the KK states have the form of $\propto 1/R^2$ for the Higgs mass and $\propto 1/R^4$ for the cosmological constant, where $R$ is the compactification radius. We also evaluate the Casimir energy in supersymmetric extra-dimensional models. The contributions from bulk fermions and bulk bosons are not offset because the general boundary conditions break the supersymmetry. The non-zero supersymmetric Casimir corrections from extra dimensions undoubtedly contribute to the Higgs mass and the cosmological constant. We conclude such corrections are enhanced compared to the case without bulk supersymmetry.
