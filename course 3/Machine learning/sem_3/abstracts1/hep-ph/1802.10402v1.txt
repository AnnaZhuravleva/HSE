We prove that the SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes SU(3)_R \otimes U(1)_X (3-2-3-1) gauge model always contains a matter parity W_P = (-1)^{3(B-L)+2s} as conserved residual gauge symmetry, where B-L = 2(\beta T_{8R}+X) is a SU(3)_R \otimes U(1)_X charge. Due to the non-Abelian nature of B-L, the W-odd and W-even fields are actually unified in gauge multiplets. We investigate two viable versions for dark matter according to \beta = \pm1/\sqrt{3}, where the dark matter candidates can be fermion, scalar, or vector fields. We figure out the parameter spaces in the allowed regions of the relic density and direct detection cross-sections. Additionally, we examine the neutrino masses induced by the seesaw mechanism along with associated lepton flavor violation processes. The new gauge boson searches at the LEPII and LHC are discussed.
