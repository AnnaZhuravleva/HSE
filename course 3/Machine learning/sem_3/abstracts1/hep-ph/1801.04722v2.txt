The dynamics of fermion generations is treated in the framework of the fractional Lagrangian and Hamiltonian in the compact extra dimension. The resulting spectra for u, d, e generations are described by the only mass parameter and slightly different fractional numbers, while the neutrino spectra need another mass parameter and a single fractional number for all neutrino species. New definitions of CKM and PMNS mixing matrices with standard data are given as the interference integrals in the extra dimension. A possibility of higher fermion states as dark matter candidates is shortly discussed.
