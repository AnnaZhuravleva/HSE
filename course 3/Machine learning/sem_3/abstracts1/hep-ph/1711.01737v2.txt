Using a non-perturbative quantization method originally due to Heisenberg we obtain {\it quantum} monopole solutions and {\it quantum} flux tube solutions for the SU(3) strong interaction gauge theory. For the quantum monopole solution we find that the radial chromomagnetic field decreases exponentially with a scale set by the effective gluon mass. The quantum flux tube solution stretches between a monopole and anti-monopole and has a longitudinal chromomagnetic field. Both solutions exhibit characteristics of the Meissner effect and are conjectured to have a connection to the confinement phenomenon.
