Assuming an existence of an anomalous triple electro-weak bosons interaction being defined by coupling constant $\lambda$, we calculate its contribution to interactions of the Higgs with pairs of heavy particles. Bearing in mind experimental restrictions $-0.011 < \lambda < 0.011$ we present results for possible effects in processes $p\,p \to W^+ W^- H,\,p\,p \to W^+ Z H,\,p\,p \to W^- Z H,\,p\,p \to \bar t t H $, $p p \to \bar b b H$. Effects could be significant with negative sign of $\lambda$ in associated heavy quarks $t,\,b$ pairs production with the Higgs. In calculations we rely on results of the non-perturbative approach to a spontaneous generation of effective interactions, which defines the form-factor of the three-boson anomalous interaction.
