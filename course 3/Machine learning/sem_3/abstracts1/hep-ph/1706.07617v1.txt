We generalized our model for the description of hard processes, and calculate the value of the azimuthal angle correlations ( Fourier harmonics $v_n$ ), for proton-proton scattering.The energy and multiplicity independence, as well as the value of $v_n$, turn out the be in accord with the experimental data, or slightly larger.   Therefore, before making extreme assumptions on proton-proton collisions, such as the production of quark-gluon plasma in the large multiplicity events, we need to explain how these effect theBose-Einstein correlations which are so large, that have to be taken into account, and which are able to describe the angular correlations in proton-proton collisions, without including final state interactions
