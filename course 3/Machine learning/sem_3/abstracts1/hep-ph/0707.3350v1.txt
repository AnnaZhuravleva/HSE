In this brief review we will discuss how a well motivated particle theory beyond the eletroweak Standard Model provides ingredients and conditions for a successful inflation. We will mainly focus on a low energy supersymmetric Standard Model which provides plenty of scalars. In particular, these scalars span a multidimensional moduli space of {\it gauge invariant} operators which carry the Standard Model charges. The inflationary predictions which matches the current observations are robust due to the fact that inflation occurs within our own gauge sector where the couplings are well known. We further argue that based on our current understandings if there exists a {\it string landscape} of multiple vacua, then it is very natural that the last phase of inflation would be driven by one of the many supersymmetric Standard Model modulii. Only such a graceful exit from inflation would provide hot thermal Standard Model baryons, cold dark matter, conditions for baryogenesis and foremost the seed density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background radiation in just {\it one package}. Furthermore we will also discuss how some of the ingredients of inflation can be tested already by the LHC.
