We explore the possibility to explain the monochromatic Fermi-LAT anomaly at 42.7 GeV dark matter mass in the framework of radiatively induced neutrino mass model at two level. Here we prepare the Zee-Babu type scenario with $Z_3$ discrete symmetry, in which we consider the neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor violations, muon $g-2$, and bosonic dark matter candidate. A $\mu-e$ conversion rate, which can be tested in the near future experiment such as PRISM/PRIME, is estimated and its allowed range is shown through the global analysis.
