A new method for model-independent measurement of the CKM angle $\beta$ is proposed, that employs time-dependent analysis of flavour-tagged $B^0\to D\pi^+\pi^-$ decays with $D$ meson decays into CP-specific and~$K_S^0\pi^+\pi^-$ final states. This method can be used to measure the angle $\beta$ with future data from the Belle II and LHCb experiments with the precision level of one degree.
