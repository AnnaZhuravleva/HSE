In this paper, we investigate the noval possibilities of hybrid textures comprising a vanishing minor (or element) and two equal elements (or cofactors) in light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$. Such type of texture structures lead to sixty phenomenological cases each, out of which only fifty six are viable with texture containing a vanishing minor and an equality between the elements in $M_{\nu}$, while fifty are found to be viable with texture containing a vanishing element and an equality of cofactors in $M_{\nu}$ under the current experimental test at 3$\sigma$ confidence level. Detailed numerical analysis of all the possible cases have been presented.
