With the QCD sum rule approach, we study the newly discovered doubly heavy baryon $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$. We analytically calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) contribution of perturbative part of $J^{P} = \frac{1}{2}^{+}$ baryon current with two identical heavy quarks, and then reanalyze the mass of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ at the NLO level. We find that the NLO correction significantly improves both scheme dependence and scale dependence, while it is hard to control these theoretical uncertainties at leading order (LO). With NLO contribution, the obtained mass is $m_{\Xi_{cc}^{++}} = 3.67_{-0.10}^{+0.09} \text{~GeV}$, which is consistent with the LHCb measurement.
