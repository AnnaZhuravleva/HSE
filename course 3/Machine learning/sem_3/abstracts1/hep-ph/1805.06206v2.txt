In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) the lightest superparticle (LSP) can be a TeV neutralino (mainly dominated by higgsino or wino) which serves as a dark matter candidate with correct thermal relic density. In this work we confront the 1-2 TeV neutralino dark matter with the latest direct and indirect detections from PandaX and AMS-02/DAMPE. Considering various scenarios with decoupled sfermions, with \textit{A}-mediated annihilation, with squark or stop coannihilation, we find that the parameter space is stringently constrained by the direct detection limits. In the allowed parameter space, the TeV neutralino dark matter annihilation contribution to the anti-proton flux is found to agree with the AMS-02 data while its contribution to eletron/positron flux is too small to cause any visible excess. The current survived parameter space can be mostly covered by the future direct detection experiment LZ7.2T.
