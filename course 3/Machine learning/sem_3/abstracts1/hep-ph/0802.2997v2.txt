It is argued that a well measured double neutron star binary in which the two neutron stars are more than 4% different from each other in mass or a massive neutron star with mass M > 2 M_sun would put in serious doubt or simply falsify the following chain of predictions: (1) nearly vanishing vector meson mass at chiral restoration, (2) kaon condensation at a density n ~ 3 n_0, (3) the Brown-Bethe maximum neutron star mass M_max ~ 1.5 M_sun and (4) Smolin's `Cosmological Natural Selection' hypothesis.
