A recent cosmological bound on the gravitino mass, $m_{3/2}<4.7$ eV, together with LHC results on the Higgs mass and direct searches, excludes minimal gauge mediation with high reheating temperatures. We discuss a minimal, vector-mediated model which incorporates the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses, allows for thermal leptogenesis, ameliorates the $\mu$ problem, and achieves the observed Higgs mass and a gravitino as light as $1$-$2$ eV.
