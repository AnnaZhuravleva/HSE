The hypothesis of the new stable heavy hadrons existence is proposed which follows from Cosmic rays physics indirect data. It is shown that the hypothesis does not contradict Cosmochemical data, Cosmological test and the restrictions on New Physics effects. This conclusion is based on the most important property of the new hadrons - repulsion strong interaction with nucleons at large distance asymptote. This effect is substantiated theoretically in the framework of the low-energy hadron interaction model. Some extensions of Standard Model is considered where new stable and metastable quarks appear.
