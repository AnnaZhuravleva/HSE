We apply data taken at the $e^+e^-$ collider LEP in the 1990's at center-of-mass energy up to 209 GeV to constrain Dark Matter models with a light leptophobic spin-1 mediator $R$. We assume that the dark sector particle (DSP) is a spin-1/2 fermion $\chi$. This scenario is well studied in the context of LHC searches for mediator mass from 100 GeV to several TeV. Emission of the mediator off a quark or antiquark at LEP gives rise to di-jet plus missing energy and 4-jet signatures, which we use to limit the relevant couplings. We focus on scenarios with $2 m_\chi > m_R$, which are poorly constrained by LHC data. We recast published searches by the ALEPH collaboration. For $m_\chi < 20$ GeV the best bounds result from an analysis at $\sqrt{s} \simeq M_Z$ of di-jet plus missing energy events. For heavier DSP but $m_R < 70$ GeV meaningful bounds can be derived from a four jet analysis at $\sqrt{s} = 183$ GeV. Unfortunately published searches using four jet final states at $\sqrt{s} \simeq M_Z$ use only a small fraction of the total data sample. Moreover, all published searches for di-jet plus missing energy final states at $\sqrt{s} \geq 130$ GeV have poor efficiency for our model; we therefore design new cuts that combine good background rejection with higher efficiency. Re-analyzing the higher energy data using our new cuts, and an analysis of the complete four jet data sample taken at $\sqrt{s}\simeq M_Z$, can explore new regions of parameter space.
