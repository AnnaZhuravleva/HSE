We consider effective theory treatment for the lowest-lying $S$- and $P$-wave states of charmed mesons. In our analysis, quantum corrections and contributions from leading chiral and heavy quark symmetry breakings are taken into account. The heavy meson mass expressions have abundance parameters, low-energy constants, in comparison to the measured charmed mesons masses. The experimental and lattice QCD data on charmed meson spectroscopy are used to extract, for the first time, the numerical values of the full set of low-energy constants of the effective chiral Lagrangian. Our results on these parameters can be used for applications on other properties of heavy-light meson systems.
