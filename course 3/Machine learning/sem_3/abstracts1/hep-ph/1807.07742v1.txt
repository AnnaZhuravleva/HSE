It is shown that the diagonalization of the axial-vector -- pseudoscalar transitions in the effective meson Lagrangian in presence of electromagnetic interactions leads to a deviation from the vector meson dominance picture which usually arises in the Nambu - Jona-Lasinio model. The essential features of such modification of the theory are studied. Some important examples are considered in detail.
