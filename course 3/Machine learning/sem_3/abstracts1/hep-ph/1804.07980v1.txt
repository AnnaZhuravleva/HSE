Recently, transport coefficients viz. shear viscosity, electrical conductivity of strongly interacting matter produced in heavy-ion collisions have drawn considerable interest. We study the normalised electrical conductivity ($\sigma_{\rm el}$/T) of hot QCD matter as a function of temperature (T) at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies within the Color String Percolation Model (CSPM). We also study the temperature dependence of shear viscosity to electrical conductivity ratio for the QCD matter. We compare CSPM results with various existing results and lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (lQCD) predictions with (2+1) dynamical flavours. We find that $\sigma_{\rm el}$/T in CSPM varies with the temperature in a similar way as observed in lQCD but does not explain the lQCD data quantitatively. CSPM results are close to that obtained in Parton Hadron String Dynamics (PHSD) model.
