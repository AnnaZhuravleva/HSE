In this letter, we present LHC limits on the minimal universal extra dimension (MUED) model from LHC Run 1 data and current limits from searches of the ongoing Run 2. Typical collider signals of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) states mimic generic degenerate supersymmetry (SUSY) missing transverse momentum signatures since the excited KK particles cascade decay to jets, leptons and the lightest KK particle which is stable due to KK parity and thus evades detection. We test the parameter space against a large number of supersymmetry based missing energy searches implemented in the public code CheckMATE. We demonstrate the complementarity of employing various searches which target a large number of final state signatures, and we derive the most up to date limits on the MUED parameter space from 13 TeV SUSY searches.
