In this paper, we consider the possibility that Y(4260), Y(4360), $ \psi(4415) $ or X(4660) is the ground state or the first excited state of a hybrid charmonium, and examine whether $ \Upsilon ( 10860) $ is the ground state or the first excited state of a hybrid bottomonium. Under a constituent quark model, we carry out numerical calculations to obtain the spectra of both electric-gluon and magnetic-gluon hybrid quarkonia. We see that the ground state of a magnetic-gluon hybrid charmonium and the first excited state of an electric-gluon hybrid are comparable in energy to $ \psi(4415) $, and that the first excited states of an electric-gluon hybrid bottomonium and the ground state of an magnetic-gluon hybrid appear a few hundred MeV above the mass of $ \Upsilon (10860 ) $. Also, we evaluate the widths of the decays of a hybrid charmonium into $D^{(*)} \bar{D^{(*) } } $ and those of a hybrid bottomonium into $ B^{(*) } \bar{B^{(* ) } } $. We show that if the exotic meson candidates are hybrid charmonia, then they are magnetic-gluon ones, and argue that it seems unlikely that $ \Upsilon (10860) $ is the ground state of an electric-gluon hybrid bottomonium.
