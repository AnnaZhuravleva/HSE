Signature of heavier charged Higgs boson, much above the top quark mass, is investigated at the LHC Run 2 experiments, following its decay mode via top and bottom quark focusing on both hadronic and leptonic signal final states. The generic two Higgs doublet model framework is considered with a special emphasis on supersymmetry motivated Type II model. The signal is found to heavily affected by the huge irreducible backgrounds due to the top pair production and QCD events. The jet substructure technique is used to tag moderately boosted top jets in order to reconstruct charged Higgs mass. The simple cut based analysis is performed optimizing various kinematic selections, and the signal sensitivity is found to be reasonable for only lower range of charged Higgs masses for very high luminosity 3000 fb$^{-1}$ option. However, employing the multi-variate analysis(MVA) technique, a remarkable improvement in signal sensitivity is achieved. We find, the charged Higgs signal for the mass range about $300-600$ is observable with 1000 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity option. However, for more high luminosity option 3000 fb$^{-1}$, the discovery potential can be extended to $700-800$ GeV.
