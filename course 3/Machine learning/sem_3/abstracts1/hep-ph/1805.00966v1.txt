The program N2HDECAY calculates the branching ratios and decay widths of the Higgs bosons of the Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM). The code incorporates the dominant higher-order effects by including QCD corrections and off-shell decay modes. The N2HDM is an extension of the Standard Model by a Higgs doublet and a real Higgs singlet. Its phenomenology can change dramatically depending on which global symmetries are broken by electroweak symmetry breaking. It can feature a large visible Higgs sector in the broken phase, behave like a 2HDM with scalar singlet dark matter in the dark singlet phase, or, in the inert doublet phase, extend an inert doublet model by mixing a singlet with the SM Higgs boson. N2HDECAY provides precise predictions for the decays of the Higgs bosons in all of these phases.
