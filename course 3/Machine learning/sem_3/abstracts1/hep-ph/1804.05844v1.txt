Motivated by possible scalar-leptoquark explanations of the recently reported $B$-decay anomalies, we investigate whether the required leptoquarks can be accommodated within models based on noncommutative geometry (NCG). The models considered have the gauge structure of Pati-Salam models, $SU(4)\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$, with gauge coupling unification at a single scale. In one of the models, we find a unique scalar leptoquark $H_{3L}(3,1,-\frac{1}{3})_{321}$, originating from the multiplet $H_L(6,1,1)_{422}$, which can potentially explain the $B$-decay anomalies if its mass is on the order of a few TeV. The unification of couplings can be realized with the inclusion of a single step of intermediate symmetry breaking. The scalar leptoquark under consideration does not contribute to proton decay due to the absence of its diquark couplings, as dictated by the underlying noncommutative geometry.
