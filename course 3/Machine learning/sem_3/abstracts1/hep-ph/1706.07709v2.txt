We have theoretically investigated the finite system size effect of hadronic matter on its transport coefficients like shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and electrical conductivity. We have used a Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model to calculate the thermodynamical quantities like entropy density, speed of sound and also the above transport coefficients. All these quantities are found to be sensitive to finite system size effects of hadronic matter. The effect of finite system size is found to be more when the system is at low temperatures and gets reduced at high temperatures. Owing to the intimate linking between system size and centrality, we have presented the centrality dependence of transport coefficients. We have also explored to link of our results with the macroscopic picture of hydrodynamical evolution.
