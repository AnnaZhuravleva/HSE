Diboson production at the LHC is a process of great importance both in the context of tests of the SM and for direct searches for new physics. In this paper we present a phenomenological study of WW, WZ, and ZZ production considering event selections of interest for the anomalous triple-gauge-boson-coupling searches at the LHC: we provide theoretical predictions within the Standard Model at NLO QCD and NLO EW accuracy and study the effect of the anomalous triple-gauge-boson interactions at NLO QCD. For WW and ZZ production, the contribution of the gluon-initiated loop-induced processes is included. Anomalous triple-gauge-boson interactions are parametrized in the EFT framework. This paper is the first application of RECOLA2 in the EFT context.
