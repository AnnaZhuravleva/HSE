It is widely known that the $ZH$ production channel provides a promising probe to the $H \to b\bar{b}$ decay at the LHC, when the Higgs and the $Z$ bosons are highly boosted along the transverse direction. Performing a realistic analysis, we show how information on the $Z$ boson polarization can relevantly improve the signal from background discrimination and help us to finally observe the largest Higgs boson branching ratio.
