In this paper, we develop a simple method for the reconstruction of the string-inspired dark energy model with the lagrangian $ {\cal L} = -V (\phi) \sqrt{1 - \alpha' {\nabla}_{\mu} \phi \nabla^{\mu} \phi + \beta' \phi \Box \phi} $ given by Cai et. al., which may allow the equation-of-state parameter cross the cosmological constant boundary $ (w=-1) $. We reconstruct this model in the light of three forms of parametrization for dynamical dark energy.
