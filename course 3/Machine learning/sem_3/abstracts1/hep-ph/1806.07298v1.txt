After briefly reviewing the status of the $B$-physics anomalies, describing the challenges of building a scenario of physics beyond the Standard Model that can accommodate the observed departures from lepton flavor universality, I discuss a new model, based on extending the Standard Model by two light [$\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{TeV})$] scalar leptoquarks. That model, in addition to satisfying a number of flavor physics constraints both at low and high energies, also allows for a $SU(5)$ unification.
