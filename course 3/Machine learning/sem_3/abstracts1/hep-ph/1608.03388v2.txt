We have calculated the in-medium magnetic moments of octet baryons in the presence of hot and dense symmetric nuclear matter. Effective magnetic moments of baryons have been derived from medium modified quark masses within chiral SU(3) quark mean field model.   Further, for better insight of medium modification of baryonic magnetic moments, we have considered the explicit contributions from the valence quarks, sea quarks as well as sea orbital angular momentum of sea quarks. These effects have been successful in giving the description of baryonic magnetic moments in vacuum.   The magnetic moments of baryons are found to vary significantly as a function of density of nuclear medium.
