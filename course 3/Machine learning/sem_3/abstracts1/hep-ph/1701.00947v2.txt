To explain the small neutrino masses, heavy Majorana neutrinos are introduced in the left-right twin Higgs model. The heavy neutrinos, together with the charged scalars and the heavy gauge bosons, may contribute large mixings between the neutrinos and the charged leptons, which may induce some distinct lepton flavor violating processes. We will check the \bar \ell_i \ell_j (i,j= e,\mu,\tau,i\neq j) productions in the \gamma\gamma collision in the left-right twin Higgs model, and find that the production rates may be large in some specific parameter space, in the optimal cases even possible to be detected with reasonable kinematical cuts. we have also shown that these collisions can constrain effectively the model parameters such as the Higgs vacuum expectation value and the right-handed neutrino mass, etc., and may serve as a sensitive probe of this new physics model.
