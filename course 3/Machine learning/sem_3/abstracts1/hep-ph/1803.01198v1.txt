We extend our previous studies of double-parton scattering (DPS) to simultaneous production of $c \bar c$ and $b \bar b$ and production of two pairs of $b \bar b$. The calculation is performed within factorized ansatz. Each parton scattering is calculated within $k_T$-factorization approach. The hadronization is done with the help of fragmentation functions. Production of $D$ mesons in our framework was tested in our previous works. Here we present our predictions for $B$ mesons. A good agreement is achieved with the LHCb data. We present our results for $c \bar c b \bar b$ and $b \bar b b \bar b$ final states. For completeness we compare results for double- and single-parton scattering (SPS). As for $c \bar c c \bar c$ final state also here the DPS dominates over the SPS, especially for small transverse momenta. We present several distributions and integrated cross sections with realistic cuts for simultaneous production of $D^0 B^+$ and $B^+ B^+$, suggesting future experimental studies at the LHC.
