Inspired by the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ state at Belle II, we investigate the two-body strong decays of $\Omega$ baryons up to $N=2$ shell within the chiral quark model. Our results indicate that: (i) the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ state could be assigned to the spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$ state $|70,^210,1,1,\frac{3}{2}^-\rangle$ and the experimental data can be reasonably described. However, the spin-parity $J^P=1/2^-$ state $|70,^210,1,1,\frac{1}{2}^-\rangle$ and spin-parity $J^P=3/2^+$ state $|56,^410,2,0,\frac{3}{2}^+\rangle$ can't be completely excluded. (ii) The $D$-wave states in the $N=2$ shell are most likely to be narrow states with a width of dozens of MeV and have a good potential to be observed in the $\Xi K$ and/or $\Xi(1530)K$ channels in future experiments. The $\Omega(2250)$ resonance listed in PDG may be a good candidate of the $J^P=5/2^+$ $1D$ wave state $|56,^410,2,2,5/2^+\rangle$.
