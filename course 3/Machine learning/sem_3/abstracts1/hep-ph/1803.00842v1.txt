We study a model with $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value of a singlet scalar field. In this model, a light $Z'$ boson plays a role in explaining anomalous muon $g-2$ via one-loop effect and a CP-even scalar boson $\phi$ with $\sim \mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV mass appears associated with the symmetry breaking. We investigate experimental constraints for $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge coupling, kinetic mixing, and mixing between the SM Higgs and $\phi$. Then collider physics is discussed considering $\phi$ production followed by decay process $\phi \to Z' Z'$ at the large hadron collider (LHC) and the international linear collider (ILC). In particular, we estimate discovery significance at the ILC taking into account relevant kinematical cut effects.
