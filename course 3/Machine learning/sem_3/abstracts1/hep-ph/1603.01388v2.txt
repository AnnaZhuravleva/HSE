We discuss possibilities of measuring CP violation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model by studying effects of one-loop generated $ZZZ$ and $ZWW$ vertices. We discuss a set of CP-sensitive asymmetries for $ZZ$ and $W^+W^-$ production at linear $e^+e^-$-colliders, that directly depends on the weak-basis invariant Im $J_2$ that parametrises the strength of CP violation. Given the restrictions on this model that follow from the LHC measurements, the predicted effects are small. Pursuing such measurements is however very important, as an observed signal might point to a richer scalar sector.
