An effective left-right symmetric mirror model restoring parity at a high scale in a unique way is proposed. One of the remarkable features is that mirror fermions and mirror gauge sector simultaneously can exist at TeV scale. We also provide a simple ultraviolet completion of the model with vector-like fermions. The model has implications for recently observed flavour anomalies in the quark-level $b \rightarrow s l \bar{l}$ transitions.
