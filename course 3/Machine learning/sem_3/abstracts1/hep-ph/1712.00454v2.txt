Lattice studies of QCD at temperatures above the chiral restoration and QCD with truncated low modes of the Dirac operator indicate approximate and explicit $SU(4)$ degeneracies in hadron spectra, respectively. At the same time, the QCD classical action and the path integral measure are not invariant under $SU(4)$. Here we investigate $SU(4)$ transformations in the continuum limit by deriving corresponding Ward identities. We show that, if there is a gap in low-lying modes of the Dirac operator the obtained $SU(4)$ Ward identities are simplified and look like they would be if $SU(4)$ symmetry is preserved. Then, we discuss possible consequences for the quark matter at high temperatures.
