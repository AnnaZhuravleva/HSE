Precise theoretical predictions are vital for the interpretation of Standard Model measurements and facilitate conclusive searches for New Physics phenomena at the LHC. In this contribution I highlight some of the ongoing efforts in the framework of the Sherpa event generator to provide accurate and realistic simulations of Standard Model production processes. This includes the automated evaluation of NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections and their consistent consideration in the parton-shower evolution of scattering events. Particular emphasis is given to examples and applications involving the production of top quarks.
