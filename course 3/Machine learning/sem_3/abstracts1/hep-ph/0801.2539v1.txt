Searches for supersymmetry are among the most exciting physics goals at Run II of the Tevatron. In particular, in supersymmetric models with light charginos, neutralinos and sleptons, associated chargino--neutralino production can potentially be observed as multi-lepton events with missing energy. We discuss how, in the generic TeV-scale MSSM, the prospects for these chargino-neutralino searches are impacted by cosmological considerations, namely the neutralino relic abundance and direct detection limits. We also discuss what an observation of chargino-neutralino production at the Tevatron would imply for the prospects of future direct dark matter searches without assuming specific patterns of supersymmetry breaking.
