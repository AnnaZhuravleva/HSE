With no conclusive signal till date of the minimal supersymmetric and extra dimensional models at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the issue of fine-tuning of the Higgs mass still calls for some attention. It could be very possible that the observed Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV has its origin in a non-supersymmetric extended scalar sector, and, it still has properties strikingly similar to the Standard Model Higgs. In such cases, however, one relies upon possible cancellations in the quadratic divergence of the Higgs mass to uphold naturalness. In this work, we have investigated this possibility in context of some two Higgs doublet and three Higgs doublet scenarios.
