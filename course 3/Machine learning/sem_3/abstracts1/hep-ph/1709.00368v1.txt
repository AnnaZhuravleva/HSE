These proceedings describe a computation of the large-$n_f$ terms contributing to the QCD splitting functions at the fourth order in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. Using the FORCER package for the reduction of four-loop two-point Feynman integrals, Mellin moments of the four-loop splitting functions have been computed. These moments are used to derive analytic Mellin-space expressions, by forming and finding solutions to systems of Diophantine equations. Expressions for the terms proportional to $n_f^3$ of the flavour singlet, and to $n_f^2$ of the flavour non-singlet splitting functions have been determined.
