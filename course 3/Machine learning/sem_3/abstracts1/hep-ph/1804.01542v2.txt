Neutrinos can gain mass from coupling to an ultralight field in slow roll. When such a field is displaced from its minimum, its vev acts just like the Higgs vev in spontaneous symmetry breaking. Although these masses may eventually vanish, they do it over a very long time. The theory is technically natural, with the ultralight field-dependent part being the right-handed Majorana mass. The mass variation induced by the field correlates with the cosmological evolution. The change of the mass term changes the mixing matrix, and therefore suppresses the fraction of sterile neutrinos at earlier times and increases it at later times. Since the issue of quantum gravity corrections to field theories with large field variations remains open, this framework may give an observational handle on the Weak Gravity Conjecture.
