We investigate the spectrum and decay rates of low lying charmonium states within the framework of the non relativistic quark model by employing a Coulomb like potential from the perturbative one gluon exchange and the linear confining potential along with the potential derived from instanton vacuum to account for the hyperfine mass splitting of charmonium states in variational approach. We predict radiative E1, M1, two-photon, leptonic and two-gluon decay rates of low lying charmonium states. An overall agreement is obtained with the experimental masses and decay widths.
