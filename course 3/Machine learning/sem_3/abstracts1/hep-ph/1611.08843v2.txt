We discuss the production of the doubly charged leptons in future linear electron positron colliders, such as the International Linear Collider and Compact Linear Collider. Such states are introduced in extended weak-isospin multiplets by composite models. We discuss the production cross section of $e^-\gamma\rightarrow L^{--}W^{+}$ and carry out analyses for hadronic, semi-leptonic and pure leptonic channels based on the full simulation performance of the Silicon Detector. The 3- and 5-sigma statistical significance exclusion curves are provided in the model parameter space. It is found that the hadronic channel could offer the most possible detectable signature.
