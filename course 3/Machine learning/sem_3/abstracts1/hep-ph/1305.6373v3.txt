We investigate the flavour decomposition of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon, based on the chiral quark-soliton model ($\chi$QSM) with symmetry-conserving quantisation. We consider the rotational $1/N_c$ and linear strange-quark mass ($m_s$) corrections. We discuss the results of the flavour-decomposed electromagnetic form factors in comparison with the recent experimental data. In order to see the effects of the strange quark, we compare the SU(3) results with those of SU(2). We finally discuss the transverse charge densities for both unpolarised and polarised nucleons. The transverse charge density inside a neutron turns out to be negative in the vicinity of the centre within the SU(3) $\chi$QSM, which can be explained by the contribution of the strange quark.
