Theoretical predictions for Bhabha scattering observables are presented including complete one-loop electroweak radiative corrections. A longitudinal polarization of the initial beams is taken into account. Numerical results for the asymmetry $A_{LR}$ and the relative correction $\delta$ are given for the set of the energy $E_{cm}=250, 500, 1000$~GeV with various polarization degrees.
