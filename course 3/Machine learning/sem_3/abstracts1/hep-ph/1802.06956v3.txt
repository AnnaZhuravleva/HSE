We introduce dark matter (DM) evolution process in the Sun under a two-component DM (2DM) scenario. Both DM species $\chi$ and $\xi$ with masses heavier than 1 GeV are considered. In this picture, both species could be captured by the Sun through DM-nucleus scattering and DM self-scatterings, e.g. $\chi\chi$ and $\xi\xi$ collisions. In addition, the heterogeneous self-scattering due to $\chi$ and $\xi$ collision is essentially possible in any 2DM models. This new introduced scattering naturally weaves the evolution processes of the two DM species that was assumed to evolve independently. Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of DM being captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range of DM mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the solar-captured DM annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the DM indirect detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution in the Sun as well as its kinematics are studied.
