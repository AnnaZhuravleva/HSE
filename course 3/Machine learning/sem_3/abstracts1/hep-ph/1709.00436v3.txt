We investigate the properties of a Bose gas with a conserved charge as a dark matter candidate, taking into account the restrictions imposed by relic abundance, direct and indirect detection limits, big-bang nucleosynthesis and large scale structure formation constraints. We consider both the WIMP-like scenario of dark matter masses $ \gtrsim $ 1 GeV, and the small mass scenario, with masses $ \lesssim 10^{-11} $ eV. We determine that a Bose-Einstein condensate will be present at sufficiently early times, but only for the small-mass scenario it will remain at the present epoch.
