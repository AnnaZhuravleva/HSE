The latest, high-accuracy identified hadron spectra measurements in high-energy nuclear collisions led us to the investigation of the strongly interacting particles and collective effects in small systems. Since microscopical processes result in a statistical Tsallis-Pareto distribution, the fit parameters $q$ and $T$ are well suited for identifying system size scalings and initial conditions. Moreover, parameter values provide information on the deviation from the extensive, Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics in finite-volumes. We apply here the fit procedure developed in our earlier study for proton-proton collisions. The observed mass and $\sqrt{s}$ energy trends in the hadron production are compared to RHIC dAu and LHC pPb data in different centrality/multiplicity classes. Here we present new results on mass hierarchy in pp and pA from light to heavy hadrons.
