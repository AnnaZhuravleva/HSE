We study a quantum analogy of Schumann resonances by solving massless and massive spin-1 particle equations derived from the zitterbewegung model in a spherical cavity background with poor conducting walls. The poor conductivity with a quality factor helps us to derive Schumann resonances theoretically more accurately. We also show that the massless case and the massive case in the $m_0^2 \rightarrow 0$ limit are compatible with the Maxwell theory. Furthermore, from the massive case, we predict an upper limit for the mass of the photon.
