In this article, we study the renormalization group equations of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, and investigate universality conditions on the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters at the Grand Unification scale. We demonstrate that the inclusion of right-handed neutrino superfields can have a substantial effect on the running of the soft terms (greatly contributing to driving the singlet Higgs mass- squared parameter negative), which makes it considerably easier to satisfy the conditions for radiative electroweak symmetry-breaking. The new fields also lead to larger values of the Standard Model Higgs mass, thus making it easier to reproduce the measured value. We investigate the phenomenology of this constrained scenario, and focus on two viable benchmark points, which feature a neutral lightest supersymmetric particle (either the lightest neutralino or the right-handed sneutrino). We show that all bounds from colliders and low-energy observables can be fulfilled in wide areas of the parameter space. However, the relic density in these regions is generally too high requiring some form of late entropy production to dilute the density of the lightest supersymmetric particle.
