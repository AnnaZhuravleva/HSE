We discuss the process of colour-singlet parton-parton scattering, which in hadron-hadron collision can lead to production of jet events, where a rapidity gap between the jets is present. The dynamics of the process is calculated within LL BFKL approximation. Using Pythia MC generator, hadronic shapes of jet-gap-jet events are studied, in particular the distributions of the rapidity gap size resulting from the jet formation processes. Using Pythia's modelling of multiple parton interactions, the rescattering effects are simulated. It is shown how these effects influence the gap size distributions. The kinematic dependence of the gap survival probability is discussed.
