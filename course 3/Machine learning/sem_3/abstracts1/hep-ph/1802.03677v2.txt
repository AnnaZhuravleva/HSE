The existence of CP-violation in the leptonic sector is one of the most important issues for modern science. Neutrino physics is a key to the solution of this problem. JUNO (under construction) is the near future of neutrino physics. However CP-violation is not a priority for the current scientific program. We estimate the capability of $\delta_{\rm CP}$ measurement, assuming a combination of the JUNO detector and a superconductive cyclotron as the antineutrino source. This method of measuring CP-violation is an alternative to conventional beam experiments. A significance level of 3$\sigma$ can be reached for 22% of the $\delta_{\rm CP}$ range. The accuracy of measurement lies between 8$^{\rm o}$ and 22$^{\rm o}$. It is shown that the dominant influence on the result is the uncertainty in the mixing angle $\Theta_{23}$.
