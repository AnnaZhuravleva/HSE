The excess of cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes measured by the PAMELA satellite and ATIC balloon experiments may be interpreted as the signals of the dark matter annihilation or decay into leptons. In this letter we show that the dark matter annihilation/decay which reproduces the electron/positron excess may yield a significant amount of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic center. In the case, future kilometer-square size experiments may confirm such a scenario, or even the Super-Kamiokande results already put constraints on some dark matter models.
