The thermodynamical properties of a neutral vector boson gas in a constant magnetic field are studied starting from the spectrum given by Proca formalism. Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC) and magnetization are obtained, for the three and one dimensional cases, in the limit of low temperatures. In three dimensions the gas undergoes a phase transition to an usual BEC in which the critical temperature depends on the magnetic field. In one dimension a diffuse condensate appears as for the charged vector boson gas. In both cases, the condensation is reached not only by decreasing the temperature but also by increasing the magnetic field. In three and one dimensions self-magnetization is possible. The anisotropy in the pressures due to axial symmetry imposed to the system by the magnetic field is also discussed. The astrophysical implications are commented.
