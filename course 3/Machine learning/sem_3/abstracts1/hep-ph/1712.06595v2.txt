The CP asymmetry in $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$, as measured by the BaBar collaboration, differs from the Standard Model prediction by $2.8\sigma$. Most non-standard interactions do not allow for the required strong phase needed to produce a non-vanishing CP asymmetry, leaving only new tensor interactions as a possible mechanism. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous assumptions in the literature, the crucial interference between vector and tensor phases is suppressed by at least two orders of magnitude due to Watson's final-state-interaction theorem. Furthermore, we find that the strength of the relevant CP-violating tensor interaction is strongly constrained by bounds from the neutron electric dipole moment and $D$-$\bar{D}$ mixing. These observations together imply that it is extremely difficult to explain the current $\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ measurement in terms of physics beyond the Standard Model originating in the ultraviolet.
