We apply the unitarity bounds and the bounded-from-below (BFB) bounds to the most general scalar potential of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). We do this in the Higgs basis, i.e. in the basis for the scalar doublets where only one doublet has vacuum expectation value. In this way we obtain bounds on the scalar masses and couplings that are valid for all 2HDMs. We compare those bounds to the analogous bounds that we have obtained for other simple extensions of the Standard Model (SM), namely the 2HDM extended by one scalar singlet and the extension of the SM through two scalar singlets.
