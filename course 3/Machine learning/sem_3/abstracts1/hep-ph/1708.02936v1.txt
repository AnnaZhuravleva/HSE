Current-quark masses are compared to the rest masses allowed by the Helmholtz equation in a polar model. Within the uncertainty of the current u quark mass determination, the current quark mass coincides with the rest mass allowed by the Helmholtz equation in the polar model in accordance with the second root of the zero Neumann function. Current d quark mass coincides with the rest mass calculated in accordance with the third root of the Bessel zero function. On the basis of a comparison of these results with the results obtained earlier for ordinary real particles u and d quarks stability is discussed.
