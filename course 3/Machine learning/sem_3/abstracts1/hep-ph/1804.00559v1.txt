The intensive synchrotron radiation resulting from the quarks interacting with a collective confining color field in relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed. The spectrum of hard photons is calculated and compared with experimental data to demonstrate a feasibility of this magnetic bremsstrahlung-like raiation. The study of early predicted specific anisotropy of the lepton angle distribution with respect to the three-momentum of pair is suggested to take this mechanism as the preferred one among other sources of direct photons and dileptons to probe the confinement features.
