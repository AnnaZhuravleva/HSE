In this thesis a simple extension of the Standard Model has been investigated. The Standard Model gauge group has been extended by an additional $U(1)_X$ group. The model introduces a new Higgs particle as well as three particles (a gauge boson and two Majorana fermions) that can be candidates for dark matter. The thesis also contains a discussion of derivation of the Boltzmann equation, involving detailed analysis of the assumptions. The equation has been used to investigate behaviour of the dark matter density in time, with respect to values of the parameters of the model.
