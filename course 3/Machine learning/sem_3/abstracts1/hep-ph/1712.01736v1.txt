Several experiments at the electron-proton ($ep$) collider HERA have collected high precision data on the spectrum of leading-proton and leading-neutron carrying a large fraction of the proton's energy. In this paper, we have analyzed recent experimental data on the production of leading-nucleon in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) processes at HERA in the framework of a perturbative QCD (pQCD). An approach based on the fractures functions framework has been used, and the nucleon fracture functions (nucleon FFs) ${\cal M}_2^{(n/p)} (x, Q^2, x_L)$ have been extracted from global QCD analysis of DIS data measured by ZEUS collaboration at HERA. We show that the approach of fracture functions formalisem allows us phenomenologically parametrize the nucleon FFs at the input scale, $Q_0^2$. Considering leading-nucleon production data in the DIS processes, we present the results for the separate parton distributions for all parton species. The extracted results from the $t$-integrated leading-baryon fracture functions, $F_2^{\rm LB(3)} (x, Q^2, x_L)$ are in good agreement with all DIS data analyzed, for a wide range of longitudinal momentum fraction $x_L$ as well as scaled fractional momentum variable $x$.
