The properties of the recently discovered Higgs boson, together with the absence of new physics at the LHC, allows us to speculate about the possibility of consistently extending the Standard Model all the way up to the Planck scale, while staying in the perturbative regime. In this context, the Standard Model Higgs non-minimally coupled to gravity could be responsible for the flatness, homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe at large scales and for the generation of the primordial spectrum of perturbations leading to structure formation. We overview the minimalistic Higgs inflation scenario, its predictions, open issues and extensions and its relation to the possible metastability of the electroweak vacuum.
