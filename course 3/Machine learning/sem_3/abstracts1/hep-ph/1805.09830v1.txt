Dark matter and neutrinos provide the two most compelling pieces of evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics but they are often treated as two different sectors. In this paper, we consider how neutrino observables can be used to constrain the parameter space of different models where active neutrinos interact with DM via mediators of different spins. We study for the first time the sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande detector to neutrinos produced from MeV Dark Matter annihilation. In particular, we find that thermally produced DM candidates with masses between 15-30 MeV could be fully excluded.
