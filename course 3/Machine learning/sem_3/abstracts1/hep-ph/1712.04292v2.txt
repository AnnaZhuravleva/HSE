We construct a class of renormalizable models for lepton mixing that generate predictions given in terms of the charged-lepton mass ratios. We show that one of those models leads, when one takes into account the known experimental values, to almost maximal CP-breaking phases and to almost maximal neutrinoless double-beta decay. We study in detail the scalar potential of the models, especially the bounds imposed by unitarity on the values of the quartic couplings.
