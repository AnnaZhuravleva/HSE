In this paper, the top quark pair production events are analyzed as a source of neutral Higgs bosons of two Higgs doublet model type I at LHC. The production mechanism is $pp \to H/A \to t\bar{t}$ assuming a fully hadronic final state through $t \to Wb \to jjb$. In order to distinguish the signal from the main background which is the standard model $t\bar{t}$, we benefit from the fact that the top quarks in signal events acquire a large Lorentz boost due to the heavy neutral Higgs boson. This feature leads to three collinear jets (a fat jet) which is a discriminating tool for identification of the top quarks from the Higgs boson resonances. Events with two identified top jets are selected and the invariant mass of the top pair is calculated for both signal and background. It is shown that the low $\tan\beta$ region has still some parts which can be covered by this analysis and has not been excluded yet by flavor physics data.
