Many extensions of the standard model (SM) involve new massive particles charged under the electroweak gauge symmetry. The electroweakly interacting new particles affect various SM processes through radiative corrections. We discuss the possibility of detecting such new particles based on the precise measurement of the SM processes at high energy hadron colliders. It then turns out that Drell-Yan processes receive radiative corrections from the electroweakly interacting particles at the level of ${\cal O}$(0.1-10) %. It is hence possible to indirectly search for the Higgsino up to the mass of 400 GeV and the quintet (5-plet) Majorana fermion up to the mass of 1200 GeV at the high-luminosity running of the Large Hadron Collider, if the systematic uncertainty associated with the estimation of the SM background becomes lower than the statistical one.
