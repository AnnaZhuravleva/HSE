Recently, we have proposed a definition for the vacuum and suggest a mechanism for symmetry breaking. In this mechanism extra massless fields, vacuum fields, arise. We apply our method to the standard model of particle physics and obtain vacuum sector of this model. Vacuum field of the standard model is a four-vector with electromagnetic nature. This field is invariant under $ U(1)_{em} $ gauge transformation. We speculate that it could be responsible for many cosmological phenomena like inflation, dark energy and cosmic magnetic fields.
