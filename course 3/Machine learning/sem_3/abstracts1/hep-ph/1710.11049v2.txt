Within our description of Goldstone-type pseudoscalar mesons as almost massless bound states of quark and antiquark by a three-dimensional bound-state equation of Bethe-Salpeter origin, taking into account the pointwise behaviour of the full light-quark propagators enables to characterize the effective interquark interactions more precisely than earlier studies exploiting just specific aspects.
