We discuss the interpretation of the annual modulation signal seen in the DAMA experiment in terms of spin-independent elastic WIMP scattering. Taking into account channeling in the crystal as well as the spectral signature of the modulation signal we find that the low-mass WIMP region consistent with DAMA data is confined to WIMP masses close to $m_\chi \simeq 12$ GeV, in disagreement with the constraints from CDMS and XENON. We conclude that even if channeling is taken into account this interpretation of the DAMA modulation signal is disfavoured. There are no overlap regions in the parameter space at 90% CL and a consistency test gives the probability of $1.2\times 10^{-5}$. We study the robustness of this result with respect to variations of the WIMP velocity distribution in our galaxy, by changing various parameters of the distribution function, and by using the results of a realistic N-body dark matter simulation. We find that only by making rather extreme assumptions regarding halo properties can we obtain agreement between DAMA and CDMS/XENON.
