Recent CDF and D0 measurements of B^0_s-\bar{B}^0_s mixing make it possible to search for CP violation and test CPT symmetry in a variety of B_s decays. Considering both coherent B^0_d\bar{B}^0_d decays at the \Upsilon (4S) resonance and coherent B^0_s\bar{B}^0_s decays at the \Upsilon (5S) resonance, we formulate their time-dependent and time-integrated rates by postulating small CPT violation in B^0_d-\bar{B}^0_d and B^0_s-\bar{B}^0_s oscillations. We show that the opposite-sign dilepton events from either C-odd or C-even B^0_q\bar{B}^0_q states (for q = d or s) can be used to determine or constrain the CPT-violating parameter at a super-B factory. The possibility of distinguishing between the effect of CPT violation and that of \Delta B = -\Delta Q transitions is also discussed.
