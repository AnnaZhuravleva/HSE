In this article, we study dynamic chiral symmetry breaking at zero temperature, finite chemical potential and external magnetic field with massless NJL model. We have proposed a mathematical method to classify phases in phase diagram of cold dense quark matter, and use mathematical analysis to identify the multi phase phenomenon among solutions for gap equation which means with fixed chemical potential and magnetic field, there could be two phases coexisting.
