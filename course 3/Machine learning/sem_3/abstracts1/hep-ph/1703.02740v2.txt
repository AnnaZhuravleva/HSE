We study a possible symmetry restoration due to the radiative effect of particles which are explosively produced in preheating after inflation. As its application, we consider a scenario for leptogenesis based on the lepton number asymmetry generated in the right-handed neutrino sector through the inflaton decay. The scenario is examined in a one-loop radiative neutrino mass model extended with singlet scalars.
