Fluctuations and correlations of conserved quantities in the confined phase of QCD are a viable way to characterize the existence of exotic and missing states with given quantum numbers in the hadronic spectrum. We study a realization of the Hadron Resonance Gas model in the light quark (uds) flavor sector of QCD to study the fluctuations and static correlators of electric charge, baryon number and strangeness. It is also conjectured an interesting duality between the correlators at zero temperature, and the fluctuations of integrated quantities at low temperatures, leading to the appearance of a dual Hagedorn distance for the former.
