We propose a scenario that generates the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe through a multi--step phase transition in which SU(3) color symmetry is first broken and then restored. A spontaneous violation of $B-L$ conservation leads to a contribution to the baryon asymmetry that becomes negligible in the final phase. The baryon asymmetry is therefore produced exclusively through the electroweak mechanism in the intermediate phase. We illustrate this scenario with a simple model that reproduces the observed baryon asymmetry. We discuss how future electric dipole moment and collider searches may probe this scenario, though future EDM searches would require an improved sensitivity of several orders of magnitude.
