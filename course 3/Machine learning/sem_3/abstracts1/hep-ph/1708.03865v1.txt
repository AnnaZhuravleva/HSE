The N-dimensional radial Schr\"odinger equation has been solved using the analytical exact iteration method (AEIM), in which the Cornell potential is generalized to finite temperature and chemical potential. The energy eigenvalues have been calculated in the N-dimensional space for any state (n, l). The present results have been applied for studying quarkonium properties such as charmonium and bottomonium masses. The binding energies and the mass spectra of heavy quarkonia are studied in the N-dimensional space. The dissociation temperatures for different states of heavy quarkonia are calculated in the three dimensional space. The influence of dimensionality number (N) has been discussed on the dissociation temperatures. A comparison is studied with other recent works. We conclude that the AEIM successes to predict the heavy-quarkonium properties at finite temperature and chemical potential.
