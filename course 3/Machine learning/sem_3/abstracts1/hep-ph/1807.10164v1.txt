We study the decay of a pseudovector glueball with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, the lightest glueball with spin different from zero or two, in the top-down holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model. This glueball is dual to the string-theoretic Kalb-Ramond tensor field, which completely fixes all its couplings by gauge invariance and $D$-brane anomaly inflow. The dominant decay channels are determined by a Chern-Simons-like action for the flavor branes; couplings from the Dirac-Born-Infeld action turn out to be subdominant. While the resulting width is parametrically of order $N_c^{-2}\lambda^{-1}$ for $N_c$ colors and 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$, when extrapolated to $N_c=3$ and with $\lambda$ matched to experimental data, the prediction is that the pseudovector glueball is an extremely broad resonance.
