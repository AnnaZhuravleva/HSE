Neutral gauge bosons beyond the Standard Model are becoming interesting as possible mediators to explain several experimental anomalies. They have small masses, below one GeV, and are referred to as dark photons, $U$, $A'$ or $Z'$ bosons. Electron--positron collision experiments at the B-factories provide the most straightforward way to probe bosons of this kind. In the present article we study production of the bosons at $e^+e^-$ colliders operating at GeV center-of-mass energies. We have studied two channels: $e^+e^-\rightarrow \gamma Z'$ and $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-Z'$. Analytic expressions for the cross sections and various observables such as the energy spectra of the produced bosons and the final electrons from the $Z'$ decays are derived. We have also studied the transverse momentum distribution of the bosons and the spatial distribution of the $Z'\rightarrow e^+e^-$ decay vertices. It is shown that these distributions provide distinct signatures of the bosons in $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma Z'$. The reaction $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-Z'$ becomes important at small $Z'$ scattering angles where its contribution to the overall yield may be larger by orders of magnitude compared to $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma Z'$. The standard processes $e^+e^-\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma$ that lead to the same signal are considered. We include numerical predictions for the production rates at the energy $\sqrt{s}=10.5$ GeV. The case with a light scalar boson is also discussed. The calculations are performed in detail and can be useful for additional studies.
