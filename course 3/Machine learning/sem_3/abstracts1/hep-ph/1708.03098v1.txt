Two body nonleptonic weak decays of bottom mesons to a pseudoscalar meson and an axial-vector meson involving charmed states are studied using the non-relativistic quark model. We calculate the branching ratios of these decays by employing the factorization hypothesis. Obtained results are in good agreement with the existing experimental data. We also calculated the branching ratios in the light of heavy quark symmetry constraints and compared with the exiting theoretical analyses.
