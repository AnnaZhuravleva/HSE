We show that the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) emission, as recently updated by the Fermi-LAT Collaboration, could be explained by the sum of Fermi-bubbles-like emission plus dark matter (DM) annihilation, in the context of a scalar-singlet Higgs portal scenario (SHP). In fact, the standard SHP, where the DM particle, $S$, only has renormalizable interactions with the Higgs, is non-operational due to strong constraints, specially from DM direct detection limits. Thus we consider a most economical extension, called ESHP (for extended SHP), which simply consists in the addition of a second (heavier) scalar singlet in the dark sector. The second scalar can be integrated-out, leaving a standard SHP plus a dimension-6 operator. Essentially, this model has only two relevant parameters (the DM mass and the coupling of the dim-6 operator). DM annihilation occurs mainly into two Higgs bosons, $SS\rightarrow hh$. We demonstrate that, despite its economy, the ESHP model provides excellent fits to the GCE (with p-value $\sim 0.6-0.7$) for very reasonable values of the parameters, in particular $m_S \simeq 130$ GeV. This is achieved without conflicting with other observables and keeping the $S-$particle relic density at the accepted value for the DM content in the universe.
