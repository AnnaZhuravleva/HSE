It was proposed recently that different chiralities of the dark matter (DM) fermion under a broken dark U(1) gauge group can lead to distinguishable signatures at the LHC through shower patterns, which may reveal the mass origin of the dark sector. We study this subject further by examining the dark shower of two simplified models, the dubbed Chiral Model and the Vector Model. We derive a more complete set of collinear splitting functions with power corrections, specifying the helicities of the initial DM fermion and including the contribution from an extra degree of freedom, the dark Higgs boson. The dark shower is then implemented with these splitting functions, and the new features resulting from its correct modelling are emphasized. It is shown that the DM fermion chirality can be differentiated by measuring dark shower patterns, especially the DM jet energy profile, which is almost independent of the DM energy.
