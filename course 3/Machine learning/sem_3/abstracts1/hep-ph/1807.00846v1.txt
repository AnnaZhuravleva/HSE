Assuming that dark matter (DM) efficiently clusters on various scales we analyse the possible impact on direct {DM} searches. For certain sizes and {densities of DM clusters}, mutual cluster-detector encounters may occur only once every several years leading to the apparent failure of individual experiments searching for DM to discover it. If, however, encounters with Earth size and up to $10^4$ times bigger clusters occur about once a year, then finding time correlations between events in different underground detectors can unambiguously lead to DM discovery.
