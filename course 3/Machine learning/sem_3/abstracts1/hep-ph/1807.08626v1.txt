We describe work being done at Baylor University investigating the possibility of new states of mesonic matter containing two or more quark-antiquark pairs. To put things in context, we begin by describing the lattice approach to hadronic physics. We point out there is a need for a quark model which can give an overall view of the quark interaction landscape. A new application of the Thomas-Fermi (TF) statistical quark model is described, similar to a previous application to baryons. The main usefulness of this model will be to detect systematic energy trends in the composition of the various particles. It could be a key to identifying {\it families} of bound states, rather than individual cases. Numerical results based upon a set of parameters derived from a phenomenological model of tetraquarks are given.
