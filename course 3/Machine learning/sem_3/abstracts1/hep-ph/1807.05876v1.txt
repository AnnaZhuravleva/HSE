We present the next-to-leading-order calculation of the partial decay widths of light CP-even Higgs bosons decaying into four fermions in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and a Singlet Extension of the Standard Model. Different renormalization schemes are applied in the calculation, which is implemented into the analysis tool PROPHECY4F. Some sample results on the Higgs->4fermions decay widths illustrate how the corrections reduce the dependence on the renormalization scale and the choice of the scheme.
