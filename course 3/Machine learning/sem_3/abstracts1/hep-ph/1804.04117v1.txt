We study a simple extension of the Standard Model that accounts for neutrino masses and dark matter. The Standard Model is augmented by two extra Higgs doublets and one Dirac singlet fermion, all charged under a new dark global symmetry. It is a generalised version of the Scotogenic Model with Dirac dark matter. The masses of two neutrinos are generated radiatively at one-loop level, and the singlet fermion constitutes the dark matter of the Universe. We study in depth the phenomenology of the model, in particular the complementarity between dark matter direct detection and lepton flavour violation observables. Due to the strong limits from the latter, dark matter annihilations are suppressed and the relic abundance is set by the close-by in mass scalars. We discuss how different ratios and future sensitivity of lepton flavour violating processes can be used to test the model. We also discuss the detection prospects of the charged scalars at colliders. In some cases these leave ionising tracks and in others have prompt decays, distinct for different charged leptons and neutrino mass orderings.
