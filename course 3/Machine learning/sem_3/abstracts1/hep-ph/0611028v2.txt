We present an analysis of suitable rotation curves (RCs) of eight galaxies, aimed at checking the consistency and universality of the gravitational suppression (GraS) hypothesis, a phenomenological model for a new interaction between dark matter and baryons. Motivated by the puzzle of the core versus cusp distribution of dark matter in the center of halos, this hypothesis claims to reconcile the predictions from N-body \Lambda cold dark matter simulations with kinematic observations. The GraS model improves the kinematic fitting residuals, but the mass parameters are unphysical and put the theory in difficulty.
