We explore jet physics in hadron collisions using the parton shower event generator Deductor. Of particular interest is the one jet inclusive cross section dsigma/dpT for jets of very high pT. Compared to the Born level, the cross section decreases substantially because of pT loss from the jet during showering. We compare to the same effect in Pythia and Dire. The cross section then increases substantially because of the summation of threshold logarithms included in Deductor.   We also study the cross section to have a gap with no jets between two hard jets that are widely separated in rapidity. Here we compare Deductor with virtuality based ordering with Deductor with kT ordering and we check whether adding an underlying event and hadronization has a significant effect beyond that found with just a parton shower.
