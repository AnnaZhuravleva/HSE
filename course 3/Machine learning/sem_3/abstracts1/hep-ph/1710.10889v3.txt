Dark matter may reside in sector without Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions. One way in which such a dark sector can still impact SM particles through non-gravitational interactions is via the "photon portal" in which a dark photon kinetically mixes with the ordinary SM photon. We study the implications of this setup for electron recoil events at TEXONO reactor and nuclear recoil events at the COHERENT experiment. We find that the recent COHERENT data rules out previously allowed regions of parameter space favored by the thermal relic hypothesis for the DM abundance. When mapped onto the DM-electron cross section, we find that COHERENT provides the leading direct constraints for DM masses < 30 MeV.
