We present the extended electrodynamics in the presence of the axion and dark photon. We derive the extended versions of Maxwell's equations and dark Maxwell's equations (for both massive and massless dark photons) as well as the wave equations. We discuss the implications of this extended electrodynamics including the enhanced effects in the particle conversions under the external magnetic or dark magnetic field. We also discuss the recently reported anomaly in the redshifted 21cm spectrum using the extended electrodynamics.
