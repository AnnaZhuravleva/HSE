We present the color planar and complete light quark QCD contributions to the three loop heavy quark form factors in the case of vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. We evaluate the master integrals applying a new method based on differential equations for general bases, which is applicable for any first order factorizing systems. The analytic results are expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms and real-valued cyclotomic harmonic polylogarithms.
