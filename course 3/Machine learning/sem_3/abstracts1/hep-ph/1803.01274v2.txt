A new vector dark matter (DM) scenario in the context of the gauge-Higgs unification (GHU) is proposed. The DM particle is identified with an electric-charge neutral component in an $SU(2)_L$ doublet vector field with the same quantum number as the Standard Model Higgs doublet. Since such an $SU(2)_L$ doublet vector field is incorporated in any models of the GHU scenario, it is always a primary and model-independent candidate for the DM in the scenario. The observed relic density is reproduced through a DM pair annihilations into the weak gauge bosons with a TeV-scale DM mass, which is nothing but the compactification scale of extra-dimensions. Due to the higher-dimensional gauge structure of the GHU scenario, a pair of the DM particles has no direct coupling with a single $Z$-boson/Higgs boson, so that the DM particle evades the severe constraint from the current direct DM search experiments.
