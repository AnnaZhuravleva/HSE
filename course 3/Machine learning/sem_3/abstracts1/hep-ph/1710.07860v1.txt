A new non-universal abelian extension $\mathrm{G_{SM}}\otimes \mathrm{U(1)}_{X}$ to the Standard Model free from chiral anomalies is presented. The new $X$ charges distinguish among generations so as the fermion mass matrices get zero-textures from the fermion mass hierarchy can be obtained. Regarding to neutrino physics, the model inclues Majorana fermions which induce see-saw mechanisms to get small neutrino masses. Moreover, the suitability of the model is tested by searching for regions in the parameter space which reproduce current neutrino oscillation data.
