We present advances in the development of the numerical unitarity method for the computation of multi-loop amplitudes in QCD. As an application, we show results for all the leading-color two-loop five-gluon helicity amplitudes. The amplitudes are reduced to a linear combination of master integrals by employing unitarity-compatible integration-by-parts identities, and the corresponding integral coefficients are computed in an exact manner on rational phase-space points through finite fields arithmetics.
