In this paper the production cross section $pp\rightarrow (\gamma, Z) \to \nu_\tau \bar \nu_\tau \gamma+X$ in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8, 13, 14, 33TeV$ is presented. Furthermore, we estimate bounds at the $95\%C. L.$ on the dipole moments of the tau-neutrino using integrated luminosity of ${\cal L}=20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 3000 fb^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and we consider systematic uncertainties of $\delta_{sys}=0, 5, 10\%$. It is shown that the process under consideration is a good prospect for probing the dipole moments of the tau-neutrino at the LHC.
