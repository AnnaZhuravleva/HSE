In this conference paper, I give an overview of the capabilities of DarkBit, a module of the GAMBIT global fitting code that calculates a range of dark matter observables and corresponding experimental likelihood functions. Included in the code are limits from the dark matter relic density, multiple direct detection experiments, and indirect searches in gamma-rays and neutrinos. I discuss the capabilities of the code, and then present recent results of GAMBIT scans of the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, with a focus on sensitivities of future dark matter searches to the current best fit regions.
