We consider inhomogeneous preheating in multi-field models of cosmological perturbation. After preheating, two fields are trapped at an enhanced symmetric point. One field is an oscillating field and the other is a light field that plays an important role in generating perturbation. In this presentation, we consider two types of potential for the light field.
