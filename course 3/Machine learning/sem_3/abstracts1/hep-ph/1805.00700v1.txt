By analyzing all existing measurements for $ D\rightarrow K l^+ \nu_{l} $ ( $l=e,\ \mu$ ) decays, we find the determinations of both the vector form factor $f_+^K(q^2)$ and scalar form factor $f_0^K(q^2)$ for semileptonic $D\rightarrow K$ decays from these measurements are feasible. With the analysis results on these measurements together with magnitude of CKM matrix element $V_{cs}$, $|V_{cs}|$, we obtain these form factors. Both $f_+^K(q^2)$ and $f_0^K(q^2)$ determined from experiments are consistent within error with those in recent lattice calculations. With our analysis results in conjunction with the average of form factor in $N_f=2+1$ lattice calculations, we extract $|V_{cs}|$, which is in good agreement within error with the value obtained from SM global fit. With $|V_{cs}|$ obtianed in this analysis together with the value obtained from leptonic $D_s$ decays, we obtain the average of $|V_{cs}|$,which is in good agreement with the one from PDG'2016. Moreover, using the analysis results in the context of the SM as input parameters, we re-analyze these measurements in the context of new physics. Constraints on scalar leptoquarks are obtained for different final states of semileptonic $D \rightarrow K$.
