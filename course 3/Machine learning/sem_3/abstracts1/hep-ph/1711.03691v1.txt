Recent results from direct detection experiments such as LUX, PANDAX-II and XENON100 have imposed severe constraints on the multi-GeV mass window in various dark matter (DM) models. However, many of these experiments are not sensitive to MeV scale DM as the corresponding recoil energies are, largely, lower than the detector thresholds. Re-examining the light scalar DM in a model-independent approach, we find that while the parameter space can be constrained using cosmological and astrophysical observations, a significantly large fraction is still viable. We further demonstrate that the remaining parameter space lends itself to the possibility of discovery at both direct detection experiments (such as CRESST-II) as well as in a low-energy collider such as Belle-II.
