We present a discussion on the methods for extracting a given parameter from measurements of hadronic data, with particular focus on determinations of the strong coupling constant. We show that when the PDF dependency on the determination is adequately taken into account, the dispersion between the results from different measurements is significantly reduced. We speculatively propose the concept of preferred value of a parameter from a particular dataset.
