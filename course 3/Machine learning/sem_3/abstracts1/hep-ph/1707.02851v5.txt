Based on the predictions of the relevant form factors from the covariant light-front quark model, we show the branching fractions for the $D (D_s) \to (P,\,S,\,V,\,A)\,\ell\nu_\ell$ ($\ell=e$ or $\mu$) decays, where $P$ denotes the pseudoscalar meson, $S$ the scalar meson with a mass above 1 GeV, $V$ the vector meson and $A$ the axial-vector one. Comparison with the available experimental results are made, and we find an excellent agreement. The predictions for other decay modes can be tested in a charm factory, e.g., the BESIII detector. The future measurements will definitely further enrich our knowledge on the hadronic transition form factor as well as the inner structure of the even-parity mesons ($S$ and $A$).
