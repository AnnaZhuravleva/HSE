The aim of the present note is to compare the recent LHC data at $\sqrt{s} =13 \,TeV$ with our previous theoretical proposal that the true Higgs boson $H_T$ should be a broad heavy resonance with mass around $750 \, GeV$. We focus on the so-called golden channel $H_T \rightarrow ZZ$ where the pair of Z bosons decay leptonically to $\ell^+ \ell^- \ell^+ \ell^-$, $\ell$ being either an electron or a muon. We use the data collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at $\sqrt{s} =13 \,TeV$ with an integrated luminosity of $36.1 \, fb^{-1}$ and $77.4 \, fb^{-1}$ respectively. We find that the experimental data from both the LHC Collaborations do display in the golden channel a rather broad resonance structure around $700 \, GeV$ with a sizeable statistical significance. Our theoretical expectations seem to be in fair good agreement with the experimental observations. Combining the data from both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations we obtain an evidence of the heavy Higgs boson in this channel with an estimated statistical significance of more than five standard deviations.
