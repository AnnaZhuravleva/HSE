We consider a (long-lived) sterile neutrino dark matter scenario in a five dimensional (5D) warped extra dimension model where the fields can live in the bulk, which is partly motivated from the absence of the absolutely stable particles in a simple Randall-Sundrum model. The dominant production of the sterile neutrino can come from the decay of the radion (the scalar field representing the brane separation) around the electroweak scale. The suppressions of the 4D parameters due to the warp factor and the small wave function overlaps in the extra dimension help alleviate the exceeding fine-tunings typical for a sterile neutrino dark matter scenario in a 4D setup.
