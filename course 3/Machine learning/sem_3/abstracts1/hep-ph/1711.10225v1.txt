We revisit a three-family Pati-Salam model with a realistic phenomenology from intersecting D6-branes in Type IIA string theory compactified on a $\mathbf{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold, and study its naturalness in view of the current LHC and dark matter searches. We discuss spectrum and phenomenological features of this scenario demanding fine tuning better than 1\%. This requirement restricts the lightest neutralino to have mass less than about 600 GeV. We observe that the viable parameter space is tightly constrained by the requirements of naturalness and consistency with the observed dark matter relic density, so that it is fully testable at current and future dark matter searches, unless a non-thermal production mechanism of dark matter is at work. We find that $Z$-resonance, $h$-resonance, $A$-funnel and light stau/stop-neutralino coannihilation solutions are consistent with current LHC and dark matter constraints while the "well-tempered" neutralino scenario is ruled out in our model. Moreover, we observe that only Bino, Higgsinos, right-handed staus and stops can have mass below 1 TeV.
