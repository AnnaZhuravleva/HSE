Multiplicity distributions of charged particles produced in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at LEP2 energies ranging from 91 to 206 GeV in full phase space, are compared with predictions from Tsallis $q$-statistics and the recently proposed Weibull distribution functions.~The analysis uses data from two LEP experiments, L3 and OPAL.~It is shown that Tsallis $q$-statistics explains the data in a statistically acceptable manner in full phase space at all energies, while the Weibull distribution fails to explain the underlying properties of the data.~Modifications to the distributions proposed earlier, are applied to uncover manifold improvements in explaining the data characteristics.
