Recent theory results on direct production of resonances with positive charge conjugation in electron-positron annihilation are reviewed. The strong model dependence is emphasized, with predictions varying between 0.03 eV and 0.43 eV for the charmonium state with $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ and between 0.16 eV and 4.25 eV for the state with $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. For the state with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ the cross section is of $\cal{O}$ $(m^2_e/M^2_{\chi})$ and thus negligeable for all practical purpose. The importance of the relative phase of the production amplitude is emphasized.
