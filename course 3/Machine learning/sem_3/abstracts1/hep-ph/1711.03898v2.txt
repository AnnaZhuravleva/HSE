I show that with the discovery of the Higgs boson we have entered a new phase of our understanding of nature. This leads us towards a paradigm shift in the search for possible new physics, away from major extensions like supersymmetry towards minimalistic extensions, that largely preserve the structure of the standard model. To discover such new physics, precision may be more important than energy. Precision = Discovery! A possible path for the future is sketched.
