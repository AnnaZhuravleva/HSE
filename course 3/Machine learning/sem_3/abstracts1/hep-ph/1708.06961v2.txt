Whether the $Y(4260)$ can couple to open charm channels has been a crucial issue for understanding its nature. The available experimental data suggest that the cross section line shapes of exclusive processes in $e^+e^-$ annihilations have nontrivial structures around the mass region of the $Y(4260)$. As part of a series of studies of the $Y(4260)$ as mainly a $\bar{D}D_1(2420)+c.c.$ molecular state, we show that the partial widths of the $Y(4260)$ to the two-body open charm channels of $e^+e^-\to D^*\bar{D}^*$ and $D_s^*\bar{D}_s^*$ are much smaller than that to $\bar{D}D^*\pi+c.c.$. The line shapes measured by the Belle Collaboration for these two channels can be well described by the vector charmonium states $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$ and $\psi(4415)$ together with the $Y(4260)$. It turns out that the interference of the $Y(4260)$ with the other charmonia produces a dip around 4.22~GeV in the $e^+e^-\to D^*\bar{D}^*$ cross section line shape. The data also show an evidence for the strong coupling of the $Y(4260)$ to the $D\bar D_1(2420)$, in line with the expectation in the hadronic molecular scenario for the $Y(4260)$.
