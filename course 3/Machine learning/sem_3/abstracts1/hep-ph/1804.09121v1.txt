The existence and properties of the f0(1370) scalar meson are rather well established from data of antiproton annihilations at rest. However conflicting results from Central Exclusive Production (CEP) experiments of the last millennium and ignorance of data from antiproton annihilations at rest in H2 and D2 bubble chambers have generated doubts on the very existence of the f0(1370). Properties of {\pi}+{\pi}- pairs produced in central exclusive production (CEP) reactions observed in old data together with data collected in the current decade at high energy colliders permit to show that {\pi}+{\pi}- decays of the f0(1370) meson are directly observable as an isolated peak between 1.1 and 1.6 GeV. Consequences of this observation and prospects for the identification of the scalar glueball ground-state are discussed.
