To extend the BLMSSM, we not only add exotic Higgs superfields $(\Phi_{NL},\varphi_{NL})$ to make the exotic lepton heavy, but also introduce the superfields($Y$,$Y^\prime$) having couplings with lepton and exotic lepton at tree level. The obtained model is called as EBLMSSM, which has difference from BLMSSM especially for the exotic slepton(lepton) and exotic sneutrino(neutrino). We deduce the mass matrices and the needed couplings in this model. To confine the parameter space, the Higgs boson mass $m_{h^0}$ and the processes $h^0\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$, $h^0\rightarrow VV, V=(Z,W)$ are studied in the EBLMSSM. With the assumed parameter space, we obtain reasonable numerical results according to data on Higgs from ATLAS and CMS. As a cold dark mater candidate, the relic density for the lightest mass eigenstate of $Y$ and $Y'$ mixing is also studied.
