Similarly to the previously studied case of inclusive $t\bar t$ production we consider the inclusive $t\bar b$ production in $e^+e^-$, gluon~gluon and photon~photon collisions. We show how it is sensitive to new physics, connected to the charged Goldstone sector and possibly generated by Higgs and/or top quark compositeness.
