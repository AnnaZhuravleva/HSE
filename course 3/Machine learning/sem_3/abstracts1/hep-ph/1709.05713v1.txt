Recent measurements of the differential cross sections in the forward region of pp elastic scattering at 7 and 8 TeV show precise form of the $t$ dependence. We propose a detailed analysis of these measurements including the structures of the real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude. A good description is achieved, confirming in all experiments the existence of a zero in the real part in the forward region close to the origin, in agreement with the prediction of a theorem by A. Martin, with important role in the observed form of $d\sigma/dt$. Universal value for the position of this zero and regularity in other features of the amplitudes are found, leading to quantitative predictions for the forward elastic scattering at 13 TeV.
