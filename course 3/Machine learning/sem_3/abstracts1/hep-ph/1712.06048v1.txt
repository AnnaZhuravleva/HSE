We present details of study of the Bjorken polarized sum rule carried out recently in [1] within the range of energies where the data were collected by JLAB collaboration, 0.05 GeV2 < Q2 < 3 GeV2. Three approaches to QCD with analytic (holomorphic) coupling are considered: Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT), Two-delta analytic QCD, and Three-delta lattice-motivated analytic QCD in the three-loop and four-loop MiniMOM schemes. The new frameworks with respective couplings give results which agree well with the experimental data for 0.5 GeV2 < Q2 < 3GeV2 already when only one higher-twist term is taken into account.
