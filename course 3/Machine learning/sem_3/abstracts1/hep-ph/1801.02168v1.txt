The in-medium properties of the heavy spin-3/2 $\Sigma_Q^{*}$, $\Xi_Q^{*}$ and $\Omega_Q^{*}$ baryons with $Q$ being $b$ or $c$ quark are investigated. The shifts in some spectroscopic parameters of these particles due to the saturated cold nuclear matter are calculated. The variations of those parameters with respect to the changes in the density of the cold nuclear medium are studied, as well. It is observed that the parameters of $\Sigma_Q^{*}$ baryons are considerably affected by the nuclear matter compared to the $\Xi_Q^{*}$ and $\Omega_Q^{*}$ particles that roughly do not see the medium. The results obtained may be used in analyses of the data to be provided by the in-medium experiments like PANDA.
