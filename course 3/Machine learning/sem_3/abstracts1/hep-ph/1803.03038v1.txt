Deviation from the standard model prediction is observed in many semileptonic $B$ decays mediated via $b \to c$ charged current interactions. In particular, current experimental measurements of the ratio of branching ratio $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\ast}}$ in $B \rightarrow D^{(*)}l \nu$ decays disagree with standard model expectations at the level of about $4.1\sigma$. Moreover, recent measurement of the ratio of branching ratio $R_{J/\Psi}$ by LHCb, where $R_{J/\Psi} = \mathcal B(B_c \to J/\Psi\,\tau\nu)/\mathcal B(B_c \to J/\Psi\,\mu\nu)$, is more than $2\sigma$ away from the standard model prediction. In this context, we consider an effective Lagrangian in the presence of vector and scalar new physics couplings to study the implications of $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\ast}}$ anomalies in $B_s \to D_s\,\tau\nu$ decays. We give prediction of several observables such as branching ratio, ratio of branching ratio, forward backward asymmetry parameter, $\tau$ polarization fraction, and the convexity parameter for the $B_s \to D_s\,\tau\nu$ decays within the standard model and within various new physics scenarios.
