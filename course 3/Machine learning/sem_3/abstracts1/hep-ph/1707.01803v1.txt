We study the production of a Higgs boson in association to a top-antitop pair at the Large Hadron Collider. We show how precise predictions for the differential distributions with respect to the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, to the invariant mass of the top-antitop-Higgs system and to the invariant mass of the top-antitop pair can provide useful information on the possible presence of a pseudoscalar component in the coupling of the top quark with the Higgs boson. We evaluate the production of a top-antitop pair and a Higgs boson to next-to-leading order in fixed order perturbation theory and we carry out the resummation of soft emission corrections to next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy for the LHC operating at a center of mass energy of $13$ TeV. We discuss how the shape of these distributions can be employed experimentally, making a physics case for the kinematic reconstruction of dilepton channels.
