Unparticle exchange gives rise to long range forces which deviate from the inverse square law due to non-canonical dimension of unparticles. It is well known that a potential of the form $r^{-n}$ where $n$ is not equal to one gives rise to a precession in the perihelion of planetary orbits. We calculate the constraints on unparticle couplings with baryons and leptons from the observations of perihelion advance of Mercury orbit.
