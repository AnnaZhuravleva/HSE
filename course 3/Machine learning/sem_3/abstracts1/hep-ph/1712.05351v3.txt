Left-Right symmetric model (LRSM) has been an attractive extension of the Standard Model (SM) which can address the origin of parity violation in the SM electroweak (EW) interactions, generate tiny neutrino masses, accommodate dark matter (DM) candidates and provide a natural framework for baryogenesis through leptogenesis. In this work we utilize the minimal LRSM to study the recently reported DAMPE results of cosmic $e^+e^-$ spectrum which exhibits a tentative peak around 1.4 TeV, while satisfying the current neutrino data. We propose to explain the DAMPE peak with a complex scalar DM $\chi$ in two scenarios: 1) $\chi\chi^* \to H_1^{++}H_1^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$; 2) $\chi\chi^* \to H_{k}^{++}H_{k}^{--} \to \ell_i^+\ell_i^+\ell_j^-\ell_j^-$ accompanied by $\chi\chi^* \to H_1^+ H_1^- \to \ell_i^+ \nu_{\ell_i} \ell_j^- \nu_{\ell_j}$ with $\ell_{i,j}=e,\mu,\tau$ and $k=1,2$. We fit the theoretical prediction on $e^+e^-$ spectrum to relevant experimental data to determine the scalar mass spectrum favored by the DAMPE excess. We also consider various constraints from theoretical principles, collider experiments as well as DM relic density and direct search experiments. We find that there are ample parameter space which can interpret the DAMPE data while passing the constraints. Our explanations, on the other hand, usually imply the existence of other new physics at the energy scale ranging from $10^7 {\rm GeV}$ to $10^{11} {\rm GeV}$. Collider tests of our explanations are also discussed.
