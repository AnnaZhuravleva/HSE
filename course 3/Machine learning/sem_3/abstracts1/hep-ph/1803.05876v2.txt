Exclusive semileptonic decays based on $b\to s$ transitions have been attracting a lot of attention as some angular observables deviate significantly from the Standard Model (SM) predictions in specific $q^2$ bins. B meson decays induced by other Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC), $b\to d$, can also offer a probe to new physics with an additional sensitivity to the weak phase in Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Masakawa (CKM) matrix. We provide predictions for angular observables for $b\to d$ semileptonic transitions, namely $\bar{B}_s\to K^{\ast}\ell^+\ell^-$, $\bar{B}^0\to\rho^0 \ell^+\ell^-$, and their CP-conjugated modes. For $\bar{B}^0\to\rho^0 \ell^+\ell^-$ mode, $B^0-\bar{B}^0$ mixing effects have been included and predictions are made for Belle and LHCb separately. Study of these decay modes will be useful in its own right and to understand the pattern of deviations in $b\to s$ transitions.
