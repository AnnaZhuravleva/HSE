We show that due to the large coupling constant of the monopole-photon interaction the annihilation of monopole-antimonopole and monopolium into many photons must be considered experimentally. For monopole-antimonopole annihilation and lightly bound monopolium, even in the less favorable scenario, multi-photon events (four and more photons in the final state) are dominant, while for strongly bound monopolium, although two photon events are important, four and six photon events are also sizable.
