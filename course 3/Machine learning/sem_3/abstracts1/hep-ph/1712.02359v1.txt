We study low-scale gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models with a very light gravitino of mass $\mathcal{O}(1)$ eV. The cosmological upper bound on the gravitino mass and the collider constraints on the sparticle masses give a significant impact on such models. We apply the latest results of the LHC to these models and obtain the current constraints. We find that perturbatively calculable classes of low-scale gauge mediation models can be largely excluded.
