If the dark matter particle has spin 0, only two types of WIMP-nucleon interaction can arise from the non-relativistic reduction of renormalisable single-mediator models for dark matter-quark interactions. Based on this crucial observation, we show that about 100 signal events at next generation directional detection experiments can be enough to enable a $2\sigma$ rejection of the spin 0 dark matter hypothesis in favour of alternative hypotheses where the dark matter particle has spin 1/2 or 1. In this context directional sensitivity is crucial, since anisotropy patterns in the sphere of nuclear recoil directions depend on the spin of the dark matter particle. For comparison, about 100 signal events are expected in a CF$_4$ detector operating at a pressure of 30 torr with an exposure of approximately 26,000 cubic-meter-detector days for WIMPs of 100 GeV mass and a WIMP-Fluorine scattering cross-section of 0.25 pb. Comparable exposures are within reach of an array of cubic meter time projection chamber detectors.
