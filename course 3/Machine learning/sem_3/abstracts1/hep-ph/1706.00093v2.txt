Recent results for the total and inelastic hadronic cross-sections from LHC experiments are compared with predictions from a single channel PDF driven eikonal mini-jet model and from an empirical model.   The role of soft gluon resummation in the infrared region in taming the rise of mini-jets and their contribution to the increase of the total cross-sections at high energies are discussed. Survival probabilities at LHC, whose theoretical estimates range from circa 10 percent to a few per mille, will be estimated in this model and compared with results from QCD inspired models and from multi channel eikonal models. We revisit a previous calculation and examine the origin of these discrepancies.
