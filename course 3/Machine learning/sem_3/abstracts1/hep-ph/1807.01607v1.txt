In the littlest Higgs Model with T-parity, we discuss the pair production of the T-odd top partner ($T_{-}$) which decays almost 100\% into the top quark and the lightest T-odd particle ($A_{H}$). Considering the current constraints, we investigate the observability of the T-odd top partner pair production through the process $pp\rightarrow T_{-}\bar{T}_{-}\rightarrow t\bar{t}A_{H}A_{H}$ in final states with two leptons at 14 TeV LHC. We analyze the signal significance and find that the lower limit on the T-odd top partner mass are about 1.2 TeV, 1.3 TeV, 1.4 TeV at $2\sigma$ confidence level at 14TeV LHC with the integrated luminosity of 30 fb$^{-1}$, 100fb$^{-1}$, 300fb$^{-1}$. This lower limit can be raised to about 1.5(1.6) TeV if we use 1000(3000) fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.
