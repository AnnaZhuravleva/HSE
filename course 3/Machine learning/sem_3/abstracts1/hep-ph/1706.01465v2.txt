We present an extraction of the pion-nucleon ($\pi N$) scattering lengths from low-energy $\pi N$ scattering, by fitting a representation based on Roy-Steiner equations to the low-energy data base. We show that the resulting values confirm the scattering-length determination from pionic atoms, and discuss the stability of the fit results regarding electromagnetic corrections and experimental normalization uncertainties in detail. Our results provide further evidence for a large $\pi N$ $\sigma$-term, $\sigma_{\pi N}=58(5)$ MeV, in agreement with, albeit less precise than, the determination from pionic atoms.
