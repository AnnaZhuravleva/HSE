We study the structure of the neutrino mass matrix in the minimal gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model, where three right-handed neutrinos are added to the Standard Model in order to obtain non-zero masses for active neutrinos. Because of the U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry, the structure of both Dirac and Majorana mass terms of neutrinos is tightly restricted. In particular, the inverse of the neutrino mass matrix has zeros in the $(\mu,\mu)$ and $(\tau,\tau)$ components, namely, this model offers a symmetric realization of the so-called two-zero-minor structure in the neutrino mass matrix. Due to these constraints, all the CP phases-the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ and the Majorana CP phases $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$-as well as the mass eigenvalues of the light neutrinos $m_i$ are uniquely determined as functions of the neutrino mixing angles $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{13}$, and the squared mass differences $\Delta m_{21}^2$ and $\Delta m_{31}^2$. We find that this model predicts the Dirac CP phase $\delta$ to be $\delta\simeq 1.59\pi$-$1.70\pi$ ($1.54\pi$-$1.78\pi$), the sum of the neutrino masses to be $\sum_{i}m_i \simeq 0.14$-0.22 eV ($0.12$-0.40 eV), and the effective mass for the neutrinoless double beta decay to be $\langle m_{\beta \beta }\rangle \simeq 0.024$-0.055 eV ($0.017$-0.12 eV) at $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) level, which are totally consistent with the current experimental limits. These predictions can soon be tested in future neutrino experiments. Implications for leptogenesis are also discussed.
