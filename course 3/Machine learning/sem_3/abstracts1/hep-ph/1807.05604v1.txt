The isobaric collision experiment at RHIC provides the unique opportunity to detect the possible signal of Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions. The idea is to contrast the correlation observables of the two colliding systems that supposedly have identical flow-driven background contributions while quite different CME signal contributions due to the 10% variation in their nuclear charge and thus magnetic field strength. With the recently developed quantitative simulation tool for computing CME signal, the Anomalous-Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD), we demonstrate that a joint (multiplicity + elliptic-flow) event selection is crucial for this purpose. We further propose to use the absolute difference between RuRu and ZrZr events (after using identical event selection) for detecting CME signal and make predictions for the correlation observables.
