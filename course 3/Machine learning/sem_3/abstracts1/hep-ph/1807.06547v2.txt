We consider the extension of the Standard Model with scalar leptoquarks as a portal to dark matter (DM), motivated by the recent anomalies in semi-leptonic $B$-meson decays. Taking singlet and triplet scalar leptoquarks as the best scenarios for explaining $B$-meson anomalies, we discuss the phenomenological constraints from rare meson decays, muon $(g-2)_\mu$, and leptoquark searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Introducing leptoquark couplings to scalar dark matter, we find that the DM annihilations into a pair of leptoquarks open a wide parameter space, being compatible with XENON1T bound, and show that there is an interesting interplay between LHC leptoquark searches and distinct signatures from cascade annihilations of dark matter.
