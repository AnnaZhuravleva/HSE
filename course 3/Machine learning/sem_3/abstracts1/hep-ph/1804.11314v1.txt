Gaugino mediation is an attractive supersymmetry breaking scheme naturally avoiding flavor problems by suppressing the soft sfermion masses at a high-energy scale. We consider an extension of the original model which yields non-vanishing trilinear scalar couplings. This increases the viable parameter space predicting a sufficiently large Higgs mass. Assuming the gravitino to be the lightest superparticle, we consider additional constraints from direct searches at the LHC, finding allowed points with a neutralino, sneutrino or stau next-to-lightest superparticle.
