We consider determinations of the strange sea in the nucleon based on the QCD analyses of data collected at the LHC with focus on the recent high-statistics ATLAS measurement of the $W^\pm$- and $Z$-boson production. We study the effect of different functional forms for parameterization of the parton distribution functions and the combination of various data sets in the analysis. We compare to earlier strange sea determinations and discuss ways to improve them in the future.
