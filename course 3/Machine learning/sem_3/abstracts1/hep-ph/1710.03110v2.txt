Extending the Standard Model (SM) scalar sector via one or multiple Higgs field(s) in higher representation brings one or more charged Higgs bosons in the spectrum. Some of these gauge representations with appropriate hypercharge can bring up doubly charged Higgs boson and can be easily distinguished from the existing models with only singly charged Higgs boson. In this study we focus on distinguishing the singly charged Higgs bosons from different representations, viz. doublets and triplets of $SU(2)_L$ gauge group. We consider a supersymmetric extension of SM with a gauge singlet and $SU(2)_L$ triplet with $Y=0$ as a benchmark scenario with the possibility of rich phenomenology due to existence of light pseudoscalar for $Z_3$ symmetric superpotential. A detailed collider simulation considering all the SM backgrounds has been carried out in order to classify the final states which are favourable to charged Higgs boson from one particular representation than others. We show that such different representations can be probed an distinguished via looking at single charged Higgs boson phenomenology at the LHC with 14 TeV center of mass energy within $\sim 50$ fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.
