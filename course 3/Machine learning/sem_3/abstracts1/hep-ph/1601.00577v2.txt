The summation of logarithmic contributions to perturbative radiative corrections in physical processes through use of the renormalization group equation has proved to be a useful way of enhancing the information one can obtain from explicit calculation. However, it has proved difficult to perform this summation when massive fields are present. In this note we point out that if the masses involved are quite large, the decoupling theorem of Symanzik and of Appelquist and Carazzone can be used to make the summation of logarithms possible.
