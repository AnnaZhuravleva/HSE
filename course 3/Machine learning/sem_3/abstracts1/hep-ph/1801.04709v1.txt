These proceedings review the status of present and future bounds on muonic lepton flavour violating transitions in the context of an effective-field theory defined below the electroweak scale. A specific focus is set on the phenomenology of $\mu\to e\gamma$, $\mu \to 3e$ transitions and coherent $\mu\to e$ nuclear conversion in the light of current and future experiments. Once the experimental limits are recast into bounds at higher scales, it is shown that the interplay between the various experiments is crucial to cover all corners of the parameter space.
