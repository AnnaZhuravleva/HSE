We present details on calculation of next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections to massive charged-current coefficient functions in deep-inelastic scattering. Especially we focus on the application to charm-quark production in neutrino scattering on fixed target that can be measured via the dimuon final state. We construct a fast interface to the calculation so for any parton distributions the cross sections can be evaluated within milliseconds by using the pre-generated interpolation grids. We discuss agreements of various theoretical predicitons with the NuTeV and CCFR dimuon data and the impact of the results on determination of the strange-quark distributions.
