Resonant interactions between neutrinos from a Galactic supernova and dark matter particles can lead to a sharp dip in the neutrino energy spectrum. Due to its excellent energy resolution, measurement of this effect with the JUNO experiment can provide evidence for such couplings. We discuss how JUNO may confirm or further constrain a model where scalar dark matter couples to active neutrinos and another fermion.
