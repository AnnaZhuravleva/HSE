The azimuthal anisotropies $v_n$ of particle spectra measured in proton-nucleus (pA) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions play a key role in constraining QCD matter properties like the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$. Here, we provide a calculation of $v_2$ in kinetic transport theory and compare it to calculations in viscous fluid dynamics with the same initial geometry and the same matter properties. Both descriptions agree if the transverse system size is large enough and the viscous fluid dynamics is initialized from the full kinetic transport calculation at a time larger than the microscopic isotropization timescale. We find that kinetic transport in the pre-hydrodynamic stage of viscous fluid dynamic calculations cannot be replaced by free-streaming without introducing a fine-tuning of the switching time and corresponding systematic uncertainties. We argue that the need of realistic kinetic transport for a reliable calculation of azimuthal anisotropies in pA and AA collisions may provide a tool for phenomenologically constraining the isotropization time which is a characteristic and as-yet-unknown length scale in the matter produced in pA and AA collisions.
