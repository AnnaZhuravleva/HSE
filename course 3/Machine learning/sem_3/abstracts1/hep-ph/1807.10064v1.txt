We study renormalon ambiguity in the perturbative expansion of~$\langle E(t)\rangle$, the vacuum expectation value of the `energy density operator' $E(t,x)=\frac{1}{4}G_{\mu\nu}^a(t,x)G_{\mu\nu}^a(t,x)$ defined by the Yang--Mills gradient flow, within the so-called large-$\beta_0$ approximation. The leading uncertainty turns out to be of the order of~$\Lambda^4$, where $\Lambda$ is the dynamical scale. We argue that the perturbative expansion of~$\langle E(t)\rangle$ is identified with the coefficient of the identity operator, $c_{\mathbbm{1}}(t)$, in the small flow time expansion of~$\langle E(t)\rangle$. Hence, the higher order terms in the expansion such as the gluon condensate are ambiguous, unless one properly separates the renormalon ambiguity from~$c_{\mathbbm{1}}(t)$. Based on this reasoning, we give a crude estimate of the gluon condensate in the quenched QCD after we remove the renormalon ambiguity from~$c_{\mathbbm{1}}(t)$ in an analytic way.
