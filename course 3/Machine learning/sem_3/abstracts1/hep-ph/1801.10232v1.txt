A recent observation of a threshold momentum difference in the production of adjacent hadrons is implemented in the fragmentation model of a three-dimensional QCD string, with the aim to investigate the common origin of the azimuthal ordering of hadrons and of the correlations commonly attributed to the Bose-Einstein effect. The role of particle decays and their polarization in the measurement of two-particle correlations is evaluated. A comparison with the available data is presented and further measurements suggested. The impact of the hadronization on the long range angular correlations is discussed.
