Dark Matter candidates are natural in Technicolor theories. We introduce a general framework allowing to predict signals of Technicolor Dark Matter at colliders and set constraints from earth based experiments such as CDMS and XENON. We show that the associate production of the composite Higgs can lead to relevant signals at the Large Hadron Collider.
