We calculate relativistic Fermi liquid parameters (RFLPs) for the description of the properties of dense nuclear matter (DNM) using Effective Chiral Model. Analytical expressions of Fermi liquid parameters (FLPs) are presented both for the direct and exchange contributions. We present a comparative study of perturbative calculation with mean field (MF) results. Moreover we go beyond the MF so as to estimate the pionic contribution to the FLPs. Finally, we use these parameters to estimate some of the bulk quantities like incompressibility, sound velocity, symmetry energy etc. for DNM interacting via exchange of $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\pi$ meson. In addition, we also calculate the energy densities and the binding energy curve for the nuclear matter. Results for the latter have been found to be consistent with two loop calculations reported recently within the same model.
