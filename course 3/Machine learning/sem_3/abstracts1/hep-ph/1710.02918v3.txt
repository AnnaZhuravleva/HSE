Compilation of 2 comments on S. L. Adler, "Vacuum Birefringence in a Rotating Magnetic Field", J.Phys. A40 (2007) F143-F152, hep-ph/0611267 and S. Biswas and K. Melnikov, "The Rotation of magnetic field does not impact vacuum birefringence", Phys. Rev. D75 (2007) 053003, hep-ph/0611345, hope it has some usefulness.
