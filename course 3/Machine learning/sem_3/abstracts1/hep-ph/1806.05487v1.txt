Within the extended BLMSSM, the exotic Higgs superfields $(\Phi_{NL},\varphi_{NL})$ are added to make the exotic leptons heavy, and the superfields($Y$,$Y^\prime$) are also introduced to make exotic leptons unstable. This new model is named as the EBLMSSM. We study some lepton flavor violating processes in detail in the EBLMSSM, including $l_j\rightarrow l_i \gamma$ and $h^0\rightarrow l_i l_j$. Being different from BLMSSM, some particles are redefined in this new model, such as slepton, sneutrino, exotic lepton (neutrino), exotic slepton (sneutrino) and lepton neutrino. We also introduce the mixing of superfields $Y,Y'$ and spinor $\tilde{Y}$ in the EBLMSSM. All of these lead to new contributions to the decay precesses. In the suitable parameter space, we obtain the reasonable numerical results. The results of this work would encourage physicists to explore new physics beyond the SM.
