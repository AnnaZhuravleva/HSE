In this work, we propose a possible experimental research topic on the $\Upsilon(6S)\to \Upsilon(nS)\eta^{(\prime)}$ ($n=1,2,3$) transitions. Considering the hadronic loop effect from the intermediate $S$-wave $B_{(s)}$ and $B_{(s)}^*$ mesons, we estimate the partial decay widths and the corresponding branching ratios of the $\Upsilon(6S)\to \Upsilon(nS)\eta^{(\prime)}$ hadronic decays, which become considerably large. With the running of the Belle II experiment, it becomes possible to explore these $\Upsilon(6S)\to \Upsilon(nS)\eta^{(\prime)}$ transitions.
