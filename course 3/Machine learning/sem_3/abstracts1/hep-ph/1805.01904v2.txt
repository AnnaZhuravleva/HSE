A consistent model for vector mediators to dark matter needs to be anomaly-free and include a scalar mode from mass generation. For the leading U(1) extensions we review the structure and constraints, including kinetic mixing at loop level. The thermal relic density suggests that the vector and scalar masses are similar. For the LHC we combine a $Z'$ shape analysis with mono-jets. For the latter, we find that a shape analysis offers significant improvement over existing cut-and-count approaches. Direct detection limits strongly constrain the kinetic mixing angle and we propose a $\ell^+\ell^- E_T$ search strategy based on the scalar mediator.
