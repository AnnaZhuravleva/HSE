Observables with the best ratio of signal to statistical uncertainty are proposed for a bunch of popular models of the $Z'$ boson. They are the cross sections integrated over the phase space of the final particles with proper weight functions. It is proved that the proposed observables are completely equivalent to the $\chi^2$ fit of the differential cross section, so they could be used as an alternative of aggregating events into bins with further minimization of the $\chi^2$ function, especially in preliminary analysis of experimental data. The relations of the observables to the maximum likelihood estimate of the $Z'$ mass as well as to the exclusion reach and statistical efficiency of the signal are investigated.
