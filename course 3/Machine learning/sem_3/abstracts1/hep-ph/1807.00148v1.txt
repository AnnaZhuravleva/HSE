We discuss the status of the SM - The principles - The Lagrangian - The problems - Open questions - The ways beyond. Then we consider possible physics beyond the SM - New symmetries (Gauge, SUSY, etc) - New particles (gauge, axion, superpartners) - New dimensions (extra, large, compact, etc) - New Paradigm (strings, branes, gravity). In conclusion, we formulate the first priority tasks for the future HEP program.
