The self-consistent approach based on similarity of inclusive spectra of hadrons produced in $pp$ and $AA$ collisions is reviewed. This approach allows us to describe rather well the ratio of proton to anti-proton yields in $AA$ collisions as a function of the initial energy at a wide range from a few GeV to a few TeV. We suggest its modification due to the quark-gluon dynamics to describe the inclusive spectra of hadrons produced in $pp$ collision as a function of the transverse momentum $p_t$ at mid-rapidity. The extension of this approach to analyze the pion $p_t$-spectra produced in $AA$ collision at high and middle energies and mid-rapidity is given. The satisfactory description of experimental data on these spectra in $pp$ and $AA$ collisions within the offered approach is shown.
