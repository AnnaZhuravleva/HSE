An analysis is performed to constrain the $W'$ boson production using the measurement of the s-channel single top quark production cross section. Both phenomenological and statistical approaches are examined and results are presented. In the best case, $W'$ bosons that interact only to the right-handed fermions are excluded below 1390 GeV. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the measured cross section of the s-channel single top quark production from the colliders is used to rule out part of the phase space of the $W'$ boson.
