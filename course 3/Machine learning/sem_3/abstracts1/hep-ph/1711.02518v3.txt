Thanks to the remarkable achievements of LHC, a great amount of data on baryons is accumulated, it is believed that the time for precisely studying baryons especially that involving heavy quarks b and c, has come. By analyzing the data, the quark-diquark structure which has been under acute dispute, can receive a stringent test. In this work the decay widths of weak transitions $\Sigma_b\to \Sigma^*_c+X$ are calculated in terms of the light front quark model. To carry out the calculations, the quark-diquark picture where the axial-vector diquark made by two light quarks serves as a spectator in the concerned processes, is employed. The calculations are done in the framework of the light front quark model (LFQM). Concretely, we first construct the vertex functions for $\Sigma^{(*)}_c$ and $\Sigma_b$, then deduce the relevant form factors which can be reduced to the Isgur-Wise functions under the heavy quark limit. Our numerical results indicate that semi-leptonic and non-leptonic decays of $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma^{(*)}_c+X$ where $X$ stands for either leptons $l\bar\nu$ or mesons, can be measured at the RUN-II stage of LHC with sufficient accuracy. By a symmetry consideration, we suggest to measure $\Omega_b\to\Omega^*_c$ transitions for further testifying the quark-diquark picture.
