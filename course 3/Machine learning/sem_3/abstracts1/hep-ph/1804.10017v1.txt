We present the key features relevant to the automated computation of all the leading- and next-to-leading order contributions to short-distance cross sections in a mixed-coupling expansion, with special emphasis on the first subleading NLO term in the QCD+EW scenario, commonly referred to as NLO EW corrections. We discuss, in particular, the FKS subtraction in the context of a mixed-coupling expansion; the extension of the FKS subtraction to processes that include final-state tagged particles, defined by means of fragmentation functions; and some properties of the complex mass scheme. We combine the present paper with the release of a new version of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, capable of dealing with mixed-coupling expansions. We use the code to obtain illustrative inclusive and differential results for the 13-TeV LHC.
