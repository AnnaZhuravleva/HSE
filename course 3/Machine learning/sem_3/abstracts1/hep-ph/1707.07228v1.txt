Using the chiral unitary approach in coupled channels and $SU(3)$ symmetry we describe the production of $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ in the $\chi_{c1} \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction, recently performed by the BESIII collaboration. A very strong peak for the $a_0(980)$ can be seen in the $\eta\pi$ invariant mass, while clear signals for the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ appear in the one of $\pi^+\pi^-$. Next, we make predictions for the analogous decay $\eta_c \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$, which could also be measured experimentally. We discuss the differences of these reactions which are interesting to test the picture where these scalar mesons are dynamically generated from the interaction of pairs of pseudoscalars.
