We analyze the hidden charm $P$-wave tetraquarks in the diquark model, using an effective Hamiltonian incorporating the dominant spin-spin, spin-orbit and tensor interactions. We compare with other $P$-wave system such as $P$-wave charmonia and the newly discovered $\Omega_c$ baryons, analysed recently in this framework. Given the uncertain experimental situation on the $Y$ states, we allow for different spectra and discuss the related parameters in the diquark model. In addition to the presently observed ones, we expect many more states in the supermultiplet of $L=1$ diquarkonia, whose $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers and masses are worked out, using the parameters from the currently preferred $Y$-states pattern. The existence of these new resonances would be a decisive footprint of the underlying diquark dynamics.
