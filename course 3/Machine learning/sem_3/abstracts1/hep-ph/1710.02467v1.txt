The extension of the standard model (SM) by a Higgs portal scalar field is one the simplest dark matter theories. We present here the first results for a global fit to this model using the global and beyond the SM inference tool (GAMBIT). This software enables the combination of dark matter constraints in a statistically consistent manner. In total 15 parameters are varied and the parameter space explored using four different scanning algorithms. The viable parameter space is reduced from previous studies of this model due to the inclusion of the latest direct detection constraints.
