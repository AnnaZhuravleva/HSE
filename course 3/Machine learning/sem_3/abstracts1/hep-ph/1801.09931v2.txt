We embed $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry into the minimal seesaw formalism, where two right-handed neutrinos are added to the Standard Model of particle physics. Assuming that both the left- and right-handed neutrino fields transform under $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry, we obtain the required forms of the neutrino Dirac mass matrix and the Majorana mass matrix for the right-handed neutrinos. To investigate the neutrino phenomenology at low energies, we first consider the breaking of $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry due to the renormalization group running, and then systematically study various breaking schemes by introducing explicit breaking terms at high energies.
