We calculate the next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the production of a photon pair in association with zero, one and two jets at the LHC. We use GoSam and Sherpa to obtain the results in a fully automated way. For a typical set of fiducial cuts the electroweak corrections lead to a modification of the total cross section of up to 3 per cent, depending on the jet multiplicity. We find substantial contributions in differential distributions, leading to tens of per cent corrections for phase space regions within the reach of the LHC. Furthermore we investigate the importance of photon induced processes as well as subleading contributions. Photon induced processes are found to be negligible, subleading contributions can have a sizeable impact however they can be removed by appropriate phase space cuts.
