The renormalization group (RG) equation is first used to sum all leading-logarithmic, next-to-leading logarithmic etc. contributions to the decay rate $\Gamma$ for the process $b \rightarrow u\ell^-\overline{\nu}_\ell$ when using minimal subtraction. Next, all logarithmic contributions to $\Gamma$ are summed, leaving $\Gamma$ in terms of the log-independent contributions and the renormalization group functions as well as a mass scale set by the pole mass $m_{\rm{pole}}$ for the $b$ quark. The implicit and explicit dependence of $\Gamma$ on the renormalization induced mass scale $\mu$ (which is non-physical and arbitrary) cancels. The renormalization scheme (RS) dependence of $\Gamma$ is considered, and two particular renormalization schemes suggested. Both of these leave $\Gamma$ dependent on $m_{\rm{pole}}$ and a set of RS invariant parameters $\tau_i$ and $\sigma_i$.
