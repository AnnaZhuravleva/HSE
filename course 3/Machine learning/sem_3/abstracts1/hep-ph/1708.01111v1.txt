We recall the motivations for the Compositeness Standard Model(CSM) concept, its precise description, the procedures for its applications and the particular constraints that it requires. We present its most spectacular predictions for typical processes observable at present and future colliders. To the previous results we add the treatment of the inclusive processes $e^+e^- \to H,Z,W~or~t+ anything$.
