We develop a formalism where the hard and soft pomeron contributions to high energy scattering arise as leading Regge poles of a single kernel in holographic QCD. The kernel is obtained using effective field theory inspired by Regge theory of a 5-d string theory. It describes the exchange of higher spin fields in the graviton Regge trajectory that are dual to glueball states of twist two. For a specific holographic QCD model we describe Deep Inelastic Scattering in the Regge limit of low Bjorken x, finding good agreement with experimental data from HERA. The observed rise of the effective pomeron intercept, as the size of the probe decreases, is reproduced by considering the first four pomeron trajectories. In the case of soft probes, relevant to total cross sections, the leading hard pomeron trajectory is suppressed, such that in this kinematical region we reproduce an intercept of 1.09 compatible with the QCD soft pomeron data. In the spectral region of positive Maldelstam variable t the first two pomeron trajectories are consistent with current expectations for the glueball spectrum from lattice simulations.
