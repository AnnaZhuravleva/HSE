Edge effects in spectra of non-dipole radiation from ultra-relativistic electrons passing through various finite targets are analyzed from a unified point of view. Examples include radiation in a finite magnet, bremsstrahlung at double scattering, and bremsstrahlung in an amorphous plate. A generalization of the encountered spectral decomposition property is proposed. The relevance of phenomena of jet-interjet radiation interference and electron time delay in the target is emphasized. Features produced by them in the radiation spectra are discussed.
