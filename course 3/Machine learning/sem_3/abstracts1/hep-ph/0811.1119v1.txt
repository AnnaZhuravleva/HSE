The discrepancy on Li^7 and Li^6 abundances between the observational data and the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory prediction has been a nagging problem in astrophysics and cosmology, given the highly attractive and succesful Big Bang paradigm. One possible solution of this lithium problem is through hadronic decays of a massive metastable particle which alter the primordial element abundances. We explore this possibility using gravitino dark matter framework in which the next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) is typically long-lived. We found that stop NLSP can provide an attractive solution to the lithium problem.
