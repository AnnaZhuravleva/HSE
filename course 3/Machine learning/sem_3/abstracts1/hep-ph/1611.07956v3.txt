Within the extension of MSSM by two right handed neutrinos, which masses are degenerate at tree level, we address the issue of leptogenesis. Investigating the quantum corrections in details, we show that the lepton asymmetry is induced at 1-loop level and decisive role is played by the tau lepton Yukawa coupling. On a concrete and predictive neutrino model, which enables to predict the CP violating $\delta $ phase and relate it to the cosmological CP asymmetry, we demonstrate that the needed amount of the baryon asymmetry is generated via the resonant leptogenesis.
