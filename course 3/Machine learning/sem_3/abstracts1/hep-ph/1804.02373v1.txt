We establish model independent bounds on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau-lepton using the two-photon processes $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ and $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-\gamma$. We use ${\cal L}=10, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000 \hspace{0.8mm}fb^{-1}$ of data collected with the future $e^+e^-$ linear collider such as the CLIC at $\sqrt{s}=380, 1500, 3000 \hspace{0.8mm}GeV$ and we consider systematic uncertainties of $\delta_{sys}=0, 3, 5\hspace{1mm}\%$. Precise bounds at $95\%$ C. L. on the anomalous dipole moments to the tau-lepton $-0.00015\leq \tilde{a}_\tau \leq 0.00017$ and $|\tilde{d}_\tau(ecm)|=9.040\times 10^{-19}$ are set from our study. Our results show that the processes under consideration are a very good prospect for probing the dipole moments of the tau-lepton at the future $e^+e^-$ linear collider at the $\gamma\gamma$ mode.
