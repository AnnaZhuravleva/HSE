We show that a proposal which involves an effective radius derived from an effective potential that includes a linear extra-potential may solve both the proton and deuteron size puzzle. Moreover, this solution preserves the e-{\mu} universality and helps to solve the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon too. Still, it is consistent with the rms magnetic radius of the proton and deuteron, the rms charge radius of both the ordinary and muonic C12 as well as the kaonic and pionic X-rays spectroscopy.
