Non-zero leptonic CP phases in the neutrino sector are clear evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model and have many implications in particle physics and cosmology. Some clues to maximal Dirac CP violation $\delta_{CP}=3\pi/2$ are reviewed. An approach to connect the Dirac CP violation phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy in terms of the measurement of CP asymmetry is proposed. Under appropriate requirements for baseline distance and beam energy, the problem of neutrino mass hierarchy can be revealed at maximal Dirac CP violation. General allowed parameter spaces are investigated, within which the two unknown neutrino issues, mass hierarchy and Dirac CP violation, can be solved simultaneously. The abilities of addressing the mass hierarchy of current long baseline neutrino experiments are also discussed.
