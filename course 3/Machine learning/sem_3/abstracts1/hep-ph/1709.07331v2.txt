We study the pair-production process in the presence of two counterpropagating linearly polarized short laser pulses. By means of a nonperturbative technique, we take into account the full coordinate dependence of the external field going beyond the dipole and standing-wave approximations. In particular, we analyze the momentum distribution of particles created. It is demonstrated that the spatial variations of the laser pulses may play a crucial role. The more accurate treatment reveals a number of prominent features: the pair-production probabilities become considerably smaller, the quantitative behavior of the momentum spectra changes dramatically, and the pulse shape effects become much less pronounced. The results of our study are expected to be very important for future theoretical and experimental investigations.
