The axion causes two serious cosmological problems, domain wall and isocurvature perturbation problems. Linde pointed that the isocurvature perturbations are suppressed when the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar field takes a large value $\sim M_{\rm pl}$ (Planck scale) during inflation. In this case, however, the PQ field with large amplitude starts to oscillate after inflation and large fluctuations of the PQ field are produced through parametric resonance, which leads to the formation of domain walls. We consider a supersymmetric axion model and examine whether domain walls are formed by using lattice simulation. It is found that the domain wall problem does not appear in the SUSY axion model when the initial value of the PQ field is less than $10^3\times v$ where $v$ is the PQ symmetry breaking scale.
