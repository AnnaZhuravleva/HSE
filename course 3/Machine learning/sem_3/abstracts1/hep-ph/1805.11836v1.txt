In this article, we present the charged and neutral current coherent pion production in the neutrino-nucleus interaction in the resonance region using the formalism based on the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) theorem which relates the neutrino-nucleus cross section to the pion-nucleus elastic cross section. The pion nucleus elastic cross section is calculated using the Glauber model approach. We calculate the integrated cross sections for neutrino-carbon, neutrino-iron and neutrino-oxygen scattering. The results of integrated cross-section calculations are compared with the measured data
