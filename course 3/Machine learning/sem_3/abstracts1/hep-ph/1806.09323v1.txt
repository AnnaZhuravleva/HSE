The present paper incorporates the effects induced by massless spectator quarks in the renormalization group improved Wilson coefficients associated to the ${\cal O}(1/m^3)$ spin-dependent heavy quark effective theory Lagrangian operators. The computation is carried out in Coulomb gauge with leading logarithmic precision. The result completes the Lagrangian to $\mathcal{O}(1/m^3)$ with that accuracy.
