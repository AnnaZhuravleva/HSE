We consider forward inclusive production of two quarks in the high energy p-A collisions in the CGC formalism. We demonstrate that the production cross-section is determined by the convolution of the proton generalized double transverse momentum-dependent distribution (2GTMD) functions with two independent eikonal scattering amplitudes: the product of two dipoles and a quadrupole. We explicitly demonstrate that the quadrupole amplitude term accounts for all the (initial and final state) effects of quantum statistics for identical fermions, and the correlations due to these effects. We also demonstrate that the effects due to quantum statistics (entirely encoded in the quadrupole) are parametrically leading contributions to the correlated particle production at large $N_c$. For non-identical quarks the quadrupole term also leads to correlated production which has characteristics similar to the HBT effect.
