Models with an orbifolded universal extra dimension receive important loop-induced corrections to the masses and couplings of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles. The dominant contributions stem from so-called boundary terms which violate KK number. Previously, only the parts of these boundary terms proportional to $\ln(\Lambda R)$ have been computed, where $R$ is the radius of the extra dimension and $\Lambda$ is cut-off scale. However, for typical values of $\Lambda R \sim 10 \cdots 50$, the logarithms are not particularly large and non-logarithmic contributions may be numerically important. In this paper, these remaining finite terms are computed and their phenomenological impact is discussed. It is shown that the finite terms have a significant impact on the KK mass spectrum. Furthermore, one finds new KK-number violating interactions that do not depend on $\ln(\Lambda R)$ but nevertheless are non-zero. These lead to new production and decay channels for level-2 KK particles at colliders.
