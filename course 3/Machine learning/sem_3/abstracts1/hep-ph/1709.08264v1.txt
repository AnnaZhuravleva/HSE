It has been known that a tension between the mass-squared differences obtained from the solar neutrino and KamLAND experiments may be solved by introducing the Non-Standard flavor-dependent Interaction (NSI) in neutrino propagation. We discuss the possibility to test such a hypothesis by the future long baseline neutrino experiments T2HKK and DUNE. Assuming that NSI does not exist, we give the excluded region in the ($\epsilon_D$, $\epsilon_N$)-plane, where $\epsilon_D$ and $\epsilon_N$ are the parameters which appear in the solar neutrino analysis with NSI. It is found that the best-fit value from the solar neutrino and KamLAND data (global analysis) can be tested at more than 10$\sigma$ (3$\sigma$) by the two experiments for most the parameter space.
