We explore the sparticle spectroscopy of the supersymmetric SU(5) model with non-universal gaugino masses in light of latest experimental searches. We assume that the gaugino mass parameters are independent at the GUT scale. We find that the observed deviation in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be explained in this model. The parameter space that explains this deviation predicts a heavy colored sparticle spectrum whereas the sleptons can be light. We also find a notable region of the parameter space that yields the desired relic abundance for dark matter. In addition, we analyze the model in light of latest limits from direct detection experiments and find that the parameter space corresponding to the observed deviation in the muon anomalous magnetic moment can be probed at some of the future direct detection experiments.
