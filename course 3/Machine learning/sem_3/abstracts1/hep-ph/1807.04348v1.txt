We present a technique for infrared subtraction in next-to-leading order QCD calculations that preserves the virtuality of resonant propagators. The approach is based on the pseudo-dipole subtraction method first proposed by Catani and Seymour in the context of identified particle production. As a first application, we compute ee -> WWbb, which is dominated by top-quark pair production above the threshold. We compare the efficiency of our approach with a calculation performed using the standard dipole subtraction technique.
