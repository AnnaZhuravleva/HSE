We consider a dark matter (DM) model that arises from the interplay of two simplified dark matter models, namely the doublet-triplet fermion model and the doublet-triplet scalar model. Despite being excellent exponents of the WIMP paradigm, the physics related to DM in each of these models fails at the same time to account for neutrino masses. It turns out that from the combination of these two models it is possible to generate neutrino masses at one-loop level in the four topologies that are realizations of the Weinberg operator for neutrino masses at one-loop. In this work, we combine both models focusing mostly on fermionic dark matter lying at the electroweak scale. We analyze the impact of the extra charged fields on the Higgs diphoton decay and find that, thanks to the presence of the charged scalars, it is possible to have a viable DM region at the electroweak scale.
