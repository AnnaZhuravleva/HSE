The $D_{s0}^*(2317) D$ and $D_{s1}^*(2460) D^*$ heavy meson systems can exchange a kaon that is emitted in S-wave owing to the opposite intrinsic parity of the $D_{s0}^*$($D_{s1}^*$) and $D$($D^*$) mesons. As a consequence of the mass difference of the $D_{s0}^*$($D_{s1}^*$) and $D$($D^*$) mesons, the range of the kaon exchange potential will be significantly longer than expected, corresponding to an effective mass of about $200\,{\rm MeV}$. The potential will be very strong: the strength of the interaction is proportional to $(m_{D_{s0}} - m_D)^2 / f_{\pi}^2$ and $(m_{D_{s1}} - m_{D^*})^2 / f_{\pi}^2$. This combination of range and strength almost guarantees the existence of $D_{s0}^*(2317) D$ and $D_{s1}^*(2460) D^*$ bound states with $J^P = 0^{-}$ and $J^P = 0^{-}, 1^{-}, 2^{-}$ respectively. Concrete calculations indicate a binding energy of $6^{+7}_{-4}\,{\rm MeV}$ and $7^{+8}_{-5}\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively. The $D_{s0}^*(2317) D$ and $D_{s1}^*(2460) D^*$ molecules have manifestly exotic flavour quantum numbers: $C=2$, $S=-1$ and $I=1/2$. We expect the existence of bottom counterparts composed of the $B B_{s0}$ and $B^* B_{s1}^*$ mesons, which will be more bound and have a richer spectrum that might include a shallow P-wave state and an excited S-wave state.
