The 21-cm electromagnetic wavelength from the hyperfine interaction in hydrogen has an important role in cosmology unique method for probing of the universe prior to the star formation era. The QCD axion with mass ${\bf m_a \simeq 5.7 \mu eV}$ (with a Compton wavelength close to 21 cm) can serve as Bose-condensate dark matter. We propose that the resonant emission of axions induced by the Bose-condensate axion dark matter in hydrogen atoms causes a lowering of their spin temperature and can explain the stronger than expected absorption of 21-cm light reported by the EDGES collaboration.
