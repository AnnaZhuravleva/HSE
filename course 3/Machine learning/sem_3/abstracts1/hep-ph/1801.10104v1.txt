We construct a conformal version of a general multi-Higgs-doublet model with additional right-handed neutrino gauge-singlets. Assuming a minimal extension of the scalar sector by a real singlet field, we show that the resulting model achieves the same attractive properties as the non-conformal theory, combining the seesaw mechanism and higher-order mass production to generate naturally light neutrino masses. Starting with dimensionless couplings only, all masses and energy scales in the theory (including the heavy Majorana masses and the electroweak scale) are obtained from dimensional transmutation via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. A characteristic feature of the conformal model is the appearance of the scalon in the scalar spectrum.The mass of this particle, which can be expressed in terms of the masses of the other particles in the theory, is produced at the one-loop level. We establish a connection between the large seesaw scale and a suppression of the scalon interactions. The positivity condition for the squared scalon mass requires sufficiently large masses of the additional Higgs bosons balancing the contributions of the heavy neutrinos.
