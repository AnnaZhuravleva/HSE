The dominant contribution to the Higgs production in association with bottom quark pair at the LHC is gluon-gluon fusion parton subprocess. We present a complete calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak (EW) corrections to this channel. The other small contributions with quarks in the initial state are calculated at tree level. We find that the NLO EW corrections can suppress the leading order (LO) contributions significantly.
