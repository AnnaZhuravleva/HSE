Following the unexpected theoretical discovery of a mass dimension one fermionic quantum field of spin one half, we now present first results on two _local_ versions. The Dirac and Majorana fields of the standard model of particle physics are supplemented by their natural counterparts in the dark matter sector. The possibility that a mass dimension transmuting symmetry may underlie a new standard model of particle physics is briefly suggested.
