We studied the effects of the Tsallis distribution on the transverse momentum fluctuation in high energy collisions. The parton-hadron duality and the Bose-Einstein type correlation between partons were assumed. The fluctuation was calculated in the boost-invariant picture for the expectation value used in the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and for the expectation value used in the Tsallis nonextensive statistics. It was shown that the fluctuation is a function of $\eta$ which is the ratio of the inverse temperature to the correlation length. We found the following points: (1) the fluctuation depends on the form of the distribution and depends weakly on the definition of the expectation value used in the statistics,(2) the fluctuation increases as the entropic parameter value of the Tsallis distribution increases, and (3) the variation of the fluctuation as a function of the entropic parameter for the expectation value used in the Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics is larger than that for the expectation value used in the Tsallis nonextensive statistics in the wide range of $\eta$.
