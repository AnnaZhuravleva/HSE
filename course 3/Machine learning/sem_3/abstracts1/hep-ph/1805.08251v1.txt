We propose a unified setup for dark matter, inflation and baryon asymmetry generation through the neutrino mass seesaw mechanism. Our scenario emerges naturally from an extended gauge group containing $B-L$ as a non-commutative symmetry, broken by a singlet scalar that also drives inflation. Its decays reheat the universe, producing the lightest right-handed neutrino. Automatic matter parity conservation leads to the stability of an asymmetric dark matter candidate, directly linked to the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.
