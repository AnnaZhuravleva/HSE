An overview of flavour physics and CP-violating phenomena is presented. The Standard Model quark-mixing mechanism is discussed in detail and its many successful experimental tests are summarized. Flavour-changing transitions put very stringent constraints on new-physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model framework. Special attention is given to the empirical evidences of CP violation and their important role in our understanding of flavour dynamics. The current status of the so-called flavour anomalies is also reviewed.
