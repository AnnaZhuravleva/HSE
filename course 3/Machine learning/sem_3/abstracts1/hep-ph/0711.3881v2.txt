Dark matter (comprising a quarter of the Universe) is usually assumed to be due to one and only one weakly interacting particle which is neutral and absolutely stable. We consider the possibility that there are several coexisting dark-matter particles, and explore in some detail the generic case where there are two. We discuss how the second dark-matter particle may relax the severe constraints on the parameter space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, as well as other verifiable predictions in both direct and indirect search experiments.
