Up to now, the $N^*$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilations has been studied only around charmonium region. Charmonium decays to $N^*$s are analogous to (time-like) EM form factors in that the charm quark annihilation provides a nearly pointlike (ggg) current. Complementary to other sources, such as $\pi N$, $eN$ and $\gamma N$ reactions, this new source for $N^*$ spectroscopy has a few advantages, such as an isospin filter and a low spin filter. The experimental results on $N^*$ from $e^+e^-$ annihilations and their phenomenological implications are reviewed. Possible new sources on $N^*$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilations are discussed.
