In this paper, we present the computation of the Higgs boson pair production cross section, both inclusive as well as differential on the invariant mass distribution, at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD including effects of new physics beyond the standard model. We parametrize the effects of new physics with the relevant dimension 6 operators in a standard model effective field theory (EFT) approach and examine their phenomenology. The dependence of the NNLO $K$-factor on the EFT couplings is analysed, finding that, while rather flat for a number of EFT coefficients, it can considerably differ from the standard model value in some particular regions of the parameter space. We present explicit examples of (almost) degeneracy in the NNLO cross-section with respect to the anomalous couplings, showing that the invariant mass distribution has a much larger sensitivity to phenomena beyond the standard model and can be used as a tool to discriminate their effect.
