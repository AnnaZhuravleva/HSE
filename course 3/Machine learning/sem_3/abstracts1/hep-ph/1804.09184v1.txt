We generalize the scalar triplet neutrino mass model, the type II seesaw. Requiring fine-tuning and arbitrarily small parameters to be absent leads to dynamical lepton number breaking at the electroweak scale and a rich LHC phenomenology. A smoking gun signature at the LHC that allows to distinguish our model from the usual type II seesaw scenario is identified. Besides, we discuss other interesting phenomenological aspects of the model such as the presence of a massless Goldstone boson and deviations of standard model Higgs couplings
