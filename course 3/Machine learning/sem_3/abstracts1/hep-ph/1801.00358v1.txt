The phase transition from hadronic matter to chirally-symmetric quark-gluon plasma is expected to be a rapid crossover at zero quark chemical potential ($\mu$), becoming first order at some finite value of $\mu$, indicating the presence of a critical point. Using a three-flavor soft-wall model of AdS/QCD, we investigate the effect of varying the light and strange quark masses on the order of the chiral phase transition. At zero quark chemical potential, we reproduce the Columbia Plot, which summarizes the results of lattice QCD and other holographic models. We then extend this holographic model to examine the effects of finite quark chemical potential. We find that the the chemical potential does not affect the critical line that separates first-order from rapid crossover transitions. This excludes the possibility of a critical point in this model, suggesting that a different setup is necessary to reproduce all the features of the QCD phase diagram.
