The solution of the phenomenological problems of technicolor (TC) models may reside in the different dynamical behavior of the technifermions self-energy appearing in walking (or quasi-conformal) theories. Motivated by recent results where it is shown how the boundary conditions (bc) of the anharmonic oscillator representation of the Schwinger-Dyson gap equation (SDE) to $SU(N)$ are directly related with the mass anomalous dimensions, and different bc cause a change in the ultraviolet asymptotic behavior of the self-energies, in this work we verify that it is possible to have a hard technifermion self-energy in TC models originated through radiative corrections coming from the interactions mediated by the new massive neutral and charged gauge bosons, $Z'$ and $U^{\pm\pm}$ in the context of a 331-TC model.
