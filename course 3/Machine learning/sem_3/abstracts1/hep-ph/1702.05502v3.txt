It has been shown that AdS/CFT calculations can reproduce certain exclusive 2->2 cross sections in QCD at high energy, both for near-forward and for fixed-angle scattering. In this paper, we extend prior treatments by using AdS/CFT to calculate the inclusive single-particle production cross section in QCD at high center-of-mass energy. We find that conformal invariance in the UV restricts the cross section to have a characteristic power-law falloff in the transverse momentum of the produced particle, with the exponent given by twice the conformal dimension of the produced particle, independent of incoming particle types. We conclude by comparing our findings to recent LHC experimental data from ATLAS and ALICE, and find good agreement.
