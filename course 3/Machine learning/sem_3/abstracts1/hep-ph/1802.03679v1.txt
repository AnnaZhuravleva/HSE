The light Higgsino search is a crucial test for the criteria of the naturalness in supersymmetry while at the same time, the direct production of light Higgsino is also known as one of most challenging SUSY searches at the LHC. The lack of visible leptons due to the compressed spectrum and their small production rates limit their discovery potential in both mono-jet plus MET as well as the weak boson fusion production. The signal prediction is usually within the background systematic uncertainties. We study the search of the light Higgsinos at the future Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) at CERN. The light Higgsinos will be produced in pair through weak boson fusion with controlled background at this $e-p$ collider. For the Higgsino of 150 GeV, the $S/B$ ratio can be enhanced to be around 7%. However, due to the small production rate, the discovery still requires huge luminosity. We find the Higgsino of 135(155)~GeV can be reached at 2$\sigma$ level with a luminosity $1(3)~\text{ab}^{-1}$ respectively.
