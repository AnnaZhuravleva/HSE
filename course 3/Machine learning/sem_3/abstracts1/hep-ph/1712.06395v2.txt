The production of the $\rho^o$- meson in the inclusive proton-proton scattering $p_A+p_B\to \rho^o+X$ is studied using extension of parton model according to generalized vector meson dominance model (GVMD) in region of small $Q^2=m_{\rho^o}^2$ and $\rho^o$-meson transverse momentum $\le 1-2GeV/c$. The realistic description of the experimental cross sections of $p_A+p_B\to \rho^o+X$ for $4.9\le \sqrt{s}\le 65 GeV$ is achieved using an isotropic distribution of the $\rho^o$-meson. The resulting density matrix allows one to select values of the quark masses, which lead to the isotropic distribution of the emitted meson. It is demonstrated that the same cross sections of the reaction $p_A+p_B\to\rho^o +X$ for the isotropic distribution of the $\rho^o$-meson can be obtained with different sets of the quark masses and corresponding coupling constants of the quark-meson vertex functions.
