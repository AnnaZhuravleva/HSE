The electromagnetic properties of the tetraquark state $Z_c(3900)$ are investigated in the diquark-antidiquark picture and its magnetic and quadrupole moments are extracted. To this end, the light-cone QCD sum rule in electromagnetic background field is used. The magnetic and quadrupole moments encode the spatial distributions of the charge and magnetization in the particle. The result obtained for the magnetic moment is quite large and can be measured in future experiments. We obtain a nonzero but small value for the quadrupole moment of $Zc(3900)$ indicating a nonspherical charge distribution.
