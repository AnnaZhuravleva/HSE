Using the Belle data on the decay $\Upsilon(10860)\to \Upsilon(1S)f_0(980)\to\Upsilon(1S)\pi^+\pi^-$, we estimate the fraction of the process $\Upsilon(10860)\to\Upsilon(1S)f_0(980)\to \Upsilon(1S)\eta\pi^0$, caused by the mixing of $a^0_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances that breaks the isotopic invariance due to the $K^+$ and $K^0$ meson mass difference. With an instantaneous luminosity of $8\times10^{35}$ cm$^2\cdot$\,s$^{-1}$ at the SuperKEKB collider, one can collect with the Belle II detector about a hundred $\Upsilon(10860)\to\Upsilon(1S)\eta\pi^0$ events in the narrow region of the $\eta\pi^0$ invariant mass near the $K\bar K$ thresholds in a time roughly spent on the present Belle experiment.
