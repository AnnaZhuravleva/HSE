We propose a neutrinophilic two Higgs doublet model with hidden local $U(1)$ symmetry, where active neutrinos are Dirac type, and a fermionic DM candidate is naturally induced as a result of remnant symmetry even after the spontaneous symmetry breaking. In addition, a physical Goldstone boson is arisen as a consequence of two types of gauge singlet bosons and contributes to the DM phenomenologies as well as additional neutral gauge boson. Then we will analyze the relic density of DM within the safe range of direct detection searches, and show the allowed region of dark matter mass.
