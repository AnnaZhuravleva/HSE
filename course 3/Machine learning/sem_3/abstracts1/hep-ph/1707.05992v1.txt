The combined HERA data for the inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) cross sections for the momentum transfer $Q^2 > 1$ GeV$^2$ are fitted within the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) framework at next-to-leading order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy, complemented by a QCD-inspired parameterisation of twist 4 corrections. A modified form of the input parton density functions is also included, motivated by parton saturation mechanism at small Bjorken $x$ and at a low scale. These modifications lead to a significant improvement of the data description in the region of low $Q^2$. For the whole data sample, the new benchmark NNLO DGLAP fit yields $\chi^2$ / d.o.f. $\simeq 1.2$ to be compared to 1.5 resulting from the standard NNLO DGLAP fit. We discuss the results in the context of the parton saturation picture and describe the impact of the higher-twist corrections on the derived parton density functions. The resulting description of the longitudinal proton structure function $F_L$ is consistent with the HERA data. Our estimates of higher-twist contributions to the proton structure functions are comparable to the leading-twist contributions at low $Q^2 \simeq 2$ GeV$^2$ and $x \simeq 10^{-5}$. The $x$-dependence of the twist 4 corrections obtained from the best fit is consistent with the leading twist 4 quasi-partonic operators, corresponding to an exchange of four interacting gluons in the $t$-channel.
