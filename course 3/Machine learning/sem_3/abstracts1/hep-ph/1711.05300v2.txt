We consider Mirror Twin Higgs models in which the breaking of the global symmetry is realized linearly. In this scenario, the radial mode in the Higgs potential is present in the spectrum, and constitutes a second portal between the twin and SM sectors. We show that a study of the properties of this particle at colliders, when combined with precision measurements of the light Higgs, can be used to overdetermine the form of the scalar potential, thereby confirming that it possesses an enhanced global symmetry as dictated by the Twin Higgs mechanism. We find that, although the reach of the LHC for this state is limited, future linear colliders will be able to explore a significant part of the preferred parameter space, allowing the possibility of directly testing the Twin Higgs framework.
