We derive the effective Hamiltonian of simple atomic system by using the Non-Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (NRQED) approach, which is based on scattering matching method. At $m\alpha^6$ order, the correction terms are coincide with Pachucki's work, which is obtained by using Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This work could be an insurance cross-checking and alternative way to calculate higher-order energy corrections to the simple atomic system with the method of Pachuck.
