We introduce the semiclassical Wehrl entropy for the nucleon as a measure of complexity of the multiparton configuration in phase space. This gives a new perspective on the nucleon tomography. We evaluate the entropy in the small-$x$ region and compare with the quantum von Neumann entropy. We also discuss the growth of entropy at small-$x$ and argue that it eventually saturates due to the Pomeron loop effect.
