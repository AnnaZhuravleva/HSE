We propose a hybrid mediation and hybrid supersymmetry breaking. In particular the RG-invariant anomaly mediation is considered. Together with additional gravity mediation the slepton tachyon problem of anomaly mediation is solved automatically. The special properties are that all of color sparticles masses fall into several TeV region due to the large $m_0$ and $m_{32}$ which are well beyond the scope of current LHC Run II limits. Unlike the gauge mediation, the dark matter candidate is still the lightest neutralino and the correct dark matter relic density can be realized within the framework of mixed axion-wino dark matter. Due to the existence of multi-component of axion-wino dark matter, the direct detection cross section is suppressed to evade the tightest LUX, PandaX bound. Furthermore the fine-tuning is under control when the single scale supersymmetry breaking mechanism is adapted.
