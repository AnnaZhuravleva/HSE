In this followup to Phys. Rev. D 75, 053001 (2007) [arXiv:hep-ph/0608060] we report updated constraints on neutrino mass-mixing parameters, in light of recent neutrino oscillation data (KamLAND, SNO, and MINOS) and cosmological observations (WMAP 5-year and other data). We discuss their interplay with the final 0nu2beta decay results in 76-Ge claimed by part of the Heidelberg-Moscow Collaboration, using recent evaluations of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements, and their uncertainties. We also comment on the 0nu2beta limits in 130-Te recently set by Cuoricino, and on prospective limits or signals from the KATRIN experiment.
