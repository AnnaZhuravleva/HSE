A few multiplets that can be added to the SM contain a lightest neutral component which is automatically stable and provides allowed DM candidates with a non-standard phenomenology. Thanks to coannihilations, a successful thermal abundance is obtained for well defined DM masses. The best candidate seems to be a SU(2)_L fermion quintuplet with mass 4.4 TeV, accompanied by a charged partner 166 MeV heavier with life-time 1.8 cm, that manifests at colliders as charged tracks disappearing in pi^\pm with 97.7% branching ratio. The cross section for usual NC direct DM detection is sigma_SI = f^2 1.0 10^-43 cm^2 where f ~ 1 is a nucleon matrix element. We study prospects for CC direct detection and for indirect detection.
