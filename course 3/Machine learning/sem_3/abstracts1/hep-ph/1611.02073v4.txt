We consider a real scalar singlet field which provides a strong first-order electroweak phase transition via its coupling to the Higgs boson, and gives a $CP$ violating contribution on the top quark mass via a dimension-6 operator. We study the correlation between the baryon-to-entropy ratio produced by electroweak baryogenesis, and the gravitational wave signal from the electroweak phase transition. We show that future gravitational wave experiments can test, in particular, the region of the model parameter space where the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio can be obtained even if the new physics scale, which is explicit in the dimension-6 operator, is high.
