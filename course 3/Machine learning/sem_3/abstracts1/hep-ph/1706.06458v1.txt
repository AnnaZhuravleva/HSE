We have systematically investigated the decuplet (T) to octet (B) baryon ($T\rightarrow B\gamma$) transition magnetic moments to the next-to-next-to-leading order and electric quadruple moments to the next-to-leading order in the framework of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. Our calculation includes the contributions from both the intermediate decuplet and octet baryon states in the loops. Our results show reasonably good convergence of the chiral expansion and agreement with the experimental data. The analytical expressions may be useful to the chiral extrapolation of the lattice simulations of the decuplet electromagnetic properties.
