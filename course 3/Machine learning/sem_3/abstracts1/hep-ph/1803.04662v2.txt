We show that there is a constraint on the parameter space of two Higgs doublet models that comes from the existence of the stable vortex-domain wall systems. The constraint is quite universal in the sense that it depends on only two combinations of Lagrangian parameters and does not depend on how fermions couple to two Higgs fields. Numerical solutions of field configurations of domain wall-vortex system are obtained, which provide a basis for further quantitative study of cosmology which involve such topological objects.
