We study a system in which a quark-antiquark antenna emits a hard gluon in a medium, and an extra very soft emission afterwards. Considering the coherence effects in terms of the survival probability, we can describe the interaction of the $q\bar{q}g$ configuration with the medium. We extrapolate previous analyzes of the antenna radiation to the case of two hard splittings inside the medium, and prove that this generalization keeps back the picture of jet quenching with effective emitters in the parton QCD cascade.
