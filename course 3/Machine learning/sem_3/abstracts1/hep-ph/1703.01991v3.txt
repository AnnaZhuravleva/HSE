We present estimates of transverse single spin asymmetry (TSSA) in $p+p^\uparrow \rightarrow J/\psi+X$ within the colour evaporation model of charmonium production in a generalized parton model (GPM) framework, using the recently obtained best fit parameters for the gluon Sivers function (GSF) extracted from PHENIX data on TSSA in $p+p^\uparrow \to \pi^0+X$ at midrapidity. We calculate asymmetry at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV, and compare the results with PHENIX data on TSSA in the process $p + p^\uparrow \to J/\psi+X$. We also present estimates for asymmetry at $\sqrt{s} = 115 $ GeV corresponding to the proposed fixed target experiment AFTER@LHC and at $\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV corresponding to the higher RHIC energy. Finally, we investigate the effect of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution of the densities involved, on the asymmetry.
