The similarity of the observed mass densities of baryons and cold dark matter may be a sign they have a related origin. The baryon-to-dark matter ratio can be understood in the MSSM with right-handed (RH) neutrinos if CDM is due to a d = 4 flat direction condensate of very weakly coupled RH sneutrino LSPs and the baryon asymmetry is generated by Affleck-Dine leptogenesis along a d = 4 (H_{u}L)^2 flat direction. Observable signatures of the model include CDM and baryon isocurvature perturbations and distinctive long-lived NLSP phenomenology.
