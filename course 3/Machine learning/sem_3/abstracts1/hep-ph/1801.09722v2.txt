In this paper we consider an $S^{1}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ compactified flat extra dimensional scenario where all the standard model states can access the bulk and have generalised brane localised kinetic terms. The flavour structure of brane kinetic terms for the standard model fermions are dictated by stringent flavour bounds on the first two generations implying an $U(2)_{Q_L} \otimes U(2)_{u_R} \otimes U(2)_{d_R}$ flavour symmetry. We consider the constraints on such a scenario arising from dark matter relic density and direct detection measurements, precision electroweak data, Higgs physics and LHC dilepton searches. We discuss the possibility of such a scenario providing an explanation of the recently measured anomaly in $R_{K^{(\ast)}}$ within the allowed region of the parameter space.
