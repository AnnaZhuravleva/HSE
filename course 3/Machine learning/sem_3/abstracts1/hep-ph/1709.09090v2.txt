We propose a new way of explaining the observed Higgs mass, within the cosmological relaxation framework. The key feature distinguishing it from other scanning scenarios is that the scanning field has a non-canonical kinetic term, whose role is to terminate the scan around the desired Higgs mass value. We propose a concrete realisation of this idea with two new singlet fields, one that scans the Higgs mass, and another that limits the time window in which the scan is possible. Within the provided time period, the scanning field does not significantly evolve after the Higgs field gets close to the Standard Model value, due to particle production friction.
