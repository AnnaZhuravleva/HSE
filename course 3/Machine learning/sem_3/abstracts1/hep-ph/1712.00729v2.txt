Recently a new inflationary scenario was proposed in arXiv:1703.09020 which can be applicable to an inflaton having multiple vacua. In this letter, we consider a more general situation where the inflaton potential has a (UV) saddle point around the Planck scale. This class of models can be regarded as a natural generalization of the hillclimbing Higgs inflation (arXiv:1705.03696).
