Effects of strong longitudinal color fields (SCF) on the identified (anti)particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions in $ pp$ collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are investigated within the framework of the {\small HIJING/B\=B v2.0} model. The comparison with the experiment is performed in terms of the correlation between mean transverse momentum ($\mpt$) and multiplicity (N$_{ch}^*$) of charged particles at central rapidity, as well as the ratios of the $p_T$ distributions to the one corresponding to the minimum bias (MB) pp collisions at the same energy, each of them normalized to the corresponding charged particle density, for high multiplicity $\mbox{(HM, N$_{ch}>100$)}$ and low multiplicity $\mbox{(LM, N$_{ch}<100$)}$ class of events. The theoretical calculations show that an increase of the strength of color fields (as characterized by the effective values of the string tension $\kappa$), from $\kappa$ = 2 GeV/fm to $\kappa$ = 5 GeV/fm from LM to HM class of events, respectively, lead to a ratio at low and intermediate $p_T$ (i.e., \mbox{$ 1$GeV/{\it c} $< p_{T} < 6 $ GeV/{\it c}}) consistent with recent data obtained at LHC by the ALICE Collaboration.
