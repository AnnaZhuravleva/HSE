Three-dimensional tomography of hadrons can be investigated by generalized parton distributions (GPDs), transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions (TMDs), and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs). The GDA studies had been only theoretical for a long time because there was no experimental measurement until recently, whereas the GPDs and TMDs have been investigated extensively by deeply virtual Compton scattering and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. Here, we report our studies to determine pion GDAs from recent KEKB measurements on the differential cross section of $\gamma^* \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$. Since an exotic-hadron pair can be produced in the final state, the GDAs can be used also for probing internal structure of exotic hadron candidates in future. The other important feature of the GDAs is that the GDAs contain information on form factors of the energy-momentum tensor for quarks and gluons, so that gravitational form factors and radii can be calculated from the determined GDAs. We show the mass (energy) and the mechanical (pressure, shear force) form factors and radii for the pion. Our analysis should be the first attempt for obtaining gravitational form factors and radii of hadrons by analysis of actual experimental measurements. We believe that a new field of gravitational physics is created from the microscopic level in terms of elementary quarks and gluons.
