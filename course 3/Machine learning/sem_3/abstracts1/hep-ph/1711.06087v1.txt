An implementation of the Monte Carlo (MC) phase space generators coupled with adaptive MC integration/simulation program FOAM is presented. The first program is a modification of the classic phase space generator GENBOD interfaced with the adaptive sampling integrator/generator FOAM. On top of this tool the algorithm suitable for generation of the phase space for an reaction with two leading particles is presented (double-peripheral process with central production of particles). At the same time it serves as an instructive example of construction of a self-adaptive phase space generator/integrator with a modular structure for specialized particle physics calculations.
