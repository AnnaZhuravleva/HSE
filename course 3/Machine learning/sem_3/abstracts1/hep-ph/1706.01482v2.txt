Solitary waves propagation of baryonic density perturbations, ruled by the Korteweg--de Vries equation in a mean-field quark-gluon plasma model, are investigated from the point of view of the theory of information. A recently proposed continuous logarithmic measure of information, called configurational entropy, is used to derive the soliton width, defining the pulse, for which the informational content of the soliton spatial profile is more compressed, in the Shannon's sense.
