We propose a viable family symmetry $SU(3)_C\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_X$ model based on the $\Delta \left(27\right) \times Z_{3}\times Z_{16}$ discrete group, consistent with the SM fermion masses and mixings. In the proposed model the masses for the light active neutrinos are generated from an inverse seesaw mechanism caused by non renormalizable Yukawa operators and mediated by three very light Majorana neutrinos and the observed hierarchy of the Standard Model (SM) fermion masses and mixing angles arises from the breaking of the $\Delta \left( 27\right) \times Z_{3}\times Z_{16}$ discrete group at very high energy scale.
