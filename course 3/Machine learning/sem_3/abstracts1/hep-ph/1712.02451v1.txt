We compute a net electric current during a first order EWPT arising from the asymmetric propagation of fermion chiral modes due to a CP-violating interaction with the Higgs. The interaction is quantified in terms of a CP-violating phase in the bubble wall that separate both false and true vacuum phases. We comment on the possibility of this current to generate a seed magnetic field and its implications for primordial magne- togenesis in the early Universe.
