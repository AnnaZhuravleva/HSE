The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ({\eta}/s) of quark gluon plasma produced in ultra- relativistic heavy-ion collisions has been studied from the energy loss of heavy quarks in QGP medium. We have also studied the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio ({\zeta}/s) and fluidity measure(F) of the medium using the obtained {\eta}/s values. In addition to that, we have estimated the heavy quark bound state potential (V) inside this medium. Our finding of {\eta}/s agrees well with the results obtained by Lattice QCD (LQCD) and functional renormalization group technique.
