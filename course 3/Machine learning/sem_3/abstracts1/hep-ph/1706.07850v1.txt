Beyond the attractive strong potential needed for hadronic bound states, strong interactions are predicted to provide repulsive forces depending on the color charges involved. The repulsive interactions could in principle serve for particle acceleration with highest gradients in the order of GeV/fm. Indirect evidence for repulsive interactions have been reported in the context of heavy meson production at colliders. In this contribution, we sketch a thought experiment to directly investigate repulsive strong interactions. For this we prepare two quarks using two simultaneous deep inelastic scattering processes off an iron target. We discuss the principle setup of the experiment and estimate the number of electrons on target required to observe a repulsive effect between the quarks.
