We study the temperature dependence of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density for the LQCD-contrasted hadron resonance gas of different finite system-sizes, which may represent the final state hadronic matter, formed in systems of ultra-relativistic collisions. The transport coefficient reaches the lowest common value, for the systems of different sizes of thermalized hadron gas, near the critical temperature $T_{c}$ of the QCD crossover.
