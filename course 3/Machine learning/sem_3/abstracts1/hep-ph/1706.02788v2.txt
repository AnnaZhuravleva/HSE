We study the Regge-like spectra of light mesons in a relativized quark model. An analytical mass formula is presented for the light unflavored mesons with the help of auxiliary field method, by which a quasi-linear Regge-Chew-Frautschi plot is predicted for the orbitally excited states. We show that the trajectory slope is proportional to the inverse confining parameter $1/a$ up to a factor depending on the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$ when the orbital quantum number $L$ is large. The result is tested against the experimental data of the spectra of the meson families $\pi/b$,$\rho/a$,$\eta/h$ and $\omega/f$ in the ($L$,$M^{2}$) planes, with the fitted parameters consistent with that in the literatures.
