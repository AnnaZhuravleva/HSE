New experiments designed to discover a weakly interacting dark matter (DM) particle via spin dependent scattering can distinguish models of electroweak symmetry breaking. The plane of spin dependent versus spin independent DM scattering cross sections is a powerful model diagnostic. We detail representative predictions of mSUGRA, singlet extended SM and MSSM, a new Dirac neutrino, Littlest Higgs with T-parity (LHT) and Minimal Universal Extra Dimensions (mUED) models. Of these models, the nMSSM has the largest spin dependent (SD) cross section. It has a very light neutralino which would give lower energy nuclear recoils. The Focus Point region of mSUGRA, mUED and the right handed neutrino also predict a very large SD cross section and predict a large signal of high energy neutrinos in the IceCube experiment from annihilations of dark matter in the Sun. We also describe a model independent treatment of the scattering of DM particles of different intrinsic spins.
