Recently the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) has reported an excess in the electron-positron flux of the cosmic rays which is interpreted as a dark matter particle with the mass about $1.5$ TeV. We come up with a leptophilic $Z'$ scenario including a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate which beside explaining the observed DAMPE excess, is able to pass various experimental/observational constraints including the relic density value from the WMAP/Planck, the invisible Higgs decay bound at the LHC, the LEP bounds in electron-positron scattering, the muon anomalous magnetic moment constraint, Fermi-LAT data, and finally the direct detection experiment limits from the XENON1t/LUX. By computing the electron-positron flux produced from a dark matter with the mass about $1.5$ TeV we show that the model predicts the peak observed by the DAMPE.
