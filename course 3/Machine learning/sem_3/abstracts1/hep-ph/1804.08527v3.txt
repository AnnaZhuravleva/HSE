We present a full angular distribution of the four body $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda(\to N\pi)\ell^+\ell^-$ decay where the leptons are massive and the $\Lambda_b$ is unpolarized, in an operator basis which includes the Standard Model operators, new vector and axial-vector operators, and scalar and pseudo-scalar operators. The angular coefficients are expressed in terms of transversity amplitudes. We study several $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda(\to p\pi)\tau^+\tau^-$ observables in the Standard Model and in the presence of the new operators. For our numerical analysis, we use the form factors from lattice QCD calculations.
