We analyzed the evolution data of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment in terms of short-baseline active-sterile neutrino oscillations taking into account the theoretical uncertainties of the reactor antineutrino fluxes. We found that oscillations are disfavored at $2.6\sigma$ with respect to a suppression of the $^{235}\text{U}$ reactor antineutrino flux and at $2.5\sigma$ with respect to variations of the $^{235}\text{U}$ and $^{239}\text{Pu}$ fluxes. On the other hand, the analysis of the rates of the short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments favor active-sterile neutrino oscillations and disfavor the suppression of the $^{235}\text{U}$ flux at $3.1\sigma$ and variations of the $^{235}\text{U}$ and $^{239}\text{Pu}$ fluxes at $2.8\sigma$. We also found that both the Daya Bay evolution data and the global rate data are well-fitted with composite hypotheses including variations of the $^{235}\text{U}$ or $^{239}\text{Pu}$ fluxes in addition to active-sterile neutrino oscillations. A combined analysis of the Daya Bay evolution data and the global rate data shows a slight preference for oscillations with respect to variations of the $^{235}\text{U}$ and $^{239}\text{Pu}$ fluxes. However, the best fits of the combined data are given by the composite models, with a preference for the model with an enhancement of the $^{239}\text{Pu}$ flux and relatively large oscillations.
