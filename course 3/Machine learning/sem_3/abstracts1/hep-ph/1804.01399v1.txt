The differential cross section for elastic scattering of deuterons on electrons at rest is calculated taking into account the QED radiative corrections to the leptonic part of interaction. These model-independent radiative corrections arise due to emission of the virtual and real soft and hard photons as well as to vacuum polarization. We consider an experimental setup where both final particles are recorded in coincidence and their energies are determined within some uncertainties. The kinematics, the cross section, and the radiative corrections are calculated and numerical results are presented.
