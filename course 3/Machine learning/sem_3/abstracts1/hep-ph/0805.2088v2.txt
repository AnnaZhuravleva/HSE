We provide a bestiary of public codes and other algorithmic tools that can be used for analysing supersymmetric phenomenology. We also describe the organisation of the different tools and communication between them. Tools exist that calculate supersymmetric spectra and decay widths, simulate Monte Carlo events as well as those that make predictions of dark matter relic density or that predict precision electroweak or b-observables. Some global fitting tools for use in SUSY phenomenology are also presented. In each case, a description and a link to the relevant web-site is provided. It is hoped that this review could serve as an "entry-gate" and map for prospective users.
