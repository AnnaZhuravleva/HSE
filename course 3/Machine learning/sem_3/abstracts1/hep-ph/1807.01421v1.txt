We estimate the number of quark jets in QCD multi-jet final states at hadron colliders. In the estimation, we develop the calculation of jet rates into that of quark jet rates. From the calculation, we estimate the improvement on the signal-to-background ratio for a signal semi-analytically by applying quark/gluon discrimination, where the signal predicts many quark jets. We introduce a variable related to jet flavors in multi-jet final states and propose a data-driven method using the variable to reduce systematic uncertainties of analysis results. As the same with the semi-analytical result, the improvements on the signal-to-background ratio using the variable in Monte-Carlo analysis are estimated.
