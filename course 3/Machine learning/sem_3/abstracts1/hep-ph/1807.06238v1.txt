We review certain classes of iterated integrals that appear in the computation of Feynman integrals that involve elliptic functions. These functions generalise the well-known class of multiple polylogarithms to elliptic curves and are closely related to the elliptic multiple polylogarithms (eMPLs) studied in the mathematics literature. When evaluated at certain special values of the arguments, eMPLs reduce to another class of special functions, defined as iterated integrals of Eisenstein series. As a novel application of our formalism, we illustrate how a class of special functions introduced by Remiddi and one of the authors can always naturally be expressed in terms of either eMPLs or iterated integrals of Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup Gamma(6).
