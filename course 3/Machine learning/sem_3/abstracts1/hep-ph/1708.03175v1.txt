We study two nonets of excited vector mesons, predominantly corresponding to radially excited vector mesons with quantum numbers $n\hspace{0.08cm} ^{2S+1}L_{J}$ $=2^3S_1$ and to orbitally excited vector mesons with quantum numbers $n\hspace{0.08cm} ^{2S+1}L_{J}=1^3D_1$. We evaluate two types of decays of these mesons: into two pseudoscalar mesons and into a pseudoscalar and a ground-state vector meson. We compare the results with experimental data taken from PDG. We also make predictions for the strange-antistrange state in the $1^3D_1$ nonet denoted as $\phi(1930)$, which has not yet been discovered.
