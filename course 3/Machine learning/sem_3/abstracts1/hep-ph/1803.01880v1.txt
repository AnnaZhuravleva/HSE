A variety of experimental searches and theoretical efforts have constrained gluinos that undergo an all-hadronic decay with no missing energy, as can arise in R-parity violating or stealth supersymmetry. Although the gluino->jj decay is robustly excluded, there is gap in current experimental coverage for gluinos with masses between 51-76 GeV that decay into three light-flavor quarks. In this work, we probe this gap with published multi-jet data from the UA2 experiment. Despite setting the strongest current limit on this region, we find that UA2 data is unable to close this gap for gluino->jjj decays. In addition to this three-jet gap, we note an additional gap for all-hadronic gluino -> n parton decays with $n\geq 4$ for light gluinos (51 GeV < m < 300 GeV) not covered by the current search program.
