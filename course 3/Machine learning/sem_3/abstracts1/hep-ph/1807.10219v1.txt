We consider the flavor transformation of neutrinos through oscillatory matter profiles. We show that the neutrino oscillation Hamiltonian in this case describes a Rabi system with an infinite number of Rabi modes. We further show that, in a given physics problem, the majority of the Rabi modes have too small amplitudes to be relevant. We also go beyond the rotating wave approximation and derive the relative detuning of the Rabi resonance when multiple Rabi modes with small amplitudes are present. We provide an explicit criterion of whether an off-resonance Rabi mode can affect the parametric flavor transformation of the neutrino.
