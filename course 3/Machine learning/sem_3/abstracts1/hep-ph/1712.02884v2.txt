Double parton scattering events are directly sensitive to the correlations between two partons inside a proton and can answer fundamental questions on the connections between the proton constituents. In this chapter, the different types of possible correlations, our present knowledge of them, and the processes where they are likely to be important, are introduced and explained. The increasing integrated luminosity at the LHC and the refinements of the theory of double parton scattering, lead to interesting prospects for measuring, or severely constraining, two-parton correlations in the near future.
