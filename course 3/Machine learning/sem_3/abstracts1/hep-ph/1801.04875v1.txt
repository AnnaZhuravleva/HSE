We consider forward inclusive production of several quarks in the high energy p-A collisions in the CGC formalism. For three particle production we provide a complete expression in terms of multipole scattering amplitudes on the nucleus and multi particle generalized TMD's of the proton. We then calculate all the terms that are not suppressed by the factor of the area in four particle production, and generalize this result up to terms of order $1/N_c^2$ for arbitrary number of produced particles. Our results include the contribution of quantum interference effects both in the final state radiation (HBT) and in the initial projectile wave function (Pauli blocking).
