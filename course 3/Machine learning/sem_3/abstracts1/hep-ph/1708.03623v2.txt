The xFitter project (former HERAFitter project) is an open-source package that provides a framework for the determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton for many different kinds of analyses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). xFitter version 2.0.0 has recently been released, and offers an expanded set of tools and options. It incorporates experimental data from a wide range of experiments including fixed-target, Tevatron, HERA, and LHC. xFitter can analyze this data up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in perturbation theory with a variety of theoretical calculations including numerous methodological options for carrying out PDF fits and plotting tools which help visualise the results. In this contribution, a determination of the photon PDF from fits to recent ATLAS measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan dilepton production at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV using this framework is presented. The work presented here is based on the paper published here: Eur.Phys.J. C77 (2017) no.6, 400
