The main goal of this paper is a direct diagrammatic evaluation of the effective four-photon Lagrangian of the Euler-Heisenberg type for the quantum electrodynamics of massive charged vector bosons. This QED model is naturally embedded in the standard electroweak theory, and we have carried out the corresponding one-loop calculation in the unitary gauge. As far as we know, such a work has not been published before since usually the $R$-gauge techniques are preferred for the computation of loop Feynman diagrams. We have recovered the result obtained many years ago by Vanyashin and Terent'ev, who used a specific functional method. For completeness and for validation of our techniques, we have also redone the analogous calculations for scalar and spinor QED.
