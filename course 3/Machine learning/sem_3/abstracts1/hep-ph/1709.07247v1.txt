The heavy-flavour production at forward rapidity in $pp$ collisions at the LHC is a very useful tool to assess the gluon density at low momentum fraction $x$. In this work, the impact of heavy-flavour measurements of the LHCb at center-of-mass energy of $ \sqrt s= $7 TeV on parton distribution functions (PDFs) is studied. To this aim, the normalised LHCb cross sections of charm and beauty hadron production are included into two modern PDF sets CT14 and MMHT using the PDF profiling procedure. It is illustrated that the LHCb data impose tighter constraints on the gluon distributions at low $x$, down to $x \sim 10^{-6}$, the region that is currently not covered by other experimental data which CT14 and MMHT have used in their perturbative QCD fits. We also affirm that the LHCb data will affect the MMHT gluon distribution more than the CT14 one, if they are included in their global analyses.
