Photons traveling in a background electromagnetic field may bend via vacuum polarization effect with the background field. The bending in a Coulomb field by a heavy nucleus is small even at a large atomic number, rendering it difficult to detect experimentally. As an amplifying mechanism of the effect we consider the bending of light traveling in a chamber of Coulomb gas. The Gaussian nature of the bendings in the gas increases the total bending angle in proportion to the square root of the number of nuclei in the gas. The enhancement can be orders of magnitude over the bending by a single nucleus at small impact parameter, which may help experimental observation of the Coulombic bending.
