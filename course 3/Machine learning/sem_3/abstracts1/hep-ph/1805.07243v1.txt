We calculate the matching of the transversity and pretzelosity transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMD) on transversity collinear distribution at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We find that the matching coefficient for pretzelosity distribution is zero, despite the matrix element for it is nontrivial. This result suggests that the pretzelosity matches a twist-4 distribution. The matching for transversity TMD distributions is provided for both parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions cases.
