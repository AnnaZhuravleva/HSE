We investigate the electromagnetic properties of possible charm-strange pentaquarks in the framework of the light-cone QCD sum rule using the photon distribution amplitudes. In particular, by calculating the corresponding electromagnetic form factors defining the radiative transitions under consideration we estimate the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the pentaquark systems of a charm, an anti-strange and three light quarks. We observe that the values of magnetic dipole moments are considerably large, however, the quadrupole moments are very small. Any future measurements of the electromagnetic parameters under consideration and comparison of the obtained data with the theoretical predictions can shed light on the quark-gluon organization as well as the nature of the pentaquarks.
