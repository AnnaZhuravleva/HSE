We study how vortices in dense superfluid hadronic matter can connect to vortices in superfluid quark matter, as in rotating neutron stars, focusing on the extent to which quark-hadron continuity can be maintained. As we show, a singly quantized vortex in three-flavor symmetric hadronic matter can connect smoothly to a singly quantized non-Abelian vortex in three-flavor symmetric quark matter in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, without the necessity for boojums appearing at the transition. This smooth transition supports the possibility of quark-hadron continuity between the hadronic and quark phases at finite angular momentum. Although non-Abelian vortices appear to carry color flux, in a gauge invariant description of such vortices, as we construct, their color does not appear in physical observables.
