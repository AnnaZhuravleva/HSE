We investigate the chiral phase transition of the strongly interacting matter at nonzero temperature and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ within an extended (2+1) flavor Polyakov constituent quark-meson model which incorporates the effect of the vector and axial vector mesons. The parameters of the model are determined by comparing masses and tree-level decay widths with experimental values. We examine the restoration of the chiral symmetry by monitoring the temperature evolution of condensates. We study the $T-\rho_B$ phase diagram of the model and find that a critical end point exists, although at very low density.
