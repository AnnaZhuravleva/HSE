The probabilities of point events in space 3 + 1 obey an equation of Dirac type. Masses, moments, energies, spins, etc. are the parameters of the probability distribution of such events. The terms and equations of quark-gluon theories turn out theoretically probabilistic terms and theorems. Confinement and asymptotic freedom are explained by behaviour of such probabolities. And here we have the probabilistic foundations of the theory of gravitation. Knowledge of the elements of linear algebra and differential calculus is sufficient to understand the content of this article.
