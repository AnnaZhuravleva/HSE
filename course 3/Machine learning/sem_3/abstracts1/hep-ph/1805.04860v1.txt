We propose an extension of the standard model (SM) by including a dark sector comprising of heavy right-handed neutrinos, a singlet scalar and a singlet Dirac fermion representing the dark matter (DM). In the early Universe, the CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy right-handed neutrinos in the dark sector generate a net B-L asymmetry. The latter is then transported to the visible sector via a dimension eight operator which conserves $B-L$ symmetry and is in thermal equilibrium above the sphaleron decoupling temperature. The singlet scalar mixes with the SM Higgs and pave a path for annihilating the symmetric component of the DM. We predict that the efficient annihilation of symmetric component of the DM requires the mass of singlet scalar to be exactly twice the mass of DM. Then we discuss the constraints on singlet-doublet Higgs mixing from invisible Higgs decay, signal strength at LHC and direct search of DM at terrestrial laboratories. At tree level the neutrinos are shown to be massless since the symmetry of dark sector forbids the interaction of right-handed neutrinos with the SM particles. However, at one loop level the neutrinos acquire sub-eV masses as required by the oscillation experiments.
