We investigate the phenomenology of scalar singlet dark matter candidates that couple dominantly to the Standard Model via a Yukawa interaction with the top quark and a colored vector-like fermion. We estimate the viability of this vector-like portal scenario with respect to the most recent bounds from dark matter direct and indirect detection, as well as to dark matter and vector-like mediator searches at colliders. Moreover, we take QCD radiative corrections into account in all our theoretical calculations. This work complements analyses related both to models featuring a scalar singlet coupled through a vector-like portal to light quarks, and to scenarios in which the dark matter is a Majorana singlet coupled to the Standard Model through scalar colored particles (akin to simplified models inspired by supersymmetry). Our study puts especially forward the complementarity of different search strategies from different contexts, and we show that current experiments allow for testing dark matter masses ranging up to 700 GeV and mediator masses ranging up to 6 TeV.
