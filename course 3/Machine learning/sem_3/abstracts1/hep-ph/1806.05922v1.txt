Taking into account the contributions of sterile and heavy neutrinos, the probabilities of both transitions and preservation of various types of active neutrinos are considered. Modified graphical dependencies for the probability of appearance of electron neutrinos/antineutrinos in muon neutrino/antineutrino beams as a function of distance and other model parameters at different neutrino energies, and also as a function of the ratio of the distance to the neutrino energy are obtained. It is shown that in the case of mixing of a certain type between light and heavy neutrinos it is possible to explain the anomalies of neutrino data at short distances. In this paper, a new parametrization proposed by the authors for the mixing matrix of light and heavy neutrinos with allowance for violation of CP-invariance is used. The theoretical results obtained for modified oscillations characteristics of active neutrinos at short distances can be used for interpretation and prediction of results of ground-based experiments on search of sterile and heavy neutrinos, as well as for the analysis of some astrophysical data.
