We compare and review the theoretical predictions for the $\bar{K}N$ and $\eta N$ elastic amplitudes where sizable variations are found among the considered approaches, especially at subthreshold energies relevant for studies of kaonic atoms and meson-nuclear quasi-bound states. Conditions for an appearance of dynamically generated states in meson-baryon multi-channel interactions are established and discussed for the $\bar{K}N$ and $\eta N$ systems.
