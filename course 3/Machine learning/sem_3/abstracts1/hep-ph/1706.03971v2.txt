We consider the ${\mathcal O}(1/m)$ and the spin-independent momentum-dependent ${\mathcal O}(1/m^2)$ quasi-static energies of heavy quarkonium (with unequal masses). They are defined nonperturbatively in terms of Wilson loops. We determine their short-distance behavior through ${\mathcal O}(\alpha^3)$ and ${\mathcal O}(\alpha^2)$, respectively. In particular, we calculate the ultrasoft contributions to the quasi-static energies, which requires the resummation of potential interactions. Our results can be directly compared to lattice simulations. In addition, we also compare the available lattice data with the expectations from effective string models for the long-distance behavior of the quasi-static energies.
