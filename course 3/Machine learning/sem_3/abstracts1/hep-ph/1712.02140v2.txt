In this paper we investigate the projected sensitivity to effective dark matter (DM) - diboson interaction during the high luminosity $Z$-pole and 240 GeV runs at the proposed Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). The proposed runs at the 91.2 GeV $e^+e^-$ center of mass energy offers an interesting opportunity to probe effective dark matter couplings to the $Z$ boson, which can be less stringently tested in non-collider searches. We investigate the prospective sensitivity for dimension 6 and dimension 7 effective diboson operators to scalar and fermion dark matter. These diboson operators can generate semi-visible $Z$ boson decay, and high missing transverse momentum mono-photon signals that can be test efficiently at the CEPC, with a small and controllable Standard Model $\gamma\bar{\nu}\nu$ background. A projected sensitivity for effective $\gamma Z$ coupling efficient $\kappa_{\gamma Z}< (1030$ GeV$)^{-3}$, $(1970$ GeV$)^{-3}$ for scalar DM, $\kappa_{\gamma Z}< (360$ GeV$)^{-3}$, $(540$ GeV$)^{-3}$ for fermion DM are obtain for 25 fb$^{-1}$ and 2.5 ab$^{-1}$ $Z$-pole luminosities assuming the optimal low dark matter mass range. In comparison the effective DM-diphoton coupling sensitivity $\kappa_{\gamma \gamma}< (590$ GeV$)^{-3}$ for scalar DM, $\kappa_{\gamma \gamma}< (360$ GeV$)^{-3}$ for fermion DM are also obtained for a 5 ab$^{-1}$ 240 GeV Higgs run. We also compare the CEPC sensitivities to current direct and indirect search limits on these effective DM-diboson operators.
