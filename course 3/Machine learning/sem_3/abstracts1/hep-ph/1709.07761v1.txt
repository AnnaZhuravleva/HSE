We present POWHEG predictions for photon-jet correlations at RHIC and the LHC. We show that the total transverse-momentum spectrum of photons and jets is modified not only by medium, but also by higher-order QCD effects, as is the distribution in their relative azimuthal angle. At the LHC, photon-jet measurements in the forward region allow to probe parton momentum fractions of lead ions down to 10$^{-4}$.
