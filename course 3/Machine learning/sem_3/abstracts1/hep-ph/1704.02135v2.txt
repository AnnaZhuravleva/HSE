In a previous work a novel parametrization was proposed for the $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ total cross section. Here, results are presented for analysis updated with taken into account the recent data from accelerator experiments as well as from cosmic ray measurements. The analytic parameterizations suggested within axiomatic quantum field theory (AQFT) provide the quantitative description of energy dependence of global scattering observables with robust values of fit parameters. Based on the fit results the estimations are derived for the total cross section and the $\rho$ parameter in elastic $pp$ scattering at various $\sqrt{s}$ up to energy frontier $\sqrt{s}=10$ PeV which can be useful for present and future hadron colliders as well as for cosmic ray measurements at ultra-high energies.
