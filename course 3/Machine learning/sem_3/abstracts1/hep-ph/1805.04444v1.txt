We study clustering of baryons at the freeze-out point of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using a Walecka-Serot model for the nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction we analyze how the modified/critical $\sigma$ mode---responsible for the NN attraction---allows for clustering of nucleons when the system is close to a possible critical point of QCD. We investigate clusters of few nucleons, and also the internal cluster configuration when the system is long lived. For realistic heavy-ion collisions we study to how extend such clusters can be formed in a finite time, and perform the statistical analysis of cumulants and higher-order moments (skewness and kurtosis) for collisions at the Beam Energy Scan of RHIC.
