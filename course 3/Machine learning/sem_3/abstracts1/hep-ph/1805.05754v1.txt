The properties of the Higgs boson, h(125), observed in LHC data are consistent with Standard Model predictions. Consequently, if additional Higgs bosons are present, then the direction of h(125) in field space must be approximately aligned with the direction of the Higgs vacuum expectation value. One way to achieve approximate Higgs alignment is in the decoupling limit, where all additional Higgs scalars are significantly heavier than the h(125). In this presentation, the viability of approximate Higgs alignment without decoupling is addressed.
