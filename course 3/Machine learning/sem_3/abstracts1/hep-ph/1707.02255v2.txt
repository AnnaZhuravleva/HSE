We perform a complete and systematic calculation of the octet-baryon form factors within the fully covariant approach of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory at O(p^3). We use the extended on-mass shell renormalization scheme, and include explicitly the vector mesons and the spin-3/2 decuplet intermediate states. Comparing these predictions with data including magnetic moments, charges, and magnetic radii, we determine the unknown low-energy constants, and give predictions for yet unmeasured observables, such as the magnetic moment of the Sigma^0, and the charge and magnetic radii of the hyperons.
