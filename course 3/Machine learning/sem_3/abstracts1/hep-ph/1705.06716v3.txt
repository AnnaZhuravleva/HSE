Cross section predictions of W and Z bosons in association with jets (up to 6 jets, $W\to\ell^{\pm}\nu$ and $Z\to\ell^{\pm}$ where $\ell^{\pm}$=$e^{\pm}$ or $\mu^{\pm}$) in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV is performed using Alpgen MC generator with CTEQ6L1 leading order parton distribution function. In addition, W and Z boson cross sections are obtained up to next to next to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections using MCFM MC generator. To validate the predictions, a detailed comparison of NNLO QCD calculations with 8 TeV CMS results for total cross section is performed and a fiducial region is further defined to make a comparison of predictions with 7 TeV and 13 TeV ATLAS results.
