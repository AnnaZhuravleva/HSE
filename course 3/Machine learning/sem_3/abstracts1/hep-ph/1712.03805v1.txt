We estimate the electrical and thermal conductivities of hot and dense hadron gas in relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation. We estimate the thermodynamical quantities of hadron gas within the ambit of hadron resonance gas model. The repulsive interactions among the hadrons are parametrized through excluded volume corrections in the ideal hadron resonance gas. The relaxation time for all the hadrons are estimated assuming the constant cross-section with uniform as well as mass dependent hard core radius. We compare our results with various existing results. Further, it is seen that along the freeze out curve, the electrical conductivity ($\sigma/T$) is almost constant apart from an initial monotonic decrease with $\sqrt{s}$. In contrast, the thermal conductivity ($ \kappa/T^2 $) shows a minimum and diverges at large $\sqrt{s}$.
