Bose-Einstein correlations in proton-proton collisions is an effective tool to study the space structure of the production amplitude. Usually rather simple parametrization of particle-emission distribution function has been used - exponential or gaussian form. However if one consider a particle source as an expanding media the symmetric Levy distribution as the generalization exponential can be used.Then additional parameter - the index of stability - will appear. All parameters dependencies on the charged particle density and on the mean transverse momentum of the pion/hadron in the correlated pair are investigated.
