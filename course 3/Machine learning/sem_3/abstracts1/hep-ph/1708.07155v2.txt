Near a critical value of the wino mass where there is a zero-energy S-wave resonance at the neutral-wino-pair threshold, low-energy winos can be described by a zero-range effective field theory (ZREFT) in which the winos interact nonperturbatively through a contact interaction and charged winos also have electromagnetic interactions. At energies near the wino-pair thresholds, the Coulomb interaction from photon exchange between charged winos must also be treated nonperturbatively. The parameters of ZREFT can be determined by matching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for winos interacting through a potential due to the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons. With Coulomb resummation, ZREFT at leading order gives a good description of the low-energy two-body observables for winos.
