We develop a systematic procedure of constructing lepton mass matrices that satisfy all the experimental constraints in the light lepton sector of the minimal left-right symmetric model with type-I seesaw dominance. This method is unique since it is applicable to the most general cases of type-I seesaw with complex electroweak vacuum expectation values in the model. With this method, we investigate the TeV-scale phenomenology in the normal hierarchy without fine-tuning of model parameters, focusing on the charged lepton flavour violation, neutrinoless double beta decay, and electric dipole moments of charged leptons. We examine the predictions for typical ranges of associated observables such as branching ratios of rare lepton decays, and study how those experimental constraints affect the model parameter space. The most notable result is that the regions of parameter space that allow small light neutrino masses have been constrained by the present experimental bounds from charged lepton flavour violation. Furthermore, we also find that the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino should be relatively small in order to satisfy those experimental constraints.
