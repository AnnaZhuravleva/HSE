The mass spectra and decay properties of heavy quarkonia are computed in nonrelativistic quark-antiquark Cornell potential model. We have employed the numerical solution of Schr\"odinger equation to obtain their mass spectra using only four parameters namely quark mass ($m_c$, $m_b$) and confinement strength ($A_{c\bar c}$, $A_{b\bar b}$). The spin hyperfine, spin-orbit and tensor components of the one gluon exchange interaction are computed perturbatively to determine the mass spectra of excited $S$, $P$, $D$ and $F$ states. Digamma, digluon and dilepton decays of these mesons are computed using the model parameters and numerical wave functions. The predicted spectroscopy and decay properties for quarkonia are found to be consistent with available experimental observations and results from other theoretical models. We also compute mass spectra and life time of the $B_c$ meson without additional parameters. The computed electromagnetic transition widths of heavy quarkonia and $B_c$ mesons are in tune with available experimental data and other theoretical approaches.
