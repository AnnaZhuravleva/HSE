Warm dark matter (WDM) may resolve the possible conflict between observed galaxy halos and the halos produced in cold dark matter (CDM) simulations. Here we present an extension of MSSM to include WDM by adding a gauge singlet fermion, \bar{\chi}, with a portal-like coupling to the MSSM Higgs doublets. This model has the property that the dark matter is {\it necessarily warm}. In the case where M_{\bar{\chi}} is mainly due to electroweak symmetry breaking, the \bar{\chi} mass is completely determined by its relic density and the reheating temperature, T_R. For 10^2 GeV < T_{R} < 10^{5} GeV$, the range allowed by \bar{chi} production via thermal Higgs annihilation, the \bar{\chi} mass is in the range 0.3-4 keV, precisely the range required for WDM. The primordial phase-space density, Q, can directly account for that observed in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, Q \approx 5 x 10^{6}(eV/cm^3)/(km/s)^3,, when the reheating temperature is in the range T_R \approx 10-100 TeV, in which case M_{\bar{\chi}} \approx 0.45 keV. The free-streaming length is in the range 0.3-4 Mpc, which can be small enough to alleviate the problems of overproduction of galaxy substructure and low angular momentum of CDM simulations.
