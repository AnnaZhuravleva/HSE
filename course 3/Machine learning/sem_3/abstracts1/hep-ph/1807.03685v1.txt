We make the connection between certain deep learning architectures and the renormalisation group explicit in the context of QCD by using a deep learning network to construct a toy parton shower model. The model aims to describe proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. A convolutional autoencoder learns a set of kernels that efficiently encode the behaviour of fully showered QCD collision events. The network is structured so as to ensure self-similarity, and the number of trained network parameters is low. Randomness is introduced via a novel custom masking layer, which also preserves existing parton splittings by using layer-skipping connections. By applying a shower merging procedure, the network can be evaluated on unshowered events produced by a matrix element calculation. The trained network behaves as a parton shower that qualitatively reproduces jet-based observables.
