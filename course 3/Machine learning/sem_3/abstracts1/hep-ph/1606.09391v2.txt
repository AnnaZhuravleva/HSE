In this paper we consider the exclusive production of proton-antiproton pairs in the interaction between two quasireal photons in $e^+e^-$ collision. The differential and total cross section of the process $\gamma \gamma \to p\bar {p}$ at a beam energy of photons from 2.1 GeV to 4.5 GeV in the center-of-mass and for different values of $|cos\theta^{\ast}|$ is calculated. At energy $<\sqrt {s_{e^+e^-}}>$=197 \,\,GeV the total cross section process o0f the $e^+ +e^- \to e^+ +e^- +p +\bar {p}$ is calculated by the two-photon mechanism. The results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data.
