We propose a method to organize experimental data from particle collision experiments in a general format which can enable a simple visualisation and effective classification of collision data using machine learning techniques. The method is based on sparse fixed-size matrices with single- and two-particle variables containing information on identified particles and jets. We illustrate this method using an example of searches for new physics at the LHC experiments.
