The effects of dimension-eight operators giving rise to anomalous neutral triple gauge boson interactions of $Z\gamma\gamma$ and $Z\gamma Z$ vertices in $l^-l^+\gamma$ production ($pp\to l^-l^+\gamma$) are investigated at 100 TeV centre of mass energy of future circular hadron collider (FCC-hh). The transverse momentum of photon, invariant mass of $l^-l^+\gamma$ and angular distribution of charged lepton in the rest frame of $l^-l^+$ are considered in the analysis. The realistic detector effects are also included with Delphes simulation. Sensitivity limits obtained at 95\% C.L. for $C_{\widetilde B W}/\Lambda^4$ and $C_{B B}/\Lambda^4$ couplings are $[-0.52;0.52] ([-0.40;0.40] )$ TeV$^{-4}$, $ [-0.43;0.43]([-0.33;0.33]) $ TeV$^{-4}$ with $L_{int}$=1 (3) ab$^{-1}$, respectively. Our results are one order of magnitude better than current LHC results.
