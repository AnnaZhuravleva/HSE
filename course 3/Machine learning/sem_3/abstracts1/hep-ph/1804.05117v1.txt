We examine scenarios in which a dark sector (dark matter, dark radiation, or dark energy) couples to the active neutrinos. For light and weakly-coupled exotic sectors we find that scalar, vector, or tensor dark backgrounds may appreciably impact neutrino propagation while remaining practically invisible to all other phenomenological probes. The dark medium may induce small departures from the Standard Model predictions or even offer an alternative explanation of neutrino oscillations. While the propagation of neutrinos is affected in all experiments, atmospheric data currently represent the most promising probe of the new physics scale. We quantify the future sensitivity of the ORCA detector of KM3NeT and the IceCube experiment and find that all exotic effects can be constrained at the level of a few percent of the Earth matter potential, with couplings mediating $\mu$-neutrino transitions being most constrained. Long baseline experiments like DUNE may provide additional complementary information on the scale of the dark sector.
