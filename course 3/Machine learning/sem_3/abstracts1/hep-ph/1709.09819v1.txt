In the following work, we compute the positron production from branon dark matter annihilations in order to constrain extra-dimensional theories. By having assumed that the positron fraction measured by AMS-02 is well explained just with astrophysical sources, exclusion diagrams for the branon mass and the tension of the brane, the two parameters characterising the branon phenomenology become possible. Our analysis has been performed for a minimal and a medium diffusion model in one extra dimension for both pseudo-isothermal and Navarro Frenck White dark matter haloes. Our constraints in the dark matter mass candidate range between 200 GeV and 100 TeV. Combined with previous cosmological analyses and experimental data in colliders, it allows us to set bounds on the parameter space of branons. In particular, we have discarded regions in the mass-tension diagram up to a branon mass of 28 TeV for the pseudo-Isothermal prole and minimal diffusion, and 63 TeV for the Navarro-Frenck-White profile and medium diffusion.
