We examine scenarios in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), where pair-produced squarks and gluinos decay via two cascades, each ending in a stable neutralino as Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson, with mass spectra such that the missing transverse energy, $E_{T}^{\text{miss}}$, is very small. Performing two-dimensional parameter scans and focusing on the hadronic $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ decay giving a $b\bar{b}b\bar{b} + E_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ final state we explore the sensitivity of a current LHC general-purpose jets+$E_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ analysis (arXiv:1802.02110) to such scenarios.
