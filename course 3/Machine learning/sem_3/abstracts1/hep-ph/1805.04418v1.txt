Indirect signs of new physics beyond the Standard Model may be appearing in $B \to K^{(*)}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. If confirmed, the title question will be of paramount importance in determining the strategy for future colliders. We answer it by estimating the sensitivity to minimal, anomaly-compatible $Z^\prime$ and leptoquark models at the high luminosity LHC, 27 TeV HE-LHC, and 100 TeV FCC-hh; this conservative analysis outlines an upper bound on the available parameter space and the conditions for a reasonable guarantee of direct discovery.
