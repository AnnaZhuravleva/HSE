Precise measurements of spectra of cosmic ray electrons/positrons can effectively probe the nature of dark matter (DM) particles. In a class of models that DM particles first annihilate into a pair of intermediate particles which then decay into standard model particles, box-shaped spectra can be produced. Such energy spectra of cosmic rays are distinct from astrophysical backgrounds, and can probably be regarded as characteristic features of the DM annihilation. In this work, we search for such spectral feature in the total electron plus positron fluxes by AMS-02 and DAMPE. We find no significant signal of the DM annihilation into box-shaped electrons/positrons. The 95\% confidence level upper limits of the velocity-weighted cross section are derived, which range from $\sim 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for DM mass of 50 GeV to $\sim 10^{-24}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for DM mass of 10 TeV.
