We have systematically constructed the general structure of the gauge boson self-energy and the effective propagator in presence of a nontrivial background like hot magnetised material medium using \emph{three mutually orthogonal projection tensors}. The hard thermal loop approximation has been used for the heat bath to obtain various form factors associated with the two point function. We have analyzed the dispersion spectra of the gauge boson using the effective propagator both in weak and strong field approximation. The formalism is applicable to both QED and QCD. The presence of a heat bath usually breaks the Lorentz (boost) symmetry whereas that of magnetic field breaks the rotational symmetry in the system. The presence of only the thermal background leads to a longitudinal (plasmon) mode and a two-fold degenerate transverse mode. In presence of a hot but weakly magnetized background the degeneracy of the two transverse mode is lifted where one remains massive and the other one becomes massless. We also note that the plasmon mode also becomes massless in a hot magnetized medium. On the other hand, in strong field approximation the three modes behave like that of a free massless gauge boson in Lowest Landau Level due to the dimensional reduction.
