We perform a systematical investigation of the possible deuteron-like bound states with configuration $\Xi_{cc}N (\bar{N})$, where $N(\bar{N})$ denotes the nucleon (anti-nucleon), in the framework of the one-boson-exchange-potential model. In the spin-triplet sector we take into account both the ${}^3S_1$ and ${}^3D_1$ channels due to non-vanishing tensor force. There exist several candidates of the loosely bound molecular states for the $\Xi_{cc}N$ and $\Xi_{cc}\bar{N}$ systems, which lie below the threshold of $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$ or $\Lambda_c{\bar\Lambda}_c$. These molecular candidates may be searched for at Belle II and LHC in the near future.
