KKMC-hh is a precision event-generator for Z production and decay in hadronic collisions, which applies amplitude-level exponentiation to both initial and final state photon radiation, including perturbative residuals through order $\alpha^2 L$, together with electroweak matrix element corrections. We present results showing the effect of multi-photon radiation for cuts motivated by a recent ATLAS W-mass analysis. We also show preliminary untuned comparisons of the electroweak corrections of KKMC-hh to those of HORACE, which includes order $\alpha$ corrections with exponentiated final-state photon radiation.
