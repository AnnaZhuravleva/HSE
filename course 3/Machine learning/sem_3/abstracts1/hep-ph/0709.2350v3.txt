We study the cosmological constraints on unparticle interactions and the temperature of the Universe for the case where unparticle states can be modelled as continuous mass particles with lifetime > 1s. By considering thermal background quark decay to continuous mass scalars via a scalar operator of dimension d_{U}, we show that the condition that the Universe is not dominated by scalars at nucleosynthesis imposes a lower bound on the scale of the interaction of the unparticle sector, with M_{U} > 20-2600 TeV for \Lambda_{U} > 1 \TeV$, 1.1 < d_{U} < 2.0 and 2 < d_{BZ} < 4. The existence of a long-lived scalar sector also imposes an upper bound on the temperature of the Universe during radiation-domination, which can be as low as a TeV for M_{U} close to its lower bound.
