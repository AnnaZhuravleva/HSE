Certain models involving ALPs (axion-like-particles) allow for the coupling of scalars and pseudoscalars to fermions. A derivation of the total rate for production of massive scalars and pseudoscalars by an electron in a monochromatic, circularly-polarised electromagnetic background is presented. In addition, a derivation and the total rate for the decay of massive scalars and pseudoscalars into electron-positron pairs in the same electromagnetic background is given. We conclude by approximating the total yield of ALP production for a typical laser-particle experimental scenario.
