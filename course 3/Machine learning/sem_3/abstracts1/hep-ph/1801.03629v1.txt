Using Laplace transform techniques, I calculate the longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^{2})$ from the scaling violations of the proton structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^{2})$, and make a critical study of this relationship between the structure functions at leading order (LO) up to next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) analysis at small $x$. Furthermore, I consider heavy quark contributions to the relation between the structure functions, which leads to compact formula for $N_{f}=3+\mathrm{Heavy}$. The nonlinear corrections to the longitudinal structure function at LO up to NNLO analysis are shown in the $N_{f}=4$ (light quark flavor) based on the nonlinear corrections at $R=2$ and $R=4 GeV^{-1}$. The results are compared to experimental data of the longitudinal proton structure function $F_{L}$ in the range of $6.5 \leq Q^{2} \leq 800 GeV^{2}$.
