Relativistic bound state problem in hadron physics is studied. Mesons and their resonance excitations in the framework of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics (RQM) are investigated. Two-particle wave equation for the Lorentz scalar QCD inspired funnel-type potential with the coordinate dependent strong coupling $\alpha_\S(r)$ is derived. The concept of distance dependent particle mass is developed. Two exact asymptotic expressions for the system's squared mass are obtained and used to derive the meson interpolating complex-mass formula. Free particle hypothesis for the bound state is developed: quark and antiquark move as free particles in of the bound system. Practical applications of the model are given.
