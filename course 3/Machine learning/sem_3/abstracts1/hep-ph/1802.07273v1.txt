We propose using interferometry of circularly polarized light as a mechanism by which to test for axion dark matter. These interferometers differ from standard interferometers only by the addition of a few quarter waveplates to preserve the polarization of light upon reflection. We show that using current technology, interferometers can probe new regions of axion parameter space up to a couple orders of magnitude beyond current constraints.
