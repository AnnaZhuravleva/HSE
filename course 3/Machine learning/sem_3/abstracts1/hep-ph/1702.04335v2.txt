The universality of the weak interactions can be tested in semileptonic $b \to c$ transitions, and in particular in the ratios $R(D^{(*)}) \equiv \Gamma(B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau \nu )/\Gamma(B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell \nu )$ (where $\ell = \mu$ or $e$). Due to the recent differences between the experimental measurements of these observables by BaBar, Belle and LHCb on the one hand and the Standard Model predicted values on the other hand, we study the predicted ratios $R(D^{(*)}) = \Gamma(B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau +$ "missing" $)/\Gamma(B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell \nu )$ in scenarios with an additional sterile heavy neutrino of mass $\sim 1$ GeV. Further, we evaluate the newly defined ratio $R(0) \equiv \Gamma(B \to \tau +$ "missing" $)/\Gamma(B \to \mu \nu )$ in such scenarios, in view of the future possibilities of measuring the quantity at Belle-II.
