We propose a radiatively-induced neutrino mass model at one-loop level by introducing a pair of doubly-charged fermions and a few multi-charged bosons. We investigate the contributions of the model to neutrino masses, lepton-flavor violations, muon $g-2$, oblique parameters, and collider signals, and find a substantial fraction of the parameter space that can satisfy all the constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of detecting the doubly-charged fermions at the LHC.
