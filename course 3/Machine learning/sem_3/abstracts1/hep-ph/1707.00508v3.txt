We consider isosinglet scalar extension of a model with a Higgs democracy - multihiggs extension of the SM where each quark and lepton has its own Higgs isodoublet. The addition of light isosinglet scalar allows to solve both muon $g_{\mu}-2$ anomaly and dark matter problem. Also we point out that an extension of the model with $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ vector interaction allows not only explain muon $g_{\mu} - 2$ anomaly but also dark matter density.
