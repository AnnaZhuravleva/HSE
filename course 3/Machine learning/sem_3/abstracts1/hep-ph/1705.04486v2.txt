The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a future Higgs factory proposed by the Chinese high energy physics community. It will operate at a center-of-mass energy of 240-250 GeV. The CEPC will accumulate an integrated luminosity of 5 ab$^{\rm{-1}}$ in ten years' operation. With GEANT4-based full simulation samples for CEPC, Higgs boson decaying into electron pair is studied at the CEPC. The upper limit of ${\cal B}(H \rightarrow e^+ e^-)$ could reach 0.024\% at 95\% confidence level. The signal process is generated by MadGraph, with Initial State Radiation (ISR) implemented, as a first step to adjust MadGraph for a electron positron Collider.
