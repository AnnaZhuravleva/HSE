Exploiting an interplay of the Bethe-Salpeter equation enabling us to regard mesons as bound states of quark and antiquark and the Dyson-Schwinger equation controlling the dressed quark propagator, we amend existing studies of quarkonia by a comprehensive description of open-flavour mesons composed of all conceivable combinations of quark flavour. Employing throughout a fixed set of model parameters, we predict some basic characteristics of these mesons, i.e., their masses, leptonic decay constants and corresponding in-hadron condensates entering in a generalized formulation of the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation.
