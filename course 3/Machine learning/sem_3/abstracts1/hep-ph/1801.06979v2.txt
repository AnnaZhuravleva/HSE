We present a new cosmological model of the Universe based on the two discoveries: 1. cosmological constant is very small, and 2. Nature shows a new law in physics called "Multiple Point Principle" (MPP). The MPP predicts the two degenerate vacua of the Universe with VEV $v_1\approx 246$ Gev and $v_2\sim 10^{18}$ GeV, which provide masses of the Higgs boson and top-quark. A new cosmological model assumes the formation of two universal bubbles. The Universe at first stage of its existing is a bubble with a de-Sitter spacetime inside, having black-holes-hedgehogs as topological defects of the vacuum. Such a bubble has a "false vacuum" with VEV $v_2$, which decays very quickly. Cooling Universe has a new phase transition, transforming the "false" vacuum to the "true" (Electroweak) vacuum. Hedgehogs confined, and the universal bubble is transformed into the bubble having spacetime with FLRW-metric and the vacuum with new topological defects of $U(1)_{(el-mag)}$ group: magnetic vortices and Sidharth's pointlike defects. The problem of stability/metastability of the EW-vacuum is investigated. Noncommutativity of the vacua spacetime manifold is discussed. The prediction of a new physics is given by the future observations at LHC of the triplet $SU(2)$ Higgs bosons (at energies $E\sim 10$ TeV), and/or of the new bound states $6t + 6\bar t$ formed by top-antitop quarks (at $E\sim 1$ TeV). The problem "What comes beyond the Standard Model" is discussed at the end of this paper.
