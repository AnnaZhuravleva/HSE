Rapidity distributions of vector mesons are computed in dipole model proton-lead ultraperipheral collisions(UPCs) at the CERN Larger Hadron Collider(LHC). The dipole model framework is implemented in the calculations of cross sections in the photon-hadron interaction. The bCGC model and Boosted Gaussian wave functions are employed in the scattering amplitude. We obtain predictions of rapidity distributions of $J/\psi$ meson proton-lead ultraperipheral collisions. The predictions give a good descriptions to the experimental data of ALICE. The rapidity distributions of $\phi$, $\omega$ and $\psi(2s)$ mesons in proton-lead ultraperipheral collisions are also presented in this paper.
