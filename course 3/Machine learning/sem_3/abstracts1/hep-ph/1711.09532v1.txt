We study the exclusive semileptonic rare $B_c^+ \to D^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ decay in the framework of light-cone quark model. The transition form factors $f_{+}(q^2)$ and $f_{T}(q^2)$ are evaluated in the time-like region using the analytic continuation method in $q^{+} = 0$ frame. The analytic solutions of these form factors are compared with the results obtained from the double pole parametric form. The branching ratio for $B_c^+ \to D^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ decay is calculated and compared with the other theoretical model predictions. The predicted results in this model can be tested at the LHCb experiments in near future which will help in testing the unitarity of CKM quark mixing matrix, thus, providing an insight into the phenomenon of CP violation.
