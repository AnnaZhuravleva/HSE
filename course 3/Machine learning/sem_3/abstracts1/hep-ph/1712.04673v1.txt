The aim of present work is to consider in more details recently theoretically observed exotic "color charge glow" effect and possible physical effects related to ensembles of color charged particles on the classical level. We study ways of occurrence of "color charge glow" in arbitrary systems of point massive particles which could be split into elementary configurations like color charges and color dipoles. Also the impact of this effect on dynamics of such systems is studying. For the natural regularization of expressions we consider collisions of particles with given impact factor. We show that with reasonable values of impact factor collisions could be quite of "electrodynamical" (Coloumb-like) regime and the contribution of "glow" turns out to be suppressed in comparison with "electrodynamical" picture. It follows from the analysis of "color echo" effect that this result is still correct if we consider more complicated configurations of particles because hard gluon fields could arise only due to immediate collisions but not as a result of some effects like "color echo".
