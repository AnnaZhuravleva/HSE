We scrutinize the parameter space of the SM-like Higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) under current experimental constraints. The constraints are from (i) the precison electroweak data and various flavor observables; (ii) the direct 22 separate ATLAS searches in Run-1; (iii) the latest LHC Run-2 Higgs data and tri-lepton search of electroweakinos. We perform a scan over the parameter space and find that the Run-2 data can further exclude a part of parameter space. For the property of the SM-like Higgs boson, its gauge couplings further approach to the SM values with a deviation below 0.1\%, while its Yukawa couplings $hb\bar{b}$ and $h\tau\bar\tau$ can still sizably differ from the SM predictions by several tens percent.
