We have revisited the computations of the $L^{-}\to \ell^- \ell^{\prime -} \ell^{\prime +}$ ($L=\tau,\mu$; $\ell'=\mu, e$) decays in the Standard Model with non-vanishing neutrino masses. We were driven by a claimed unnaturally large branching ratio predicted for the $\tau^-\to \mu^- \ell^+ \ell^-$ ($\ell=\mu, e$) decays \cite{Pham:1998fq}, which was at odds with the corresponding predictions for the $\mu^-\to e^- e^-e^+$ processes \cite{Petcov:1976ff}. We confirm the latter calculation and -as a result of first keeping external momenta and masses in the computation of the dominant penguin and box diagrams- we find smaller branching fractions than in ref.~\cite{Petcov:1976ff} by a factor $\sim 16$ $(\sim 40)$ for muon (tau) decays. Therefore, we confirm that any future observation of such processes would be an unambiguous manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model.
