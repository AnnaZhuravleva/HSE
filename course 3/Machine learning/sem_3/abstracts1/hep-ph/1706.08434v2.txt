We propose a new framework, merging High Energy Factorization with final-state jet quenching effects due to interactions in a quark-gluon plasma, to compute di-jet rates at mid- and forward rapidity. It allows to consistently study the interplay of initial-state effects with medium interactions, opening the possibility for understanding the dynamics of hard probes in heavy-ion collisions and the QGP evolution in rapidity.
