We study the non-Breit-Wigner line-shape of the $\psi(3770)$ resonance, using an unitarized effective Lagrangian approach, including the one-loop effects of the nearby thresholds $D^+D^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0$. The model contains a single seed state, corresponding to a standard $\bar{c}c$ with predominant quantum numbers $1\ ^{3}D_{1}$. The loops of $D^+D^-$and $D^0\bar{D}^0$ are responsible for the distortion of the spectral function. A fit of the theoretical data to the total cross-section $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow D\bar{D}$ is performed with 28 data points and 4 parameters: strong and electromagnetic coupling constants, the bare mass of the $\psi(3370)$, and a form-factor parameter, leading to a good description of data ($\chi^{2}$/d.o.f. $\sim 0.86$). We then analyze various consequences of the fit, among which pole positions (which were not investigated in previous theoretical works), partial cross-sections, and leptonic decays. The first pole reads $3777-i12$ MeV, and it is in good agreement with the Particle Data Group (PDG) mass and width estimation for this state. Quite remarkably, there is also a second pole at $3741-i18$ MeV. This additional, dynamically generated, companion pole is responsible for the deformation of the left side of the line-shape. Its existence represents one of the main finding of this work. Moreover, the $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow D^0\bar{D}^0$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow D^+D^-$ cross sections turn out to be separately in good agreement with data. The width for the decay $\psi(3370)\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ is 113 eV, hence smaller than the PDG fit of $262\pm 18$ eV, yet in agreement with a recent experimental study. Finally, the final state rescattering effect is found to be small. The size of the wave-function is estimated within a Schr\"{o}dinger model to be around $0.93$ fm, a value that we relate to the form-factor of the effective field theoretical framework.
