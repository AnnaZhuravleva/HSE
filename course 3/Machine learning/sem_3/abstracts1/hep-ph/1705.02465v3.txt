The puzzle of $R(D^{(*)})$ associated with $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decay is addressed in the two-HIggs-doublet model. An anomalous coupling of $\tau$ to the charged Higgs is introduced to fit the data from BaBar, Belle, and LHCb. It is shown that all of the four types of the model yield similar values of the minimum $\chi^2$. Also shown is that the newly normalized $R(D^{(*)})$ with the branching ratio of $B\to\tau\nu$ decay exhibits much smaller minimum $\chi^2$.
