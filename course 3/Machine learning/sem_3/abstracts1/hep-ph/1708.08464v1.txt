In certain models of a QCD axion, finite density corrections to the axion potential can result in the axion being sourced by large dense objects. There are a variety of ways to test this phenomenon, but perhaps the most surprising effect is that the axion can mediate forces between neutron stars that can be as strong as gravity. These forces can be attractive or repulsive and their presence can be detected by Advanced LIGO observations of neutron star inspirals. By a numerical coincidence, axion forces between neutron stars with gravitational strength naturally have an associated length scale of tens of kilometers or longer, similar to that of a neutron star. Future observations of neutron star mergers in Advanced LIGO can probe many orders of magnitude of axion parameter space. Because the axion is only sourced by large dense objects, the axion force evades fifth force constraints. We also outline several other ways to probe this phenomenon using electromagnetic signals associated with compact objects.
