pySecDec is a program that numerically calculates dimensionally regularized integrals. We use pySecDec to compute QCD Laplace sum-rules for pseudoscalar (i.e., $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$) charmonium hybrids, and compare the results to sum-rules computed using analytic results for dimensionally regularized integrals. We find that the uncertainty introduced by the use of numerical integration methods is negligible compared to the uncertainty associated with the parameters of QCD (e.g., quark masses, the coupling constant, and condensate values) that are already present in the sum-rules.
