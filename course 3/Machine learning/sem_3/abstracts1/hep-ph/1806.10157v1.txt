We compute the leading-order evolution of parton fragmentation functions for all the Standard Model fermions and bosons up to energies far above the electroweak scale, where electroweak symmetry is restored. We discuss the difference between double-logarithmic and leading-logarithmic resummation, and show how the latter can be implemented through a scale choice in the SU(2) coupling. We present results for a wide range of partonic center-of-mass energies, including the polarization of fermion and vector boson fragmentation functions induced by electroweak evolution.
