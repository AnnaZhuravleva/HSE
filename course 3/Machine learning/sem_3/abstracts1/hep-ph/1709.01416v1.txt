We study the $\Lambda^+_c \to \pi^0 \phi p$ decay by considering a triangle singularity mechanism. In this mechanism, the $\Lambda^+_c$ decays into the $K^* \Sigma^*(1385)$, the $\Sigma^*(1385)$ decays into the $\pi^0 \Sigma$ (or $\Lambda$), and then the $K^* \Sigma$ (or $\Lambda$) interact to produce the $\phi p$ in the final state. This mechanism produces a peak structure around $2020$ MeV. In addition, the possibility that there is a hidden-strange pentaquark-like state is also considered by taking into account the final state interactions of $K^* \Lambda$, $K^* \Sigma$, and $\phi p$. We conclude that it is difficult to search for the hidden-strange analogue of the $P_c$ states in this decay. However, we do expect nontrivial behavior in the $\phi p$ invariant mass distribution. The predictions can be tested by experiments such as BESIII, LHCb and Belle-II.
