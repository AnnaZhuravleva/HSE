We propose a predictive inert 2 Higgs doublet model, where the Standard Model (SM) symmetry is extended by $S_{3}\otimes Z_{2}\otimes Z_{12}$ and the field content is enlarged by extra scalar fields, charged exotic fermions and two heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The charged exotic fermions generate a nontrivial quark mixing and provide one-loop-level masses for the first- and second-generation charged fermions. The masses of the light active neutrinos are generated from a one loop-level radiative seesaw mechanism. Our model successfully explains the observed SM fermion mass and mixing pattern.
