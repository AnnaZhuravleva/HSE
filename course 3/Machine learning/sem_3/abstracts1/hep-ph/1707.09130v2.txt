We study fermions in a magnetic field in a finite size cylinder. With the boundary condition for the fermion flux, we show that the energy spectra and the wave-functions are modified by the finite size effect; the boundary makes the degenerate Landau levels appear only partially for states with small angular momenta, while the boundary effect becomes stronger for states with large angular momenta. We find that mode accumulation at the boundary occurs for large angular momenta and the magnetic effect is enhanced on the boundary surface. Using a simple fermionic model, we quantify the magnetic catalysis, i.e. the magnetic enhancement of the fermion pair condensation, in a finite size cylinder. We confirm that the magnetic catalysis is strongly amplified at the boundary due to the mode accumulation.
