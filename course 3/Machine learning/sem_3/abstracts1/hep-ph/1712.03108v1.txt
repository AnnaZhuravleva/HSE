This article is devoted to systematic analysis of double charmonium production in exclusive $Z$ boson decays in the framework of Nonrelativistic Quantum Chromodynamic (NRQCD) and leading twist light-cone (LC) models. Theoretical predictions for branching fractions of all considered decays are presented. According to obtained results in the case of allowed by helicity suppression rule processes the effect of internal quark motion increases the branching fraction by a factor 1.5, while for forbidden reactions LC predictions are strictly zero, while NRQCD ones are significantly smaller than for allowed.
