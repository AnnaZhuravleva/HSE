We investigate the QCD resummation for the Higgs boson plus a high $P_T$ jet production with large rapidity separations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The relevant Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) and Sudakov logs are identified and resummed. In particular, we apply recent developments of the transverse momentum dependent factorization formalism in the impact factors, which provides a systematic framework to incorporate both the BFKL and Sudakov resummations.
