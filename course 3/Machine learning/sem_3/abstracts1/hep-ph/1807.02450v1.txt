In the standard model the (Brout-Englert-)Higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at high energies rendering our current electroweak vacuum metastable, but with an instability timescale much longer than the age of the Current Universe. During cosmological inflation, unless there is a non-minimal coupling to gravity, the Higgs field is pushed away from the origin of its potential due to quantum fluctuations. It is therefore a mystery how we have remained in our current vacuum if we went through such a period of inflation. In this work we study the effect of top quarks created gravitationally during Inflation and their effect upon the Higgs potential using only General Relativity with minimal couplings and Standard Model particle physics. We show that there are regions of parameter space still compatible with LHC observations where such modifications to the potential would prevent the Higgs from passing over the barrier to the unstable regime during 60 e-folds of Inflation. The effect of the fermions can change the values of $r_T$ which lead to instability by more than 100$\%$ meaning that the Electroweak vacuum during inflation is slightly less unstable than we previously thought.
