The physical, observable spectrum in gauge theories is made up from gauge-invariant states. In the standard model the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism shows that these states can be adequately mapped to the gauge-dependent elementary $W$, $Z$ and Higgs states. In theories with a more general gauge group and Higgs sector this is no longer necessarily the case. We classify and predict the physical spectrum for a wide range of such theories, with special emphasis on GUT-like cases, and show that discrepancies between the spectrum of elementary fields and physical particles frequently arise.
