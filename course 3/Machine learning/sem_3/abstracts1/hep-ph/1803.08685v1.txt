We study the width of a two-body resonance in a coupled-channel system. We demonstrate how the width does not come only determined by the available phase space for its decay to the detection channel, but it greatly depends on the relative position of the mass of the resonance with respect to the masses of the coupled-channels generating the state. Our results are consistent with the experimental observation of narrow hadrons lying well above their lowest decay threshold.
