We present NNFF1.1h, a new determination of unidentified charged-hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) and their uncertainties. Experimental measurements of transverse-momentum distributions for charged-hadron production in proton-(anti)proton collisions at the Tevatron and at the LHC are used to constrain a set of FFs originally determined from electron-positron annihilation data. Our analysis is performed at next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. We find that the hadron-collider data is consistent with the electron-positron data and that it significantly constrains the gluon FF. We verify the reliability of our results upon our choice of the kinematic cut in the hadron transverse momentum applied to the hadron-collider data and their consistency with NNFF1.0, our previous determination of the FFs of charged pions, kaons, and protons/antiprotons.
