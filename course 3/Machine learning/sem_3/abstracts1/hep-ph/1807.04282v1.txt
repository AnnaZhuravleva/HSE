Thermal relics lighter than an MeV contribute to the energy density of the universe at the time of nucleosynthesis and recombination. Constraints on extra radiation degrees of freedom typically exclude even the simplest of such dark sectors. We explore the possibility that a sub-MeV dark sector entered equilibrium with the Standard Model after neutrino-photon decoupling, which significantly weakens these constraints and naturally arises in the context of neutrino mass generation through the spontaneous breaking of lepton number. Acquiring an adequate dark matter abundance independently motivates the MeV-scale in these models through the coincidence of gravitational, matter-radiation equality, and neutrino mass scales, $(m_\text{Pl} / T^\text{MRE})^{1/4} \, m_\nu \sim \text{MeV}$. This class of scenarios will be decisively tested by future measurements of the cosmic microwave background and matter structure of the universe. While the dark sector dominantly interacts with Standard Model neutrinos, large couplings to nucleons are possible in principle, leading to observable signals at proposed low-threshold direct detection experiments.
