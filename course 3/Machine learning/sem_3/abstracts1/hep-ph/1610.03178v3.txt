We examine an extension of the SM Higgs sector by a Higgs triplet taking into consideration the Higgs-like particle discovery at the LHC with mass around 125 GeV. We evaluate the bounds on the scalar potential through the unitarity of the scattering-matrix. Considering with and without $\Z_2$-symmetry on the extra triplet, we derive constraints on the parameter space. We identify the region of the parameter space that corresponds to the stability and metastability of the electroweak vacuum. We also show that at large field values the scalar potential of this model is suitable to explain inflation.
