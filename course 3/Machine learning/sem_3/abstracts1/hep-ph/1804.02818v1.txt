We investigate the implications of a sterile neutrino on the physics potential of the proposed experiment DUNE and future runs of NO$\nu$A using latest NO$\nu$A results. Using combined analysis of the disappearance and appearance data, NO$\nu$A reported preferred solutions at normal hierarchy (NH) with two degenerate best-fit points one in the lower octant (LO) and $\delta_{13}$ = 1.48$\pi$ and other in higher octant (HO) and $\delta_{13}$ = 0.74$\pi$. Another solution of inverted hierarchy (IH) which is 0.46$\sigma$ away from best fit was also reported. We discuss chances of resolving these degeneracies in the presence of sterile neutrino(3+1 model).
