We present a new observable zest and demonstrate its potential to differentiate between jets originated by gluons, top quark and vector bosons. Zest has salient properties such as boost invariance, stability against global color flow of partons and inclusion or exclusion of a few soft particles to the jet. For a gluon jet, zest distribution is also insensitive to the jet mass. We show that when zest is used in conjunction with other observables, it can yield high gluon rejection while retaining high signal sample.
