We study a simple left-right symmetric (LRS) extension of the Zee model for neutrino mass generation. An extra $SU(2)_{L/R}$ singlet charged scalar helps in generating a loop-induced Majorana mass of the neutrinos. This scenario is quite distinct from other LRS models as the right-handed neutrinos are very light of the order of a few eV to a few MeV. We study the collider signature of the charged scalar at $e^+e^-$ collider, where a huge enhancement in the production cross-section is possible, resulting in a much stronger signal at the ILC or CLIC experiments.
