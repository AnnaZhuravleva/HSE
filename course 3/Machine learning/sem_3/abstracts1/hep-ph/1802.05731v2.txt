Model building within the Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework generally involves placing the Standard Model fields in the bulk. Such fields may possess non-zero values for their associated brane-localized kinetic terms (BLKTs) in addition to possible bulk mass parameters. In this paper we clearly identify the regions of the RS model parameter space where the presence of bulk mass terms and BLKTs yield a setup which is free from both ghost and tachyon instabilities. Such physically acceptable parameter space regions can then be used to construct realistic and phenomenologically viable RS models.
