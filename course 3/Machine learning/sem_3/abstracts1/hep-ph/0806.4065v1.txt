We consider cosmological perturbations caused by modulated inflaton velocity. During inflation, the inflaton motion is damped and the velocity is determined by the parameters such as couplings or masses that may depend on light fields(moduli). The number of e-foldings is different in different patches if there are spatial fluctuations of such parameters. Based on this simple idea, we consider ``modulated inflation'' in which the curvature perturbation is generated by the fluctuation of the inflaton velocity. This talk is based on our recent papers.
