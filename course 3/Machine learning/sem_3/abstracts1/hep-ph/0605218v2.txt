If the Standard Model is correct, and fundamental fermions exist only in the three generations, then the CKM matrix should be unitary. However, there remains a question over a deviation from unitarity from the value of the neutron lifetime. We discuss a simple space-based experiment that, at an orbit height of 500 km above Earth, would measure the kinetic-energy, solid-angle, flux spectrum of gravitationally bound neutrons (kinetic energy K<0.606 eV at this altitude). The difference between the energy spectrum of neutrons that come up from the Earth's atmosphere and that of the undecayed neutrons that return back down to the Earth would yield a measurement of the neutron lifetime. This measurement would be free of the systematics of laboratory experiments. A package of mass $<25$ kg could provide a 10^{-3} precision in two years.
