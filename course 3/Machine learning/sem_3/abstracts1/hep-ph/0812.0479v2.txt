We perform a statistical analysis with the prospective results of future experiments on neutrino-less double beta decay, direct searches for neutrino mass (KATRIN) and cosmological observations. Realistic errors are used and the nuclear matrix element uncertainty for neutrino-less double beta decay is also taken into account. Three benchmark scenarios are introduced, corresponding to quasi-degenerate, inverse hierarchical neutrinos, and an intermediate case. We investigate to what extend these scenarios can be reconstructed. Furthermore, we check the compatibility of the scenarios with the claimed evidence of neutrino-less double beta decay.
