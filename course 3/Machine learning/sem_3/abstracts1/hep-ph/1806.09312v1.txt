Higgs and Z boson associated production with subsequent decay was studied in the framework of alternative left-right model, which is motivated by superstring-inspired $E_6$ model at CEPC and future linear colliders. We systematically analyze each decay channel of Higgs with constraints imposed by theory and latest experiment. Due to the mixing of scalars in the Higgs sector, charged Higgs bosons can also play essential roles in the phenomenological analysis of this process. The conclusion is that even though the predictions of this model for the signal strengths of this process are close to the standard model expectations, it can be differentiated in high luminosity.
