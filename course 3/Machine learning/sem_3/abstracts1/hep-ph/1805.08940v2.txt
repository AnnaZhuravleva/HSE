We apply the path optimization method to a QCD effective model with the Polyakov loop at finite density to circumvent the model sign problem. The Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model is employed as the typical QCD effective model and then the hybrid Monte-Carlo method is used to perform the path integration. To control the sign problem, the path optimization method is used with complexification of temporal gluon fields to modify the integral path in the complex space. We show that the average phase factor is well improved on the modified integral-path compared with that on the original one. This indicates that the complexification of temporal gluon fields may be enough to control the sign problem of QCD in the path optimization method.
