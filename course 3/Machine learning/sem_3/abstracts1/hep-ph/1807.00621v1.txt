We analyze the $Wt\bar b$ production processes and especially the rate of longitudinal $W$ polarization sensitive to a possible top quark mass scale dependence and to the presence of strong final state $Wt$ interactions for example generated by a dark matter environment. We give illustrations for the three processes $e^+e^-$, gluon-gluon and $\gamma\gamma \to W t\bar b $.
