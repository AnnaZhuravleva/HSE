Higgsplosion is the mechanism that leads to exponentially growing decay rates of highly energetic particles into states with very high numbers of relatively soft Higgs bosons. In this paper we study quantum effects in the presence of Higgsplosion. First, we provide a non-perturbative definition of Higgsplosion as a resolved short-distance singularity of quantum propagators at distances shorter than the inverse Higgsplosion energy scale, $E_*$. We then consider quantum effects arising from loops in perturbation theory with these propagators on internal lines. When the loop momenta exceed the Higssplosion scale $E_*$, the theory dynamics deviates from what is expected in the standard QFT settings without Higgsplosion. The UV divergences are automatically regulated by the Higgsplosion scale, leading to the change of slopes for the running couplings at the RG scales $\mu > E_*$. Thus, the theory becomes asymptotically safe. Further, we find that the finite parts are also modified and receive power-suppressed corrections in $1/E_*^2$. We use these results to compute a set of precision observables for the Higgsploding Standard Model. These and other precision observables could provide experimental evidence and tests for the existence of Higgsplosion in particle physics.
