In this contribution, I present a new QCD fit to final combined HERA deep-inelastic scattering cross-section data incorporating $\ln(1/x)$-resummation terms. This fit has been performed within the xFitter framework. The main effect of including such resummed terms results not only in a better description of the low-$x$ and low-$Q^{2}$ data, but also in a steeply rising gluon PDF at low x for low scales. Furthermore, the kinematic region where this resummation is important is delineated. This contribution is based on the results presented in arXiv:1802.00064.
