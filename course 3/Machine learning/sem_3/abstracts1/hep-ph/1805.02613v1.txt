We perform a new extraction of polarized parton distribution functions (PPDFs) from the spin structure function experimental data in the fixed-flavor number scheme (FFNS). In this analysis, we include recent proton and deuteron spin structure functions obtained by the \texttt{COMPASS} collaboration. We examine the impact of the \texttt{new COMPASS} proton and deuteron data on the polarized parton densities and compare with results from our previous study (KATAO PPDFs) which used the Jacobi polynomial approach. We find the extracted PPDFs of the proton, neutron, and deuteron structure functions are in very good agreement with the experimental data. The results for extracted PPDFs are also compared with available theoretical models from the literature.
