We analyze the zero point energy in a dense matter of quarks or hadrons with particular attention on the renormalization of the UV divergences. Besides divergences removable by the vacuum subtraction and counter terms, there are also UV divergences associated with non-perturbative modifications of quark bases appearing in the in-medium propagators. The latter would remain after the self-energies and vertices are renormalized, unless a proper set of medium contributions is included at a given truncation. We use the formalism of the two particle irreducible action to clarify how the UV divergences are assembled to cancel. An example is given for the thermodynamic potentials with mesons as composite particles whose zero point energies apparently diverge but can be cancelled by the quark self-energy contributions. Important applications of this work are quark matter with hadronic correlations which may be realized at the core of neutron stars.
