The entropy and effective string tension of the moving heavy quark-antiquark pair in the strongly coupled plasmas are calculated by using a deformed an anti-de Sitter/Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black hole metric. A sharp peak of the heavy-quarkonium entropy around the deconfinement transition can be realized in our model, which is consistent with the lattice QCD result. The effective string tension of the heavy quark-antiquark pair is related to the deconfinement phase transition. Thus, we investigate the deconfinement phase transition by analyzing the characteristics of the effective string tension with different temperatures, chemical potentials, and rapidities. It is found that the results of phase diagram calculated through effective string tension are in agreement with results calculated through a Polyakov loop. We argue that a moving system will reach the phase transition point at a lower temperature and chemical potential than a stationary system. It means that the lifetime of the moving QGP becomes longer than the static one.
