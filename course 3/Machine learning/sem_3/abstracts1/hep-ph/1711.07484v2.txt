We investigate the bounds which can be placed on generic new-physics contributions to dijet production at the LHC using the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, deriving the first consistently-treated EFT bounds from non-resonant high-energy data. We recast an analysis searching for quark compositeness, equivalent to treating the SM with one higher-dimensional operator as a complete UV model. In order to reach consistent, model-independent EFT conclusions, it is necessary to truncate the EFT effects consistently at order $1/\Lambda^2$ and to include the possibility of multiple operators simultaneously contributing to the observables, neither of which has been done in previous searches of this nature. Furthermore, it is important to give consistent error estimates for the theoretical predictions of the signal model, particularly in the region of phase space where the probed energy is approaching the cutoff scale of the EFT. There are two linear combinations of operators which contribute to dijet production in the SMEFT with distinct angular behavior; we identify those linear combinations and determine the ability of LHC searches to constrain them simultaneously. Consistently treating the EFT generically leads to weakened bounds on new-physics parameters. These constraints will be a useful input to future global analyses in the SMEFT framework, and the techniques used here to consistently search for EFT effects are directly applicable to other off-resonance signals.
