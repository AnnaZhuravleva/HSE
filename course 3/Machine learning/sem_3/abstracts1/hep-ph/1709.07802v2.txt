The loop-tree duality (LTD) theorem establishes that loop contributions to scattering amplitudes can be computed through dual integrals, which are build from single cuts of the virtual diagrams. In order to build a complete LTD representation of a cross section and to achieve a local cancellation of singularities, it is crucial to include the renormalized self-energy corrections in an unintegrated form. In this document, we calculate the scalar functions related to the self-energy corrections in QED and QCD in the LTD formalism and extract explicitly their UV behaviour.
