We study the effects of $\mathcal{CP}$-violating phases on the phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the MSSM. Complex parameters in the MSSM lead to $\mathcal{CP}$-violating mixing between the tree-level $\mathcal{CP}$-even and $\mathcal{CP}$-odd neutral Higgs states, leading to three new loop-corrected mass eigenstates $h_a$, $a \in \lbrace 1,2,3\rbrace$. For scenarios where a light Higgs boson at about 125 GeV can be identified with the observed signal and where the other Higgs states are significantly heavier, a large admixture of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons occurs as a generic feature if $\mathcal{CP}$-violating effects are taken into account. Including interference contributions in the predictions for cross sections times branching ratios of the Higgs bosons is essential in this case. As a first step, we present the gluon-fusion and bottom-quark annihilation cross sections for $h_a$ for the general case of arbitrary complex parameters, and we demonstrate that squark effects strongly depend on the phases of the complex parameters. We then study the effects of interference between $h_2$ and $h_3$ for the example of the process $b\bar{b} \to \tau^+\tau^-$. We show that large destructive interference effects modify LHC exclusion bounds such that parts of the parameter space that would be excluded by MSSM Higgs searches under the assumption of $\mathcal{CP}$-conservation open up when the possibility of $\mathcal{CP}$-violation in the Higgs sector is accounted for.
