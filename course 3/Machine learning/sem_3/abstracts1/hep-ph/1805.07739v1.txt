We compute double and triple inclusive gluon production in p-A scattering beyond the so-called "glasma graph" approximation. We consider quantum interference effects and identify in this general setup the terms responsible for the gluon HBT and initial wave function Bose enhancement which lead to correlations in particle production. Both of these terms originate from the factorizable part of the quadrupole and sextupole terms in the production cross section. We also show that the target Bose enhancement in this regime is suppressed at large number of colors.
