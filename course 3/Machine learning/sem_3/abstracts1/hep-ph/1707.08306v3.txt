In the framework of the one-boson-exchange model, we explore whether the intermediate and short-range forces from $\sigma/\omega$-exchange can be strong enough to bind heavy molecular states. $\Lambda_cD(\bar{D})$, and $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c(\bar{\Lambda}_c)$ systems have been studied and compared. We find that the force from $\sigma$-exchange is attractive and dominant, whereas the $\omega$-exchange force not. As a consequence, the S-wave $\Lambda_cD$, $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c$, and $\Lambda_c\bar{\Lambda}_c$ can be possible molecular candidates. We further indicate that one hadron-hadron system with more light quarks $(u,d)$ can be easier to form a bound state. As a byproduct, by studying the heavy-quark mass dependence for the $\Lambda_cD(\bar{D})$-like and $\Lambda_c\Lambda_c(\bar{\Lambda}_c)$-like systems, we find that the charm/bottom sector can easily accommodates molecular states. Finally, the $\Lambda_cN(\bar{N})$ and $\Lambda_bN(\bar{N})$ systems are investigated. Our results indicate that they are also likely to form bound states. By including one-$\pi$-exchange forces providing additional attraction when coupled channels are included, we expect many molecular states in heavy quark sectors.
