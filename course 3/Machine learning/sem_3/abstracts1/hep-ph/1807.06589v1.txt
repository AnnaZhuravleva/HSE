A physical model is presented for the non-perturbative parton distributions in the nucleon. This is based on quantum fluctuations of the nucleon into baryon-meson pairs convoluted with Gaussian momentum distributions of partons in hadrons. The hadronic fluctuations, here developed in terms of hadronic chiral perturbation theory, occur with high probability and generate sea quarks as well as dynamical effects also for valence quarks and gluons. The resulting parton momentum distributions $f(x,Q_0^2)$ at low momentum transfers are evolved with conventional DGLAP equations from perturbative QCD to larger scales. This provides parton density functions $f(x,Q^2)$ for the gluon and all quark flavors with only five physics-motivated parameters. By tuning these parameters, experimental data on deep inelastic structure functions can be reproduced and interpreted. The contribution to sea quarks from hadronic fluctuations explains the observed asymmetry between $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{d}$ in the proton. The strange-quark sea is strongly suppressed at low $Q^2$, as observed.
