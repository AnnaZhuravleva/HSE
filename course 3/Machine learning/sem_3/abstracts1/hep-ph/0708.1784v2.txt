We examine a scenario where the Higgs boson is coupled to an additional singlet scalar field which we identify with a quintessence field. We show that this results in an unified picture of dark matter and dark energy, where dark energy is the zero-mode classical field rolling the usual quintessence potential and the dark matter candidate is the quantum excitation (particle) of the field, which is produced in the universe due to its coupling to the Higgs boson.
