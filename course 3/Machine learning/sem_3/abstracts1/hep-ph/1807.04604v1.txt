We discuss an investigation of the dark matter decay modes of the neutron, proposed by Fornal and Grinstein (Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 191801 (2018)) and Ivanov et al. ( arXiv:1806.10107 [hep-ph]) for solution of the neutron lifetime anomaly problem, through the analysis of the electrodisintegration of the deuteron d into dark matter fermions chi and protons p close to threshold. We calculate the triple-differential cross section for the reaction e^- + d ->\chi + p + e^- and propose to search for such a dark matter channel in coincidence experiments on the electrodisintegration of the deuteron e^- + d -> n + p + e^- into neutrons n and protons close to threshold with outgoing electrons, protons and neutrons in coincidence. A missing of neutron signals should testify a detection of dark matter fermions.
