The first results of a new application of the Thomas-Fermi statistical quark model to mesonic matter is presented. Interesting aspects of the theory are discussed, distinguishing such states from baryonic matter. A major motivation of this study is the tetraquark states discovered by the Belle and other collaborations and the possibility that stable multi-quark families of such states exist. Similar to our previous baryonic study, we use a two-inequivalent wave function approach to investigate aspects of multi-quark matter. We think of our model as a tool for quickly assessing the characteristics of new, possibly bound, particle states of higher quark number content, which can not yet be examined by lattice methods.
