We propose a new mechanism for electroweak baryogenesis based on gravitational waves generated by helical magnetic fields that are present during a first order electroweak phase transition. We generate a net lepton number through the gravitational chiral anomaly which appears due to the chiral gravitational waves produced by these magnetic fields. The observed value of baryon asymmetry can be obtained in our mechanism within parameter space of scenarios with an inverse cascade evolution for magnetic fields which can also be candidates for large-scale magnetic fields.
