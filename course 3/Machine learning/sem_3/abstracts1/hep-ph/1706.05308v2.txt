We generalize the clockwork theory in several directions. First, we consider beyond nearest neighbors interactions. Considering such interactions keeps a larger subgroup of the original $U(1)^{N+1}$ unbroken and can allow for different symmetry breaking patterns. We recover the original clockwork scenario in the presence of these additional interactions. In such case, the masses of the massive modes change, but a single massless mode remains intact. Such interactions are naturally interpreted as higher derivative terms from the point of view of extra dimensions. Second, we generalize the clockwork shift symmetry to non-abelian global groups. Third, trivial embedding of the clockwork scenario in supergravity, yields an AdS minimum as big as the clockwork interaction. Specifically, the clockwork is connected to the cosmological constant. We analyze the different ways in which a Minkowski supersymmetric minimum can be constructed. Fourth, we review the extra-dimensional origin of the mechanism and interpretation, in the case of conformal coupling to gravity. Upon deconstruction, the CW massless mode becomes tachyonic. This property is generic to massless modes in negatively curved $5D$ manifolds. Masslessness can be restored by adding a specific $5D$ mass term. Additionally, we suggest an alternative positively curved $5D$ manifold with conformal coupling to gravity, that generates a positive mass term to the massless mode.
