In this paper we present a new and efficient analytical solutions for evolving the QED$\otimes$QCD DGLAP evolution equations in mellin space and obtain the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in perturbative QCD including the QED corrections. The validity of our analytical solutions, which have done in the next to leading order QCD and the leading order QED approximations, are checked with the initial parton distributions from newly released CT14QED global analysis code (Phys. Rev.D93,114015(2016)). The evolved parton distributions are in good agreement with CT14QED code and also with those from APFEL (Computer Physics Communications 185, 1647 (2014)) program.
