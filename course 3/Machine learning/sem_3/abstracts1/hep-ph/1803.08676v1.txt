The combined Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations in rainbow-ladder approximation are used to search for Regge trajectories of mesons in the pseudo-scalar and vector channels. We focus on the often employed Alkofer-Watson-Weigel kernel which is known to deliver good results for the ground state meson spectra; it provides linear Regge trajectories in the $J^P= 0^-$ channel.
