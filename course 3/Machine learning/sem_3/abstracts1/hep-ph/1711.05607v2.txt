The precision measurement of the $WW\gamma$ vertex at the future Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) at CERN is discussed in this paper. We propose to measure this vertex in the $e^{-} p\to e^{-}W^{\pm}j$ channel as a complement to the conventional charged current $\nu_{e}\gamma j$ channel. In addition to the cross section measurement, $\chi^{2}$ method studies of angular variables provide powerful tools to probe the anomalous structure of triple gauge boson couplings. We study the distribution of the well-known azimuthal angle between the final state forward electron and jet in this vector-boson fusion (VBF) process. On the other hand, full reconstruction of leptonic $W$ decay opens a new opportunity to measure $W$ polarization that is also sensitive to the anomalous triple gauge boson couplings. Taking into consideration the superior determination of parton distribution functions~(PDFs) based on future LHeC data, the constraints of $\lambda_{\gamma}$ and $\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}$ might reach up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ level in the most ideal case with the 2--3~ab$^{-1}$ data set, which shows a potential advantage compared to those from LHC and LEP data.
