In this paper we study the inclusive and diffractive double quarkonium production. Based on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism for the quarkonium production mechanism we estimate the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the cross section for the $J/\Psi J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon \Upsilon$ production in diffractive processes at LHC energies. The contributions of the color-singlet and color-octet channels are estimated and predictions for the total cross sections in the kinematical regions of the LHC experiments are also presented. Our results demonstrate that the contribution of diffractive processes is not negligible and that its study can be useful to test the Resolved Pomeron model.
