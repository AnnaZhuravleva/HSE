The $\bar{B}_{q}^{\ast}$ ${\to}$ $DP$, $DV$ weak decays are studied with the perturbative QCD approach, where $q$ $=$ $u$, $d$ and $s$; $P$ and $V$ denote the ground $SU(3)$ pseudoscalar and vector meson nonet. It is found that the branching ratios for the color-allowed $\bar{B}_{q}^{\ast}$ ${\to}$ $D_{q}{\rho}^{-}$ decays can reach up to $10^{-9}$ or more, and should be promisingly measurable at the running LHC and forthcoming SuperKEKB experiments in the near future.
