We present analytical results at four-loop level for the renormalization constants and anomalous dimensions of an extended QCD model with one coupling constant and an arbitrary number of fermion representations. One example of such a model is the QCD plus gluinos sector of a supersymmetric theory where the gluinos are Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.   The renormalization constants of the gauge boson, ghost and fermion fields are analytically computed as well as those for the ghost-gluon vertex, the fermion-gluon vertex and the fermion mass. All other renormalization constants can be derived from these. Some of these results were already produced in Feynman gauge for the computation of the beta-function of this model, which was recently published. Here we present results for an arbitrary gauge parameter.
