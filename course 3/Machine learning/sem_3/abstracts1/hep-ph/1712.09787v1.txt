This talk is about the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment, mainly our old work but including some newer results as well. It concentrates on the model calculations. Most attention is paid to pseudo-scalar exchange and the pion loop contribution. Scalar, $a_1$-exchange and other contributions are shortly discussed as well. For the $\pi^0$-exchange a possible large cancellation between connected and disconnected diagrams is expected.
