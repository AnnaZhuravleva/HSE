The implications of extra sterile neutrinos for the Double Chooz experiment is expounded. The so-called ``3+2'' mass spectrum with 2 sterile neutrinos mixed with the active ones, is still allowed by the global neutrino data including MiniBooNE. We probe its impact on the resultant reactor antineutrino signal at the near and far detector of the Double Chooz experiment. The oscillations driven by the additional mass squared difference due to the sterile states bring an energy independent constant suppression at both the near and far detectors. We study to what extent the measurement of $\theta_{13}$ would get affected due to the presence of sterile mixing. We also give the projected sensitivity that Double Chooz will have to constrain the extra mixing angles associated with the sterile states.
