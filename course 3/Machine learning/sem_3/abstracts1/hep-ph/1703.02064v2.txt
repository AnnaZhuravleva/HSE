A Higgs-like dilaton owns couplings that differ from those of the Standard Model Higgs and of a generic Composite Higgs. The complete bosonic basis for a Higgs-like dilaton is presented at the first subleading order. A comparison with the Standard Model, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory and the generic Lagrangian for the minimal $SO(5)/SO(4)$ Composite Higgs model is performed. Observables that can disentangle the different hypotheses are identified.
