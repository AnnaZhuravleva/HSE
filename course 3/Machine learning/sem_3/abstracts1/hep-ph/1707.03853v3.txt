We construct an unified model of inflation and PeV dark matter which is consistent with the CMB observations and can explain the PeV neutrinos at IceCube. A no-scale K\"ahler potential and an appropriate choice of gauge kinetic function in MSSM superfields can result in Starobinsky like Higgs-sneutrino plateau inflation from $D$-term potential. The SUSY breaking at the PeV scale is achieved through the Polonyi field. This sets the scales $m_0, m_{\frac{1}{2}}, A_0$ at the GUT scale in terms of the parameters of the theory. The low energy (PeV scale) spectrum is obtained by running the RGEs. We show that the $\sim$125 GeV higgs and the gauge coupling unification can be achieved in this model. The $6$ PeV bino-type dark matter is a subdominant fraction ($\sim 11\%$) of the relic density and its decay gives the PeV scale neutrino flux observed at IceCube by choosing the couplings of the $R$-parity violating operators.
