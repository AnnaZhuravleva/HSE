Rare $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda l^+l^-$ and $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda\gamma$ decays are investigated in the relativistic quark model based on the quark-diquark picture of baryons. The decay form factors are calculated with the account of all relativistic effects including relativistic transformations of baryon wave functions from rest to moving reference frame and the contribution of the intermediate negative energy states. The momentum transfer squared dependence of the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range. The calculated decay branching fractions, various forward-backward asymmetries for the rare decay $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda \mu^+\mu^-$ are found to be consistent with recent detailed measurements by the LHCb Collaboration. Predictions for the $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda \tau^+\tau^-$ decay observables are given.
