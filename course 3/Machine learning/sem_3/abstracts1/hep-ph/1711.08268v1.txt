We introduce in an arbitrary supersymmetric version of the standard model without elementary scalars a logarithmic operator which is irrelevant in the limit in which all symmetries are respected. However through a dynamical mechanism of the Nambu Jona Lasinio type this operator may produce two fermion vacuum condensates that may account for electroweak and contribute to supersymmetry breaking. Some of the phenomenological consequences of this set-up are discussed.
