In this talk we present a powerful tool applied to the study of Leptonic Physics. This tool is based on the construction of Weak Basis invariant relations associated to different properties of leptonic models. The rationale behind these constructions is the fact that fermion mass matrices related through weak basis transformations look different but lead to the same physics. Such invariants can be built, for instance, with the aim to test leptonic models for different types of CP violation. These invariants are also relevant beyond such tests and have been applied to the study of implications from zero textures appearing in the leptonic mass matrices. In this case an important question is, how can a flavour model corresponding to a set of texture zeros be recognised, when written in a different weak basis, where the zeros are not explicitly present. Another important application is the construction of invariants sensitive to the neutrino mass ordering and the $\theta_{23}$ octant.
