We discuss the effective field theory description of bound states composed of a heavy baryon and antibaryon. This framework is a variation of the ones already developed for heavy meson-antimeson states to describe the $X(3872)$ or the $Z_c$ and $Z_b$ resonances. We consider the case of heavy baryons for which the light quark pair is in S-wave and we explore how heavy quark spin symmetry constrains the heavy baryon-antibaryon potential. The one pion exchange potential mediates the low energy dynamics of this system. We determine the relative importance of pion exchanges, in particular the tensor force. We find that in general pion exchanges are probably perturbative for hidden charm baryonium and non-perturbative for the hidden bottom case. If we assume that the contact-range couplings of the effective field theory are saturated by the exchange of vector mesons, we can estimate for which quantum numbers it is more probable to find a heavy baryonium state.
