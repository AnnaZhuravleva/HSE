A new method to test the valence quark distribution of nucleon obtained from the maximum entropy method using Gottfried sum rule by performing DGLAP equations with the GLR-MQ-ZRS corrections and original LO~/~NLO DGLAP equations are outlined. The test relies on a knowledge of the unpolarized electron-proton structure function $F_2^{ep}$ and electron-neutron structure function $F_2^{en}$ and the assumption that Bjorken scaling is satisfied. In this work, the original Gottfried summation value obtained by the integrals of the structure function at different Q$^{2}$ is in accordance with the theoretical value 1/3 under the premise of light-quark flavour symmetry of nucleon sea, whether it is the result from the dynamics evolution equations or the result from global QCD fits of PDFs. Finally, we present the summation value of the LO / NLO DGLAP global fits of PDFs under the premise of light-quark flavour asymmetry of nucleon sea. According to analysis the original Gottfried summation value with two evolution equations at different $Q^{2}$, we can know that the valence quark distributions of nucleon obtained by the maximum entropy method are effective and reliable.
