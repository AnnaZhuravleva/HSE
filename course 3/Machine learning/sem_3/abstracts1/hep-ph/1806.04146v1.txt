There is growing evidence for deviation from the standard model predictions in the ratios between semi-tauonic and semi-leptonic $B$ decays, known as the $R(D^{(*)})$ puzzle. If the source of this non-universality is new physics, it is natural to assume that it also breaks CP symmetry. In this paper we study the possibility of measuring CP violation in semi-tauonic $B$ decays, exploiting interference between excited charm mesons. Given the current values of $R(D^{(*)})$, we find that our proposed CP-violation observable could be as large as about 10%. We discuss the experimental advantages of our method and propose carrying it out at Belle II and LHCb.
