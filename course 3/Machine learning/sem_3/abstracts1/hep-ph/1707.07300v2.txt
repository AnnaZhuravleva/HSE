We extend the standard model with three right-handed singlet neutrinos and a real singlet scalar. We impose two $Z_2$ and $Z_2^\prime$-symmetries. We explain the tiny neutrino mass-squared differences with two $Z_2$- and $Z_2^\prime$-even right-handed neutrinos using the type-I seesaw mechanism. The $Z_2$-odd fermion and the $Z_2^\prime$-odd scalar can both serve as viable dark matter candidates. We identify new regions in the parameter space which are consistent with relic density of the dark matter, recent direct search experiment LUX-2016, XENON1T-2017 and LHC data.
