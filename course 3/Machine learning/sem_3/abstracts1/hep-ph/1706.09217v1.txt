We compute for the first time the suppression of bottomonia in a strongly coupled QGP and compare the results to those from a weakly coupled QGP. Using imaginary time techniques we numerically determine the real and imaginary parts of the ground state binding energy of the bottomonia in one potential computed from AdS/CFT and another computed from pQCD. We then use these binding energies in a suppression model to determine the $\Upsilon$(1S) nuclear modification factor in $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions. AdS/CFT significantly overpredicts the suppression compared to data, although the predictive power of our calculation is limited by its significant sensitivity to the exact details of the suppression model.
