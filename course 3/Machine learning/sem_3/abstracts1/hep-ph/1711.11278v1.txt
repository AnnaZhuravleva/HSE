The dependence of the hadron interaction on its structure is examined in the framework of the generelized parton distributions (GPDs). The x dependence of the GPDs is determined by the parton distribution functions (PDFs), which were obtained from the deep inelastic scattering. The analysis of the whole sets of experimental data on the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron with taking into account many forms of PDFs, obtained by the different Collaborations, make it possible to obtain the special momentum transfer dependence of the GPDs. This permits us to obtain the electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleons. The impact parameter dependence of the proton and neutron charge and matter densities is examined. The elastic hadron scattering at high energies was analyzed in the framework of the model that takes into account both these form factors (electromagnetic and gravitomagnetic).
