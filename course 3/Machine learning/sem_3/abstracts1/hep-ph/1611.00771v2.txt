Naturalness arguments suggest that the stop sector is within reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We investigate how the observation of a third generation squark signal could predict masses and discovery modes of other supersymmetric particles, or potentially test the Higgs boson mass relation and the validity of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at the high luminosity LHC. We illustrate these ideas in three distinct scenarios: discovery of a light stop, a sbottom signal in multileptons, and a signal of the second (heavier) stop in boosted dibosons.
