The scale at which supersymmetry (SUSY) breaks ($m_{s}$) is still unknown. The present article, following a top-down approach, endeavors to study the effect of varying $m_s$ on the radiative stability of the observational parameters associated with the neutrino mixing. These parameters get additional contributions in the minimal supersymmetric model,(MSSM). A variation in $m_s$ will influence the bounds for which the Standard Model,(SM) and MSSM work and hence will account for the different radiative contributions received from both sectors respectively, while running the renormalization group equations,(RGE). The present work establishes the invariance of the self complementarity relation among the three mixing angles, $\theta_{13}+\theta_{12}\approx\theta_{23}$ against the radiative evolution. A similar result concerning the mass ratio, $m_2: m_1$ is also found to be valid. In addition to varying $m_s$, the work incorporates a range of different seesaw\,(SS) scales and tries to see how the latter affects the parameters.
