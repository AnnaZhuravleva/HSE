We consider the chiral Lagrangian for charmed baryon fields with $J^P =\frac{1}{2}^+$ or $J^P =\frac{3}{2}^+$ quantum numbers. A chiral expansion framework for the baryon ground state masses is worked out to N$^3$LO as to compute their dependence on the up, down and strange quark masses for finite box QCD lattice simulations. It is formulated in terms of on-shell meson and baryon masses. The convergence of such a scheme is illustrated with physical masses as taken from the PDG. The counter terms relevant at N$^3$LO are correlated systematically by large-$N_c$ sum rules to leading and subleading order in a manner that keeps the renormalization scale invariance of the approach.
