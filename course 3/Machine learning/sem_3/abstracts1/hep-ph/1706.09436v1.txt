We reevaluate the hadronic vacuum polarisation contributions to the muon magnetic anomaly and to the running of the electromagnetic coupling constant at the Z-boson mass. We include newest e+e- to hadrons cross-section data (among others) from the BABAR and VEPP-2000 experiments. For the muon (g-2)/2 we find for the lowest-order hadronic contribution (693.1 +- 3.4) 10^-10, improving the precision of our previous evaluation by 21%. The full Standard Model prediction differs by 3.5 sigma from the experimental value. The five-quark hadronic contribution to alpha(mZ) is evaluated to be (276.0 +- 0.9) 10^-4.
