We use the Polyakov-loop extended two-flavor quark-meson model as a low-energy effective model for QCD to study the phase diagram in the $\mu_I$--$T$ plane where $\mu_I$ is the isospin chemical potential. In particular, we focus on the Bose condensation of charged pions. At $T=0$, the onset of pion condensation is at $\mu_I={1\over2}m_{\pi}$ in accordance with exact results. The phase transition to a Bose-condensed phase is of second order for all values of $\mu_I$ and we find that there is no pion condensation for temperatures larger than approximately 187 MeV. The chiral transition temperature coincides with the critical temperature for Bose condensation for values of the isospin chemical potential larger than $\mu_I\approx110$ MeV. We compare our results with recent lattice simulations and find overall good agreement.
