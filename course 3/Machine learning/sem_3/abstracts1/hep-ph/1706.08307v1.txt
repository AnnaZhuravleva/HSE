In this work the process of elastic hadron scattering is discussed. In particular, scattering amplitudes for the various Pomeron models are compared. In addition, differential elastic cross section as a function of the scattered proton transverse momentum for unpolarised and polarised protons is presented. Finally, an implementation of the elastic scattering amplitudes into the GenEx Monte Carlo generator is discussed.
