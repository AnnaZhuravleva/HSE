We present a mechanism for disguising one composite Higgs model as another. Allowing the global symmetry of the strong sector to be broken by large mixings with elementary fields, we show that we can disguise one coset $\mathcal G/\mathcal H$ such that at low energies the phenomenology of the model is better described with a different coset $\mathcal G'/\mathcal H'$. Extra scalar fields acquire masses comparable to the rest of the strong sector resonances and therefore are no longer considered pNGBs. Following this procedure we demonstrate that two models with promising UV-completions can be disguised as the more minimal $SO(5)/SO(4)$ coset.
