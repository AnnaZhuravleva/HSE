The Two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is one of the most studied extensions of the Standard Model. Like the other popular "New Physics" models, it gets more and more constrained by recent experimental progress, especially by the LHC data. For the 2HDM types I and II with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, I present updated results of global analyses obtained with the open-source HEPfit code, emphasizing the impact of the pre-EPS-HEP 2017 LHC data. Furthermore, I discuss the status of implementation into HEPfit of 2HDM's beyond the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetric types.
