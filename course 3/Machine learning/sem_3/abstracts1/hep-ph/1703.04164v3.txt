We extract constraints on the parameter space of the MW model by comparing the cross-sections for dijet, top-pair, dijet-pair, $t\bar t t \bar t$ and $b\bar b b \bar b$ productions at the LHC with the strongest available experimental limits from ATLAS or CMS at 8 or 13 TeV. Overall we find that masses below 1 TeV have not been excluded for color octet scalars as it is often claimed in the literature. The constraints that can be placed on coupling constants are typically weaker than those from existing theoretical considerations, with the exception of the parameter $\eta_D$.
