We suggest a description of the beam asymmetry in $p \bar p$ and $\Lambda \bar \Lambda$ photoproduction off the proton $\vec\gamma + p \to p \bar p + p$ and $\vec\gamma + p \to \Lambda \bar\Lambda + p$, takes into account the contribution of the scalar mesons $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1710)$. These scalars are considered as mixed states of a glueball and nonstrange and strange quarkonia in the framework based on the use of effective hadronic Lagrangians. Present results can be used to guide the possible search for this reaction by the GlueX Collaboration at JLab. Also, we did an estimate of contribution of heavier scalar meson states $f_0(2020)$, $f_0(2100)$, and $f_0(2200)$.
