Most of the methods to measure the top quark mass suffer from the jet energy scaling in achieving better precision. As a way to circumvent this issue, the study of $B$-hadron observables is motivated. While they do not involve such an issue, understanding underlying hadronization models is a key to achieve $\sim 0.5\%$ precision or better. In this presentation, we discuss the impact of the hadronization model parameters - for example, implemented in Pythia 8 - on precision measurements of the top quark mass through $B$-hadron observables. We study the sensitivity of the top quark mass to relevant hadronization and showering parameters, followed by a discussion on observables to be used for constraining the hadronization and showering parameters.
