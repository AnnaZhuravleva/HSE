We calculate all main top-quark pair differential distributions at the Tevatron. For the first time Tevatron predictions for this process include all Standard Model corrections through NLO (referred to as complete-NLO) consistently combined with previously computed NNLO QCD corrections. We also assess, for the first time, the impact of dynamical scales on predictions for the latest Tevatron measurements.
