We study the $B_c^- \to \pi^- J/\psi \omega$ and $B_c^- \to \pi^- D^* \bar{D}^*$ reactions and show that they are related by the presence of two resonances, the $X(3940)$ and $X(3930)$, that are of molecular nature and couple most strongly to $D^* \bar{D}^*$, but also to $J/\psi\omega$. Because of that, in the $J/\psi\omega$ mass distribution we find a cusp with large strength at the $D^* \bar{D}^*$ threshold and predict the ratio of strengths between the peak of the cusp and the maximum of the $D^* \bar{D}^*$ distribution close to $D^* \bar{D}^*$ threshold, which are distinct features of the molecular nature of these two resonances.
