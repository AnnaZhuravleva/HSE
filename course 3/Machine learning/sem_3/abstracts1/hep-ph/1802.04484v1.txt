Understanding of particle physics will be incomplete without knowing the true nature i.e. Dirac or Majorana, and absolute effective mass of neutrinos. This will lead us into the world of beyond the standard model physics. In the current era of experimental technology it is probably only neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\nu\beta\beta$), which has the ability to clarify the nature and provide the absolute effective mass of neutrinos. Observation of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ implies not only neutrinos are Majorana particles but also the lepton number violation. There are already intense activities going on over the world-wide for the experimental searches of 0$\nu\beta\beta$. In these experiments, some are currently in their running phase and several experiments have been projected. With the same motivation as the other experiments, the TIN-TIN (The INdia$^{'}$s TIN detector) experiment has been projected by the scientific community of India. This experiment, in coming future, will be housed in the approved underground laboratory of INO (India based Neutrino Observatory), to search 0$\nu\beta\beta$ using enriched $^{124}$Sn isotope as the target mass. In the present paper we have calculated the required sensitivity for $^{124}$Sn isotope in terms of exposure ($\beta\beta{isotope}$ mass $\times$ time) and background rate (counts/ton-year-keV) at the projected FWHM energy resolution. Such that, after achieving the required sensitivity the TIN-TIN can really see the events of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay, if it exists in nature.
