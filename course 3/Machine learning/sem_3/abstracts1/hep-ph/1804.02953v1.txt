We construct the quark-antiquark chiral odd distribution amplitudes including twist-four mass contributions for tensor mesons. We also give quark-antiquark-gluon distribution amplitudes, where we calculate the input parameters with QCD sum rules. With the help of equations of motion we determine the twist-three and twist-four distribution amplitudes including SU(3) breaking terms. We use QCD light-come sum rules to derive the form factors for the decay B $\rightarrow f_2(1270)$ with vector, axial-vector and tensor currents. We also give the $q^2$ dependence of the form factors.
