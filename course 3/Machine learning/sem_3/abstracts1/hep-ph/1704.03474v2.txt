In this work we propose an extension to the Standard Model in which we consider the model 2HDM type-III plus massive neutrinos and the horizontal flavor symmetry $S_{3}$ $(\nu$2HDM$\otimes S_3)$. In the above framework and with the explicit breaking of flavor symmetry $S_{3}$, the Yukawa matrices in the flavor adapted basis are represented by means of a matrix with two texture zeroes. Also, the active neutrinos are considered as Majorana particles and their masses are generated through type-I seesaw mechanism. The unitary matrices that diagonalize the mass matrices, as well as the flavor mixing matrices, are expressed in terms of fermion mass ratios. Consequently, in the mass basis the entries of the Yukawa matrices naturally acquire the form of the so-called {\it Cheng-Sher ansatz}. For the leptonic sector of $\nu$2HDM$\otimes S_3$, we compare, through a $\chi^{2}$ likelihood test, the theoretical expressions of the flavor mixing angles with the masses and flavor mixing leptons current experimental data. The results obtained in this $\chi^{2}$ analysis are in very good agreement with the current experimental data. We also obtained an allowed value ranges for the "Dirac-like" phase factor, as well as for the two Majorana phase factors. Furthermore, we study the phenomenological implications of these numerical values of the CP-violation phases on the neutrinoless double beta decay, and for Long Base-Line neutrino oscillation experiments such as T2K, NO$\nu$A, and DUNE.
