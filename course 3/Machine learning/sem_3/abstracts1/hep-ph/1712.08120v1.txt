The study of the top quark's properties is an important part of the LHC programme. In earlier work, we have studied the rare decay $t \to b \bar b c$, using effective operators to capture the effects of physics beyond the Standard Model. However top decay is primarily sensitive to new physics in the sub-TeV energy regime. If this new physics resides at a higher energy scale, then one needs to turn to single-top production. In this paper, we use the $s$-channel and $t$-channel single-top production cross sections to constrain the new physics parameter space associated with such contact interactions. We also study the net top polarization as a means to distinguish between contributions from operators involving different fermion chiralities and Lorentz structures.
