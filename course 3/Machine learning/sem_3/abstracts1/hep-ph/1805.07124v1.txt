We calculate the cross section for $p p \to W^{+} W^-$ in the recently developed $k_{\rm T}$-factorisation approach, including transverse momenta of the virtual photons. We focus on processes with single and double proton dissociation. The hadronisation of proton remnants is performed with \pythia string fragmentation model, assuming a simple quark-diquark model for proton. Highly excited remnant systems hadronise producing particles that can be vetoed in the calorimeter. We calculate associated effective gap survival factors. The gap survival factors depend on the process, mass of the remnant system and collision energy. The rapidity gap survival factor due to remnant fragmentation for double dissociative (DD) collisions ($S_{R,DD}$) is smaller than that for single dissociative (SD) process ($S_{R,SD}$). We observe approximate factorisation: $S_{R,DD} \approx (S_{R,SD})^2$, when imposing rapidity veto.
