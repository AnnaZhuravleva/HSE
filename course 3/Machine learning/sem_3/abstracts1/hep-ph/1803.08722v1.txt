The ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates, also addressed as Mass Hierarchy (MH), is one of the most relevant issues in neutrino physics, currently under investigation by many proposals and experiments. In this short note focus will be given to the different ways to determine MH from neutrino oscillation data in the near future. A pragmatic strategy is suggested and two recent new methods of analysis are recalled. Statistical issues and concerns are also addressed, envisaging the necessity of more accurate studies and analyses.
