We give an overview of our calculation of the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to W + jet production in hadronic collisions. Phenomenological results for multiple differential distributions are compared to CMS data for 8 TeV proton-proton collisions. We further discuss the application of the calculation to the transverse momentum spectrum of inclusive W boson production, again accompanied by a comparison to 8 TeV CMS data. In both cases, the inclusion of NNLO QCD effects give an improved agreement between theory and data with considerably reduced scale uncertainties with respect to the next-to-leading order (NLO) results.
