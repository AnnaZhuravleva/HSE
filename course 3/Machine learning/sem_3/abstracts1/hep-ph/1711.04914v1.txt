Within the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD, we study the finite volume effects on chiral phase transition, especially its influence on the position of the possible critical end point (CEP). The results show that in the chiral limit case (the current quark mass $m=0$), the absolute value of quark condensate decreases for smaller volumes, and more interestingly, the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c(\mu=0)$ also decrease for smaller volumes, which is in agreement with the Polyakov-extended-Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model result and opposite to the Polyakov linear sigma model prediction. These conclusions are also true for $m>0$ case in our calculation. Moreover, the results of CEP as a function of different volumes show that $T$ of CEP also decreases for smaller volumes, but $\mu$ of CEP will increases, which are qualitatively more close to Polyakov linear sigma model results. For our model setup, results for systems with a size larger than (5 fm)$^3$ closely approximate those from infinite volume, but if the volume is smaller, the corrections are non-negligible, even significantly affect signatures of the results from an infinite system. There also exist some possibility that, if the system size is too small, the whole phase transition would be crossover, which means no CEP exists at all. It is no doubt that, finite volume effects deserve further researches.
