We derive a new bound on diphoton resonances using inclusive diphoton cross section measurements at the LHC, in the so-far poorly constrained mass range between the Upsilon and the SM Higgs. This bound sets the current best limit on axion-like particles that couple to gluons and photons, for masses between 10 and 65 GeV. We also estimate indicative sensitivities of a dedicated diphoton LHC search in the same mass region, at 7, 8 and 14 TeV. As a byproduct of our analysis, we comment on the axion-like particle interpretation of the CMS excesses in low-mass dijet and diphoton searches.
