In this paper, we attempt to implement the neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which predicts $\theta^{}_{23} = \pi/4$ and $\delta = \pm \pi/2$ as well as trivial Majorana phases) in the minimal seesaw (which enables us to fix the neutrino masses). For some direct (the preliminary experimental hints towards $\theta^{}_{23} \neq \pi/4$ and $\delta \neq - \pi/2$) and indirect (inclusion of the renormalization group equation effect and implementation of the leptogenesis mechanism) reasons, we particularly study the breakings of this symmetry and their phenomenological consequences.
