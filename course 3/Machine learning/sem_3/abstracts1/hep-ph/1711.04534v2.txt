Under the assumption that the current epoch of the Universe is not special, i.e. is not the final state of a long history of processes in particle physics, the breaking of $SU(3)_C \times U(1)_{EM}$ is investigated. Spontaneous symmetry breaking of $U(1)_{EM}$ is carried out and the electromagnetically charged scalar field $\phi$ is found to be ruled out for all experimentally viable masses. In this case, electromagnetism will continue to be a long range force for the lifetime of the Universe. $SU(3)_C$ is tested for complementarity, in which the confinement phase of QCD $+$ colored scalars is equivalent to a spontaneously broken $SU(3)$ gauge theory. If complementarity is not applicable, $SU(3)_C$ has multiple symmetry breaking paths with various final symmetry structures. The stability of the colored vacuum at finite temperature in this scenario is nonperturbative and a definitive statement on the fate of $SU(3)_C$ is left open. Cosmological implications for the metastability of the vacua - electromagnetic, color and electroweak - are discussed.
