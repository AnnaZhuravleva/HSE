Seesaw mechanism constrains from below mixing between active and sterile neutrinos for fixed sterile neutrino masses. Signal events associated with sterile neutrino decays inside a detector at fixed target experiment are suppressed by the mixing angle to the power of four. Therefore sensitivity of experiments such as SHiP and DUNE should take into account minimal possible values of the mixing angles. We extend the previous study of this subject arXiv:1312.2887 to a more general case of non-zero CP-violating phases in the neutrino sector. Namely, we provide numerical estimate of minimal value of mixing angles between active neutrinos and two sterile neutrinos with the third sterile neutrino playing no noticeable role in the mixing. Thus we obtain a sensitivity needed to fully explore the seesaw type I mechanism for sterile neutrinos with masses below 2 GeV, and one undetectable sterile neutrino that is relevant for the fixed-target experiments. Remarkably, we observe a strong dependence of this result on the lightest active neutrino mass and the neutrino mass hierarchy, not only on the values of CP-violating phases themselves. All these effects sum up to push the limit of experimental confirmation of sterile-active neutrino mixing by several orders of magnitude below the results of arXiv:1312.2887 from $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-11}$ down to $10^{-12}$ and even to $10^{-20}$ in parts of parameter space; nonzero CP-violating phases are responsible for that.
