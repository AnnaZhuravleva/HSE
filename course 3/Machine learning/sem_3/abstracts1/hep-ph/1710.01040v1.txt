A detailed multi-messenger study of the high-energy emission from the Galactic plane is possible nowadays thanks to the observations provided by gamma and neutrino telescopes and could be mandatory in order to obtain a consistent scenario. We show the potential of this approach by using the total gamma flux from the inner galactic region measured by HESS at $1\,{\rm TeV}$ and in the longitude range $-75^\circ < l < 60^\circ$. By comparing the observational data with the expected diffuse galactic emission, we highlight the existence of an extended hot region of the gamma sky where the cumulative sources contribution dominates over the diffuse component. This region approximately coincides with the portion of the galactic plane from which a $\sim 2 \sigma$ excess of showers is observed in IceCube high energy starting events. In the assumption that hadronic mechanisms are responsible for the observed gamma emission, we estimate the total galactic contribution (i.e. including both diffuse and the source components) to the IceCube neutrino signal as a function of the spectral index and energy cutoff of the sources, taking also into account the upper limit on a galactic component provided by Antares.
