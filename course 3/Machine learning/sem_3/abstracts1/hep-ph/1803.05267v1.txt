Analogous to the work of hidden charm molecular pentaquarks, we study possible hidden strange molecular pentaquarks composed of $\Sigma$ (or $\Sigma^{*}$) and $K$ (or $K^{*}$) in the framework of quark delocalization color screening model. Our results suggest that the $\Sigma K$, $\Sigma K^{*}$ and $\Sigma^{*} K^{*}$ with $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ and $\Sigma K^{*}$, $\Sigma^{*} K$ and $\Sigma^{*} K^{*}$ with $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ are all resonance states by coupling the open channels. The molecular pentaquark $\Sigma^{*} K$ with quantum numbers $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ can be seen as a strange partner of the LHCb $P_{c}(4380)$ state, and it can be identified as the nucleon resonance $N^{*}(1875)$ listed in PDG. The $\Sigma K^{*}$ with quantum numbers $IJ^{P}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ can be identified as the $N^{*}(2100)$, which was experimentally observed in the $\phi$ photo-production.
