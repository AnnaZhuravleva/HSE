Momentum sum rule in QCD is widely used at high energy colliders. Although the exact form of the confinement potential energy is not known but the confinement potential energy at large distance $r$ can not rise slower than ${\rm ln}(r)$. In this paper we find that if the confinement potential energy at large distance $r$ rises linearly with $r$ (or faster) then the momentum sum rule in QCD is violated at the high energy colliders if we consider the hadron size as infinite. For finite size hadron we find that the momentum sum rule in QCD is violated at the high energy colliders for any form of the confinement potential energy.
