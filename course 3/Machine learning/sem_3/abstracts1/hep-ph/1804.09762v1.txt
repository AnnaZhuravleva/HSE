The quarkonium plus photon production in coherent hadron-hadron interactions at the LHC is studied using the non-relativistic QCD factorization formalism. We investigate a set of kinematic distributions and compute the total cross sections for $J/\Psi + \gamma $ production. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of such process in the LHC kinematic regime and explore the possibilities for the Future Circular Collider, where higher event yields can be achieved.
