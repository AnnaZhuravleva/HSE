This volume is a short summary of talks given at the PKI2018 Workshop organized to discuss current status and future prospects of pi-K interactions. The precise data on pi-K interaction will have a strong impact on strange meson spectroscopy and form factors that are important ingredients in the Dalitz plot analysis of a decays of heavy mesons as well as precision measurement of Vus matrix element and therefore on a test of unitarity in the first raw of the CKM matrix. The workshop has combined the efforts of experimentalists, Lattice QCD, and phenomenology communities. Experimental data relevant to the topic of the workshop were presented from the broad range of different collaborations like CLAS, GlueX, COMPASS, BaBar, BELLE, BESIII, VEPP-2000, and LHCb. One of the main goals of this workshop was to outline a need for a new high intensity and high precision secondary KL beam facility at JLab produced with the 12 GeV electron beam of CEBAF accelerator.   This workshop is a successor of the workshops Physics with Neutral Kaon Beam at JLab [1] held at JLab, February, 2016; Excited Hyperons in QCD Thermodynamics at Freeze-Out [2] held at JLab, November, 2016; New Opportunities with High-Intensity Photon Sources [3] held at CUA, February, 2017.
