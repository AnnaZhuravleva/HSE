The very recent result of the DAMPE cosmic ray spectrum of electrons shows a narrow bump above the background at around 1.4 TeV. We attempt to explain the DAMPE electron excess in a simplified Kaluza-Klein graviton-mediated dark matter model, in which the graviton only interacts with leptons and dark matter. The related phenomenological discussions are given and this simplified graviton-mediated dark matter model has the potential to be cross-tested in future lepton collider experiments.
