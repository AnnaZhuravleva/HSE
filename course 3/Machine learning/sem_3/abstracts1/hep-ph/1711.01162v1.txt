We identify the correct power counting of all the variables in the low-$q^2$ window of the inclusive decay $\bar B \to X_s \ell^+\ell^-$ within the effective theory SCET if a hadronic mass cut is imposed. Furthermore we analyse the resolved power corrections at the order $1/m_b$ in a systematic way. As a special feature, the resolved contributions stay nonlocal when the hadronic mass cut is released. Therefore they represent an irreducible uncertainty independent of the hadronic mass cut.
