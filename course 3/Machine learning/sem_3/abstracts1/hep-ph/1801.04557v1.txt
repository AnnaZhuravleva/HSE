Motivated by the observation of two pentaquark-like resonances and the doubly charmed baryon at LHCb, in this work, we systematically investigate the mass spectra of $QQqq\bar{q}$ ($Q=b,c$; $q=u,d,s$) pentaquark systems in a color-magnetic interaction model. One finds that stable or narrow exotic states are possible and their rearrangement decay patterns are shown. Hopefully, the study is helpful to the experimental search for such pentaquark states.
