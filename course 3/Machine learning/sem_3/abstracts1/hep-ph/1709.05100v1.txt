We study the recently found anomalies in $B$-meson decays within a scenario with a warped extra dimension where the Standard Model fermions are propagating in the bulk. The anomalies are then interpreted as the result of the exchange of heavy vector resonances with electroweak quantum numbers. The model naturally leads to lepton-flavor universality violation when different flavor fermions are differently localized along the extra dimension, signaling a different degree of compositeness in the dual holographic theory.
