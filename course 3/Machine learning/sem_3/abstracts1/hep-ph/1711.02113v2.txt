Weak singlet charged scalar exists in many new physics models beyond the Standard Model. In this work we show that a light singlet charged scalar with mass above 65~GeV is still allowed by the LEP and LHC data. The interactions of the singlet charged scalar with the Standard Model particles are described by operators up to dimension-5. Dominant decay modes of the singlet charged scalar are obtained, and a subtlety involving field redefinition and gauge fixing due to a dimension-5 operator is also clarified. We demonstrate that it is promising to observe the singlet charged scalar at the LHC.
