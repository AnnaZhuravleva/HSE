In this paper we investigate the phenomenology of the electron flavored Dirac dark matter with two types of portal interactions. We analyze constraints from the electron magnetic moment anomaly, LHC searches of singly charged scalar, dark matter relic abundance as well as direct and indirect detections. Our study shows that the available parameter space is quite constrained, but there are parameter space that is compatible with the current data. We further show that the DAMPE cosmic ray electron excess, which indicates cosmic ray excess at around 1.5 TeV, can be interpreted as the annihilation of dark matter into electron positron pairs in this model.
