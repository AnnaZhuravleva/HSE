We propose that neutrino masses can be zero $in ~vacuo$ and may be generated by the local distribution of dark matter through a feeble long range scalar force. We discuss potential phenomenological constraints and implications of this framework. Our model typically implies that the relic neutrino background left over from the Big Bang is mostly absent in our Galactic neighborhood. Hence, a positive detection signal from future proposed experiments, such as PTOLEMY, could in principle falsify our scenario.
