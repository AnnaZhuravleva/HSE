We present a study of the production of vector resonances at the LHC via $W^+Z$ vector boson scattering and explore the sensitivities to these resonances for expected LHC luminosities. We work in the framework of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian, where these resonances can be generated dynamically by unitarizing the scattering amplitudes. We implement all these features into a model adapted for MonteCarlo, the IAM-MC, that allows us to give predictions for the sensitivity to these resonances and to the relevant parameters involved for $pp \to W^+Zjj$, $pp\to \ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\nu jj$, and $pp \to JJjj$.
