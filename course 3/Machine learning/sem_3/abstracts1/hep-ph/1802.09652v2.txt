Through the embedding of superconformal quantum mechanics into AdS space, it is possible to construct an effective supersymmetric QCD light-front Hamiltonian for hadrons, which includes a spin-spin interaction between the hadronic constituents. A specific breaking of conformal symmetry determines a unique effective quark-confining potential for light hadrons, as well as remarkable connections between the meson, baryon, and tetraquark spectra. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and has no supersymmetric partner. The excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson, baryon and tetraquark bound states lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and orbital quantum numbers. Although conformal symmetry is strongly broken by the heavy quark mass, the basic underlying supersymmetric mechanism, which transforms mesons to baryons (and baryons to tetraquarks) into each other, still holds and gives remarkable connections across the entire spectrum of light, heavy-light and double-heavy hadrons. Here we show that all the observed hadrons can be related through this effective supersymmetric QCD, and that it can be used to identify the structure of the new charmonium states.
