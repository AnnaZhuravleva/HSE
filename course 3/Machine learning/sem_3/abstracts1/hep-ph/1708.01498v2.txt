The inclusive diffractive quarkonium photoproduction in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions is investigated considering the Resolved Pomeron Model to describe the diffractive interaction. We estimate the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the $J/\Psi$, $\Psi(2S)$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction in hadronic collisions at the LHC and present our estimate for the total cross sections at the Run 2 energies. A comparison with the predictions associated to the exclusive production also is presented. Our results indicate that the inclusive diffractive production is a factor $\gtrsim 10$ smaller than the exclusive one in the kinematical range probed by the LHC.
