We sketch how the R*-operation can be used to compute the pole terms of Feynman diagrams. We identify computational difficulties when performing five-loop calculations, and provide four solutions that drastically reduce the number of terms that are generated. Using these methods, we have computed the beta function for Yang-Mills theory with fermions, the R-ratio in electron-positron annihilation, and Higgs decays to quarks and gluons at five-loop accuracy. The results for the beta function and Higgs decay width to gluons in the heavy-top limit are briefly discussed. There is no need for six-loop extensions of these calculations in the near future.
