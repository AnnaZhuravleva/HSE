With the Higgs search program already quite mature, there is the exciting possibility of discovering a new particle with rates near that of the SM Higgs. We consider models with a signal in $\gamma \gamma$ below the SM Higgs mass, taking the recent $2.9\, \sigma$ (local) CMS excess at 95 GeV as a target. We discuss singlet models with additional vectorlike matter, but argue that a Type-I two Higgs doublet model provides a more economical scenario. In such a setup, going into regions of moderate-to-strong fermiophobia, the enhanced $\gamma \gamma$ branching ratio allows signals from $VH$+VBF production to yield $\sigma \times BR_{\gamma\gamma} $ comparable to total SM rates. Light $H$ production can be dominated via rare top decays $t \rightarrow b H^+ \rightarrow b W^{*} H$, which provides an alternate explanation of the excess. We consider this in the context of other Higgs anomalies, namely the LEP Higgs excess near the same mass, and excesses in $t\bar{t}h$ searches at Tevatron and LHC. We find that with $140\, \mathrm{GeV} < m_{H^+} < 160\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $\tan \beta \sim 5$ and a coupling to gauge bosons of $\sin^2 \delta \sim 0.1$, such a scenario can produce all the excesses simultanously, where $tth$ arise from contamination from the rare top decays, as previously proposed. An implication of the Type-I scenario is that any $\gamma \gamma$ excess should be associated with additional elements that could reduce background, including $b$-jets, forward jets or signs of vector boson production.
