The weak bosons are bound states of new constituents. The p-wave excitations are studied. The state with the lowest mass is identified with the boson, which has been discovered at the LHC. Specific properties of the excited bosons are discussed, in particular their decays into weak bosons and photons. The stable fermion, consisting of three haplons, provides the dark matter in our universe.
