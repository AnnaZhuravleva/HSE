The Georgi-Machacek model is used to motivate and interpret LHC searches for doubly- and singly-charged Higgs bosons decaying into vector boson pairs. In this paper we study the constraints on and phenomenology of the "H5plane" benchmark scenario in the Georgi-Machacek model, which has been proposed for use in these searches. We show that the entire H5plane benchmark is compatible with the LHC measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings. We also point out that, over much of the H5plane benchmark, the lineshapes of the two CP-even neutral heavy Higgs bosons $H$ and $H_5^0$ will overlap and interfere when produced in vector boson fusion with decays to $W^+W^-$ or $ZZ$. Finally we compute the decay branching ratios of the additional heavy Higgs bosons within the H5plane benchmark to facilitate the development of search strategies for these additional particles.
