We study an effective theory beyond the standard model (SM) where either of two additional gauge singlets, a Majorana fermion and a real scalar, constitutes all or some fraction of dark matter. In particular, we focus on the masses of the two singlets in the range of O(10) MeV-O(10) GeV, with a neutrino portal interaction which plays important roles not only in particle physics but also in cosmology and astronomy. We point out that the dark matter abundance can be thermally explained with (co)annihilation, where the dark matter with a mass greater than 2 GeV can be tested in future lepton colliders, CEPC, ILC, FCC-ee and CLIC, in the light of the Higgs boson invisible decay. When the gauge singlets are lighter than O(100)MeV, the interaction can affect the neutrino propagation in the universe due to its annihilation with the cosmic background neutrino into the gauge singlets. Although can not be the dominant dark matter in this case, the singlets are produced by the invisible decay of the Higgs boson at a rate fully within the reach of the future lepton colliders. In particular, a high energy cutoff of cosmic-ray neutrino, which may account for the non-detection of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) neutrinos or non-observation of Glashow resonance, can be set. Interestingly, given the cutoff and the mass (range) of the WIMP, a neutrino mass can be "measured" kinematically.
