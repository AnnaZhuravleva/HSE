In this paper we study the contribution of the double parton distributions of gluons to the charmonium production. Despite being suppressed in the heavy quark mass limit, numerically this contribution gives a sizeable correction to the leading order $k_{T}$ factorization result in LHC kinematics due to enhancement of gluonic densities in the small Bjorken $x_{B}$ limit. This contribution is not suppressed at large $J/\psi$ momenta $p_{T}$ and thus presents one of the complementary mechanisms of charmonia production in this kinematics.
