In orbifold family unification on the basis of $SU(N)$ gauge theory on the six-dimensional space-time $M^4\times T^2/Z_m$ ($m=2, 3, 4, 6$), enormous numbers of models with three families of the standard model matter multiplets are derived from a massless Dirac fermion with a vectorlike representation $[N, 3] + [N, N-3]$ of $SU(N)$ ($N = 8, 9$). They contain models with three or more than three neutrino singlets and without any non-Abelian continuous flavor gauge symmetries. The relationship between flavor numbers from a fermion with $[N, N-k]$ and those from a fermion with $[N, k]$ are studied from the viewpoint of charge conjugation.
