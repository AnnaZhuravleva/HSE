Triggered by a recent announcement by the LHCb Collaboration of five excited $\Omega^0_c$ resonances of small widths we propose an interpretation based on the Chiral Quark Soliton Model. We argue that three of the LHCb resonances are parity ($-$) excitations of the ground state SU(3) sextets, while the other two with the smallest widths are exotic pentaquarks that belong to the SU(3) $\overline{\mathbf{15}}$. We first briefly review the model and discuss the status of the putative $\Theta^+(1540)$. Next we show how to generalize the model to the case of heavy baryons. We test this approach against the ground state $\overline{\mathbf{3}}$ and ${\mathbf{6}}$ heavy baryons, and discuss different excitations that are possible in the Chiral Quark Soliton Model. We show that the model accommodates two excited $\overline{\mathbf{3}}$ in the charm sector that are experimentally observed. Finally we discuss possible assignments of the LHCb $\Omega^0_c$ states.
