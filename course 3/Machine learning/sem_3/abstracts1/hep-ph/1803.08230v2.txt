We study the conditions for the adiabatic resonant conversion of the cold dark matter (CDM) axions into photons in existence of the astrophysically sourced strong magnetic fields such as those in the neutron star magnetosphere. We demonstrate the possibility that the forthcoming radio telescopes such as the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) can probe those photon signals from the CDM axions.
