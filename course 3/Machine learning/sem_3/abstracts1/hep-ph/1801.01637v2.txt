We derive analytical results for unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution function at small transverse momentum. By Fourier transforming the $S$-matrix for large dipoles we derive the results in the form of a series of Bells polynomials. Interestingly, when resumming the series in leading log accuracy, the results showing up striking similarity with the Sudakov form factor with role play of coupling is being done by a constant that stems from the saddle point condition along the saturation line.
