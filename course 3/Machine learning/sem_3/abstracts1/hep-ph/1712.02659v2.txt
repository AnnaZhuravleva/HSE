The equilibration of a finite Bose system is modelled using a gradient expansion of the collision integral that leads to a nonlinear transport equation. For constant transport coefficients, it is solved in closed form through a nonlinear transformation. Using schematic initial conditions, the exact solution and the equilibration time are derived and compared to the corresponding case for fermions. Applications to the equilibration of the gluon system created initially in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and to cold quantum gases are envisaged.
