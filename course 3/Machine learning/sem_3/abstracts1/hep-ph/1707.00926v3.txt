We review the current status of searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model in the diphoton channel at the LHC and estimate the reach with future collected data. We perform a model independent analysis based on an effective field theory approach and different production mechanisms. As an illustrative example, we apply our results to a scenario of minimal composite dynamics.
