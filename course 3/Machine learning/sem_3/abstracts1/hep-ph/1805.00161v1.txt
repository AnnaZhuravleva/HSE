We present two non-supersymmetric models involving different content of additional vector-like fermions. In both models, gauge coupling unification, neutrino mass generation and Higgs inflation mechanism are related to each other. It is known that when TeV scale vector-like fermions are introduced in order to implement the Standard Model (SM) gauge coupling unification, it also solves the SM Higgs vacuum stability problem. Involving additional new state at intermediate scale makes it possible to give successful gauge coupling unification even at reduced Planck scale. We adopt in our models Type I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses. Appropriate choice of the type I Seesaw scale allows us to have an arbitrarily small but positive value of SM Higgs quartic coupling around the reduced Planck scale. Implementing this observation into the SM Higgs inflation models leads us to have the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ between Higgs field and Ricci scalar less then 100. We present a few benchmark points where we show that the scalar spectral indices are around 0.9626 and 0.9685 respectively for the number of e-folding $N=50$ and $N=60$. The tensor-to-scalar ratios are at the order of $10^{-3}$. The running of the scalar spectral index is negative and is order of $10^{-4}$.
