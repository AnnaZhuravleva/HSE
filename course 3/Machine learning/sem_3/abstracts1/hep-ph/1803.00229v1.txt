We have systematically derived the analytical expressions of the magnetic moments of the spin-$1\over 2$ heavy baryons to the next-to-next-to-leading order in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT). We include the spin-$1\over 2$ and spin-$3\over 2$ heavy hadrons as the intermediate states in the chiral loops and estimate the low energy constants (LECs) with the help of the quark model and lattice QCD simulations. We give the numerical results to the next-to-leading order for the anti-triplet heavy baryons and to the next-to-next-to-leading order for the sextet states.
