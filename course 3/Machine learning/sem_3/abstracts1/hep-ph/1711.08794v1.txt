Recasting the $N$-point one loop scalar integral from Feynman to Schwinger parameters gives an integrand with a Gaussian form. By application of a Fourier transform, it is easy to derive explicit expressions for the two, three and four-point functions. The Fourier transformation disentangles singularities in the complex plane and extract their contribution as two-point functions in two dimensions. We explicitly derive a one dimensional expression for the (4D) four-point function whose integrand involves only square root and arcsine functions. This report is a condensed version of the approach developed in \cite{Benhaddou2016} which does not make use of probabilistic jargon.
