Large momentum effective field theory provides a new direction for lattice QCD calculations of hadronic structure functions, such as parton distribution functions (PDFs), meson distribution amplitudes, and so on, directly with $x$-dependence. In the framework of Lattice Perturbation Theory (LPT), we compute the one-loop quark-in-quark quasi-PDF with the na\"ive fermion action and Wilson-Clover action and show that it reduces to the continuum quasi-PDF in the continuum limit. We point out, however, that the continuum limit and massless quark limit do not commute. As a consequence, the collinear divergence is absent in the quasi-PDF at any finite lattice spacing and we find that the correct condition to recover the continuum quasi-PDF is $aP_{3}^{2}\ll m\ll P_{3}$, where $P_3$ is the momentum in the direction of the quark's motion (longitudinal direction). The correction to the quasi-PDF using na\"ive fermion action is due to the Wilson term and can be viewed as an $\mathcal{O}\left(a^{1}\right)$ correction. For nonzero $r$, the $\mathcal{O}\left(a^{1}\right)$ corrections are subsequently mixed with the quasi-PDF using na\"ive fermion action.
