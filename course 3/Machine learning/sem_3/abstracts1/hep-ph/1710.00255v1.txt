We consider a phenomenologycal parametrization of the QCD running coupling which arises from the dispersion relation respecting the holomorphic properties of the physical QCD observables in the complex momentum plane. The parameters are fixed by the following requirements: 1) at enough high energies, it reproduces the underlying perturbative coupling, 2) at intermediate energy momenta, it reproduces the experimental semihadronic tau decay ratio, and 3) in the deep IR regime, it satisfies the qualitative properties coming from recent lattice results. Finally, we apply this new coupling to low-energy available experimental data. In particular, to Borel sum rules for {\tau}-decay, extracting the values of the dimension 4 and 6 condensates, to the V-channel Adler function, and to polarized Bjorken Sum Rule.
