The glueball dark matter, in the pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theory, engenders dark SU(N) stars that comprise self-gravitating compact configurations of scalar glueball fields. Corrections to the highest frequency of gravitational wave radiation emitted by dark SU(N) star mergers on a fluid brane with variable tension, implemented by the minimal geometric deformation, are derived and their consequences analysed. Hence, dark SU(N) stars mergers on a fluid brane-world are shown to be better detectable by the LIGO and the eLISA experiments.
