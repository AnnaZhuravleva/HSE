The transverse momentum distributions for inclusive $\eta_{c,b}$ meson described by gluon-gluon interactions from photoproduction processes in relativistic heavy ion collisions are calculated. We considered the color singlet (CS) and color octet (CO) components with the framework of non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) into the production of heavy quarkonium. The phenomenological values of the matrix elements for the color-singlet and color-octet components give the main contribution to the production of heavy quarkonium from the gluon-gluon interaction caused by the emission of additional gluon in the initial state. The numerical results indicate that the contribution of photoproduction processes cannot be negligible for mid-rapidity in p-p and Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies.
