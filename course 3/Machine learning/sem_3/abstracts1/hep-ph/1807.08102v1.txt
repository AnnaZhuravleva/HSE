Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) of neutrinos may originate from models in which new particles interact with neutrinos. In scalar extensions of the SM, the typical approach to obtain NSI requires Fierz transformations and charged Higgses, which suffer from strong constraints from collider searches or charged lepton flavor violation processes. We propose here an alternative approach to generate NSI, namely via loop processes. We show that such loop-induced NSI from secret neutrino interactions can reach sizes of ${\cal O}(0.1\sim1)$ compared to standard Fermi interaction. This approach can also give rise to neutrino-quark NSI.
