We calculate pionic contribution to the relativistic Fermi Liquid parameters (RFLPs) using Chiral Effective Lagrangian. The RFLPs so determined are then used to calculate chemical potential, exchange and nuclear symmetry energies due to $\pi$$N$ interaction. We also evaluate two loop ring diagrams involving $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges and compare results with what one obtains from the relativistic Fermi Liquid theory (RFLT).
