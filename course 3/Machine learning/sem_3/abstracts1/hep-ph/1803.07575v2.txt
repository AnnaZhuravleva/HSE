We present models in which axions have large couplings to hadrons while remaining naturally light. By assigning $U(1)_{PQ}$ charges to Standard Model quarks such that $U(1)_{PQ}$ is not anomalous under QCD, the derivative couplings naturally arise while no potential is generated for the axion upon QCD confinement. We present simple models that implement this idea both for an axion-like particle and for the QCD axion. We show that both models lead to sizable flavor violations that could be probed by future experiments. Our construction shows that the axion coupling to hadrons can be essentially independent from its mass and thus motivates experimental searches in a wide range of axion parameter space.
