Recently the Belle collaboration has discovered a narrow cascade, the $\Omega(2012)$. We explore the possibility that the $\Omega(2012)$ is a $\Xi(1530)\,K$ molecule, where the binding mechanism is the coupled channel dynamics with the $\Omega\,\eta$ channel. The characteristic signature of a molecular $\Omega(2012)$ will be its decay into the three body channel $\Xi \pi \bar{K}$, for which we expect a partial decay width of $2-3\,{\rm MeV}$. The partial decay width into the $\Xi \bar{K}$ channel should lie in the range of $1-11\,{\rm MeV}$, a figure compatible with experiment and which we have deduced from the assumption that the coupling involved in this decay is of natural size. For comparison purposes, the decay of a purely compact $\Omega(2012)$ into this channel is expected to be moderately broader. A molecular $\Omega(2012)$ will imply the existence of two- and three-body molecular partners. The two-body partners comprise two $\Lambda$ hyperons located at $1740$ and $1950\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively, the first of which might correspond to the $\Lambda(1800)$ while the second to the $\Lambda(2000)$ or the $\Lambda(2050)$. The three-body partners include a $\Xi(1530) K\bar{K}$ and a $\Xi(1530) \eta \bar{K}$ molecule, with masses of $M = 2385-2445\,{\rm MeV}$ and $M = 2434-2503\,{\rm MeV}$ respectively. We might be tempted to identify the first with the $\Xi(2370)$ and the latter with the $\Omega(2470)$ listed in the PDG.
