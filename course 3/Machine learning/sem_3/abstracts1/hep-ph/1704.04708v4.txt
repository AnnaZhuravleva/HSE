While indirect & direct CP violations (CPV) had been established in the decays of strange & beauty mesons, none have been done for baryons. There are different "roads" for finding CP asymmetries in the decays of strange baryons; they are highly non-trivial ones. The HyperCP Collaboration had probed CPV in the decays of single $\Xi$ & $\Lambda$ [Phys.Rev.Lett 93 (2004) 262001]. We talk about future lessons from $e^+e^-$ collisions at BESIII/BEPCII: probing decays of pairs of strange baryons, namely $\Lambda$, $\Sigma$ & $\Xi$. Realistic goals are to learn about non-perturbative QCD. One can hope to find CPV in the decays of strange baryons; one can also dream to find impact of New Dynamics (ND). We point out that a new important era starts with the BESIII/BEPCII data accumulated by the end of 2018.
