It was recently pointed out that direct detection signals from at least three different targets may be used to determine whether the Dark Matter (DM) particle is different from its antiparticle. In this work, we examine in detail the feasibility of this test under different conditions, motivated by proposals for future detectors. Specifically, we perform likelihood fits to mock data under the hypotheses that the DM particle is identical to or different from its antiparticle, and determine the significance with which the former can be rejected in favor of the latter. In our analysis, we consider 3 different values of the DM mass ($50$ GeV, $300$ GeV, $1$ TeV) and 4 different experimental ensembles, each consisting of at least 3 different targets -- Xe and Ar plus one among the following: Si, Ge, $\mathrm{CaWO_4}$, or Ge/$\mathrm{CaWO_4}$. For each of these experimental ensembles and each DM mass, the expected discrimination significance is calculated as a function of the DM-nucleon couplings. In the best case scenario, the discrimination significance can reach $\mathcal{O}(3\sigma)$ for three of the four ensembles considered, and $\mathcal{O}(5\sigma)$ for the ensemble including $\mathrm{Si}$, highlighting the need for a variety of experimental targets in order to determine the DM properties. These results show that future direct detection signals could be used to exclude, at a statistically significant level, a Majorana or a real DM particle, giving a critical clue about the identity of the Dark Matter.
