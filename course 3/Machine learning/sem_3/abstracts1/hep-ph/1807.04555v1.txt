We propose a new kind of inverse seesaw model without any additional symmetries. Instead, we introduce several fermions and bosons with higher $SU(2)_L$ representations. After formulating the Higgs sector and neutrino sector, we show that the cut-off energy, which is valid to our model, is at around TeV scale, by examining behavior of $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. Then we show the testability of our model at collider physics.
