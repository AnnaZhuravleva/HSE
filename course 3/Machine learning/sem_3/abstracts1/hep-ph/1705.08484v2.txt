We consider an extension of the Standard Model that provide an unified description of eV scale neutrino mass and dark energy. An explicit model is presented by augmenting the Standard Model with an $SU(2)_L$ doublet scalar, a singlet scalar and right handed neutrinos where all of them are assumed to be charged under a global $U(1)_X$ symmetry. A light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson, associated with the spontaneously broken $U(1)_{X}$ symmetry, acts as a mediator of an attractive force leading to a Dirac neutrino condensate, with large correlation length, and a non-zero gap in the right range providing a cosmologically feasible dark energy scenario. The neutrino mass is generated through the usual Dirac seesaw mechanism. Parameter space, reproducing viable dark energy scenario while having neutrino mass in the right ballpark, is presented.
