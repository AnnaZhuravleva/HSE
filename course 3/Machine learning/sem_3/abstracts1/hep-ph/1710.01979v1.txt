Charged-particle multiplicity distributions are an interesting tool to study both soft- and hard-QCD processes in hadronic collisions. Since last century a significant range of center-of-mass energies has been probed, ranging from a few GeV to 13 TeV in the latest LHC run. Common analysis of multiplicity distributions at different energies, in different phase space regions and from sufficiently different experiments provides a way to systematize and review existing phenomenological models of multiple particle production. In this work a phenomenological model is suggested, that can describe simultaneously charged-particle multiplicity distributions in different restricted pseudorapidity intervals for proton-proton collisions. The model is successfully applied to experimental results of ALICE experiment at LHC.
