We investigate the regularization-scheme dependent treatment of $\gamma_{5}$ in the framework of dimensional regularization, mainly focusing on the four-dimensional helicity scheme (FDH). Evaluating distinctive examples, we find that for one-loop calculations, the recently proposed four-dimensional formulation (FDF) of the FDH scheme constitutes a viable and efficient alternative compared to more traditional approaches. In addition, we extend the considerations to the two-loop level and compute the pseudo-scalar form factors of quarks and gluons in FDH. We provide the necessary operator renormalization and discuss at a practical level how the complexity of intermediate calculational steps can be reduced in an efficient way.
