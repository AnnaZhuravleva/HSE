The presented paper is devoted to theoretical analysis of charmonium mesons $\eta_c$, $J/\psi$, $\chi_{c0,1,2}$, and $h_c$ production in exclusive radiative $Z$ boson decays in the frameworks of Nonrelativistic Chromodynamic and amplitude expansion on the light-cone. In the framework of light-cone expansion amplitudes and widths of all processes are described with one universal relation. It is interesting to note that from this relation it follows automatically which component of $Z$ boson (either vector or axial) gives contribution to the width of the particular decay. It is shown that the effect of internal quark motion almost doubles theoretical predictions for production of $S$-wave charmonia and $\chi_{c1}$ meson.
