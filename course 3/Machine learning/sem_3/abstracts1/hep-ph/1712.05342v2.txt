This paper gives a summary of selected highlights discussed in the working group on "Structure Functions and Parton Densities" (WG1) at the DIS 2017 conference. From the many talks presented we extract some general themes discussed with respect to global PDF fits, new PDF-sensitive measurements from the LHC experiments and elsewhere, exploitation of new ideas, tools to perform PDF fits, PDFs of heavy nuclei, and finally progress in basic theory calculations.
