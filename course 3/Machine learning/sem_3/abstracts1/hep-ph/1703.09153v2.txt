We study a simple one-loop induced neutrino mass model that contains both bosonic and fermionic dark matter candidates and has the capacity to explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment anomaly. We perform a comprehensive analysis by taking into account the relevant constraints of charged lepton flavor violation, electric dipole moments, and neutrino oscillation data. We examine the constraints from lepton flavor-changing $Z$ boson decays at one-loop level, particularly when the involved couplings contribute to the muon $g-2$. It is found that $\text{BR}(Z\to \mu\tau)\simeq (10^{-7}$ - $10^{-6})$ while $\text{BR}(\tau\to\mu\gamma)\lesssim 10^{-11}$ in the fermionic dark matter scenario. The former can be probed by the precision measurement of the $Z$ boson at future lepton colliders.
