We compute the baryon asymmetry in the Universe in the framework of the standard model with the only source of CP violation in the CKM matrix. Our result is within and very close to the theoretical limits for baryon asymmetry found in the literature and too small to account for the experimentally required baryon asymmetry in standard cosmologies. The method can be easily extended to beyond standard model theories.
