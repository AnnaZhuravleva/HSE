Recently, a measurement of the vector-boson scattering process with same-sign W bosons has been reported by the CMS collaboration. Hence it is of prime importance to have precise predictions with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. In these proceedings, we report on a recent NLO electroweak computation to the full process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\nu_\mu{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}{\rm j}{\rm j}$. As realistic experimental event selections are applied to the final state, it can directly be compared with experimental measurements. This is particularly important as the corrections turn out to be surprisingly large and even exceed the NLO QCD corrections. The NLO electroweak predictions are presented at the cross-section and differential distribution level.
