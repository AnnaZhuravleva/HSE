We further elaborate on the proposal that the Higgs boson should be a broad heavy resonance, referred to as true Higgs $H_T$, with mass around $750 \, GeV$.   We stress once again that within the Standard Model the true Higgs is the unique possibility to implement the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the local gauge symmetry by elementary, relativistic and strictly local scalar fields. We discuss the most relevant decay modes of the $H_T$ boson and estimate they partial decay widths and branching ratios. We discuss briefly the experimental signatures of the $H_T$ Higgs boson and compare with the recent available LHC data at $\sqrt{s} =13 \,TeV$. We find that the coupling of the $H_T$ Higgs boson to fermions is strongly suppressed.   We also compare our theoretical expectations in the so-called golden channel to the data collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at $\sqrt{s} =13 \,TeV$ with an integrated luminosity of $36.1 \, fb^{-1}$ and $35.9 \, fb^{-1}$ respectively. We find that our theoretical expectations are in fair good agreement with the experimental observations. Combining the data from both the LHC Collaborations we obtain an evidence of the heavy Higgs boson in this channel with an estimated statistical significance of more than three standard deviations. Finally, we argue that, if the signal is real, by the end of the Run 2 both the LHC experiments will reach in the golden channel a statistical significance of about five standard deviations.
