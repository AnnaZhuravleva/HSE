We propose a novel scenario of inflation, in which the inflaton is identified as the lightest mode of an angular field in a compactified fifth dimension. The periodic effective potential exhibits exponentially flat plateaus, so that a sub-Planckian field excursion without hilltop initial conditions is naturally realized. We can obtain consistent predictions with observations on the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
