Inclusive jet production in p-p and pbar-p collisions shows many of the same kinematic systematics as observed in single particle inclusive production at much lower energies. In an earlier study (1974) a phenomenology, called radial scaling, was developed for the single particle inclusive cross sections that attempted to capture the essential underlying physics of point-like parton scattering and the fragmentation of partons into hadrons suppressed by the kinematic boundary. The phenomenology was successful in emphasizing the underlying systematics of the inclusive particle productions. Here we demonstrate that inclusive jet production at the LHC in high-energy p-p collisions and at the Tevatron in pbar-p inelastic scattering show similar behavior. The ATLAS inclusive jet production plotted as a function of this scaling variable is studied for sqrt(s) of 2.76, 7 and 13 TeV and is compared to pbar-p inclusive jet production at 1.96 TeV measured at the CDF and D0 at the Tevatron and p-Pb inclusive jet production at the LHC ATLAS at sqrt(sNN) = 5.02 TeV. Inclusive single particle production at FNAL fixed target and ISR energies are compared to inclusive J/Psi production at the LHC measured in ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. Striking common features of the data are discussed.
