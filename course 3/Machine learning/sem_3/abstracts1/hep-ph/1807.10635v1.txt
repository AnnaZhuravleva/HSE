We consider the production of the new gauge boson $Z^{}_{\mu\tau}$ predicted by the ${U(1)}_{L^{}_{\mu} - L^{}_{\tau}}$ model via SM-like Higgs boson $h^{}_{1}$ decaying in the ${t}\bar{t}h^{}_{1}$ production at LHC. Considering the current constraints on the relevant free parameters, we calculate its production cross section and further investigate the possibility of detecting $Z^{}_{\mu\tau}$ through the process $pp\to{t(\to{bjj})}\bar{t}(\to{\bar{b}l^{-}\bar{\nu}_{l}})h_{1}(\to{Z_{\mu\tau}Z_{\mu\tau}})\to{b\bar{b}jjl^{-}\bar{\nu}_{l}}+/\!\!\!\!E_{T}$ at LHC. We find that $Z^{}_{\mu\tau}$ might be detected via this process at LHC with high integrated luminosity.
