We show what type of effects on the rate of $Z_L$ production in the $\gamma\gamma\to t\bar t Z$ and $gluon~gluon\to t\bar t Z$ processes could be produced by an effective scale dependent top mass or by final state interactions between massive particles for example generated by the presence of dark matter.
