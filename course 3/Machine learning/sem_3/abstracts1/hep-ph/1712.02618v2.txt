The wounded nucleon and quark emission functions are extracted for different centralities in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200\ \text{GeV}$ using Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data. The shape of the emission function depends on centrality in the wounded nucleon model, whereas it is practically universal (within uncertainties) in the wounded quark model. Predictions for $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ distributions in p+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions are presented.
