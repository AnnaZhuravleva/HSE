New light vector particles - hidden photons - are present in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. They can be produced in nuclear reactors and registered by neutrino detectors. New limits on the models with hidden photons have been obtained in arXiv:1705.02470v4 [hep-ph] from analysis of published results of the NEOS and TEXONO neutrino experiments. We criticize that paper from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Accounting for oscillations between visible and hidden photons, we find that the neutrino experiments are generally insensitive to the hidden photons lighter than $\sim 0.1$\,eV, and present revised limits for heavier hidden photons from results of the TEXONO experiment.
