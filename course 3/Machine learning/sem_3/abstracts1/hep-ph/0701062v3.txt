We propose a new mechanism of TeV scale leptogenesis where the chemical potential of right-handed electron is passed on to the $B-L$ asymmetry of the Universe in the presence of sphalerons. The model has the virtue that the origin of neutrino masses are independent of the scale of leptogenesis. As a result, the model could be extended to explain {\it dark matter, dark energy, neutrino masses and leptogenesis at the TeV scale}. The most attractive feature of this model is that it predicts a few hundred GeV triplet Higgs scalar that can be tested at LHC or ILC.
