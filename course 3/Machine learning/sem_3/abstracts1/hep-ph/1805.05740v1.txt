We study the structure of heavy quark spin (HQS) multiplets for heavy meson-baryon molecular states in a coupled system of $\bar{P}^{(*)}\Sigma_{Q}^{(*)}$, with constructing the one-pion exchange potential with S-wave orbital angular momentum. Using the light cloud spin basis, we find that there are four types of HQS multiplets classified by the structure of heavy quark spin and light cloud spin. The multiplets which have attractive potential are determined by the sign of the coupling constant for the heavy meson-pion interactions. Furthermore, the difference in the structure of light cloud spin gives the restrictions of the decay channel, which implies that the partial decay width has the information for the structure of HQS multiplets. This behavior is more likely to appear in hidden-bottom sector than in hidden-charm sector.
