This paper examines the transverse momentum spectra of baryons in the multi particle production at modern colliders using Quark-Gluon String Model (QGSM). It discusses 1) the difference in \Lambda-hyperon spectra at antiproton-proton vs. proton-proton reactions; 2) the growth of average transverse momenta of \Lambda hyperon with proton-proton collision energies and 3) the dependence of average p_t on the masses of mesons and baryons at the LHC energy 7 TeV. This analysis of baryon spectra led to the following conclusions. First, the fragmentation of antidiquark-diquark side of pomeron diagram makes the major contribution to baryon production spectra in the asymmetric antiproton-proton reaction. Second, the average p_t's of hyperons steadily grow with energy on the range from sqrt{s}= 53 GeV to 7 TeV. Since no dramatic changes were seen in the characteristics of baryon production, the hadroproduction processes do not cause the "knee" in the cosmic ray proton spectra at the energies between Tevatron and LHC. Third, the average transverse momentum analysis through examining the different mass of baryons and hadrons reveals the regularity in the mass gaps between hadron generations. This observation gives the possibility for more hadrons with the masses: 13.7, 37.3, 101.5, 276, 750... GeV, which are produced by geometrical progression with the mass factor of order \delta(lnM)=1. These hadrons may be multiquark states with neutral baryon charge and provide the growth of average transverse momenta with energy.
