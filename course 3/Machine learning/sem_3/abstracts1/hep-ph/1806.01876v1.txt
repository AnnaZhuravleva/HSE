We propose a minimal predictive scenario for dark matter and radiative neutrino mass where the relic abundance of dark matter is generated from a hybrid setup comprising of both thermal freeze-out as well as non-thermal freeze-in mechanisms. Considering three copies of fermion triplets and one scalar doublet, odd under an unbroken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, to be responsible for radiative origin of neutrino mass, we consider the lightest fermion triplet as a dark matter candidate which remains under-abundant in the sub-TeV regime from usual thermal freeze-out. Late decay of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-odd scalar doublet into dark matter serves as the non-thermal (freeze-in) contribution which not only fills the thermal dark matter deficit, but also constrains the mother particle's parameter space so that the correct relic abundance of dark matter is generated. Apart from showing interesting differences from the purely freeze-out and purely freeze-in dark matter scenarios, the model remains testable through disappearing charge track signatures at colliders, observable direct and indirect detection rates for dark matter and prediction of almost vanishing lightest neutrino mass.
