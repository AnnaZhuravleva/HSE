Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are nonperturbative quantities describing the relation between a hadron and quarks and gluons within it. We propose to extract PDFs from QCD global analysis of "data" generated by lattice QCD calculations of good "lattice cross sections", which are basically single-hadron matrix elements that are lattice QCD calculable and perturbative QCD factorizable into the PDFs. To demonstrate the existence of good "lattice cross sections", we take quasi-quark distribution introduced by Ji \cite{Ji:2013dva} as a case study to show that it could be factorized into the PDFs to all orders in perturbation theory if it can be multiplicatively renormalized. We calculate the factorized coefficients at the next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$.
