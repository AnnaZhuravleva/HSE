A scale-invariant chiral effective Lagrangian is constructed for octet pions and a dilaton figuring as Nambu-Goldstone bosons with vector mesons incorporated as hidden gauge fields. The Lagrangian is built to the next-to-leading order in chiral-scale counting without baryon fields and then to leading order including baryons. The resulting theory is hidden scale-symmetric and local symmetric. We also discuss some possible applications of the present Lagrangian.
