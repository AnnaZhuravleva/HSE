The hypothesis of limiting fragmentation (LF) or it is called otherwise recently, as extended longitudinal scaling, is an interesting phenomena in high energy multiparticle production process. This paper discusses about different regions of phase space and their importance in hadron production, giving special emphasis on the fragmentation region. Although it was conjectured as a universal phenomenon in high energy physics, with the advent of higher center-of-mass energies, it has become prudent to analyse and understand the validity of such hypothesis in view of the increasing nucleon-nucleon cross-section ($\sigma_{\rm in}$). In this work, we revisit the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation for nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions in the pseudorapidity distribution of charged particles at various energies. We use energy dependent $\sigma_{\rm in}$ to get the pseudorapidity distributions of cross-section of charged particles and study the phenomenon of LF. We find that LF seems to be violated at LHC energies while considering the energy dependent $\sigma_{\rm in}$. We also perform a similar study using A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) Model with string melting scenario and find that LF is violated at LHC energies.
