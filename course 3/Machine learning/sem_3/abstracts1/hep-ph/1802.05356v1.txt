Use a massive jet's true-rapidity instead of its pseudorapidity, even for event displays and for determining if a jet is near a calorimeter edge. Use transverse momentum instead of transverse energy since only the former is conserved. Use massive constituents because using massless constituents reduces the jet mass by an amount proportional to the square of the number of hadrons in the jet, and can amount to several GeV. These three recommendations are important for precision measurements when jets are constructed by adding constituent 4-vectors.
