The interference effect between leptonic radiative corrections and hadronic polarization functions is calculated via optical theorem for $\mu-$pair productions. Fine selected new data for the production cross section $\sigma_h(e^+e^-\rightarrow hadrons$) are used for calculation of hadronic vacuum polarization, which enter the dressed photon propagator in muon pair production. The result is compared with KLOE experiment for $\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$ production at $\phi $ meson energy, as well as the running fine structure coupling is compared with recent KLOE2 experiment for radiative return $\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$ production at $ \omega/\rho $ meson energy.
