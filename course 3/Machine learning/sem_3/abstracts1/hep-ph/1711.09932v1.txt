We show that Mellin moments of generalized parton distributions, given as even polynomials in the skewness parameter, are obtained from the Taylor expansion of light front wave functions. Furthermore, we derive non-standard versions of the inverse Radon transform to obtain the double distribution from the parton number conserved light front wave function overlap. These transformations are utilized to extend a generalized parton distribution from the outer region to the central one. We exemplify the formalism for a light front wave function that arises from an AdS/QCD duality conjecture.
