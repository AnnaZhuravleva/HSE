The extremely large hierarchy observed in the fermion mass spectrum remains as one of the most puzzling and unresolved issues in particle physics. In a recent proposal, however, it was demonstrated that by introducing one Higgs doublet (or Private Higgs) per fermion this hierarchy could be made natural by making the Yukawa couplings between each fermion and its respective Higgs boson of order unity. Among the interesting predictions of the Private Higgs scenario is a variety of scalars which could be probed at future collider experiments and a possible dark matter candidate. In this paper, we study in some detail the dark matter sector of the Private Higgs model. We first calculate the annihilation cross sections of dark matter in this model and find that one can easily account for the observed density of dark matter in the Universe with relatively natural values of the model's parameters. Finally, we investigate the possibility of detecting Private Higgs dark matter indirectly via the observation of anomalous gamma rays originating from the galactic halo. We show that a substantial flux of photons can be produced from the annihilation of Private Higgs dark matter such that, if there is considerable clumping of dark matter in the galactic halo, the flux of these gamma rays could be observed by ground-based telescope arrays such as VERITAS and HESS.
