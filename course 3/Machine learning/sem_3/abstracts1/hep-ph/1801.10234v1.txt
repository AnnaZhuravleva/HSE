The SU(4) Polyakov linear sigma model (PLSM) is extended towards characterizing the chiral condensates, $\sigma_l$, $\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_c$ of light, strange and charm quarks, respectively and the deconfinement order-parameters $\phi$ and $\bar{\phi}$ at finite temperatures and densities (chemical potentials). The PLSM is considered to study the QCD equation of state in the presence of the chiral condensate of charm for different finite chemical potentials. The PLSM results are in a good agreement with the recent lattice QCD simulations. We conclude that, the charm condensate is likely not affected by the QCD phase-transition, where the corresponding critical temperature is greater than that of the light and strange quark condensates.
