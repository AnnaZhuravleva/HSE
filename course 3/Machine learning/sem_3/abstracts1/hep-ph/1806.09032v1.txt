In this paper, we generalize Coleman-Weinberg (CW) inflation in grand unified theories (GUTs) such as $\text{SU}(5)$ and $\text{SO}(10)$ by means of considering a two complex singlet fields with conformal invariance. In this framework, inflation is a result of spontaneously broken conformal symmetry in addition to the GUT symmetry. The latter implies a potential of CW form as a consequence of radiative corrections and the former flattens the above VEV branch of CW potential to a Starobinsky plateau, as a result we obtain $n_{s}\sim 1-\frac{2}{N}$ and $r\sim \frac{12}{N^2}$ for $N\sim 50-60$ number of e-foldings. We calculate the corresponding estimations of proton lifetime as $\tau_{p}\lesssim 10^{40}$ years whose decay mediated by the superheavy gauge bosons. We implement type I seesaw mechanism by weakly coupling the complex singlet, which carries two units of lepton number, to the three generations of singlet right handed neutrinos (RHNs). The spontaneous symmetry breaking of global lepton number amounts to the generation of neutrino masses. We consider non-thermal leptogenesis in which inflaton dominantly decays into heavy RHNs which sources the observed baryon asymmetry. We constrain the couplings of the inflaton field to the RHNs which gives the reheating temperature as $10^{6}\text{ GeV}\lesssim T_{R}<10^{9}$ GeV.
