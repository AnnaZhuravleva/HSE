In the effective field theory framework, quantum gravity can induce effective dimension-5 operators, which have important impacts on grand unified theories. Interestingly, one of main effects is the modification of the usual gauge coupling unification condition. We investigate the gauge coupling unification in $E_{6}$ under modified gauge coupling unification condition at scales $M_X$ in the presence of one or more dimension-5 operators. It is shown that nonsupersymmetric models of $E_6$ unification can be obtained and can easily satisfy the constraints from the proton lifetime. For constructing these models, we consider several maximal subgroups $H=SO(10)\times U(1), H=SU(3)\times SU(3)\times SU(3)$, and $H=SU(2)\times SU(6)$ of $E_{6}$ and the usual breaking chains for a specific maximal subgroup, and derive all of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\Phi^{(r)}_{s,z}$ associated with $E_6$ breaking to the Standard Model, which are given in Appendix A.
