A review is given of hypothetical faster-than-light tachyons and the development of the author's $3+3$ model of the neutrino mass states, which includes one tachyonic mass state doublet. Published empirical evidence for the model is summarized, including a new interpretation of the mysterious Mont Blanc neutrino burst from SN 1987A as being due to tachyonic neutrinos having $m^2=-0.38 eV^2.$ This possibility requires an 8 MeV antineutrino line from SN 1987A, which a new dark matter model has been found to support. Furthermore, this dark matter model is supported by several data sets: $\gamma-$rays from the galactic center, and the Kamiokande-II data on the day of SN 1987A.
