We propose that dark matter is composed of particles that naturally have the correct thermal relic density, but have neither weak-scale masses nor weak interactions. These WIMPless models emerge naturally from gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, where they elegantly solve the dark matter problem. The framework accommodates single or multiple component dark matter, dark matter masses from 10 MeV to 10 TeV, and interaction strengths from gravitational to strong. These candidates enhance many direct and indirect signals relative to WIMPs and have qualitatively new implications for dark matter searches and cosmological implications for colliders.
