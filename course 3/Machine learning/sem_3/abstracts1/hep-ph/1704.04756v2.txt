The spin flavor precession (SFP) is investigated in the three neutrino generation case assuming that the neutrinos are Majorana type. Approximate analytical formulas including all transition magnetic moments are provided for the electron neutrino survival probability and electron neutrino -> electron anti-neutrino transition probability in the SFP framework. The accuracy of the formulas is checked out for two different magnetic field profiles in the Sun.
