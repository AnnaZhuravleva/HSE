In a one-boson-exchange model, we study molecular states of double-charm baryon ($\Xi_{cc}(3621)$) and a charmed meson ($D$ and $D^*$). Our model indicates that there exist two possible triple-charm molecular pentaquarks, a $\Xi_{cc}D$ state with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$ and a $\Xi_{cc}D^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(3/2^-)$. In addition, we also extend our formula to explore $\Xi_{cc}\bar{B}^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}\bar{D}^{(*)}$, and $\Xi_{cc}B^{(*)}$ systems, and find more possible heavy flavor molecular pentaquarks, a $\Xi_{cc}\bar{B}$ state with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$, a $\Xi_{cc}\bar{B}^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(3/2^-)$, and $\Xi_{cc}\bar{D}^*/\Xi_{cc}B^*$ states with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$. Experimental search for these predicted triple-charm molecular pentaquarks is encouraged.
