O(1) eV sterile neutrino can be responsible for a number of anomalous results of neutrino oscillation experiments. This hypothesis may be tested at short base-line neutrino oscillation experiments, several of which are either ongoing or under construction. Here we concentrate on the so-called Gallium anomaly, found by SAGE and GALLEX experiments, and its foreseeable future tests with BEST experiment at Baksan Neutrino Observatory. We start with a revision of the neutrino-gallium cross section, that is performed by utilizing the recent measurements of the nuclear final state spectra. We accordingly correct the parameters of Gallium anomaly and refine the BEST prospects in testing it and searching for sterile neutrinos. We further evolve the previously proposed idea to investigate the anomaly with Zn-65 artificial neutrino source as a next option available at BEST, and estimate its sensitivity to the sterile neutrino model parameters following the Bayesian approach. We show that after the two stages of operation BEST will make 5$\sigma$-discovery of the sterile neutrinos, if they are behind the Gallium anomaly.
