We consider tomography of the Earth's interior using the neutrino pair beam which has recently been proposed. The beam produces a large amount of neutrino and antineutrino pairs from the circulating partially stripped ions and provides the possibility to measure precisely the energy spectrum of neutrino oscillation probability together with a sufficiently large detector. It is shown that the pair beam gives a better sensitivity to probe the Earth's crust compared with the neutrino sources at present. In addition we present a method to reconstruct a matter density profile by means of the analytic formula of the oscillation probability in which the matter effect is included perturbatively to the second order.
