We propose a model with $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry and several new fermions in no conflict with anomaly cancellation where the neutrino masses are given by the vacuum expectation value of Higgs triplet induced at the one-loop level. The new fermions are odd under discrete $Z_2$ symmetry and the lightest one becomes dark matter candidate. We find that the mass of dark matter is typically $O(1)$-$O(10)$ GeV. Then relic density of the dark matter is discussed.
