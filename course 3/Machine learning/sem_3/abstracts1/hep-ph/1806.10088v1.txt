A set of four Finite Energy QCD sum rules are used to determine the magnetic field dependence of the sum of the up- and down-quark masses of QCD, $(m_u + m_d)$, the pion decay constant $f_\pi$, the pion mass $m_\pi$, the gluon condensate, $\langle 0| \alpha_s\, G^2|0\rangle$, and the squared energy threshold for the onset of perturbative QCD, $s_0$, related to the Polyakov loop of lattice QCD.
