Central jet vetoes are powerful tools for reducing QCD background in measurements and searches for electroweak and colorless new physics processes in hadron collisions. In this letter, we report the key findings of investigating the theoretical and phenomenological consequences of setting the jet veto scale to the transverse momentum of the leading charged lepton $\ell$ on an event-by-event basis in multi-lepton processes. We consider the case of a TeV-scale heavy neutrino $N$ decaying to the trilepton final state and find the following: (i) Perturbative uncertainties associated with the veto greatly reduce due to tying the veto scale to the hard process scale. (ii) The signal efficiency for passing the veto jumps to $\gtrsim95\%$ and exhibits little-to-no dependence on the neutrino mass scale. (iii) Background rejection capabilities also improve when compared to vetoing only heavy flavor-tagged jets. This results in an increased sensitivity to active-sterile neutrino mixing by approximately an order of magnitude over the LHC's lifetime. Due to the color structures of the heavy $N$ production mechanisms considered, we argue that our results hold broadly for other color-singlet processes.
