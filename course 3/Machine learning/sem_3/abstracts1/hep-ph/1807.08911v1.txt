In this work, we study charged current quasi elastic scattering of muon anti-neutrino off nucleon and nucleus using a formalism based on Llewellyn Smith (LS) model. Parameterizations by Galster et al. are used for electric and magnetic Sach's form factors of nucleons. We use Fermi gas model along with Pauli suppression condition to take into account the nuclear effects in anti-neutrino - nucleus QES. We calculate muon anti-neutrino-p and muon anti-neutrino-^{12}C charged current quasi elastic scattering differential and total cross sections for different values of axial mass M_{A} and compare the results with data from GGM, SKAT, BNL, NOMAD, MINERvA and MiniBooNE experiments. The present theoretical approach gives an excellent description of differential cross section data. The calculations with axial mass M_{A} = 0.979 and 1.05 GeV are compatible with data from most of the experiments.
