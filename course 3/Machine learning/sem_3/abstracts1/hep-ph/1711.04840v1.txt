One of the primary objectives of Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is to discover the leptonic CP violation and to identify it's source. In this context, we study the impact of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs) on observing the CP violation signal at DUNE. We explore the impact of various parameter degeneracies introduced by non-zero NSI and identify which of these can influence the CP violation sensitivity and CP precision of DUNE, by considering NSI both in data and in theory. In particular, we study how the CP sensitivity of DUNE is affected because of the intrinsic hierarchy degeneracy which occurs when the diagonal NSI parameter $\epsilon_{ee}=-1$ and $\delta_{CP}= \pm 90^{\circ}$.
