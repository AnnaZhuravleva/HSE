The heavy charged gauge bosons were proposed in the theories beyond standard model. We explore the discovery potential for $W'\to t\bar{b}$ with top quark semi-leptonic decay at the LHC. We concentrate on the new physics signal search with the deviation from the standard model prediction if the resonance peak of $W'$ can not be observed directly. The events of signal with two jets plus one charged lepton and missing energy are simulated together with the dominant standard model backgrounds. In this paper, it is found that suitable cuts on the kinematic observables can effectively suppress the standard model backgrounds, so that it is possible to search for $W'$ signal at the LHC with its mass less than 6.6 TeV.
