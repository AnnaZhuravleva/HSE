If gaugino condensations occur in the early universe, domain walls are produced as a result of the spontaneous breaking of a discrete R symmetry. Those domain walls eventually annihilate with one another, producing the gravitational waves. We show that the gravitational waves can be a probe for measuring the gravitino mass, if the constant term in the superpotential is the relevant source of the discrete R symmetry breaking.
