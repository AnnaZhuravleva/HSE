The mass and pole residue of the first orbitally and radially excited $ \Xi$ state as well as the ground state residue are calculated by means of the two-point QCD sum rules. Using the obtained results for the spectroscopic parameters, the strong coupling constants relevant to the decays $\Xi(1690)\rightarrow \Sigma K$ and $\Xi(1690) \rightarrow \Lambda K$ are calculated within the light-cone QCD sum rules and width of these decay channels are estimated. The obtained results for the mass of $ \widetilde{\Xi} $ and ratio of the $Br\Big(\widetilde{\Xi}\rightarrow \Sigma K\Big)/Br\Big(\widetilde{\Xi}\rightarrow \Lambda K\Big)$, with $ \widetilde{\Xi} $ representing the orbitally excited state in $ \Xi $ channel, are in nice agreement with the experimental data of the Belle Collaboration. This allows us to conclude that the $\Xi(1690)$ state, most probably, has negative parity.
