In any gauge extension of the standard model (SM) of quarks and leptons, there is a minimal set of fermion and scalar multiplets which encompasses all the particles and interactions of the SM. Included within this set, there may be a suitable dark-matter candidate. If not, one may still exist from the judicious addition of a simple fermion or scalar multiplet without any imposed symmetry. Some new examples of such predestined dark matter are discussed.
