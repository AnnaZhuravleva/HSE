We propose a kinematic method for precisely measuring the top quark mass $m_t$ in $pp$ collisions using boosted top jets with light soft drop grooming. Light grooming retains a universal description of the top mass scheme and decay effects and removes soft contamination. One can obtain $m_t$ in a short distance scheme by fitting our hadron level jet mass distributions to data or by Monte-Carlo calibration. Lepton+jets and all-jet samples can be used. The peaked distributions for $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions are very similar, up to sensitivity to underlying event which is reduced by soft drop.
