It is shown that $\alpha_s(E)$, the strong coupling constant, can be determined in the non-perturbative regime from Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC). The obtained $\alpha_s(E)$ is in agreement with the prescriptions dealt with in the Analytic Perturbative Theory approach. It also extrapolates smoothly to the standard perturbative $\alpha_s(E)$ at higher energies. Our results indicate that BEC dimension can be considered as an alternative approach to the short range measure between hadrons.
