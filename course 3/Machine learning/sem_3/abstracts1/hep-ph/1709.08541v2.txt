We present the complete set of vertex, wave function and charge renormalisation constants in QCD in a general simple gauge group and with the complete dependence on the covariant gauge parameter $\xi$ in the minimal subtraction scheme of conventional dimensional regularisation. Our results confirm all already known results, which were obtained in the Feynman gauge, and allow the extraction of other useful gauges such as the Landau gauge. We use these results to extract the Landau gauge five-loop anomalous dimensions of the composite operator $A^2$ as well as the Landau gauge scheme independent gluon, ghost and fermion propagators at five loops.
