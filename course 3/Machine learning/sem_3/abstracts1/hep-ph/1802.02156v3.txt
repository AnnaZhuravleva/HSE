We investigate the bounds on light pseudoscalars that arise from a variety of collider searches. Special attention is thereby devoted to the mass regions $[3, 5] \, {\rm GeV}$ and $[9,11] \, {\rm GeV}$, in which a meaningful theoretical description has to include estimates of non-perturbative effects such as the mixing of the pseudoscalar with QCD bound states. A compendium of formulas that allows to deal with the relevant corrections is provided. It should prove useful for the interpretation of future LHC searches for light CP-odd spin-0 states.
