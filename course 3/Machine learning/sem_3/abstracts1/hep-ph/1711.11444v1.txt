The seed of the primordial magnetic field in the early universe has been attributed to various physical process in the early universe. In this work we provide a mechanism for the generation of a primordial magnetic field in the early universe via the collapse of $Z(3)$ domains in the quark gluon plasma. The collapse of closed $Z(3)$ domain walls that arise in the deconfined phase of the QCD (above $T\sim 200$ MeV) leads to the generation of vorticity and turbulence. The transmission coefficient of the $u$, $d$ and $s$ are different across the $Z(3)$ walls. This results in charge concentration at the wall boundary. The charge concentration on the boundary and the vorticity in the plasma generate a magnetic field. We estimate the magnitude of the magnetic field generated and find that it is of the order of $10^{17}$ G which is close to the equipartition value. The mechanism is independent of the order of the QCD phase transition.
