We extend our previous analysis on the mass of the recently discovered $\Omega(2012)$ state by investigation of its strong decays and calculation of its width employing the method of light cone QCD sum rule. Considering two possibilities for the quantum numbers of $\Omega(2012)$ state, namely $1P$ orbital excitation with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$ and $2S$ radial excitation with $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$, we obtain the strong coupling constants defining the $\Omega(1P/2S)\rightarrow\Xi K$ decays. The results of the coupling constants are then used to calculate the decay width corresponding to each possibility. Comparison of the obtained results on the width in this work with the experimental value and taking into account the results of our previous mass prediction on the $\Omega(2012)$ state, we conclude that this state is $1P$ orbital excitation of the ground state $\Omega$ baryon, whose quantum numbers are $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^-$.
