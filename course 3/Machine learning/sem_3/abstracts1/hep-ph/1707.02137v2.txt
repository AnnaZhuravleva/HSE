We use the relativistic perfect-fluid hydrodynamics to describe the space-time evolution of dense baryonic matter produced in the central nucleus-nucleus collisions at HIRFL-CSR, HIAF, FAIR-CBM, NICA-MPD, and RHIC-BES. The transverse flow of the fireball with cylindrical symmetry and boost invariant along the longitudinal direction is also analyzed. Based on the relativistic kinetic theory, we also present the first preliminary calculation on the production of low-mass dileptons and low-pT photons can be considered as the signals of the dense baryonic matter produced in the central Au-Au and U-U collisions. We find that the rapid cooling of the expanding dense baryonic matter with transverse flow effect can lead to the suppression of the low-mass dileptons and low-pT photons production at HIRFL-CSR, HIAF, FAIR-CBM, NICA-MPD, and RHIC-BES energies.
