We consider the effective type-II Two-Higgs doublet model originating from Dirac gaugino models with extended supersymmetry in the gauge sector, which is automatically aligned in the simplest realisations. We show that raising the scale at which the extended supersymmetry is manifest and including quantum corrections actually improves the alignment. Using an effective field theory approach, we study the implications from the Higgs mass and other experimental constraints on the scale of superpartners.
