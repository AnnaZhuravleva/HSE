We evaluate the QED corrections due to initial state radiation (ISR) to associated Higgs boson production in electron-positron ($e^+ e^-$) annihilation at typical energies of interest for the measurement of the Higgs properties at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders, such as CEPC and FCC-ee. We apply the QED Structure Function approach to the four-fermion production process $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^- b \bar b$, including both signal and background contributions. We emphasize the relevance of the ISR corrections particularly near threshold and show that finite third order collinear contributions are mandatory to meet the expected experimental accuracy. We analyze in turn the r\^ole played by a full four-fermion calculation and beam energy spread in precision calculations for Higgs physics at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders.
