The light-front distribution amplitudes (LFDAs) and the decay constant of the $K $ pseudoscalar meson are extracted within the framework of the AdS/QCD correspondence. For the LFDAs calculation, we consider a momentum-dependent (dynamical) helicity wave function which contains the dynamical spin effects. We use the LFDAs to predict the transition form factors of the semileptonic $B\to K \ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ decay. With the help of these form factors, the differential branching ratio of the $B\to K\, \mu^+ \mu^-$ on $q^2$ is plotted. A comparison is made between our prediction in AdS/QCD and the results obtained from two models including the light-cons sum rules (LCSR) and lattice QCD as well as the experimental values.
