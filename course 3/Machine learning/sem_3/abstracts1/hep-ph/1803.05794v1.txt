A connection is established between the continuum limit of the low-energy tight-binding description of two dimensional Weyl-Dirac materials immersed in a background magnetic field parallel to the sample and the Chiral Magnetic Effect of Quantum Chromodynamics. A combination of the mass gaps (Dirac and Haldane) that explicitly break the equivalence of the Dirac cones --which favor an imbalance of pseudo-chirality of charge carriers-- and the magnetic field are the necessary ingredients to generate an electric current in the material aligned with the external field. These mass gaps probe the topological non-trivial structure of the model. Currents, number densities and condensates generated from this setup are explored for different hierarchies of the energy scales involved.
