A large number of $B_c$ meson events have been recorded at the LHCb detector, especially some two-body hadronic decay modes. We analyzed the weak decays of the $B_c$ meson into two hadron states under the flavor SU(3) symmetry. The relations among amplitudes of $B_c$ into $ D+P(V)$, $B+P(V)$ and $P(V)+P(V)$ were investigated systematically, where $P$ ( $V$) denotes a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson. The $\eta-\eta'$ mixing and $\omega-\phi$ mixing effects are also considered for the phenomenological discussions. We obtained the relations among decay widths of different $B_c$ decay channels. These results are helpful to study the two-body decay properties of the $B_c$ meson and test the flavor SU(3) symmetry.
