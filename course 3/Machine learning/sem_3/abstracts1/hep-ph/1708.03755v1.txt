Glueballs, an old and firm prediction of various QCD approaches (lattice QCD, bag models, AdS/QCD, effective models, etc.), have not yet been experimentally confirmed. While for glueballs below $2.6$ GeV some candidates exist, the situation for heavy glueballs (above $2.6$ GeV) is cloudy. Here, after a brief review of scalar, tensor, and pseudoscalar glueballs, we present predictions for the decays of a putative pseudotensor glueball with a lattice predicted mass of $3.04$ GeV and a putative vector glueball with a lattice predicted mass of $3.81$ GeV. Moreover, we discuss in general the width of heavy glueballs by using large-$N_{c}$ arguments: we obtain a rough estimate according to which the width of a glueball (such as the vector one) is about $10$ MeV. Such a width would be narrow enough to enable measurement at the future PANDA experiment.
