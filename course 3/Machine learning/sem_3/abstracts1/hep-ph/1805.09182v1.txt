We solve the integration-by-parts (IBP) identities needed for the computation of any planar two-loop five-point massless amplitude in QCD. We also derive some new results for the most complicated non-planar topology with irreducible numerators of power as high as six. We do this by applying a new strategy for solving the IBP identities which scales better for problems with a large number of scales and/or master integrals. Our results are a proof of principle that the remaining non-planar contributions for all two-loop five-point massless QCD amplitudes can be computed in analytic form.
