Investigation of physical well-motivated parameter space in the theories of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) plays an important role in new physics discoveries. However, a large-scale scan of high dimensional (HD) parameter space under vast experimental constraints is typically a time-consuming and expensive task. In this Letter, we propose a novel self-learning scan framework, named Machine Learning Scan (MLS), to achieve a fast and reliable exploration of HD parameter space by using machine learning models to evaluate the quality of random parameter sets. As a proof-of-concept, we apply MLS to several benchmark models and find that such a method can significantly reduce the computational cost and ensure the discovery of all survived regions.
