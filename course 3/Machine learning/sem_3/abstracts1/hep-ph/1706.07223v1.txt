We have investigated the Regge trajectories of exotic hadrons by considering different possible pentaquark configurations with finite quark mass in the flux tube model. Signifi- cant deviation is observed in the linear behavior of the Regge trajectories for pentaquark systems in view of the universal value of the Regge slope parameter for hadrons. The modified Regge trajectories are also compared with the available experimental and lat- tice data. It is observed that the non-linear Regge trajectories of such pentaqurk systems can be well described by the relativistic corrections in view of the current quark masses and the high rotational speed of the quarks at the end of flux tube structure.
