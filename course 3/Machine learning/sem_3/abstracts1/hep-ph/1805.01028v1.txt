New physics motivated by muonic puzzles (proton radius and muon $g-2$ discrepancies) is extensively studied. The scalar boson $\phi$, assuming the Yukawa interaction, is the only candidate to solve these muonic puzzles simultaneously. Our previous work limits the existence of such a scalar boson's mass $m_\phi$ from about 160 keV to 60 MeV. We improve this result by including the influence of all of the possible particles that couple to the $\phi$ in computing the decay rate. Doing this involves including the strong interaction physics necessary to compute the $\eta\pi\phi$ vertex function. The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is employed. Given this information, we reanalyze the electron beam dump experiments, with the result is that the allowed range of $m_\phi$ lies between about 200 keV and 3 MeV. This narrow range represents an inviting target for ruling out or discovering this scalar boson.
