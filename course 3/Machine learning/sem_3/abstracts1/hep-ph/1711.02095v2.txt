We perform global fits of Two-Higgs-Doublet models with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to recent results from the LHC detectors CMS and ATLAS, that is signal strengths and direct search limits obtained at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. We combine all available ATLAS and CMS constraints with the other relevant theoretical and experimental bounds and present the latest limits on the model parameters. We obtain that deviations from the so-called alignment limit $\beta-\alpha=\pi/2$ cannot be larger than $0.03$ in type I and have to be smaller than $0.02$ in the remaining three types. For the latter, we also observe lower limits on the heavy Higgs masses in the global fit. The splittings between these masses cannot exceed $200$ GeV in the types I and X and $130$ GeV in the types II and Y. Finally, we find that the decay widths of the heavy Higgs particles cannot be larger than $7\%$ of their masses if they are lighter than $1.5$ TeV.
