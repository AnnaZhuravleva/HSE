We discuss effective models derived from a supersymmetric model whose mediation mechanism of supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking is namely mirage mediation. In this model, light higgsino mass, that is required by the natural realization of the electroweak scale, is achieved by the unification of the soft SUSY breaking parameters at the low scale. Besides, we find that extra Higgs fields are also possibly light in some cases. Then, the effective model is a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with higgsinos, and it is distinguishable with namely type-II 2HDM which is widely discussed. In this paper, we study the mass spectrum of SUSY particles and the extra Higgs fields, and summarize the phenomenology in the effective model. We survey the current experimental bounds from the LHC and the dark matter experiments as well as the flavor physics. Then, we point out the expected mass scale of the SUSY particles and reveal the future prospects for the direct and indirect searches. We also discuss the difference between our effective model and the 2HDM in the bottom-up approach.
