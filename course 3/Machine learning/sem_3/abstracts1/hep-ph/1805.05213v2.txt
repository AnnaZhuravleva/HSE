Motivated by a semi-holographic approach to the dynamics of quark-gluon plasma which combines holographic and perturbative descriptions of a strongly coupled infrared and a more weakly coupled ultraviolet sector, we construct a hybrid two-fluid model where interactions between its two sectors are encoded by their effective metric backgrounds, which are determined mutually by their energy-momentum tensors. We derive the most general consistent ultralocal interactions such that the full system has a total conserved energy-momentum tensor in flat Minkowski space and study its consequences in and near thermal equilibrium by working out its phase structure and its hydrodynamic modes.
