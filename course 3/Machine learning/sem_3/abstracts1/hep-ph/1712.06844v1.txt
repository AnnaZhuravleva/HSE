Attempts to incorporate in a coherent picture the $B$-decay anomalies presumably observed in $b\rightarrow c$ and $b\rightarrow s$ semi-leptonic decays have to face the absence of signals in other related experiments, both at low and at high energies. By extending and making more precise the content of Ref. [1], we describe one such attempt based on the Pati-Salam SU(4) group, that unifies colour and the $B$-$L$ charge, in the context of a new strongly interacting sector, equally responsible for producing a pseudo-Goldstone Higgs boson.
