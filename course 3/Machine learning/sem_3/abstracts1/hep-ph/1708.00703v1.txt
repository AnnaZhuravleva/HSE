We interprete the new double charm baryon state found by the LHCb Collaboration in the invariant mass distribution of the set of final state particles $(\Lambda_c^+\,K^-\,\pi^+\,\pi^+)$ as being at the origin of the decay chain $\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} (\to \Lambda_c^+ \pi^+) +\bar K^{*0} (\to K^- \pi^+)$. The nonleptonic decay $\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} + \bar K^{*0}$ belongs to a class of decays where the quark flavor composition is such that the decay proceeds solely via the factorizing contribution precluding a contamination from internal $W$-exchange. We use the covariant confined quark model previously developed by us to calculate the four helicity amplitudes that describe the dynamics of the transition $\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++}$ induced by the effective $(c \to u)$ current. We then proceed to calculate the rate of the decay as well as the polarization of the $\Sigma_c^{++}$ and $\Lambda_c^+$ baryons and the longitudinal/transverse composition of the $\bar K^{*0}$. We estimate the decay $\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} \bar K^{*0}$ to have a branching rate of $B(\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} \bar K^{*0}) \sim 10.5 \%$. As a byproduct of our investigation we have also analyzed the decay $\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} \bar K^{0}$ for which we find a branching ratio of $B(\Xi_{cc}^{++} \to \Sigma_c^{++} \bar K^0) \sim 2.5 \%$.
