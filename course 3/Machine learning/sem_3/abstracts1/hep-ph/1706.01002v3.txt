The gluon fusion component of Higgs-boson production in association with dijets is of particular interest because it both (a) allows for a study of the CP-structure of the Higgs-boson couplings to gluons, and (b) provides a background to the otherwise clean study of Higgs-boson production through vector-boson fusion. The degree to which this background can be controlled, and the CP-structure of the gluon-Higgs coupling extracted, both depend on the successful description of the perturbative corrections to the gluon-fusion process.   High Energy Jets (HEJ) provides all-order, perturbative predictions for multi-jet processes at hadron colliders at a fully exclusive, partonic level. We develop the framework of HEJ to include the process of Higgs-boson production in association with at least two jets. We discuss the logarithmic accuracy obtained in the underlying all-order results, and calculate the first next-to-leading corrections to the framework of HEJ, thereby significantly reducing the corrections which arise by matching to and merging fixed-order results.   Finally, we compare predictions for relevant observables obtained with NLO and HEJ. We observe that the selection criteria commonly used for isolating the vector-boson fusion component suppresses the gluon-fusion component even further than predicted at NLO.
