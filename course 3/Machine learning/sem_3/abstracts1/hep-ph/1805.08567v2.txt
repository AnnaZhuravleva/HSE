We review and revise phenomenology of the GeV-scale heavy neutral leptons (HNLs). We extend the previous analyses by including more channels of HNLs production and decay and provide with more refined treatment, including QCD corrections for the HNLs of masses $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV. We summarize the relevance of individual production and decay channels for different masses, resolving a few discrepancies in the literature. Our final results are directly suitable for sensitivity studies of particle physics experiments (ranging from proton beam-dump to the LHC) aiming at searches for heavy neutral leptons.
