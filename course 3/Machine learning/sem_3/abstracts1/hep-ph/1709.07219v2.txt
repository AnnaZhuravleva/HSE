With the aim of exploring the Higgs sector of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), we have chosen the exact and soft $Z_2$ symmetry breaking versions of the 2HDM with non-zero vacuum expectation values for both Higgs doublets (Mixed Model). We consider two SM-like scenarios: with 125 GeV $h$ and 125 GeV $H$. We have applied the condition for cancellation of quadratic divergences in the type II 2HDM in order to derive masses of the heavy scalars. Solutions of two relevant conditions were found in the considered SM-like scenarios. After applying the current LHC data for the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson, the precision electroweak data test and lower limits on the mass of $H^+$, the allowed region of parameters shrink strongly.
