We report the results for charge radii of heavy flavored mesons ($D^+, D^0, D^+_s, B^+, B^0, B^0_s$) in an improved QCD potential model. To enhance the effectiveness of short range and long range effect of the potential $V(r)=-4\frac{\alpha_s}{3r}+br+c$ in the perturbative procedure a cut-off parameter $r^P$ is introduced as an integration limit. The obtained results are found to be comparable with other available data. The limitation of the approach is discussed in the manuscript.
