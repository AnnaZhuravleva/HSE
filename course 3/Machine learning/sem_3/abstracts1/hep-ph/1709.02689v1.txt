While most BSM searches at the LHC focus on heavy new states, the NMSSM contains the possibility of new light states that have escaped detection due to their singlet nature. Here we focus on light pseudoscalars, investigating the parameter space impact of recent LHC searches for such light states stemming from the decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson. It is shown that, though direct searches can not yet compete with the requirement of the 125 GeV scalar having SM-like couplings, the searches are touching the allowed parameter space and should make a phenomenological impact in the near future.
