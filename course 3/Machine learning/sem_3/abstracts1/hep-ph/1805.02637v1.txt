We present here the first result on the three loop gluon jet function in perturbative QCD. Using the three loop coefficient functions [1,2] for deep-inelastic scattering via the exchange of a virtual photon that couples to quarks or a scalar that couples to gluons and employing KG equation, renormalization group invariance and factorization theorem, we obtain both the quark and the gluon jet functions up to three loop level. The former agrees with the recent result [3]. These jet functions being universal ingredients for many collider and decay processes, will play an important role in the phenomenological studies at the Large Hadron Collider.
