Fluctuations play an important role in diffractive production of vector mesons. It was in particular recently suggested, based on the Impact-Parameter dependent Saturation model (IPSat), that geometrical fluctuations triggered by the motion of the constituent quarks within the protons could explain incoherent diffractive processes observed at HERA. We propose a variant of the IPSat model which includes spatial and symmetry correlations between constituent quarks, thereby reducing significantly the number of parameters needed to describe diffractive vector meson production. The application to $J/\Psi$ diffractive photoproduction cross sections in coherent and incoherent channels reveals the r\^ole of correlations and their interplay with perturbative DGLAP evolution implemented up to NNLO.
