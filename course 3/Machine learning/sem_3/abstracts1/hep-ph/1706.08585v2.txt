Analytical study of the rapidity distribution of the final state particles in deep inelastic scattering at small x is presented. We separate and analyse three sources of particle production: fragmentation of the quark-antiquark pair, accompanying coherent soft gluon radiation due to octet color exchange in the t-channel, and fragmentation of gluons that form parton distribution functions. Connection to Catani-Ciafaloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) equations and the role of gluon reggezation are also discussed.
