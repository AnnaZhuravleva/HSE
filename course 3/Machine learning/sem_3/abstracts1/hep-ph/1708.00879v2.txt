We discuss the role of repulsive baryon-baryon interactions in a hadron gas using relativistic virial expansion and repulsive mean field approaches. The fluctuations of the baryon number as well as strangeness-baryon correlations are calculated in the hadron resonance gas with repulsive interactions and compared with the recent lattice QCD results. In particular, we calculate the difference between the second and fourth order fluctuations and correlations of baryon number and strangeness, that have been proposed as probes of deconfinement. We show that for not too high temperatures these differences could be understood in terms of repulsive interactions.
