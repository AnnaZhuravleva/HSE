Instanton effects can give large contribution to strong interacting processes, especially at the energy scale where perturbative QCD is no longer valid. However instanton contribution to the gluon contribution in constituent quark and nucleon has never been calculated before. Based on both the constituent quark picture and the instanton model for QCD vacuum, we calculate the unpolarized and polarized gluon distributions in the constituent quark and in the nucleon for the first time. We find that the pion field plays an important role in producing both the unpolarized and the polarized gluon distributions.
