Incoherent rapidity distributions of vector mesons are computed in dipole model in PbPb ultraperipheral collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The IIM model fitted from newer data is employed in the dipole amplitude. The Boosted Gaussian and Gaus-LC wave functions for vector mesons are implemented in the calculation as well. Predictions for the $J/\psi$, $\psi(2s)$, $\rho$ and $\phi$ incoherent rapidity distributions are evaluated and compared with experimental data and other theoretical predictions in this paper. We obtain closer predictions of the incoherent rapidity distributions for $J/\psi$ than previous calculations in the IIM model.
