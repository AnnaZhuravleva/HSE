We show that the economical 3-3-1 model poses a very high new physics scale of 1000 TeV order due to the FCNC constraint, and its new implication for neutrino masses, inflation, leptogenesis, and superheavy dark matter is recognized. Alternatively, we modify the model by rearranging the third quark generation differently from the first two as well as changing the scalar sector, and it now predicts a consistent new physics at TeV scale unlike the previous case, possibly fully probed at the current colliders. Due to the different minimal particle contents, the models manifestly accommodate dark matter and neutrino masses with characteristic production mechanisms. The large FCNCs which come from the ordinary and exotic quark mixings can be avoided due to the approximate B-L symmetry.
