This work explores the possibility of obtaining a mass gap in Yang-Mills theories via the intrinsic gauge bosons, without invoking a separate Higgs boson or fermion-antifermion pairs. Instead, pairs of gauge bosons in the spin and isospin singlet state form a pair of composite Higgs bosons which can be viewed as the simplest possible glueball of Yang-Mills gauge theories. Quadratic and quartic gauge boson self-interactions form a potential that leads to a finite expectation value of the gauge boson amplitude. Transverse polarization ensures Lorentz invariance of the vacuum after averaging over all possible polarization vectors. But the scalar pair products exhibit a finite vacuum expectation value which breaks the gauge symmetry dynamically. Compatibility with the standard Higgs potential determines the quadratic and quartic coupling constants.
