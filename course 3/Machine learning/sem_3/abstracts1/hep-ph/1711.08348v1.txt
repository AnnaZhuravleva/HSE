Single top quark production through weak interactions is one of the important source of charged Higgs in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In the s-channel single top production having largest cross-section, a charged Higgs may appear in the intermediate phase as a heavy resonance state decaying to a top and b quark. The channel under consideration in this paper is $pp \rightarrow H^{\pm}\rightarrow tb \rightarrow b\bar{b}W^{\pm} \rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^{\pm} \nu_{\tau}$, where top quark exclusively decay into b quark and W boson and W boson subsequently decays to $\tau$ jet and neutrino. So the final state is charactersied by the presence of two b jets, hadronic $\tau$ decay and missing transverse energy Due to the presence of large QCD multijet and electroweak background events at LHC, it has been demonstrated that the charged Higgs singal can be observed within the available MSSM paramter space $(tan\beta,m_{H^{\pm}})$ respecting all experimental and theoretical constraints. In order to show the observability potential of charged Higgs, the exclusion curves at 95$\%$ confidence level and 5$\sigma$ conoturs are plotted at different integrated luminosities with $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.
