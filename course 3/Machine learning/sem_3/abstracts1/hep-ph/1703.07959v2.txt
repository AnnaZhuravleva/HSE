We revisit the rapidity dependence of the average transverse momentum $\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle$ in a $pp$ and $pA$ collision, using the high energy factorization (HEF). We update previous predictions for the $\left\langle p_{T}\right\rangle$ both in central and forward rapidity region using parton densities following from extended BK and BFKL evolution equations to account for corrections of higher orders as well as one obtained by Sudakov resummation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the mid rapidity region the saturation based formalisms predict increase of the transversal momentum while in the forward rapidity region the $\left\langle p_{T}(y)\right\rangle$ decreases.
