We analyze the classical approximations made in "The general relativistic effects to the magnetic moment in the Earth's gravity", originally published as "Post-Newtonian effects of Dirac particle in curved spacetime - I : magnetic moment in curved spacetime", and work out precisely where in the argument the mistakes are made. We show explicitly that any difference vanishes when properly distinguishing between coordinate and physical distance. In doing this, we illustrate some of the pitfalls in using GR to make predictions.
