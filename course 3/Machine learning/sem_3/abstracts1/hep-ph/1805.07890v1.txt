Large magneto-electric effect in multi-ferroics and topological protection against decays of excited magnetic skyrmions are an ideal setting for detecting radiative emission of neutrino pair (RENP). We propose a new RENP scheme using multi-ferroic magnetic skyrmion condensates in order to determine the absolute neutrino mass including the mass hierarchy patterns, the type of neutrino mass (Majorana vs Dirac), one of CP violation parameters, and to detect relic 1.9 K cosmic neutrino. We critically examine the possibility of feasible experiments, and show what are required as good targets for neutrino physics.
