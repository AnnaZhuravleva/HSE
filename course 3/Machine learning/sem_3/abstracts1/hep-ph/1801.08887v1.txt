There is merely a short note on the selected issues of neutrino electromagnetic properties with focus on effects of new physics. The meaning of "new physics" is twofold: 1) a massive neutrino have nonzero electromagnetic properties that can be considered as manifestation of new physics beyond the Standard Model, and 2) in studies of neutrinos electromagnetic interactions new effects are predicted that can lead to new phenomena accessible for observations.
