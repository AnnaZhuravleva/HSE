We derive the momentum distribution for two soft and collinear gluons emitted from an off-shell quark, modeled by a $q\gamma\rightarrow qgg$ scattering process and computed using the maximal helicity violating (MHV) technique. We find the explicit non-Abelian corrections to the independent emission Poisson distribution in QED and demonstrate the efficiency of the MHV technique in perturbative QCD calculations. The gluonic two particle correlation function is highly suggestive of that measured in high-multiplicity $pp$ and $pA$ collisions, with a tight correlation in angle but broad correlation in rapidity. Further, the autocorrelation generated by the non-Abelian correlation can provide a significant non-hydrodynamical source of $v_2$ in these high multiplicity $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Finally, these two gluon correlations can be used to calibrate Monte Carlo shower codes for a more accurate description of QCD processes in $pp$ collisions.
