We use lattice simulations to compute the baryon spectrum of SU(4) lattice gauge theory coupled to dynamical fermions in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric (sextet) representations simultaneously. This model is closely related to a composite Higgs model in which the chimera baryon made up of fermions from both representations plays the role of a composite top-quark partner. The dependence of the baryon masses on each underlying fermion mass is found to be generally consistent with a quark-model description and large-Nc scaling. We combine our numerical results with experimental bounds on the scale of the new strong sector to derive a lower bound on the mass of the top partner.
