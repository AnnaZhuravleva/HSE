We study the direct detection prospects for a representative set of simplified models of sub-GeV dark matter (DM), accounting for existing terrestrial, astrophysical and cosmological constraints. We focus on dark matter lighter than an MeV, where these constraints are most stringent, and find three scenarios with accessible direct detection cross sections: (i) DM interacting via an ultralight kinetically mixed dark photon, (ii) a DM sub-component interacting with nucleons or electrons through a light scalar or vector mediator, and (iii) DM coupled with nucleons via a mediator heavier than ~ 100 keV.
