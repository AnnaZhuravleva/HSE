$X(3872)$ presents many surprises after its discovery more than ten years ago. Understanding its properties is crucial to understand the spectrum of possible exotic mesons. In this work, $X(3872)$ meson and its heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) partners (including the mesons in the bottom sector) are studied within the QCD Sum Rules approach using a current motivated by the molecular picture of $X(3872)$. We predict four heavy partners to $X(3872)$ and bottomonium with the masses and $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers. Obtained results are in good agreement with the previous studies and available experimental data.
