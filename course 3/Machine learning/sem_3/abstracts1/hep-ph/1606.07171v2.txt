We consider the Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton and its decays in the presence of the light radion, the modulus of extra dimension, appearing naturally light due to classical scale invariance in warped gravity. Due to the presence of a sizable wavefunction overlap in the extra dimension between the KK graviton and the radion, the KK graviton can decay largely into a pair of radions, each of which decays into a pair of collimated photons or photon-jets. Focusing on the setup where the KK graviton has suppressed couplings to the Higgs boson and fermions, we discuss the bounds on the light radion in the parameter space where the photon-jets are relevant. Moreover, we pursue the possibility of distinguishing the scenario from the case with direct photon contributions by the angular distributions of photons in the LHC Run 2. Roles of KK graviton and radion as mediators of dark matter interactions, extensions with brane kinetic terms and the model with a holographic composite Higgs are also addressed.
