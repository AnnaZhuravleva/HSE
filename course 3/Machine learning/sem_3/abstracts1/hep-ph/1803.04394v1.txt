We examine the experimental signature of a UV complete Supersymmetry (SUSY) theory, the $G_2$-MSSM. This model predicts that only some superpartners will be produced in possibly detectable amounts at LHC: $p p \rightarrow \tilde{g}\tilde{g}$, $p p \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1 \tilde{\chi}^{\mp}_1$, and $p p \rightarrow \tilde{\chi}^{0}_2 \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$. We exclude spectra with $m_{\tilde{g}} \approx1.5$ TeV. While spectra with $m_{\tilde{g}} \approx1.7$ TeV and $m_{\tilde{g}} \approx1.9$ TeV are currently allowed (contrary to what is often claimed), data in hand could exclude these spectra. This is not in tension with reported exclusion limits due to the difference in decay topologies between simplified models and a UV motivated ($G_2$-MSSM) model.
