In the present paper we consider the so-called effective cross section, a quantity which encodes the experimental knowledge on double parton scattering in hadronic collisions that has been accomulated so far. We show that the effective cross section, under some assumptions close to those adopted in its experimental extractions, can be used to obtain a range of mean transverse distance between an interacting parton pair in double parton scattering. Therefore we have proved that the effective cross section offers a way to access information on the hadronic structure.
