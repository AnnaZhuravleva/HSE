In a simplified model of Multiple Parton Interactions the inclusive cross sections, of processes with large momentum transfer exchange, acquire the statistical meaning of factorial moments of the distribution in multiplicity of interactions, while more exclusive cross sections, which can provide complementary information on the interaction dynamics, become experimentally viable. Inclusive and exclusive cross sections are linked by sum rules, which can be tested experimentally.
