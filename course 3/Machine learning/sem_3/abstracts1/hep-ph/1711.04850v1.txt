Scattering amplitudes of partons in QCD contain infrared divergences which can be resummed to all orders in terms of an anomalous dimension. Independently, in the limit of high-energy forward scattering, large logarithms of the energy can be resummed using Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov theory. We use the latter to analyze the infrared-singular part of amplitudes to all orders in perturbation theory and to next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy in the high-energy limit, resumming the two-Reggeon contribution. Remarkably, we find a closed form for the infrared-singular part, predicting the Regge limit of the soft anomalous dimension to any loop order.
