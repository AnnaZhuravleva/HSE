In recent years data have been accumulated at various experiments about states in the heavy quarkonium mass range that seem to be inconsistent with the most simple variants of the quark model. In this contribution it is demonstrated that most of those data are consistent with a dominant molecular nature of those states. It is also discussed which kind of observables are sensitive to the molecular component and which are not.
