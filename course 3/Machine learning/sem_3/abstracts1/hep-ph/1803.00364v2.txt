The strong and radiative decays of the low-lying $\lambda$-mode $1D$-wave $\Lambda_{c(b)}$, $\Sigma_{c(b)}$, $\Xi_{c(b)}$, $\Xi_{c(b)}'$ and $\Omega_{c(b)}$ baryons are studied in a constituent quark model. Our calculation shows that (i) the missing $\lambda$-mode $D$-wave $\Omega_{c(b)}$, $\Lambda_{b}$, and $\Xi_{b}$ baryons have a relatively narrow decay width of less than 30 MeV, their dominant strong and radiative decay channels can be ideal for searching for their signals in future experiments. (ii) The $\lambda$-mode $1D$-wave excitations in the $\Sigma_{c(b)}$ and $\Xi_{c(b)}'$ families appear to have a relatively broad width of larger than 50 MeV. These $1D$-wave states have large decay rates into the $1P$-wave heavy baryon states via the pionic or kaonic strong decay processes, which are worth to observing in future experiments. (iii) Both $\Lambda_c(2860)$ and $\Xi_c(3050)$ seem to favor the $J^P=3/2^+$ excitation $|^2D_{\lambda\lambda} \frac{3}{2}^+ \rangle$ of $\bar{\mathbf{3}}_F$, while assigning $\Lambda_c(2880)$ and $\Xi_c(3080)$ as the $J^P=5/2^+$ excitation $|^2D_{\lambda\lambda} \frac{5}{2}^+ \rangle$ of $\bar{\mathbf{3}}_F$, one cannot well understand the measured partial width ratios from experiments.
