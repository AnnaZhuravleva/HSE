In this paper we analyse the exclusive vector meson photoproduction in the recent run using Xenon-ions at energy of 5.44 TeV performed by the Large Hadron Collider. We focus on the ultraperipheral collisions and provide theoretical predictions for coherent and incoherent cross sections within the color dipole approach and gluon saturation framework. The rapidity distribution is investigated in both cases and comparison to other approaches available at literature is done. We show that the expected yields are enough to perform reliable cross section measurements for light mesons as $\rho^0$ and $\phi$.
