In this paper we propose a novel supersymmetric inverse seesaw model which has only one additional $Z_6$ symmetry. The field content is minimal to get a viable neutrino spectrum at tree-level. Interestingly, the inverse seesaw scale in our model is related to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. Due to that origin we are less biased about hierarchies and discuss three different types of the inverse seesaw mechanism with different phenomenologies. We can successfully reproduce neutrino masses and mixing and our model is consistent with current bounds on neutrinoless double beta decay, non-unitarity of the PMNS matrix and charged lepton flavor violation.
