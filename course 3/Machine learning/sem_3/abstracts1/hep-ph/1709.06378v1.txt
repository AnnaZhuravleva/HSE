The main ideas of the NLO calculations in Parton Reggeization Approach are illustrated on the example of the simplest NLO subprocess, which contributes to DIS: $\gamma^\star+R\to q + \bar{q}$. The double counting with the LO contribution $\gamma^\star + Q \to q$ is resolved. The problem of matching of the NLO results for single-scale observables in the Parton Reggeization Approach on the corresponding NLO results in the Collinear Parton Model is considered. In the developed framework, the usual NLO PDFs in the $\overline{MS}$-scheme can be consistently used as the collinear input for the NLO calculation in the Parton Reggeization Approach.
