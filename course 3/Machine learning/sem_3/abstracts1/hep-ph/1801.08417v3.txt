We study the electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) of $\Lambda_c$ and the quark and diquark current contributes to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ in the space-like (SL) region in the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. In this picture, the heavy baryon $\Lambda_c $ is regarded as composed of a heavy quark and a scalar diquark. We find that for different values of parameters the quark and diquark current contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is very different, but the total contribute to the EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ is similarly. The EMFFs of $\Lambda_c$ are similar to those of other baryons (proton, $\Xi^-$, $\Sigma^+$) with a peak at $\omega =1$ ($\omega=v^\prime \cdot v $ is the velocity transfer between the initial state (with velocity $v$) and the final state (with velocity $v^\prime$) of $\Lambda_c$).
