We investigate origins of predictive one-zero neutrino mass textures in a systematic way. Here we search Abelian continuous(discrete) global symmetries, and non-Abelian discrete symmetries, and show how to realize these neutrino masses. Then we propose a concrete model involving a dark matter candidate and an extra gauge boson, and show their phenomenologies.
