We investigate the dark matter phenomenology of a Dirac fermion together with kinetic mixing in the context of an $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model. We analyze which part of the parameter space can provide a viable dark matter candidate and explain the B-decay anomaly, while obeying current data. Although the allowed region of parameter space, satisfying these requirements, is still large at the moment, future direct detection experiments like XENONnT and DARWIN will, in case of null results, significantly strengthen the limits and push the model to a corner of the parameter space.
