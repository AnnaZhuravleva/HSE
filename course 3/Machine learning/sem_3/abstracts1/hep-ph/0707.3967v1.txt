Curvaton reheating is studied in non-oscillatory (NO) models of inflation, with the aim to obtain bounds on the parameters of curvaton models and find out whether low scale inflation can be attained. Using a minimal curvaton model, it is found that the allowed parameter space is considerably larger than in the case of the usual oscillatory inflation models. In particular, inflation with Hubble scale as low as 1 TeV is comfortably allowed.
