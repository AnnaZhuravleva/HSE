In the framework of the chiral quark model, we investigate the hidden strange pentaquark system of the $N\phi$ state with the quantum numbers of IJ=$\frac{1}{2}$$\frac{3}{2}$. The results show that the $N\phi$ state can be bound through the interaction of the $\sigma$ meson exchange plus the effect of the channel coupling, which means that the effect of the channel coupling has an influence on the existence of this bound state.
