We present the computer code RECOLA2 along with the first NLO electroweak corrections to Higgs production in vector-boson fusion and updated results for Higgs strahlung in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and Higgs-Singlet extension of the Standard Model. A fully automated procedure for the generation of tree-level and one-loop matrix elements in general models, including renormalization, is presented. We discuss the application of the Background-Field Method to the extended models. Numerical results for NLO electroweak cross sections are presented for different renormalization schemes in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and the Higgs-Singlet extension of the Standard Model. Finally, we present distributions for the production of a heavy Higgs boson.
