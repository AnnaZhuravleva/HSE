As a high energy e-p collider, FCC-he, has been recently proposed with sufficient energy options to investigate Higgs couplings. To analyse the sensitivity on the Higgs boson couplings, we focus spesifically on the CP-even and CP-odd Wilson coefficients with $hhZZ\:$and $hh\gamma\gamma\:$ four-point interactions of Higgs boson with Effective Lagrangian Model through the process $e^{-}p\to hhje^{-}$ . We simulate the related processes in FCC-he, with 60 GeV and 120 GeV $e^{-}$ beams and 50 TeV proton beam collisions. We present the exclusion limits on these couplings both for 68% and 95% C.L. in terms of integrated luminosities.
