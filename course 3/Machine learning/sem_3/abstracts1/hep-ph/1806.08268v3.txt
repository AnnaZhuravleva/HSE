This closer study of the FSM: [I] retains the earlier results in offering explanation for the existence of three fermion generations, as well as the hierarchical mass and mixing patterns of leptons and quarks; [II] predicts a vector boson $G$ with mass of order TeV which mixes with $\gamma$ and $Z$ of the standard model. The subsequent deviations from the standard mixing scheme are calculable in terms of the $G$ mass. While these deviations for (i) $m_Z - m_W$, (ii) $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow \ell^+ \ell^-)$, and (iii) $\Gamma(Z \rightarrow {\rm hadrons})$ are all within present experimental errors so long as $m_G > 1$ TeV, they should soon be detectable if the $G$ mass is not too much bigger; [III] suggests that in parallel to the standard sector familiar to us, there is another where the roles of flavour and colour are interchanged. Though quite as copiously populated and as vibrant in self-interactions as our own, it communicates but little with the standard sector except via mixing through a couple of known portals, one of which is the $\gamma-Z-G$ complex noted in [II] above, and the other is a scalar complex which includes the standard model Higgs. As a result, the new sector appears hidden to us as we appear hidden to them, and so its lowest members with masses of order 10 MeV, being electrically neutral and seemingly stable, but abundant, may make eligible candidates as constituents of dark matter. A more detailed summary of these results together with some remarks on the model's special theoretical features can be found in the last section of the text.
