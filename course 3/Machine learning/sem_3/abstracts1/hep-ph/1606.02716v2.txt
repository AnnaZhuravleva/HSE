We consider the associated production of a scalar resonance with the standard model Higgs boson. We demonstrate via a realistic phenomenological analysis that couplings of such a resonance to the Higgs boson can be constrained in a meaningful way in future runs of the LHC, providing insights on its origin and its relation to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. Moreover, the final state can provide a direct way to determine whether the new resonance is produced predominantly in gluon fusion or quark-anti-quark annihilation. The analysis focusses on a resonance coming from a scalar field with vanishing vacuum expectation value and its decay to a photon pair. It can however be straightforwardly generalised to other scenarios.
