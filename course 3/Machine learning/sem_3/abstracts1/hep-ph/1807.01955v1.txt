Spin correlations are an important, but often neglected, effect in modern Monte Carlo event generators. We show that they can be fully incorporated in Herwig 7 using the algorithm originally proposed by Collins and Knowles in all stages of the event generation process and between the different stages of the event generation. In this paper we present the final missing ingredient, correlations in both the angular-ordered and dipole shower algorithms and between the parton shower and hard production and decay processes.
