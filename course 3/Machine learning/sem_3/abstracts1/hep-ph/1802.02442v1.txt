Two AdS/CFT based energy loss models are used to compute the suppression and azimuthal correlations of heavy quarks in heavy ion collisions. The model with a velocity independent diffusion coefficient is in good agreement with B and D meson data up to high $p_T$. The partonic azimuthal correlations we calculate exhibit an order of magnitude difference in low momentum correlations to pQCD calculations [arXiv:1305.3823]. We thus propose heavy flavour momentum correlations as a distinguishing observable of weakly- and strongly-coupled energy loss mechanisms.
