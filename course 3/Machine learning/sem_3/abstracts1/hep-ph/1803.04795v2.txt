We extend the Zee-Babu model introducing local $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry with several singly-charged bosons. We find a predictive neutrino mass texture in a simple hypothesis that mixings among singly-charged bosons are negligible. Also lepton flavor violations are less constrained compared with the original model. Then we explore testability of the model focussing on a doubly-charged boson physics at the LHC and the ILC.
