We examine collider physics via the spectral power H_l, which utilizes much more detector information than sequential jet reconstruction. We use H_l to define a novel jet definition and use it to reconstruct both e+e- > qqg and e+e > tt final states. We find that a significant amount of pileup can be trivially subtracted from H_l jets, provided that the "shape" of pileup can be determined ahead of time. Finally, we find that future progress with H_l jets will require the addition of degrees of freedom accounting for jet "shape" (e.g. radial energy distribution). This should allow the measurement of jet shapes using much more information than traditional techniques.
