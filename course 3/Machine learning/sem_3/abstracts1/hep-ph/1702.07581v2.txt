Though the one-loop amplitudes of the Higgs boson to massless gauge bosons are finite because there is no direct interaction at tree-level in the Standard Model, a well-defined regularization scheme is still required for their correct evaluation. We reanalyze these amplitudes in the framework of the four-dimensional unsubtraction and the loop-tree duality (FDU/LTD), and show how a local renormalization solves potential regularization ambiguities. The Higgs boson interactions are also used to illustrate new additional advantages of this formalism. We show that LTD naturally leads to very compact integrand expressions in four space-time dimensions of the one-loop amplitude with virtual electroweak gauge bosons. They exhibit the same functional form as the amplitudes with top quarks and charged scalars, thus opening further possibilities for simplifications in higher-order computations. Another outstanding application is the straightforward implementation of asymptotic expansions by using dual amplitudes. One of the main benefits of the LTD representation is that it is supported in a Euclidean space. This characteristic feature naturally leads to simpler asymptotic expansions.
