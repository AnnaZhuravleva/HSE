We consider effects of spin-2 particle in the $b\rightarrow s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transition assuming that the spin-2 particle couples in a flavour non-universal way to $b$ and $s$ quarks and in the leptonic sector couples only to the muons, thereby only contributing to the process $b\rightarrow s \mu^+ \mu^-$. The $B_s - \bar B_s$ transition gives the strong constraint on the coupling of the spin-2 mediator and $b$ and $s$ quarks while the observed discrepancy from the SM prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment $ (g-2)_\mu$ serves us to constrain the $\mu$-coupling to spin-2 particle. We find that the spin-2 particle can modify the angular observables in the $B \to K \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decays and produce effects which do not exist in the SM. The generated forward-backward asymmetries in these processes can reach $15\%$, while other observables for these decays receive tiny effects.
