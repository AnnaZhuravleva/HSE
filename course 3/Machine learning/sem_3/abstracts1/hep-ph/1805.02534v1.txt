The mass spectra of charmonium are investigated using a Coulomb plus linear (Cornell) potential. Gaussian wave function in position space as well as in momentum space are employed to calculate the expectation value of potential and kinetic energy respectively. Various experimental states ($X(4660)(5^{3}S_{1})$, $X(3872)(2^{3}P_{1})$, $X(3900)(2^{1}P_{1})$, $X(3915)(2^{3}P_{0})$ and $X(4274)(3^{3}P_{1})$ etc.) are assigned as charmonium states. We also study the Regge trajectories, pseudoscalar and vector decay constants, the Electric and Magnetic dipole transition rates and the annihilation decay width for charmonium states.
