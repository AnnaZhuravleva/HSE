The Elementary Goldstone Higgs (EGH) model is a perturbative extension of the standard model (SM), which identifies the EGH boson as the observed Higgs boson. In this paper, we study pair production of the EGH boson via gluon fusion at the LHC and find that the resonant contribution of the heavy scalar is very small and the SM-like triangle diagram contribution is strongly suppressed. The total production cross section mainly comes from the box diagram contribution and its value can be significantly enhanced with respect to the SM prediction.
