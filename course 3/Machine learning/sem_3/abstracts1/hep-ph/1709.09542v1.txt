We did a model independent phenomenological study of baryogenesis via leptogenesis, neutrinoless double beta decay (NDBD) and charged lepton flavour violation (CLFV) in a generic left-right symmetric model (LRSM) where neutrino mass originates from the type I + type II seesaw mechanism. We studied the new physics contributions to NDBD coming from the left-right gauge boson mixing and the heavy neutrino contribution within the framework of LRSM. We have considered the mass of the RH gauge boson to be specifically 5 TeV, 10 TeV and 18 TeV and studied the effects of the new physics contributions on the effective mass and baryogenesis and compared with the current experimental limit. We tried to correlate the cosmological BAU from resonant leptogenesis with the low energy observables, notably, NDBD and LFV with a view to finding a common parameter space where they coexists.
