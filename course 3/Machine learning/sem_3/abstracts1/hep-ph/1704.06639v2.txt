General analyses of $B$-physics processes beyond the Standard Model require accounting for operator mixing in the renormalization-group evolution from the matching scale down to the typical scale of $B$ physics. For this purpose the anomalous dimensions of the full set of local dimension-six operators beyond the Standard Model are needed. We present here for the first time a complete and non-redundant set of dimension-six operators relevant for $B$-meson mixing and decay, together with the complete one-loop anomalous dimensions in QCD and QED. These results are an important step towards the automation of general New Physics analyses.
