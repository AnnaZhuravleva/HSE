We consider minimal type - I seesaw framework to realize $ \mu-\tau $ reflection symmetry in the low energy neutrino mass matrix, $ M_{\nu} $. Considering DUNE experiment, we scrutinize its potential to measure the precision of 2-3 mixing angle, $ \theta_{23} $ and the Dirac CP-phase, $ \delta $ for the given symmetry. Later, we examine the precision of these two parameters considering NuFit-3.2 data as one of the concerned true point. To study the low energy phenomenology, we further discuss various breaking patterns of such an exact symmetry. Moreover, for each breaking scenario we perform the capability test of DUNE for the determination of $ \theta_{23} $ and to establish the phenomenon of CP violation considering true benchmark point arising from the breaking of $ \mu-\tau $ reflection symmetry. We also make remarks on the potential of DUNE to rule out maximal CP-violation or CP-conservation hypothesis at a certain confidence level for different scenarios.
