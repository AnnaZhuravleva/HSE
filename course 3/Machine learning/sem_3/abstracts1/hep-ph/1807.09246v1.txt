The cross-section for Drell-Yan production of a vector boson has been previously calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order, supplemented by enhanced logarithmic terms associated with the threshold region. In this paper, we calculate a large set of enhanced terms associated with the colour structure $C_F^3$ at N$^3$LO, for the double real emission contribution in the quark-antiquark channel, as an expansion around the threshold region up to and including the first subleading power. We perform our calculation using the method of regions, which systematically characterises all contributions according to whether the virtual gluon is (next-to) soft, collinear or hard in nature. Our results will prove useful for developing general formalisms for classifying next-to-leading power (NLP) threshold effects. They are also interesting in their own right, given that they constitute a previously unknown contribution to the Drell-Yan cross-section at ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$.
