The Elementary Goldstone Higgs (EGH) model is a perturbative extension of the standard model (SM), which identifies the EGH boson as the observed Higgs boson. In this paper, we study pair production of the EGH boson in future linear electron positron colliders. The cross sections in the TeV region can be changed to about $-27\%$, $163\%$ and $-34\%$ for the $e^+e^-\rightarrow Zhh$, $e^+e^-\rightarrow \nu\bar{\nu}hh$, and $e^+e^-\rightarrow t\bar{t}hh$ processes with respect to the SM predictions, respectively. According to the expected measurement precisions, such correction effects might be observed in future linear colliders. In addition, we compare the cross sections of double SM-like Higgs boson production with the predictions in other new physics models.
