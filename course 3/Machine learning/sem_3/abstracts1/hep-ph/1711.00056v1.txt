The search for heavy Higgs bosons is an important step to probe the parameter space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In this work, we classify all possible decay modes of the supersymmetric heavy Higgs boson using the SModelS framework. We work within the phenomenological MSSM and use the ATLAS pMSSM study as our viable parameter space. We find that for a bino-like and higgsino-like LSP, a significant region of the parameter space results in mono-$X$ ($X$ = $h$, $W$, $Z$) final states. For wino-like LSPs, we demonstrate the existence of displaced vertex signatures with a large signal cross section. Finally, we argue that by covering the mono-$X$ final states, a large part of heavy Higgs decays can be tested at the LHC.
