Pseudorapidity and azimuthal three-particle correlations are studied based on a correlated-cluster model of multiparticle production. The model provides a common framework for correlations in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions allowing easy comparison with the measurements. It is shown that azimuthal cluster correlations are definitely required in order to understand three-particle correlations in the near-side ridge effect. This is similar to the explanation of the ridge phenomenon found in our previous analysis of two-particle correlations and generalizes the model to higher-order correlations.
