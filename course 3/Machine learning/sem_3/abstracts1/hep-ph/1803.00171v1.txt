We comprehensively study the charged-Higgs contributions to the leptonic $B^-_q \to \ell \bar \nu$ ($q=u,c$) and semileptonic $\bar B \to X_q \ell \bar\nu$ ($X_u=\pi, \rho; X_c=D,D^*$) decays in the type-III two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). We employ the Cheng-Sher ansatz to suppress the tree-level flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the quark sector. When the strict constraints from the $\Delta B=2$ and $b\to s \gamma$ processes are considered, parameters $\chi^u_{tq}$ from the quark couplings and $\chi^\ell_\ell$ from the lepton couplings dictate the leptonic and semileptonic $B$ decays. It is found that when the measured $B^-_u\to \tau \bar \nu$ and indirect bound of $B^-_c \to \tau \bar \nu$ obtained by LEP1 data are taken into account, $R(D)$ and $R(\pi)$ can have broadly allowed ranges; however, the values of $R(\rho)$ and $R(D^*)$ are limited to approximately the standard model (SM) results. We also find that the same behaviors also occur in the $\tau$-lepton polarizations and forward-backward asymmetries ($A^{X_q,\tau}_{FB}$) of the semileptonic decays, with the exception of $A^{D^*,\tau}_{FB}$, for which the deviation from the SM due to the charged-Higgs effect is still sizable. In addition, the $q^2$-dependent $A^{\pi,\tau}_{FB}$ and $A^{D,\tau}_{FB}$ can be very sensitive to the charged-Higgs effects and have completely different shapes from the SM.
