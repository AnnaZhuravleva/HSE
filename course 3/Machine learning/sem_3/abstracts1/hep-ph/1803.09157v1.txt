The eikonalized parton-parton scattering amplitude at large $\sqrt{s}$ and large impact parameter, is dominated by the exchange of a hyperbolic surface in walled AdS$_5$. We construct the entangled density matrix following from the exchanged surface, and show that the ensuing entanglement entropy is fixed by the intercept of the Reggeized trajectory. The largest eigenvalues of the entangled density matrix obey a cascade equation in rapidity, reminiscent of non-linear QCD evolution. We suggest that they describe the probability distributions of wee-quanta at low-x that maybe measurable at the future eIC.
