The magnetic dipole moment of the exotic $Z_b(10610)$ state is calculated within the light cone QCD sum rule method using the diquark-antidiquark and molecule interpolating currents. The magnetic dipole moment is obtained as $\mu_{Z_b}=1.73\pm 0.63~\mu_N$ in diquark-antidiquark picture and $\mu_{Z_b}=1.59\pm 0.58~\mu_N$ in the molecular case. The obtained results in both pictures together with the results of other theoretical studies on the spectroscopic parameters of the $Z_b(10610)$ state may be useful in determination of the nature and quark organization of this state.
