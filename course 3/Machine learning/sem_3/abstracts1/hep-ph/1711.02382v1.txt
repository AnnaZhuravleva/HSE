Dubnicka-Dubnickova-Kuraev (DDK) sum rules are considered. It is shown that integrals over differences of the total photoproduction cross-sections on octet baryons could be understood in terms of unitary symmetry approach. All the DDK sum rules for these quantities are expressed in terms of only three parameters.
