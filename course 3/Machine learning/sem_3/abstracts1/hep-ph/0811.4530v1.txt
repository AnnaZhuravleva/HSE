The electromagnetic processes of Compton scattering and photon splitting/merging are investigated in the presence of strongly magnetized electron-positron plasma. The influence of these processes on the radiation transfer in the astrophysical environment is studied. In particular, the contribution of the processes under consideration in coefficients of the transfer equation is calculated. We show the importance of photon splitting/merging contribution and taking into account of photon dispersion and wave function renormalization in strong magnetic field and plasma.
