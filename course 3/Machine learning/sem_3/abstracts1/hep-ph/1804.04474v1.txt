We show that we can reproduce all the features of bottomonium suppression in both proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energies in a comover-interaction picture. For each collisions system, we use the measured {\it relative} suppression of the excited $\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(3S) states to $\Upsilon$(1S) by ATLAS and CMS to parametrise the scattering cross sections of all $S$- and $P$-wave bottomonia with the comoving particles created during the collisions. In addition to a single nonpertubative parameter, these cross sections depend on the momentum distribution of these comovers which we found to be the same for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions as well as for partonic and hadronic comovers. Moreover, we can also reproduce the {\it absolute} suppresion rates measured by ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb when the nuclear modifications of the parton densities are taken into account.
