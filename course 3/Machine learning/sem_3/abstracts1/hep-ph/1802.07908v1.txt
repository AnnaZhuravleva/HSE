Recent lattice QCD data on higher order susceptibilities of Charm quarks provide the opportunity to explore Charm quark equilibration in the early quark gluon plasma (QGP) phase. Here, we propose to use the lattice data on second and fourth order net Charm susceptibilities to infer the Charm quark equilibration temperature and the corresponding volume, in the early QGP stage, via a combined analysis of experimentally measured multiplicity fluctuations. Furthermore, the first perturbative results for the second and fourth order Charm quark susceptibilities and their ratio are presented.
