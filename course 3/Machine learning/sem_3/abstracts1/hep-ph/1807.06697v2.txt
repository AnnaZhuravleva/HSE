Search for singlet fermion dark matter at high energy colliders is commonly analyzed with a singlet scalar mediator, which however violates the SM gauge invariance and renormalizability. This problem can be cured by introducing a mixing between the singlet scalar $s$ and the SM Higgs boson $h$. Thus one has to consider two scalar mediators $h_1$ and $h_2$, where $h_1$ is identified as the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson. According to the masses of dark matter and two scalar mediators, we classify the process into four cases. By investigating the total cross sections and differential distributions, we find that the contribution of the 125 GeV Higgs boson $h_1$ can not be neglected in all cases and can even dominate once $h_1$ is on-shell in dark matter production. Further, we study the impact of $h_1$ on the LHC bounds of dark matte searches in the hadronic and semi-leptonic channels with the integrated luminosity of $36~\text{fb}^{-1}$. Finally we make a brief comment that $h_1$ should be also considered in the vector DM search at high energy colliders.
