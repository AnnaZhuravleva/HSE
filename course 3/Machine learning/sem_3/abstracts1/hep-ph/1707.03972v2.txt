We study $\rho$ meson unpolarized generalized parton distributions based on a light-front constituent quark model where the quark-antiquark-meson vertex is constructed under the symmetric loop momentum convention. The form factors and some other low-energy observables of the $\rho$ meson are calculated. Moreover, the contributions to the form factors and generalized parton distributions from the valence and nonvalence regimes are discussed and analyzed in detail. In the forward limit, the usual structure functions are estimated as well. In addition, by evolving the moments of the obtained structure functions to the scale of the lattice calculation, we give the factorization scale of our quark model. It is found that the present phenomenological model is reasonable to describe the general properties of $\rho$ meson.
