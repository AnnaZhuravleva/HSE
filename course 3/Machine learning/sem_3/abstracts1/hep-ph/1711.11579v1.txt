The recent high energy electron and positron flux observed by the DAMPE experiment indicates possible excess events near 1.4 TeV. Such an excess may be evidence of dark matter annihilations or decays in a dark matter subhalo that is located close to the solar system. We give here an analysis of this excess from annihilations of Dirac fermion dark matter which is charged under a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. The interactions between dark matter and the standard model particles are mediated the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson. We show that dark matter annihilations from a local subhalo can explain the excess with the canonical thermal annihilation cross section. We further discuss the constraints from the relic density, from the dark matter direct detection, from the dark matter indirect detection, from the cosmic microwave background, and from the particle colliders.
