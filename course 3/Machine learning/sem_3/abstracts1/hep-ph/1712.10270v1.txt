We point out that, given the current experimental status of radiative kaon decays, a subclass of the ${\cal O} (p^4)$ counterterms of the weak chiral lagrangian can be determined in closed form. This involves in a decisive way the decay $K^\pm \to \pi ^\pm \pi ^0 l^+ l^-$, currently being measured at CERN by the NA48/2 and NA62 collaborations. We show that consistency with other radiative kaon decay measurements leads to a rather clean prediction for the ${\cal{O}}(p^4)$ weak couplings entering this decay mode. This results in a characteristic pattern for the interference Dalitz plot, susceptible to be tested already with the limited statistics available at NA48/2. We also provide the first analysis of $K_S\to \pi^+\pi^-\gamma^*$, which will be measured by LHCb and will help reduce (together with the related $K_L$ decay) the experimental uncertainty on the radiative weak chiral couplings. A precise experimental determination of the ${\cal{O}}(p^4)$ weak couplings is important in order to assess the validity of the existing theoretical models in a conclusive way. We briefly comment on the current theoretical situation and discuss the merits of the different theoretical approaches.
