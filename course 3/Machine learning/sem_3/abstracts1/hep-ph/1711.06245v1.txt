We consider the effect of the chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations in addition to the collisional as well as the radiative energy loss suffered by heavy quarks while propagating through the hot and densed deconfined medium of quarks and gluons created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations play an important role as it leads to an energy gain of heavy quarks of all momentum, significantly effective at the lower momentum region. With this, we have computed, for the first time, the nuclear modification factor (R_{AA}) of heavy mesons, viz., D-mesons and B-mesons and compared with the those experimental measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV and \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02 TeV by the CMS and ALICE experiments at the LHC. Our results are found to be in very good agreement with those available data measured by CMS and ALICE experiments.
