We analyze neutrino mass matrices having one texture zero, assuming that the neutrino mixing matrix has either its first (TM$_1$) or second (TM$_2$) column identical to that of the tribimaximal mixing matrix. We found that all the six possible one texture zero neutrino mass matrices are compatible with the present neutrino oscillation data when combined with TM$_1$ or TM$_2$ mixing. These textures have interesting predictions for the presently unknown parameters such as the effective Majorana neutrino mass, the Dirac CP violating phase and the neutrino mass scale. We also present a way to theoretically realize some of these textures using $A_4$ symmetry within the framework of type-I+II seesaw mechanism.
