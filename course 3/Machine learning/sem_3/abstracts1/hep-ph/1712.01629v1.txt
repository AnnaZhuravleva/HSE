We investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature in the SU(2) quark meson model where the mean field approximation is compared to the renormalized version for quarks and mesons. In a combined approach at finite temperature all the renormalized versions show a crossover transition. The inclusion of different renormalization scales leave the order parameter and the mass spectra nearly untouched, but strongly influence the thermodynamics at low temperatures and around the phase transition. We find unphysical results for the renormalized version of mesons and the combined one.
