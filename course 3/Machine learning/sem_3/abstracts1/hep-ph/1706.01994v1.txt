We consider an analysis of potentials related to Schr\"odinger-type equations for scalar fields in a 5D AdS black hole background with dilaton in order to get melting temperatures for different hadrons in a thermal bath. The approach does not consider calculations of spectral functions and it is easy to get results for hadrons with an arbitrary number of constituents. We present results for scalar mesons, glueballs, hybrid mesons and tetraquarks, and we show that mesons are more resistant to being melted in a thermal bath than other scalar hadrons, and in general the melting temperature increases when hadrons contain heavy quarks.
