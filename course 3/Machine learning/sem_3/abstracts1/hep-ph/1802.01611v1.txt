The ANITA balloon experiment has observed an EeV cascade event at an angle below the horizon that renders any Standard Model (SM) interpretation unlikely as the Earth is significantly opaque to all SM particles at such energies. In this paper, we study a sterile neutrino interpretation of this event, calculating the angular event distribution of cascades and the relative sensitivities of several experiments to a cascade initiated by an EeV sterile neutrino. We find that ANITA is uniquely sensitive to this type of upward directed cascade signal and canonical ultrahigh energy cosmic ray (UHECR) models can produce a reprocessed EeV sterile neutrino flux at sufficient levels to accommodate the ANITA event.
