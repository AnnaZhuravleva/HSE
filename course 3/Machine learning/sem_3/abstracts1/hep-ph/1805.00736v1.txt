The transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution of Higgs bosons at hadron colliders enables a detailed probe of its production dynamics and is a key ingredient to precision studies of Higgs boson properties, but receives very large QCD corrections. We obtain a precision prediction for the $p_T$ spectrum by matching second-order (NNLO) QCD corrections at large $p_T$ with resummation of third-order logarithmic (N$^3$LL) corrections at small $p_T$. We achieve significantly improved results for $p_T< 35\,{\rm GeV}$ with perturbative uncertainties $\lesssim \pm 6\%$, and thus a convergent perturbative series for all values of $p_T$.
