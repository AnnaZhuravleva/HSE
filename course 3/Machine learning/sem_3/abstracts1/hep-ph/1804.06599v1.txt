Cosmological relaxation of the electroweak scale is improved by using particle production to trap the relaxion. We combine leptogenesis with such a relaxion model that has no extremely small parameters or large e-foldings. Scanning happens after inflation--now allowed to be at a high scale--over a sub-Planckian relaxion field range for an $\mathcal{O}(100)$ TeV cut-off scale of new physics. Particle production by the relaxion also reheats the universe and generates the baryonic matter-antimatter asymmetry. We propose a realisation in which out-of-equilibrium leptons, produced by the relaxion, scatter with the thermal bath through interactions that violate CP and lepton number via higher-dimensional operators. Such a minimal effective field theory setup, with no new physics below the cut-off, naturally decouples new physics while linking leptogenesis to relaxion particle production; the baryon asymmetry of the universe can thus be intrinsically tied to a weak scale hierarchy.
