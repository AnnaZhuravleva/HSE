In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of exclusive vector meson photoproduction in $pp$, $pPb$ and $PbPb$ collisions at Run 2 LHC energies using the Color Dipole formalism. The rapidity distributions and total cross sections for the $\rho$, $\phi$, $J/\Psi$, $\Psi (2S)$ and $\Upsilon$ production are estimated considering the more recent phenomenological models for the dipole - proton scattering amplitude, which are based on the Color Glass Condensate formalism and are able to describe the inclusive and exclusive $ep$ HERA data. Moreover, we also discuss the impact of the modelling of the vector meson wave functions on the predictions. The current theoretical uncertainty in the Color Dipole predictions is estimated and a comparison with the experimental results is performed.
