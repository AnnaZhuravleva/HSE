In the present article, we have studied the equation of state and dissociation temperature of bottomonium state by correcting the full Cornell potential in isotropic medium by employing the effective fugacity quasi-particle Debye mass. We had also calculated the bottomonium suppression in an expanding, dissipative strongly interacting QGP medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Finally we compared our results with experimental data from RHIC 200GeV/nucleon Au-Au collisions, LHC 2.76 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb, and LHC 5.02 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb collisions as a function of number of participants
