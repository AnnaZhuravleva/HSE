We propose a model with an $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry, in which small neutrino masses, dark matter and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe can be simultaneously explained. In particular, the neutrino masses are generated radiatively, while the matter-antimatter asymmetry is led by the leptogenesis mechanism, at TeV scale. We also explore allowed regions of the model parameters and discuss some phenomenological effects including lepton flavor violating processes.
