Two scenarios of low temperature baryogenesis in theories with TeV scale gravity are discussed. It is argued that strong gravity at TeV energies is very favorable for baryogenesis. In both scenarios the proton decay is either absent or suppressed far below existing bounds. On the other hand, neutron-antineutron oscillations are at the verge of discovery. Some other rare decays with non-conservation of lepton or baryon numbers are predicted.
