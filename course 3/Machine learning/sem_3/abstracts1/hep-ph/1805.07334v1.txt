Recently, we have proposed a quark mass matrix model based on U(3)$\times$U(3)$'$ family symmetry, in which up- and down-quark mass matrices $M_u$ and $M_d$ are described only by complex parameters $a_u $ and $a_d $, respectively. When we use charged lepton masses as additional input values, we can successfully obtain predictions for quark masses and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing. Since we have only one complex parameter $a_q$ for each mass matrix $M_q$, we can obtain a parameter-independent mass relation by using three equations for ${\rm Tr}[H_q]$, ${\rm Tr}[H_q H_q]$ and ${\rm det}H_q$, where $H_q \equiv M_q M_q^\dagger$ ($q=u, d$). In this paper, we investigate its parameter-independent feature of the quark mass relation in the model.
