We study the equation of state (EoS) of the hot and dense hadron gas by incorporating the excluded volume corrections into the ideal hadron resonance gas model (HRG). The total hadron mass spectrum of the model is the sum of discrete mass spectrum consisting all the experimentally known hadrons and the exponentially rising continuous Hagedorn states. We confront the EoS of the model with lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) results at finite baryon chemical potential. We find that this modified HRG model reproduce the LQCD results up to T = 160 MeV at zero as well as finite baryon chemical potential. We further estimate the shear viscosity coefficient within ambit of this model in the context of heavy-ion collision experiments.
