We compute the next-to-leading order corrections to soft-gluon radiation differentially in the one-emission phase space. We show that their contribution to the evolution of color dipoles can be obtained in a modified subtraction scheme, such that both one- and two-emission terms are amenable to Monte-Carlo integration. The two-loop cusp anomalous dimension is recovered naturally upon integration over the full phase space. We present two independent implementations of the new algorithm in the two event generators Pythia and Sherpa, and we compare the resulting fully differential simulation to the CMW scheme.
