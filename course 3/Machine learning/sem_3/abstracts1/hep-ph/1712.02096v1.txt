Measuring the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters is one of the main aims in neutrino physics today. The measurement of these parameters is severely affected by the presence of degeneracies in the parameter space. Various neutrino oscillation projects have been proposed to measure them. In this overview talk, we will discuss some of the proposed neutrino experiments and the synergies between them that can enhance their future physics reach.
