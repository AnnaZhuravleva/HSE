If dark matter annihilates to light quarks in the core of the Sun, then a flux of 236 MeV neutrinos will be produced from the decay of stopped kaons. We consider strategies for DUNE to not only observe such a signal, but to determine the direction of the neutrino from the hadronic recoil. We show that this novel strategy can provide a better handle on systematic uncertainties associated with dark matter searches.
