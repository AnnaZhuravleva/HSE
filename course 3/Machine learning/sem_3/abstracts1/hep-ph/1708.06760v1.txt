Jet substructure is playing a central role at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) probing the Standard Model in extreme regions of phase space and providing innovative ways to search for new physics. Analytic calculations of experimentally successful observables are a primary catalyst driving developments in jet substructure, allowing for a deeper understanding of observables and for the exploitation of increasingly subtle features of jets. In this paper we present a field theoretic framework enabling systematically improvable calculations of groomed multi-prong substructure observables, which builds on recent developments in multi-scale effective theories. We use this framework to compute for the first time the full spectrum for groomed tagging observables at the LHC, carefully treating both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions in all regions. Our analysis enables a precision understanding which we hope will improve the reach and sophistication of jet substructure techniques at the LHC.
