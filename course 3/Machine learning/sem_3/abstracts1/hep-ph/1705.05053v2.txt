The exclusive photoproduction of the heavy vector mesons $J/\Psi$ is investigated in the context of peripheral lead-lead collisions for the energies available at the LHC, $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. Using the light-cone color dipole formalism, it was calculated the rapidity distribution in two centrality bins 50\%-70\% and 70\%-90\% in order to evaluate its robustness in extrapolating down to smaller impact parameter. It is introduced a modified photon flux, without change in the photonuclear cross section in relation to the ultraperipheral (UPC) case. Results were obtained for the two regions analized, which presented a maximum difference of 27\% in frontal rapidity for the two regions. Comparing the results for $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV, it was verified an increase of approximately half the one obtained in ultraperipheral regime in the central rapidity region.
