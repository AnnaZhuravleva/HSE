The extraction of right-handed currents, beyond the Standard Model, faces theoretical challenges from long-distance contributions. We show that these effects can be controlled by combining, for example, studies of $B \to V(1^-) \gamma$ and $B \to A(1^+) \gamma$ observables. The sum of the long-distance contributions can be extracted without compromise, and the individual pieces follow from a ratio predicted by theory. This leads to significant reduction in the uncertainty of long-distance contributions. The ideas extend to charm decays and the low $q^2$-region of $B \to V \ell \bar{\ell}$, and open the prospect of checking input affecting the angular $B \to K^* \mu \mu$-anomaly.
