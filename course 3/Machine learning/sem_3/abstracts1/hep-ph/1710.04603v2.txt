We describe a numerical calculation tool H-COUP written in Fortran, which provides one-loop electroweak corrected vertices for the discovered Higgs boson $h(125)$ in various Higgs sectors. The renormalization is based on the improved on-shell scheme without gauge dependence. In the first version H-COUP_1.0, the following models are included, namely, the Higgs singlet model, four types (Type-I, Type-II, Type-X, Type-Y) of two Higgs doublet models with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry and the inert doublet model. We first briefly introduce these models and then explain how to install and run this tool in an individual machine. A sample of numerical outputs is provided for user information.
