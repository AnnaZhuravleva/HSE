We study the dihadron fragmentation functions (DiFF) of longitudinally polarized quarks into pion pairs. The quark-jet framework is used to model the sequential hadronization of a polarized quark into hadrons, where the polarization transfer to the remnant quark in each hadron emission step is calculated using the spin density matrix formalism. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the hadronization process, we find a nonvanishing helicity dependent DiFF, $G_1^\perp$ , which is also related to the longitudinal jet handedness. A method is developed for extracting the angular moments of this DiFF, which enter the expressions for the azimuthal asymmetries for an electron-positron annihilation process into two pairs of hadrons from back-to-back jets and the dihadron production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering. Finally, we derive explicit integral expressions for DiFFs where only two hadrons are emitted by a quark and use them to validate our MC results for both unpolarized and helicity dependent DiFFs.
