LHCb data indicate a significant difference in widths between the B->K (or K^*) + e^+ e^- and B->K (or K^*) + {\mu}^+ {\mu}^- decays (April 2017). The width of the e^+ e^--channel is noticeably larger than that of the {\mu}^+ {\mu}^--channel. SM-calculations require equality here. The difference may mean that a new interaction exists which changes generations and distinguishes leptons, with coupling constants much larger than, and inverse in power to, the SM-coupling of fermions with the Higgs boson. In the spontaneously violated mirror symmetry, the coupling between SM particles and the heavy (in principle) second Higgs scalar, necessarily present here, is characterized by precisely such properties. The inverse strong power of such a coupling is not an additional hypothesis but also a necessary condition for the qualitative reproduction of the observed mass hierarchy of charged leptons and the structure of lepton weak mixing, the PMNS matrix. In the mirror model being discussed, all properties, including the inverse power of the new interaction, are dictated by the hierarchical character of mass spectra for quarks and charged leptons.
