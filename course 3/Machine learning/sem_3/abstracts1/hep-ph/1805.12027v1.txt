We estimate the sensitivity to the top-quark Yukawa coupling y_t at future e+e- colliders. We go beyond the standard approach that focuses on tth production and consider final states with a Higgs boson but not top quarks. The sensitivity to y_t in such processes comes from the coupling of the Higgs boson to top quarks in loops. Such final states can be produced in significant numbers at center-of-mass energies that will be accessible by all proposed e+e- colliders. For example, we find that at FCC-ee and CEPC operating at sqrt{s}=240 GeV, y_t could potentially be measured with precision better than 1%. For CLIC and ILC the extraction of y_t could be improved by a factor of about 2 and 7 respectively, compared to its extraction from just tth final states.
