The Madala hypothesis postulates a new heavy scalar, H, which explains several independent anomalous features seen in ATLAS and CMS data simultaneously. It has already been discussed and constrained in the literature by Run 1 results, and its underlying theory has been explored under the interpretation of a two Higgs doublet model coupled with a scalar singlet, $S$. When applying the hypothesis to Run 2 results, it can be shown that the constraints from the data are compatible with those obtained using Run 1 results.
