The covariant Faddeev approach which describes baryons as relativistic three-quark bound states and is based on the Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter equations of QCD is briefly reviewed. All elements, including especially the baryons' three-body-wave-functions, the quark propagators and the dressed quark-photon vertex, are calculated from a well-established approximation for the quark-gluon interaction. Selected previous results of this approach for the spectrum and elastic electromagnetic form factors of ground-state baryons and resonances are reported. The main focus of this talk is a presentation and discussion of results from a recent investigation of the electromagnetic transition form factors between ground-state octet and decuplet baryons as well as the octet-only $\Sigma^0$ to $\Lambda$ transition.
