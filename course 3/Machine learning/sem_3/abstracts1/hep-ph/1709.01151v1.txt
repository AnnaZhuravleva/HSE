xFitter is an open-source package that provides a framework for the determination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton for many different kinds of analyses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). xFitter version 2.0.0 has recently been released, and offers an expanded set of tools and options. It incorporates experimental data from a wide range of experiments including fixed-target, Tevatron, HERA, and LHC. xFitter can analyze this data up to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in perturbation theory with a variety of theoretical calculations including numerous methodological options for carrying out PDF fits and plotting tools which help visualize the results. While primarily based on the collinear factorization foundation, xFitter also provides facilities for fits of dipole models and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) PDFs. The package can be used to study the impact of new precise measurements from hadron colliders, and also assess the impact of future colliders. This paper provides a brief overview of xFitter with emphasis of the new version 2.0.0 features.
