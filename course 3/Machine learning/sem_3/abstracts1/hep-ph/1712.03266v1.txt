We propose a fully flexible method to perform an hypothesis test between signal and background based on the Matrix Element Method in the presence of multiple invisible particles. The proposed method performs a mapping of the measured final state onto its minimal hypersurface of degrees of freedom for a given process and then maximises the matrix element on this hypersurface separately for signal and background. To show how performant the method is in separating signal from background, we apply it to the prominent partly invisible decay of a Higgs boson into a muon-antimuon pair and two muon-neutrinos via two W bosons.
