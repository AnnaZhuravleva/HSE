The chirally symmetric baryon parity-doublet model can be used as an effective description of the baryon-like objects in the chirally symmetric phase of QCD. Recently it has been found that above the critical temperature higher chiralspin symmetries emerge in QCD. It is demonstrated here that the baryon parity-doublet Lagrangian is manifestly chiralspin-invariant. We construct nucleon interpolators with fixed chiralspin transformation properties that can be used in lattice studies at high T.
