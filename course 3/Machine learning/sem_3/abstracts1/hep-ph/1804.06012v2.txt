We propose a new model of 5D $SU(3)\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge-Higgs unification with a successful electroweak symmetry breaking and a realistic Higgs boson mass. In our model, the representations of the fermions are very simple, the ${\bf 3}, \overline{\bf 3}$ and $\bf \overline{15}$ representations of $SU(3)$ gauge group. Employing the anti-periodic boundary conditions for $\bf \overline{15}$ reduces massless exotic fermions and simplifies the brane localized mass terms. We calculate the 1-loop Higgs potential in detail and find that a realistic electroweak symmetry breaking and the observed Higgs mass are obtained.
