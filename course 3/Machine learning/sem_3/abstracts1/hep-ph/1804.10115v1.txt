Dynamics of non-standard inflation potential has been gaining significant interest in the recent times. Based on our recent proposal on minimal inflationary cosmologies for non-polynomial plateau potential, in this paper, we perform a detailed reheating constraints analysis considering the perturbative decay of inflaton to radiation and the dark matter. Our present study focuses on constraining the models from reheating analysis specifically taking into account the CMB anisotropy and current dark matter abundance. We have solved the appropriate set of Boltzmann equations for decaying inflaton, radiation, and the dark matter field during reheating and found stringent constraints on the model parameters. Further, we also have explored the possible interesting connection among the dark matter parameter space namely the dark matter annihilation cross-section ($\left<\sigma|v|\right>$), mass $(M_X)$ of a single component dark matter and the inflationary power spectrum $n_s$.
