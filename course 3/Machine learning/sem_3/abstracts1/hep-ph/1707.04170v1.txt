The exclusive production by the photon fusion of magnetic monopoles and the bound states of magnetic monopoles, the monopolium, is consider in different high energy processes. More specifically, we calculate the total cross sections of the ultraperipheral elastic collisions of electron-electron, proton-proton and lead-lead in present and future colliders, comparing with the previous results found in the literature. Our results indicates that magnetic monopoles or his bound states, if both exists, can be measuareble in future electron-electron colliders.
