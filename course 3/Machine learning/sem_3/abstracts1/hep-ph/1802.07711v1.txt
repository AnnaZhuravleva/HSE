The electromagnetic multipole moments of the open-flavor $Z_{\bar cq}$ states are investigated by assuming a diquark-antidiquark picture for their internal structure and quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$ for their spin-parity. In particular, their magnetic and quadrupole moments are extracted in the framework of light-cone QCD sum rule by the help of the photon distribution amplitudes. The electromagnetic multipole moments of the open-flavor $Z_{\bar cq}$ states are important dynamical observables, which encode valuable information on their underlying structure. The results obtained for the magnetic moments of different structures are considerably large and can be measured in future experiments. We obtain very small values for the quadrupole moments of $Z_{\bar cq}$ states indicating a nonspherical charge distribution.
