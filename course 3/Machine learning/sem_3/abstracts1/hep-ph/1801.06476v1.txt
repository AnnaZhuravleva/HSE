We propose the measurement of net $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ helicity, correlated event-by-event with the magnitude and sign of charge separation along the event's magnetic field direction, as a probe to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy-Ion Collisions. With a simple simulation model of heavy-ion events that includes effects of Local Parity Violation, we estimate the experimental correlation signal that could be expected at RHIC given the results of previous measurements that are sensitive to the CME.
