The determination of the neutrino mass ordering is currently pursued by several experiments and proposals. A very challenging one is its evaluation from reactor experiments based on the tiny interference effect between the $\Delta m^2_{31}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$ oscillations. Current analyses require several years of data taking and an extreme energy resolution to achieve anyhow less than 5 $\sigma$. Referring to the JUNO experimental conditions we developed a completely new technique that would provide a robust 5 $\sigma$ measurement in less than six years of running. The two orderings could be discriminated at the price of allowing for two different values of $\Delta m^2_{31}$. This degeneracy on $\Delta m^2_{31}$ (around $12\times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$) can however be measured at an unprecedented accuracy of much less than 1\%, i.e. $10^{-5}$ eV$^2$, within the same analysis. Analogies with the usual $\chi^2$ analysis, where the $\Delta m^2_{31}$ degeneracy is much more important, are discussed. Evaluation and inclusion of systematic errors and backgrounds have been performed, the most relevant among them being the addition of the two remote reactor plants 250 km away. Baselines of each contributing reactor core and its spatial resolution have been taken into account. Possible results after two years of running and the foreseen initially-reduced available reactor power have been studied, too. These results confirm the very positive perspectives for JUNO to determine the mass ordering in a vacuum-oscillation dominated region.
