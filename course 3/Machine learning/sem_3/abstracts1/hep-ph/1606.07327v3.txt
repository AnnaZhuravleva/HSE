A study of differential cross sections and azimuthal observables for semi-hard processes at LHC energies, including BFKL resummation effects, is presented. Particular attention has been paid to the behaviour of the azimuthal correlation momenta, when a couple of forward/backward jets or identified hadrons is produced in the final state with a large rapidity separation. Three- and four- jet production has been also considered, the main focus lying on the definition of new, generalized azimuthal observables, whose dependence on the transverse momenta and the rapidities of the central jet(s) can be considered as a distinct signal of the onset of BFKL dynamics.
