We present a conceptually clear introduction to quantum theory at a level suitable for high-school students attending the International Summer School for Young Physicists (ISSYP) at Perimeter Institute. It is entirely self-contained and no university-level background knowledge is required. The lectures we given over four days, four hours each day. On the first day the students were given all the relevant mathematical background from linear algebra and probability theory. On the second day, we used the acquired mathematical tools to define the full quantum theory in the case of a finite Hilbert space and discuss some consequences such as entanglement, Bell's theorem and the uncertainty principle. Finally, in days three and four we presented an overview of advanced topics related to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, including canonical and path integral quantization, the quantum harmonic oscillator, quantum field theory, the Standard Model, and quantum gravity.
