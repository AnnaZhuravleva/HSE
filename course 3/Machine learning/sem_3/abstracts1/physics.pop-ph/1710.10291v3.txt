The measurement problem and three other vexing experiments in quantum physics are described. It is shown how Quantum Field Theory, as formulated by Julian Schwinger, provides simple solutions for all four experiments. It is also shown how this theory resolves many other problems of Quantum Mechanics and Relativity, including a new and simple derivation of E = mc2.
