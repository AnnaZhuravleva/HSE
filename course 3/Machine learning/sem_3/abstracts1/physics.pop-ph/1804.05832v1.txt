Since the 1960s a growing number of composers have engaged with scientific research and have tried to incorporate their understanding of various models and theories into their musical works. Among them, H\`ector Parra (b. 1976) has been particularly impressed by the recent developments of gravitational physics and astrophysics, namely the part of astronomy which deals with gravity rather than light. Black holes, gravitational waves (first detected in September 2015), cosmology, or quantum gravity models belong to such fields of intensive research, bringing surprising new concepts such as the coarse-graining of space-time, multiverse or holographic principle. In this framework we have collaborated in the conception of a large piece for soloist ensemble, orchestra and electronic devices, which tries to transpose gravitational phenomena into a new form of contemporary music.
