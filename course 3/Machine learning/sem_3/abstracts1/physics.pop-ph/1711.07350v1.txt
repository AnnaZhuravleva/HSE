Among the many outreach and communication tools available in our digital era, traditional tools such as exhibitions still hold an important place. The ALICE collaboration is setting up a new exhibition at the experiment's site, as part of the ALICE Visitor Centre. Its goal is to communicate to visitors the physics and the tools and methods used by ALICE. It combines modern technology such as video mapping with real detector items, aiming to fascinate the visitors and give them an immersive experience of a high energy physics experiment. The development process, the messages to be delivered and the choices for the contents and the way of exhibiting them are discussed; and the final design and present status of the project are presented.
