Observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. This requires that the dominant constituent of matter in the universe, the so called dark energy, have some unusual properties like negative pressure. We work with the simplest model of dark energy, the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein. We study the evolution of spherical overdensities in such a model and show that there is a minimum overdensity required for collapse: perturbations with a smaller amplitude do not collapse. Further, we show that perturbations with an amplitude larger than, but comparable to the critical value, take a very long time to collapse. We compare the solutions with the case when dark energy is absent.
