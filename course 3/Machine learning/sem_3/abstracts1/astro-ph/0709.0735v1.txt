We present a mechanism to create vortices in a plasma via gravitational dragging behind rotating cosmic string loops. The vortical motions create magnetic fields by means of the Harrison-Rees mechanism; the fields are further enhanced through galactic collapse and dynamo amplification. Employing the Velocity dependent One Scale model (VOS) for the string network and incorporating loop dynamics, we compute the magnetic fields generated around the time of decoupling: these are just strong and coherent enough to account for presently observed magnetic fields in spiral galaxies if efficient dynamos with $\Gamma_{dy}^{-1}\approx 0.3$ Gyr are present.
