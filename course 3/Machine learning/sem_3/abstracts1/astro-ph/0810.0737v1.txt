Observation of the CMB is central to observational cosmology, and the Antarctic Plateau is an exceptionally good site for this work. The first attempt at CMB observations from the Plateau was an expedition to the South Pole in December 1986 by the Radio Physics Research group at Bell Laboratories. Sky noise and opacity were measured. The results were sufficiently encouraging that in the Austral summer of 1988-1989, three CMB groups participated in the "Cucumber" campaign, where a temporary site dedicated to CMB anisotropy measurements was set up 2 km from South Pole Station. Winter-time observations became possible with the establishment in 1990 of the Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. CARA developed year-round observing facilities in the "Dark Sector", a section of Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station dedicated to astronomical observations. CARA scientists fielded several astronomical instruments: AST/RO, SPIREX, White Dish, Python, Viper, ACBAR, and DASI. By 2001, data from CARA, together with BOOMERANG, a CMB experiment on a long-duration balloon launched from McMurdo Station on the coast of Antarctica, showed clear evidence that the overall geometry of the Universe is flat, as opposed to being positively or negatively curved. In 2002, the DASI group reported the detection of polarization in the CMB. These observations strongly support the concordance model of cosmology, where the dynamics of a flat Universe are dominated by forces exerted by the Dark Energy and Dark Matter. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) is a newly-operational 10 m diameter offset telescope designed to rapidly measure anisotropies on scales much smaller than 1 degree.
