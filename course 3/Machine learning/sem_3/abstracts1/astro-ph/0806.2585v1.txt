MOND-- modified Newtonian dynamics-- may be viewed as an algorithm for calculating the distribution of force in an astronomical object from the observed distribution of baryonic matter. The fact that it works for galaxies is quite problematic for Cold Dark Matter. Moreover, MOND explains or subsumes systematic aspects of galaxy photometry and kinematics-- aspects that CDM does not address or gets wrong. I will present evidence here in support of these assertions and claim that this is effectively a falsification of dark matter that is dynamically important on the scale of galaxies.
