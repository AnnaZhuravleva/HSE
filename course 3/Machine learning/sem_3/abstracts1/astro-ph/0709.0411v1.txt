We present the first high-redshift galaxy cluster candidate sample from the HIROCS survey found in the COSMOS field. It results from a combination of public COSMOS with proprietary H-band data on a 0.66 square degree part of the COSMOS field and comprises 12 candidates in the redshift range 1.23 < z < 1.55. We find an increasing fraction of blue cluster members with increasing redshift. Many of the blue and even some of the reddest member galaxies exhibit disturbed morphologies as well as signs of interaction.
