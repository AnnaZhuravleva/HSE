It is shown that in the Vacuum Fluctuations Domination model (VFD), where vacuum fluctuations of scalar fields dominates under matter and radiation throughout the all history of the Universe expansion (arXiv:gr-qc/0604020, arXiv:gr-qc/0610148), acceleration parameter evolves monotonically from the zero to the present day negative value. That is according to this model the Universe has no decelerating past and conventional radiation domination and matter domination epochs are absent. Predictions of accelerating parameter for z~0-2 is compared with that follows from the SN type Ia data.
