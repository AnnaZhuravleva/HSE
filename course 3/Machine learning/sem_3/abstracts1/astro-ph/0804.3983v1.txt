We show the preliminary results of the application of our "fireshell" model to GRB060124. This source is very peculiar because it is the first event for which both the prompt and the afterglow emission were observed simultaneously by the three Swift instruments: BAT (15-350 keV), XRT (0.2-10 keV) and UVOT (170-650 nm), due to the presence of a precursor ~ 570 s before the main burst. We analyze GRB060124 within our "canonical" GRB scenario, identifying the precursor with the P-GRB and the prompt emission with the afterglow peak emission. In this way we reproduce correctly the energetics of both these two components. We reproduce also the observed time delay between the precursor (P-GRB) and the main burst. The effect of such a time delay in our model will be discussed.
