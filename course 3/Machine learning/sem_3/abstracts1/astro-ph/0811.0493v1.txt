We have fitted ~200 RXTE and INTEGRAL spectra of the neutron star LMXB GX 9+9 from 2002-2007 with a model consisting of a disc blackbody and another blackbody representing the spreading layer (SL), i.e. an extended accretion zone on the NS surface as opposed to the more traditional disc-like boundary layer. Contrary to theory, the SL temperature was seen to increase towards low SL luminosities, while the approximate angular extent had a nearly linear luminosity dependency. Comptonization was not required to adequately fit these spectra. Together with the ~70 degree upper bound of inclination implied by the lack of eclipses, the best-fitting normalization of the accretion disc blackbody component implies a distance of ~10 kpc, instead of the usually quoted 5 kpc.
