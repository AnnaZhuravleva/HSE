[Abridged] Photoionization, whether by starlight or other sources, has difficulty in accounting for the observed spectra of the optical filaments that often surround central galaxies in large clusters. Our first paper examined whether heating by energetic particles or dissipative MHD wave can account for the observations. Here we include atomic and low-ionization regions. The model of the hydrogen atom, along with all elements of the H-like iso-electronic sequence, is now fully nl-resolved. We show how the predicted HI spectrum differs from the pure recombination case. The second update is to the rates for H^0 - H2 inelastic collisions. We now use the values computed by Wrathmall et al. The rates are often much larger.   We calculate the chemistry, ionization, temperature, gas pressure, and emission-line spectrum for a wide range of gas densities and collisional heating rates. We assume that the filaments are magnetically confined and free to move along field lines so that the gas pressure is equal to that of the surrounding hot gas. A mix of clouds, some being dense and cold and others hot and tenuous, can exist. The observed spectrum will be the integrated emission from clouds with different densities and temperatures but the same pressure. We assume that the gas filling factor is given by a power law in density. The power-law index is set by matching the observed intensities of IR H2 lines relative to optical HI lines. We conclude that the filaments are heated by ionizing particles, either conducted in from surrounding regions or produced in situ by processes related to MHD waves.
