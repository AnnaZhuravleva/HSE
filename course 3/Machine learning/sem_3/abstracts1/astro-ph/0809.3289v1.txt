We present results of a search for a young stellar moving group associated with the star HD 141569, a nearby, isolated Herbig AeBe primary member of a 5+/-3 Myr-old triple star system on the outskirts of the Sco-Cen complex. Our spectroscopic survey identified a population of 21 Li-rich, <30 Myr-old stars within 30 degrees of HD 141569 which possess similar proper motions with the star. The spatial distribution of these Li-rich stars, however, is not suggestive of a moving group associated with the HD 141569 triplet, but rather this sample appears cospatial with Upper Scorpius and Upper Centaurus Lupus. We apply a modified moving cluster parallax method to compare the kinematics of these youthful stars with Upper Scorpius and Upper Centaurus Lupus. Eight new potential members of Upper Scorpius and five new potential members of Upper Centaurus Lupus are identified. A substantial moving group with an identifiable nucleus within 15 degrees (~30 pc) of HD 141569 is not found in this sample. Evidently, the HD 141569 system formed ~5 Myr ago in relative isolation, tens of parsecs away from the recent sites of star formation in the Ophiucus-Scorpius-Centaurus region.
