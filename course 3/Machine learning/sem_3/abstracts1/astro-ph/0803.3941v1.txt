Optical and X-ray observations are presented here of a newly reported X-ray transient system in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The data reveal many previously unknown X-ray detections of this system and clear evidence for a 49.995d binary period. In addition, the optical photometry show recurring outburst features at the binary period which may well be indicative of the neutron star interacting with a circumstellar disk around a Be star.
