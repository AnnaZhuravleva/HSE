We show that if inflation lasted just longer than the required 60 or so e-folds $N$ both scalar and tensor contributions to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra are expected to show a cut-off. However the behaviour of the scalar-to-tensor ratio on large scale depends on whether inflation is preceded by a Kinetic Dominated (KD) or Radiation Dominated (RD) stage. Future experiments may be able to distinguish between the two behaviours and thus shed light on the nature of the low-$\ell$ cutoff. In particular if the cut-off is due to a KD stage the ratio is expected to grow on large scales. If observed this would challenge our current understanding of the overall probability of inflation lasting for $N$ greater than 60.
