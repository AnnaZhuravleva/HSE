The Bekenstein-Milgrom gravity theory with a modified Poisson equation is tested here for the existence of triaxial equilibrium solutions. Using the non-negative least square method, we show that self-consistent triaxial galaxies exist for baryonic models with a mild density cusp $\rho \sim {\Sigma \over r}$. Self-consistency is achieved for a wide range of central concentrations, $\Sigma \sim 10-1000\mathrm{M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, representing low-to-high surface brightness galaxies. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the orbit superposition technique is fruitful for constructing galaxy models beyond Newtonian gravity, and triaxial cuspy galaxies might exist without the help of Cold dark Matter.
