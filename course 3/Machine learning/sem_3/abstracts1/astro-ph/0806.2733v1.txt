We discuss nucleosynthesis results obtained following the recent suggestion that extramixing phenomena in red giants might be driven by magnetic buoyancy. We explore for this model the production of the short-lived radioactive isotope $^{26}$Al and of stable light nuclei, considering both the case of the general buoyancy of flux tubes and that of the intermittent release of magnetized unstable structures. We show that abundant $^{26}$Al can be produced, up to, and above, the highest levels measured in presolar grains. This level would be also sufficient to explain the early solar system $^{26}$Al as coming from a nearby AGB star of low mass. The case of fast-moving instabilities is the most efficient, reaching almost the same effectiveness as hot bottom burning (HBB).
