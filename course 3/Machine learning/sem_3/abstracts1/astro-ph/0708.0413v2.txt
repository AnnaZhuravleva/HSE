During a 200 ks observation with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer, we detected 16 type-I X-ray bursts from GS 1826-24. We combined the burst spectra in an attempt to measure the gravitational redshifts from the surface of the neutron star. We divided the composite GS 1826-24 burst spectrum into three groups based on the blackbody temperature during the bursts. The spectra do not show any obvious discrete absorption lines. We compare our observations with those of EXO 0748-676.
