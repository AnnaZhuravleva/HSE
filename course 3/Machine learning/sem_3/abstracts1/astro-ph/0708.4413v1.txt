IC 4406 is a large (about 100'' x 30'') southern bipolar planetary nebula, composed by two elongated lobes, extending from a bright central region, where there is evidence for the presence of a large torus of gas and dust. In this poster we show new observations of this source performed with IRAC (Spitzer Space Telescope) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Although the possibility for faint extended emission to be missing in the radio maps cannot be ruled out, flux from the ionized gas appears to be concentrated in the bright central region. Comparing ATCA to IRAC images, it seems that, like in other planetary nebulae, ionized and neutral components spatially co-exist in IC 4406.
