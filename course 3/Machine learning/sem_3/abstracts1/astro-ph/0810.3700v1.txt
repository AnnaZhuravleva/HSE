Using a sample of 21 damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) and 35 sub-DLAs, we evaluate the D-index = EW / Delta v x 1000 from high resolution spectra of the MgII lambda 2796 profile. This sample represents an increase in sub-DLA D-index statistics by a factor of four over the sample used by Ellison (2006). We investigate various techniques to define the velocity spread (Delta v) of the MgII line to determine an optimal D-index for the identification of DLAs. The success rate of DLA identification is 50 -- 55%, depending on the velocity limits used, improving by a few percent when the column density of FeII is included in the D-index calculation. We recommend the set of parameters that is judged to be most robust, have a combination of high DLA identification rate (57%) and low DLA miss rate (6%) and most cleanly separate the DLAs and sub-DLAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability 0.5%). These statistics demonstrate that the D-index is the most efficient technique for selecting low redshift DLA candidates: 65% more efficient than selecting DLAs based on the equivalent widths of MgII and FeII alone. We also investigate the effect of resolution on determining the N(HI) of sub-DLAs. We convolve echelle spectra of sub-DLA Lya profiles with Gaussians typical of the spectral resolution of instruments on the Hubble Space Telescope and compare the best fit N(HI) values at both resolutions. We find that the fitted HI column density is systematically over-estimated by ~ 0.1 dex in the moderate resolution spectra compared to the best fits to the original echelle spectra. This offset is due to blending of nearby Lya clouds that are included in the damping wing fit at low resolution.
