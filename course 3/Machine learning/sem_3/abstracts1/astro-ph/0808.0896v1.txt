We present an observational study about the effects of the interactions in the kinematics, stellar population and abundances of the components of the galaxy pair AM2306-721. Rotation curves for the main and companion galaxies were obtained, showing a deprojected velocity amplitude of 175 km/s and 185 km/s, respectively. The interaction between the main and companion galaxies was modeled using numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, with the result indicating that the current stage of the merger would be about 250 Myr after perigalacticum. The spatial variation in the distribution of the stellar population components in both galaxies was analysed by fitting combinations of stellar population models of different age groups. The central region of main galaxy is dominated by an old (5-10 Gyr) population, while significant contributions from a young (200 Myr) and intermediate (1 Gyr) components are found in the disk, being enhanced in the direction of the tidal features. The stellar population of the companion galaxy is overall much younger, being dominated by components with 1 Gyr or less, quite widely spread over the whole disk. Spatial profiles of the oxygen abundance were obtained from the a grid of photoionization models using the R23 line ratio. The disk of the main galaxy shows a clear radial gradient, while the companion galaxy presents an oxygen abundance relatively homogeneous across the disk. The absence of an abundance gradient in the secondary galaxy is interpreted in terms of mixing by gas flows from the outer parts to the center of the galaxy due to the gravitational interaction with the more massive primary.
