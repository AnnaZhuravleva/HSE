This paper presents a prescription for distilling the information contained in the cosmic microwave background radiation from multiple sky maps that also contain both instrument noise and foreground contaminants. The prescription is well-suited for cosmological parameter estimation and accounts for uncertainties in the cosmic microwave background extraction scheme. The technique is computationally viable at low resolution and may be considered a natural and significant generalization of the "Internal Linear Combination" approach to foreground removal. An important potential application is the analysis of the multi-frequency temperature and polarization data from the forthcoming Planck satellite.
