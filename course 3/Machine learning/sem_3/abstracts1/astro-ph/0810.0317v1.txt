In order to elucidate origin of the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission, we analyzed Suzaku data taken at various regions along the Galactic plane and studied their Fe-K emission line features. Suzaku resolved the Fe line complex into three narrow lines at ~6.4 keV,~6.7 keV and ~6.97 keV, which are K-lines from neutral (or low-ionized), He-like, and H-like iron ions, respectively. The 6.7 keV line is clearly seen in all the observed regions and its longitudinal distribution is consistent with that determined from previous observations. The 6.4 keV emission line was also found in various Galactic plane regions (b~0). Differences in flux ratios of the 6.4 keV/6.7 keV and 6.97 keV/6.7 keV lines between the Galactic plane and the Galactic center regions are studied and its implication is discussed.
