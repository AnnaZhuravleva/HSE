Based on the planet-satellite dynamics, a new perspective on the birth and evolution of the Solar System was proposed in 2004. This new perspective has 1:2 Mean Motion Resonance (1:2 MMR, that is Ps/Pj = 2) implicit in itself . This paper has shown that if we assume the sequential birth of the planets with the heaviest, i.e. Jupiter, being born the earliest and this axiom is central to the new perspective then there is an unique initial condition for which 1:2 MMR crossing occurs exactly 300My after the birth of Jupiter. It is shown that 25 My time gap between the birth of Jupiter and Saturn results in the 300 My time delay in the occurrence of 1:2 MMR. Because the process by which Late Heavy Bombardment is triggered involves the movement of Neptune over enormous distances hence almost 200 My time delay occurs between 1:2MMR crossing and the actual spike in the Meteoritic Shower on all the terrestrial planets as evidenced by the petrology record on the Moon. The analytical derivation of the time delay in the spike is a vindication of this new perspective of the application of planet-satellite dynamics to the birth and evolution of Solar Systems.
