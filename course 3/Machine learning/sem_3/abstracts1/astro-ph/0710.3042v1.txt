We show that future Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray samples should be able to distinguish whether the sources of UHECRs are hosted by galaxy clusters or ordinary galaxies, or whether the sources are uncorrelated with the large-scale structure of the universe. Moreover, this is true independently of arrival direction uncertainty due to magnetic deflection or measurement error. The reason for this is the simple property that the strength of large-scale clustering for extragalactic sources depends on their mass, with more massive objects, such as galaxy clusters, clustering more strongly than lower mass objects, such as ordinary galaxies.
