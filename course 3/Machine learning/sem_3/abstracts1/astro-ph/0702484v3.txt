Recent astronomical observations indicate that our Universe is undergoing a period of an accelerated expansion. While there are many cosmological models, which explain this phenomenon, the main question remains which is the best one in the light of available data. We consider ten cosmological models of the accelerating Universe and select the best one using the Bayesian model comparison method. We demonstrate that the LambdaCDM model is most favored by the Bayesian statistical analysis of the SNIa, CMB, BAO and H(z) data.
