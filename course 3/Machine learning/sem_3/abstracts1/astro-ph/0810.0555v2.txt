We use measurements of cosmic shear from CFHTLS, combined with WMAP-5 cosmic microwave background anisotropy data, baryonic acoustic oscillations from SDSS and 2dFGRS and supernovae data from SNLS and Gold-set, to constrain the neutrino mass. We obtain a 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.54 eV for the sum of the neutrino masses, and a lower limit of 0.03 eV. The preference for massive neutrinos vanishes when shear-measurement systematics are included in the analysis.
