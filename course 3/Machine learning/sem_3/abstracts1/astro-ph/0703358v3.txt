The hydrodynamic response of the inviscid small shearing box model of a midplane section of a rotationally supported astrophysical disk is examined. An energy functional ${\cal E}$ is formulated for the general nonlinear problem. It is found that the fate of disturbances is related to the conservation of this quantity which, in turn, depends on the boundary conditions utilized: ${\cal E}$ is conserved for channel boundary conditions while it is not conserved in general for shearing box conditions. Linearized disturbances subject to channel boundary conditions have normal-modes described by Bessel Functions and are qualitatively governed by a quantity $\Sigma$ which is a measure of the ratio between the azimuthal and vertical wavelengths. Inertial oscillations ensue if $\Sigma >1$ - otherwise disturbances must in general be treated as an initial value problem. We reflect upon these results and offer a speculation.
