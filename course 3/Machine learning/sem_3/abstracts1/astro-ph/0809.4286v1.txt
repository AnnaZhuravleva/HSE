Our recent discoveries of magnetic fields in a small number of Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars, the evolutionary progenitors of main sequence A/B stars, raise new questions about the origin of magnetic fields in the intermediate mass stars. The favoured fossil field hypothesis suggests that a few percent of magnetic pre-main sequence A/B stars should exhibit similar magnetic strengths and topologies to the magnetic Ap/Bp stars. In this talk I will present the methods that we have used to characterise the magnetic fields of the Herbig Ae/Be stars, as well as our first conclusions on the origin of magnetism in intermediate-mass stars.
