This paper presents morphological type, membership, and U-V color for a sample of galaxies in the Coma cluster direction, complete down to M_B=-15.00 mag and extending down to M_B=-14.25 mag. We have examined 1155 objects from the GMP 1983 catalog on B and V images of the CFH12K camera, and obtained the Hubble type in most cases. Coma cluster membership for 473 galaxies was derived using morphology, apparent size, and surface brightness, and, afterward, redshift. The comparison among morphology- and redshift- memberships and among luminosity functions derived from this morphologically-selected sample, or by using statistical members or spectroscopic members, all show that the morphological membership provided here can be trusted. For the first time, the morphological classification of Coma galaxies reaches magnitudes that are faint enough to observe the whole magnitude range of the giant types, E, S0, and spiral stages. The data presented in this paper makes our sample the richest environment where membership and morphology for complete samples down to faint magnitudes M_B~-15 mag are available, thereby enlarging the baseline of environmental studies.
