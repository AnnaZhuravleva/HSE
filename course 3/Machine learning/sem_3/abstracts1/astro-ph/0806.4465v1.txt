We present stellar metallicities derived from Ca II triplet spectroscopy in over 350 red giant branch stars in 13 fields distributed in different positions in the SMC, ranging from $\sim$1\arcdeg\@ to $\sim$4\arcdeg\@ from its center. In the innermost fields the average metallicity is [Fe/H] $\sim -1$. This value decreases when we move away towards outermost regions. This is the first detection of a metallicity gradient in this galaxy. We show that the metallicity gradient is related to an age gradient, in the sense that more metal-rich stars, which are also younger, are concentrated in the central regions of the galaxy.
