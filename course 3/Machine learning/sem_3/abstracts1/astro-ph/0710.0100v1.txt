We estimate the limiting angular resolution and detection area for an array of 3 large-aperture Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. We consider an idealized IACT system in order to understand the limitations imposed by the intrinsic nature of the atmospheric showers and geometry of the detector configuration. The idealization includes the assumptions of a perfect optical system and the absence of the night sky background with the goal of finding the optimum camera geometry and array configuration independent of detailed assumptions about the telescope design.   The showers are simulated using the ALTAI code for the altitude of 2700 m corresponding to one of possible future sites for a new northern-hemisphere array. The optimal design depends on the target energy range; for each energy we vary both the cell length (telescope spacing) and the image processing parameters in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. We then present the resulting values of the detection area and the angular resolution for this energy dependent optimization. We discuss the dependence of these quantities on the field of view of the telescopes and pixel size of the camera.
