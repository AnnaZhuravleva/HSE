We showed that the part of strings could be detected by optical method is only 20% from the total available amount of such objects, therefore the gravitational lensing method has to be "completed" by CMB one. We found the general structure of the CMB anisotropy generated by a cosmic string for simple model of straight string moving with constant velocity. For strings with deficit angle 1-2 arcsec the amplitude of generated anisotropy has to be 15-30 muK (the corresponding string linear density is (G mu) ~ 10^{-7} and energy is GUT one, 10^{15} GeV). To use both radio and optical methods the deficit angle has to be from 0.1 arcsec to 5-6 arcsec. If cosmic string can be detected by optical method, the length of corresponding brightness spot of anisotropy has to be no less than 100 degrees.
