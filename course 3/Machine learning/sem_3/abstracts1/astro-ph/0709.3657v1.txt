The VERITAS collaboration has observed the high-frequency-peaked BL Lac object 1ES 1218+304 using an array of several imaging Cherenkov telescopes located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Southern Arizona. A gamma-ray signal was detected with high significance for the observations taken during several months in the 2006-2007 observing season. Here we present the detection of 1ES 1218+304 in very-high-energy gamma rays.
