The Spitzer high resolution spectra of 72 Seyfert galaxies from the 12$\mu$m Galaxy Sample are presented and discussed. The presence of starburst components in these galaxies can be quantified by powerful mid-IR diagnostics tools (i.e. 11.25$\mu$m PAH feature equivalent width and the H$_2$ emission line intensity), as well as the AGN dominance can be measured by specific fine structure line ratios (e.g. [NeV]/[NeII], [NeV]/[SiII], etc.). The two types of Seyfert galaxies do not show any statistical difference in our diagnostic tools. However, the Seyfert 2's showing hidden Broad Line Regions in spectro-polarimetric observations have on average an higher AGN dominance, a weaker star formation component and a warmer [60 - 25] spectral index than those without broad emission lines.
