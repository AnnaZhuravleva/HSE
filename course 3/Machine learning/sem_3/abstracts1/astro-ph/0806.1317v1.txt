An overview is given of the properties of the various kinds of quasi-periodic luminosity modulations observed in cataclysmic variables (CVs). The two principal types, known in the CV literature as dwarf nova oscillations and quasi-periodic oscillations, have similarities to the high and low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in X-Ray binaries. There is a further well observed class known as longer period dwarf nova oscillations. In CVs the observed interrelations between these oscillations suggests a model of magnetically controlled accretion onto a rapidly rotating equatorial belt of accreted gas. Non-radial oscillations of the central white dwarf are observed in some systems.
