Context: Reconnaissance of feasibility of detection of interstellar neutral D by the forthcoming NASA SMEX mission IBEX. Aims: To investigate by numerical simulations the absolute density and flux at Earth orbit of neutral interstellar D and to check its detectability by IBEX. Methods: The simulations were performed with the use of the Warsaw 3D time-dependent test-particle model of neutral interstellar gas in the inner heliosphere, specially adapted to the case of D, and of the state-of-the-art models of the ionization field and radiation pressure. The modeling returned density, bulk velocity, and flux of interstellar D along at the Earth locations during the solar cycle. Particular attention was paid to the time interval corresponding to the planned operations of IBEX. Results: Simulations predict a large enhancement of D abundance at Earth orbit with respect to the abundance at the termination shock. The energy of the D atoms at IBEX will be within the energetic sensitivity band of its Lo instrument except a short time interval between September and November each year. Because of the specific observing geometry of IBEX, there will be one opportunity each year to search for I/S D, when Earth is near ecliptic longitude 136 deg, i.e. in February. Assuming the TS abundance of D identical as in the Local Cloud equal to 1.56E-5, and the density of H at TS 0.11/cm2/s one obtains the expected relative flux about 0.015/cm2/s, which corresponds to the local absolute flux about 0.007/cm2/s. The dependence of the expected flux on the phase of solar cycle is relatively weak. The flux scales proportionally to the density of deuterium at the termination shock and depends only weakly on the bulk velocity and temperature of the gas in this region.
