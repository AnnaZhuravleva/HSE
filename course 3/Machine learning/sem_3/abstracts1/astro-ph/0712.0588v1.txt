In the last decade, the study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data has become one of the most powerful tools to study and understand the Universe. More precisely, measuring the CMB power spectrum leads to the estimation of most cosmological parameters. Nevertheless, accessing such precious physical information requires extracting several different astrophysical components from the data. Recovering those astrophysical sources (CMB, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich clusters, galactic dust) thus amounts to a component separation problem which has already led to an intense activity in the field of CMB studies. In this paper, we introduce a new sparsity-based component separation method coined Generalized Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA). The GMCA approach is formulated in a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. Numerical results show that this new source recovery technique performs well compared to state-of-the-art component separation methods already applied to CMB data.
