The dynamical friction force experienced by a body moving at relativistic speed in a gaseous medium is examined. This force, which arises due to the gravitational interaction of the body with its own gravitationally-induced wake, is calculated for straight-line and circular motion, generalizing previous results by several authors. Possible applications to the study of extreme mass-ratio inspirals around strongly-accreting supermassive black holes are suggested.
