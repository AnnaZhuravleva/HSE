We have investigated multiband optical photometric variability and stability of the H$\alpha$ line profile of the transient X-ray binary IGR J01583+6713. We set an upper limit of 0.05 mag on photometric variations in the {\it V} band over a time scale of 3 months. The H$\alpha$ line is found to consist of non-Gaussian profile and quite stable for a duration of 2 months. We have identified the spectral type of the companion star to be B2 IVe while distance to the source is estimated to be $\sim$ 4.0 kpc. Along with the optical observations, we have also carried out analysis of X-ray data from three short observations of the source, two with the {\it Swift}--XRT and one with the {\it RXTE}--PCA. We have detected a variation in the absorption column density, from a value of 22.0 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ immediately after the outburst down to 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ four months afterwards. In the quiescent state, the X-ray absorption is consistent with the optical reddening measurement of E(B - V) = 1.46 mag. From one of the {\it Swift} observations, during which the X-ray intensity was higher, we have a possible pulse detection with a period of 469.2 s. For a Be X-ray binary, this indicates an orbital period in the range of 216--561 days for this binary system.
