We show that as many as ~50 quasars with at least mJy-level expected flux density can be pre-selected as potential in-beam phase-reference targets for ASTRO-G. Most of them have never been imaged with VLBI. These sources are located around strong, compact calibrator sources that have correlated flux density >100 mJy on the longest VLBA baselines at 8.4 GHz. All the targets lie within 12' from the respective reference source. The basis of this selection is an efficient method to identify potential weak VLBI target quasars simply using optical and low-resolution radio catalogue data. The sample of these dominantly weak sources offers a good opportunity for a statistical study of their radio structure with unprecedented angular resolution at 8.4 GHz.
