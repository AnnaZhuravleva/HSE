We examine the relationship between the frequency of close companions (stellar and planetary companions with orbital periods < 5 years) and the metallicity of their Sun-like (~ FGK) hosts. We confirm and quantify a ~4 sigma positive correlation between host metallicity and planetary companions. We find little or no dependence on spectral type or distance in this correlation. In contrast to the metallicity dependence of planetary companions, stellar companions tend to be more abundant around low metallicity hosts. At the ~2 sigma level we find an anti-correlation between host metallicity and the presence of a stellar companion. Upon dividing our sample into FG and K sub-samples, we find a negligible anti-correlation in the FG sub-sample and a 3 sigma anti-correlation in the K sub-sample. A kinematic analysis suggests that this anti-correlation is produced by a combination of low-metallicity, high-binarity thick disk stars and higher-metallicity, lower-binarity thin disk stars.
