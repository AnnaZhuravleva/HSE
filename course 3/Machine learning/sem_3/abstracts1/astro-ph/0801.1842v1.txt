We present mid-infrared spectra of thirty two high redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies, selected via the stellar photospheric feature at rest-frame 1.6um, and an observed-frame 24um flux of >500muJy. Nearly all the sample reside in a redshift range of <z>=1.71+/-0.15, and have rest-frame 1-1000um luminosities of 10^12.9 - 10^13.8 Lsun. Most of the spectra exhibit prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, and weak silicate absorption, consistent with a starburst origin for the IR emission. Our selection method appears to be a straightforward and efficient way of finding distant, IR-luminous, star-forming galaxies in narrow redshift ranges. There is however evidence that the mid-IR spectra of our sample differ systematically from those of local ULIRGs; our sample have comparable PAH equivalent widths but weaker apparent silicate absorption, and (possibly) enhanced PAH 6.2um/7.7um and 6.2um/11.2um flux ratios. Furthermore, the composite mid-IR spectrum of our sample is almost identical to that of local starbursts with IR luminosities of 10^10-10^11 Lsun rather than that of local ULIRGs. These differences are consistent with a reduced dust column, which can plausibly be obtained via some combination of (1) star formation that is extended over spatial scales of 1-4Kpc, and (2) star formation in unusually gas-rich regions.
