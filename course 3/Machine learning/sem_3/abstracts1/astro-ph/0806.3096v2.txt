The CMB's B-mode polarization provides a handle on several cosmological parameters most notably the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and is sensitive to parameters which govern the growth of large scale structure (LSS) and evolution of the gravitational potential. The primordial gravitational-wave- and secondary lensing-induced B-mode signals are very weak and therefore prone to various foregrounds and systematics. In this work we use Fisher-matrix-based estimations and apply, for the first time, Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations to determine the effect of beam systematics on the inferred cosmological parameters from five upcoming experiments: PLANCK, POLARBEAR, SPIDER, QUIET+CLOVER and CMBPOL. We consider beam systematics which couple the beam substructure to the gradient of temperature anisotropy and polarization (differential beamwidth, pointing and ellipticity) and beam systematics due to differential beam normalization (differential gain) and orientation (beam rotation) of the polarization-sensitive axes (the latter two effects are insensitive to the beam substructure). We determine allowable levels of beam systematics for given tolerances on the induced parameter errors and check for possible biases in the inferred parameters concomitant with potential increases in the statistical uncertainty. All our results are scaled to the 'worst case scenario'. In this case and for our tolerance levels, the beam rotation should not exceed the few-degree to sub-degree level, typical ellipticity is required to be 1% level, the differential gain allowed level is a few parts in $10^{3}$ to $10^{4}$, differential beamwidth upper limits are of the sub-percent level and differential pointing should not exceed the few- to sub-arcsec level.
