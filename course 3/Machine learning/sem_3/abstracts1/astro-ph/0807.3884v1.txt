We describe methods applied to the final photometric reductions and calibrations to the standard system of the images collected during the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment survey - OGLE-III. Astrometric reduction methods are also presented.   The OGLE-III data constitute a unique data set covering the Magellanic Clouds, Galactic bulge and Galactic disk fields monitored regularly every clear night since 2001 and being significant extension and continuation of the earlier OGLE observations. With the earlier OGLE-II and OGLE-I photometry some of the observed fields have now 16-year long photometric coverage.
