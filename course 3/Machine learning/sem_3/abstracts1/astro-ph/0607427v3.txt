Second generation high energy neutrino telescopes are being built to reach sensitivities of neutrino emission from galactic and extragalactic sources. Current neutrino detectors are already able to set limits which are in the range of some emission models. In particular, the Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detection Array (AMANDA) has recently presented the so far most restrictive limit on diffuse neutrino emission (Achterberg et al. 2007). Stacking limits which apply to AGN point source classes rather than to single point sources (Achterberg et al. (IceCube Collab.) & P. L. Biermann 2006) are given as well. In this paper, the two different types of limits will be used to draw conclusions about different emission models. An interpretation of stacking limits as diffuse limits to the emission from considered point source class is presented. The limits can for instance be used to constrain the predicted correlation of EGRET-detected diffuse emission and neutrino emission. Also, the correlation between X-ray and neutrino emission is constrained. Further results for source classes like TeV blazars and FR-II galaxies are presented. Starting from the source catalogs so-far examined for the stacking method, we discuss further potential catalogs and examine the possibilities of the second generation telescopes IceCube and KM3NeT by comparing catalogs with respect to northern and southern hemisphere total flux.
