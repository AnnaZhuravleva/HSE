Recent coordinated power-spectrum analyses of radiochemical solar neutrino data and the solar irradiance have revealed a highly significant, high-Q common modulation at 11.85 yr-1. Since the stability of this frequency points to an explanation in terms of rotation, this result may be attributable to non-spherically-symmetric nuclear burning in a solar core with sidereal rotation frequency 12.85 yr-1. The variability of the amplitude (on a timescale of years) suggests that the relevant nuclear burning is variable as well as asymmetric. Recent analysis of Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino data has revealed r-mode-type modulations with frequencies corresponding to a region with sidereal rotation frequency 13.97 yr-1. If this modulation is attributed to the RSFP (Resonant Spin Flavor Precession) process, it provides a measurement of the rotation rate deep in the radiative zone. These two results suggest that the core rotates significantly more slowly than the radiative zone. If one accepts an upper limit of 7 MG for the Sun's internal magnetic field, an RSFP interpretation of the Super-Kamiokande results leads to a lower limit of 10-12 Bohr magnetons for the neutrino transition magnetic moment.
