In this article we study the morphology, kinematics and ionization properties of the giant ionized gas nebulae surrounding two high redshift radio galaxies, 4C40.36 (z=2.27) and 4C48.48 (z=2.34).}{Integral Field Spectroscopy observations were taken using the PPAK bundle of the PMAS spectrograph, mounted on the 3.5m on the Calar Alto Observatory, in order to cover a field-of-view of 64" X 72" centered in each radio galaxy. The observations spanned over 5 nights, using two different spectral resolutions (with FWHM~4 AA and ~8 AA respectively), covering the optical wavelength range from ~3700 AA to ~7100 AA, which corresponds to the rest-frame ultraviolet range from ~1100 AA to ~2000 AA >. Various emission lines are detected within this wavelength range, including Lyalpha (1216 AA), NV (1240 AA), CIV (1549 AA), HeII (1640 AA), OIII] (1663 AA) and CIII] (1909\AA). The dataset was used to derive the spatial distribution of the flux intensity of each of these lines and the gas kinematics. The properties of the emission lines in the nuclear regions were studied in detail.In agreement with previous studies, we find that both objects are embedded in a large ionized gas nebula, where Ly alpha emission is extended across ~100 kpc or more. The CIV and HeII emission lines are also spatially extended. The nebulae are generally aligned with the radio axis, although we detect emission far from it. In 4C+48.48, there is a band of low Ly-alpha/CIV running perpendicular to the radio axis, at the location of the active nucleus. This feature might be the observational signature of an edge-on disk of neutral gas. The kinematics of both nebulae are inconsistent with stable rotation, although they are not inconsistent with infall or outflow.
