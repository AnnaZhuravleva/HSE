We report on the first results of a search for H2 emission from protoplanetary disks using CRIRES, ESO's new VLT high resolution NIR spectrograph. We observed the CTTS LkHa 264 and the debris disk 49 Cet, and searched for the 1-0 S(1), 1-0 S(0) and 2-1 S(1) H2 emission lines. The H2 line at 2.1218 micron is detected in LkHa 264. Our CRIRES spectra reveal the previously observed but not detected H2 line at 2.2233 micron in LkHa 264. An upper limit on the 2-1 S(1) H2 line flux in LkHalpha 264 is derived. These observations are the first simultaneous detection of 1-0 S(1) and 1-0 S(0) H2 emission from a protoplanetary disk. 49 Cet does not exhibit H2 emission in any of the three observed lines. There are a few lunar masses of optically thin hot H2 in the inner disk (~0.1 AU) of LkHa 264, and less than a tenth of a lunar mass of hot H2 in the inner disk of 49 Cet. The measured 1-0 S(0)/1-0 S(1) and 2-1 S(1)/1-0 S(1) line ratios in LkHa 264 indicate that the H2 emitting gas is at T<1500 K and that the H2 is most likely thermally excited by UV photons. Modeling of the shape of the line suggests that the disk should be seen close to face-on (i<35). A comparative analysis of the physical properties of CTTS in which the H2 1-0 S(1) line has been detected and non-detected indicates that the presence of H2 emission is correlated with the magnitude of the UV excess and the strength of the Halpha line. The lack of H2 emission in the NIR spectra of 49 Cet and the absence of Halpha emission suggest that the gas in the inner disk of 49 Cet has dissipated. The disk surrounding 49 Cet should have an inner hole.
