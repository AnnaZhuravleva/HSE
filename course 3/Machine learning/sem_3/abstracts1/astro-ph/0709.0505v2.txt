The Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex has produced in Lynds 1688 the richest known embedded cluster within ~300 pc of the Sun. Unfortunately, distance estimates to the Oph complex vary by nearly ~40% (~120-165 pc). Here I calculate a new independent distance estimate of 135 +- 8 pc to this benchmark star-forming region based on Hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes to stars illuminating reflection nebulosity in close proximity to Lynds 1688. Combining this value with recent distance estimates from reddening studies suggests a consensus distance of 139 +- 6 pc (4% error), situating it within ~11 pc of the centroid of the ~5 Myr old Upper Sco OB subgroup of Sco OB2 (145 pc). The velocity vectors for Oph and Upper Sco are statistically indistinguishable within ~1 km/s in each vector component. Both Oph and Upper Sco have negligible motion (<1 km/s) in the Galactic vertical direction with respect to the Local Standard of Rest, which is inconsistent with the young stellar groups having formed via the high velocity cloud impact scenario.
