We find that UGC 7069 is the largest ring galaxy known to date. In this Letter, we present a multiwavelength study of this galaxy (combining radio, 2MASS, optical and ultraviolet data). The ring of UGC 7069, whose diameter measures ~115 kpc, is also warped at its edges. The nucleus appears double-peaked and hosts a possible LINER. The ultraviolet data indicate a strong blue colour and suggest that UGC 7069 is a starburst galaxy. We also present N-body simulation results, which indicate that galaxy collisions can produce such huge rings. Large inclination angles between the target and the intruder galaxy may account for the formation of warped rings. Multiwavelength observations are highly essential to constrain our simulation results, which will address the formation and evolution of such a rare galaxy.
