We report the first Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 43 GHz v=1, J=1-0 SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of the M-type semi-regular supergiant variable star AH Sco at 2 epochs separated by 12 days in March 2004. These high-resolution VLBA images reveal that the distribution of SiO masers is roughly on a persistent elliptical ring with the lengths of the major and minor axes of about 18.5 and 15.8 mas, respectively, along a position angle of 150^{\circ}. And the red-shifted masers are found to be slightly closer to the central star than the blue-shifted masers. The line-of-sight velocity structure of the SiO masers shows that with respect to the systemic velocity of -6.8 km/s the higher velocity features are closer to the star, which can be well explained by the simple outflow or infall without rotation kinematics of SiO masers around AH Sco. Study of proper motions of 59 matched features between two epochs clearly indicates that the SiO maser shell around AH Sco was undergoing an overall contraction to the star at a velocity of ~13 km/s at a distance of 2.26 kpc to AH Sco. Our 3-dimensional maser kinematics model further suggests that such an inward motion is very likely due to the gravitation of the central star. The distance to AH Sco of 2.26$\pm$0.19 kpc obtained from the 3-dimensional kinematics model fitting is consistent with its kinematic distance of 2.0 kpc.
