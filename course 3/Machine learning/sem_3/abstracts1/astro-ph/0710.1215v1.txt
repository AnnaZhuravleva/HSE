We perform a timing analysis on RXTE data of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1751-305 observed during the April 2002 outburst. After having corrected for Doppler effects on the pulse phases due to the orbital motion of the source, we performed a timing analysis on the phase delays, which gives, for the first time for this source, an estimate of the average spin frequency derivative <nu_dot> = (3.7 +/- 1.0)E-13 Hz/s. We discuss the torque resulting from the spin-up of the neutron star deriving a dynamical estimate of the mass accretion rate and comparing it with the one obtained from X-ray flux. Constraints on the distance to the source are discussed, leading to a lower limit of \sim 6.7 kpc.
