We present observations of a rare, rapid, high amplitude Extreme Scattering Event toward the compact BL-Lac AO 0235+164 at 6.65 GHz. The ESE cloud is compact; we estimate its diameter between 0.09 and 0.9 AU, and is at a distance of less than 3.6 kpc. Limits on the angular extent of the ESE cloud imply a minimum cloud electron density of ~ 4 x 10^3 cm^-3. Based on the amplitude and timescale of the ESE observed here, we suggest that at least one of the transients reported by Bower et al. (2007) may be attributed to ESEs.
