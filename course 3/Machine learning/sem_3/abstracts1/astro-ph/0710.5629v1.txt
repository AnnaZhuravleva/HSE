The specifications of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) have placed stringent requirements on the mechanical performance of its antennas. As part of the evaluation process of the VertexRSI and Alcatel EIE Consortium (AEC) ALMA prototype antennas, measurements of the path length, thermal, and azimuth bearing performance were made under a variety of weather conditions and observing modes. The results of mechanical measurements, reported here, are compared to the antenna specifications.
