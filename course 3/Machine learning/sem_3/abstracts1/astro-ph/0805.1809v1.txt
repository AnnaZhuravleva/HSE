Although only 22 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are currently known to exist in the globular cluster (GC) 47 Tucanae, this cluster may harbor 30-60 MSPs, or even up to ~200. In this Letter, we model the pulsed curvature radiation (CR) gamma-ray flux expected from a population of MSPs in 47 Tucanae. These MSPs produce gamma-rays in their magnetospheres via accelerated electron primaries which are moving along curved magnetic field lines. A GC like 47 Tucanae containing a large number of MSPs provides the opportunity to study a randomized set of pulsar geometries. Geometry-averaged spectra make the testing of the underlying pulsar model more reliable, since in this case the relative flux uncertainty is reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the variation expected for individual pulsars (if the number of visible pulsars N=100). Our predicted spectra violate the EGRET upper limit at 1 GeV, constraining the product of the number of visible pulsars N and the average integral flux above 1 GeV per pulsar. GLAST/LAT should place even more stringent constraints on this product, and may also limit the maximum average accelerating potential by probing the CR spectral tail. For N=22-200, a GLAST/LAT non-detection will lead to the constraints that the average integral flux per pulsar should be lower by factors 0.03-0.003 than current model predictions.
