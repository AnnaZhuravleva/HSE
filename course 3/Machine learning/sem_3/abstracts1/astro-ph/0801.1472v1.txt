We report on our attempts to achieve a nearly steady-state gas flow in hydrodynamical simulations of doubly barred galaxies. After exploring the parameter space, we construct two models, for which we evaluate the photometric and the kinematic integrals, present in the Tremaine-Weinberg method, in search of observational signatures of two rotating patterns. We show that such signatures are often present, but a direct fit to data points is likely to return incorrect pattern speeds. However, for a particular distribution of the tracer, presented here, the values of the pattern speeds can be retrieved reliably even with the direct fit.
