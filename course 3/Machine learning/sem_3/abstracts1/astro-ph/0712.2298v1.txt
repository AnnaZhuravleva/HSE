The main objective of the Penn State/Torun Centre for Astronomy Search for Planets around Evolved Stars is the detection of planetary systems around massive, evolved stars. We are also interested in the evolution of these systems on stellar evolution timescales. In this paper we present our approach to determine the basic physical parameters of our targets GK-giants. We also discuss the stellar activity indicators used in our survey: line bisector and curvature, and Halpha variability.
