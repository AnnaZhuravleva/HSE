(Shortened) The Swift and HETE-2 discovery of an afterglow associated possibly with short GRBs opened the new problematic of their nature and classification. This has been further enhanced by the GRB060614 observation and by a re-analysis of the BATSE catalog leading to the identification of a new GRB class with "an occasional softer extended emission lasting tenths of seconds after an initial spikelike emission". We plan: a) to fit this new class of "hybrid" sources within our "canonical GRB" scenario, where all GRBs are generated by a "common engine" (i.e. the gravitational collapse to a black hole); b) to propose GRB970228 as the prototype of the such a class. We analyze BeppoSAX data on GRB970228 in the 40-700 keV and 2-26 keV energy bands within the "fireshell" model. We find that GRB970228 is a "canonical GRB", like e.g. GRB050315, with the main peculiarity of a particularly low CircumBurst Medium (CBM) average density n_{cbm}~10^{-3} #/cm^3. We also simulate the light curve corresponding to a rescaled CBM density profile with n_{cbm}=1 #/cm^3. From such a comparison it follows that the total time-integrated luminosity is a faithful indicator of the GRB nature, contrary to the peak luminosity which is merely a function of the CBM density. We call attention on discriminating the short GRBs between the "genuine" and the "fake" ones. The "genuine" ones are intrinsically short, with baryon loading B \la 10^{-5}, as stated in our original classification. The "fake" ones, characterized by an initial spikelike emission followed by an extended emission lasting tenths of seconds, have a baryon loading 10^{-4} \la B \leq 10^{-2}. They are observed as such only due to an underdense CBM consistent with a galactic halo environment which deflates the afterglow intensity.
