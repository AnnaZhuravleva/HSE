Optical-electric technology can measure the tangential position and velocity of spacecraft. To know the feasibility of the use of optical-electric technology, it is necessary to estimate the magnitude of spacecraft first. Since the spacecrafts are non-self-illumination objects, the estimation formulas of the optical magnitude of spacecraft is constructed according to the radiation theory and the extra-atmospheric radiant emittance of the Sun in the visible light wave band. Taking Chang'e-1 as an example, the magnitude of it in different situations is calculated.
