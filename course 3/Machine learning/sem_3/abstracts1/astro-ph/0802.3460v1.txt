In this paper, we show that method of mode identification using combined multicolour photometry and spectroscopy can be successfully applied to the pulsating subdwarf B star Balloon 090100001. The method constrains the spherical degree, l.We confirm that the dominant mode is radial and we show that for some other modes the method provides values of l consistent with the observed rotationally split triplet. Moreover, we derive a radius variation of 1.7 per cent for the dominant mode. The identification opens the possibility for constraining the internal structure of the star by means of seismic methods.
