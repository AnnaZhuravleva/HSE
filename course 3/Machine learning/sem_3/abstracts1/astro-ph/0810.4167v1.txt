In this review we address the progress that has been made toward the understanding the population of Magellanic Cloud planetary nebulae since the last Magellanic Cloud Symposium. Planetary nebulae in the Clouds are not only important as key probes of stellar and ISM evolution in these galaxies, but also reflect the evolution of AGB stars and beyond in low-metallicity environments. We present the recent surveys results, including the wide fields ground-based search for PNe, the {\it HST} study of the resolves ejecta and their central stars, and the {\it Spitzer} analysis of the gas contents of these ejecta. Finally, we show how Magellanic Cloud PNe can be used to constraint the distance scale of galactic PNe.
