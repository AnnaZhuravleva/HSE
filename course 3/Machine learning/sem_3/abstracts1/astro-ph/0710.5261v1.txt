I outline a mechanism, akin to Weibel instabilities of interpenetrating beams, in which the neighboring current sheets in a striped wind from an oblique rotator interact through a two stream-like mechanism (a Weibel instability in flatland), to create an anomalous resistivity that heats the sheets and causes the magnetic field to diffusively annihilate in the wind upstream of the termination shock. The heating has consequences for observable unpulsed emission from pulsars.
