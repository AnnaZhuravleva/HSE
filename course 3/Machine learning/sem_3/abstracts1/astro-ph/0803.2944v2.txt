Quite recently, some new mathematical approaches to black holes have appeared in the literature. They do not rely on the classical concept of event horizon -- which is very global, but on the local concept of hypersurfaces foliated by trapped surfaces. After a brief introduction to these new horizons, we focus on a viscous fluid analogy that can be developed to describe their dynamics, in a fashion similar to the membrane paradigm introduced for event horizons in the seventies, but with a significant change of sign of the bulk viscosity.
