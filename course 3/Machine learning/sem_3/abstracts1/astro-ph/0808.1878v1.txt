The NuMoon project uses the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to search for short radio pulses from the Moon. These pulses are created when an ultra high energy cosmic ray or neutrino initiates a particle cascade inside the Moon's regolith. The cascade has a negative charge excess and moves faster than the local speed of light, which causes coherent Cherenkov radiation to be emitted. With 100 hours of data, a limit on the neutrino flux can be set that is an order of magnitude better than the current one (based on FORTE). We present an analysis of the first 10 hours of data.
