We aim at studying the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk and their dependence upon several parameters: a threshold in the surface gas density regulating star formation, the star formation efficiency, the timescale for the formation of the thin disk and the total surface mass density of the stellar halo. We test a model which considers a cosmological infall law. This law does not predict an inside-out disk formation, but it allows to well fit the properties of the solar vicinity. We study several cases. We find that to reproduce at the same time the abundance, star formation rate and surface gas density gradients along the Galactic disk it is necessary to assume an inside-out formation for the disk. The threshold in the gas density is not necessary and the same effect could be reached by assuming a variable star formation efficiency. A cosmologically derived infall law with an inside-out process for the disk formation and a variable star formation efficiency can indeed well reproduce all the properties of the disk. However, the cosmological model presented here does not have sufficient resolution to capture the requested inside-out formation for the disk.
