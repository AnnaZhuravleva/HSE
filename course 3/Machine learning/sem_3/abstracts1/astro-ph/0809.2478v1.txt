We present dynamical simulations of NGC 2523 and NGC 4245, two barred galaxies (types SB(r)b and SB(r)0/a, respectively) with prominent inner rings. Our goal is to estimate the bar pattern speeds in these galaxies by matching a sticky-particle simulation to the $B$-band morphology, using near-infrared $K_s$-band images to define the gravitational potentials. We compare the pattern speeds derived by this method with those derived in our previous paper using the well-known Tremaine-Weinberg continuity equation method. The inner rings in these galaxies, which are likely to be resonance features, help to constrain the dynamical models. We find that both methods give the same pattern speeds within the errors.
