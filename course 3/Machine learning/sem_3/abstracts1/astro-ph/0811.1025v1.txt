The complex relationship between the galaxy density field and the underlying matter field limits our ability to extract cosmological constraints from galaxy redshift surveys. Our approach is to use halos rather than galaxies to trace the underlying mass distribution. We identify Fingers-of-God (FOGs) and replace multiple galaxies in each FOG with a single halo object. This removes the nonlinear contributions of satellite galaxies, the one-halo term. We test our method on a large set of high-fidelity mock SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) catalogs. We find that the aggressive FOG compression algorithm adopted in the LRG P(k) analysis of Tegmark et al. (2006) leads to a ~10% correction to the underlying matter power spectrum at k = 0.1 h/Mpc and ~40% correction at k=0.2 h/Mpc, thereby compromising the cosmological constraints. In contrast, the power spectrum of our reconstructed halo density field deviates from the underlying matter power spectrum by less than 1% for k less than 0.1 h/Mpc and less than 4% for k less than 0.2 h/Mpc. The reconstructed halo density field also removes the bias in the measurement of the redshift space distortion parameter beta induced by the FOG smearing of the linear redshift space distortions.
