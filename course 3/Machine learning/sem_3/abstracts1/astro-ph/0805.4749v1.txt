The "Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars" (KADoNiS) project is an online database for experimental cross sections relevant to the s process and p process. It is available under http://nuclear-astrophysics.fzk.de/kadonis and consists of two parts. Part 1 is an updated sequel to the previous Bao et al. compilations from 1987 and 2000 for (n,$\gamma$) cross sections relevant to the big bang and s-process nucleosynthesis. The second part will be an experimental p-process database, which is expected to be launched in winter 2005/06. The KADoNiS project started in April 2005, and a first partial update is online since August 2005. In this paper we present a short overview of the first update of the s-process database, as well as an overview of the status of stellar (n,$\gamma$) cross sections of all 32 p isotopes.
