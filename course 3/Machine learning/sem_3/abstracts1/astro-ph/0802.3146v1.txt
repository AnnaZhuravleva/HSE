We present here a study of the Infrared properties of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (hereafter AGB) based on existing databases, mainly from space-borne experiments. Preliminary results about C and S stars are discussed, focusing on the topics for which future Infrared surveys from Antarctica will be crucial. This kind of surveys will help in making more quantitative our knowledge of the last evolutionary stages of low mass stars, especially for what concerns luminosities and mass loss.
