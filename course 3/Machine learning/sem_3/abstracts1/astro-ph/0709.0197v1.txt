We review the current state of modeling convective mixing in AGB stars. The focus is on results obtained through multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of AGB convection, both in the envelope and the unstable He-shell. Using two different codes and a wide range of resolutions and modeling assumptions we find that mixing across convective boundaries is significant for He-shell flash convection. We present a preliminary quantitative analysis of this convectively induced extra mixing, based on a sub-set of our simulations. Other non-standard mixing will be discussed briefly.
