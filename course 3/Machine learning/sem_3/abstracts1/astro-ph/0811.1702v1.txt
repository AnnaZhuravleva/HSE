We present preliminary results on a global study of X-ray binaries using 14 Ms of data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. Our initial study on GX 339-4 is recapped as an introduction to the methods used. We use a consistent analysis scheme for all objects, with three different spectral models to fit the powerlaw and disc components. We also take into account the possibility of a line being present in the data. The resulting almost 4000 observations allow the tracking of the spectral properties of the binaries as they evolve through an outburst. Our investigations concentrate on the disc and line properties of the binaries when in outburst. We also show the Disc-Fraction Luminosity diagram for the population of X-ray binaries studied which will enable us to further links with AGN.
