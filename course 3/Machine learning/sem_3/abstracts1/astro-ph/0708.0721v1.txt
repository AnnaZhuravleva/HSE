By means of deep FORS1@VLT and ACS@HST observations of a wide area in the stellar system omega Cen we measured the luminosity function of main sequence stars down to R=22.6 and I_{F814W}=24.5 . The luminosity functions obtained have been converted into mass functions and compared with analytical Initial Mass Functions (IMFs) available in the literature. The mass function obtained, reaching M~0.15 M_s, can be well reproduced by a broken power-law with indices alpha=-2.3 for M>0.5 M_s and alpha=-0.8 for M<0.5 M_s. Since the stellar populations of omega Cen have been proved to be actually unaffected by dynamical evolution processes, the mass function measured in this stellar system should represent the best approximation of the IMF of a star cluster. The comparison with the MF measured in other Galactic globular clusters suggests that possible primordial differences in the slope of the low-mass end of their MF could exist.
