Aims: To detect line effects using spectropolarimetry in order to find evidence of rotating disks and their respective symmetry axes in T Tauri stars. Methods: We used the IAGPOL imaging polarimeter along with the Eucalyptus-IFU to obtain spectropolarimetric measurements of the T Tauri stars RY Tau (two epochs) and PX Vul (one epoch). Evidence of line effects showing a loop on the Q-U diagram favors a compact rather than an extended source for the line photons in a rotating disk. In addition, the polarization position angle (PA) obtained using the line effect can constrain the symmetry axis of the disk. Results: RY Tau shown a variable Halpha double peak on 2004-2005 data. Polarization line effect is evident on the Q-U diagram for both epochs confirming a clockwise rotating disk. A single loop is evident on 2004 changing to a linear excursion plus a loop on 2005. Interestingly, the intrinsic PA calculated using the line effect is consistent between our two epochs (~167deg). An alternative intrinsic PA computed from the interstellar polarization corrected continuum and averaged between 2001-2005 yielded a PA 137deg. This last value is closer to be perpendicular to the observed disk direction (~25deg) as expected by single scattering in an optically thin disk. For PX Vul, we detected spectral variability in Halpha along with non-variable continuum polarization when compared with previous data. The Q-U diagram shows a well-defined loop in Halpha associated to a counter-clockwise rotating disk. The symmetry axis inferred by the line effect has a PA~91deg (with an ambiguity of 90deg). Our results confirm previous evidence that the emission line in T Tauri stars has its origin in a compact source scattered off a rotating accretion disk.
