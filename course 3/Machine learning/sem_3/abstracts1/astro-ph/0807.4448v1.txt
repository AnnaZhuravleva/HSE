Diffuse VHE gamma radiation from the Galactic Centre ridge observed by the H.E.S.S. telescope has been convincingly linked with the propagation of recently accelerated cosmic rays that interact with molecular hydrogen clouds during their diffusion. Through a series of time-dependent simulations of that diffusion for different propagation parameters we have obtained the most probable values of the diffusion coefficient for the Galactic Centre region. Assuming that the diffusion coefficient is of the form kappa(E) = kappa_0*(E/E_0)^delta, then for different optimal combinations of kappa_0 and delta its value is obtained for cosmic rays originating from a central point (possibly Sgr A East) 10 kyr ago.
