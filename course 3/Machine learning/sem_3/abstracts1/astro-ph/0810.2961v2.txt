(Abridged) We aim to quantitatively understand the dynamical effect and observational signatures of magnetization of the GRB ejecta on the onset of the afterglow. We perform ultrahigh-resolution one-dimensional relativistic MHD simulations of the interaction of a radially expanding, magnetized ejecta with the interstellar medium. The need of ultrahigh numerical resolution derives from the extreme jump conditions in the region of interaction between the ejecta and the circumburst medium. We study the evolution of an ultrarelativistic shell all the way to a the self-similar asymptotic phase. Our simulations show that the complete evolution can be characterized in terms of two parameters, namely, the \xi parameter introduced by Sari & Piran (1995) and the magnetization \sigma_0. We exploit this property by producing numerical models where the shell Lorentz factor is \gamma_0 ~ tens and rescaling the results to arbitrarily large \gamma_0. We find that the reverse shock is typically very weak or absent for ejecta characterized by \sigma_0 >~ 1. The onset of the forward shock emission is strongly affected by the magnetization. On the other hand, the magnetic energy of the shell is transfered to the external medium on a short timescale (~several times the duration of the burst). The later forward shock emission does not contain information for the initial magnetization of the flow. The asymptotic evolution of strongly magnetized shells, after they have suffred a substantial deceleration, resembles that of hydrodynamic shells, i.e., they fully enter in the Blandford-McKee self-similar regime.
