The location of two nearby galaxy groups within ~20 Mpc in the Leo region allows for a detailed study of low-mass galaxies. A catalog of HI line detections in Leo (9h36m < RA <11h36m, +8deg < dec < +16deg) has been made from the blind HI survey ALFALFA. More sensitive single-pixel Arecibo observations targeted Leo dwarf candidates noted optically by Karachentsev et al 2004 (K04) to determine group members and allow for a comparison of HI and optically-selected samples. This presentation highlights the differences between the two samples and the significant contribution blind HI surveys can make to the missing satellites problem.
