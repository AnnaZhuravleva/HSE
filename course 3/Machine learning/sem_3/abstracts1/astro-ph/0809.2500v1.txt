Using archival X-ray data from the second XMM-Newton serendipitous source catalogue, we present comparative analysis of the overall population of X-ray sources in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. We see a difference between the characteristics of the brighter sources in the two populations in the X-ray band. Utilising flux measurements in different energy bands we are able to sort the X-ray sources based on similarities to other previously identified and classified objects. In this manner we are able to identify the probable nature of some of the unknown objects, identifying a number of possible X-ray binaries and Super Soft Sources.
