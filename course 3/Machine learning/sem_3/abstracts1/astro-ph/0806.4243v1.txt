In this review, I will discuss how to characterize synchrotron X-ray variability of TeV blazars by using the observed/simulated light curves. Apparently, temporal studies provide independent and complementary information to the spectral studies, but surprisingly little attention has been paid especially for the blazar study. Only exception is a classical argument for presence of "time lag", which may (or may not) reflect the diffrence of synchrotron cooling timescale. Also very recently, it was suggested that the X-ray variability of TeV blazars indicates a strong red-noise, compared to a fractal, flickering-noise of Seyfert galaxies. Various temporal techniques are proposed in literature, e.g., the power spectrum density (PSD), the structure function (SF), and the discrete correlation function (DCF) and other analysis tools, but special care must be taken if the data are not well sampled and observation is relatively short compared to a characteristic timescale of the system. Also, the situation is being more complicated for low-Earth orbit satellites, e.g., ASCA, RXTE and BeppoSAX, since the light curve inevitably contains "periodic gap" due to the Earth occultation (every ~6ksec). I will present detailed approaches to see how the "gap" and the "finite length" of the data affects the results of temporal analysis, and to what extent we can believe in our results. Finally, I will briefly comment on the high-sensitivity X-ray observations with MAXI, that may shed new light on the forthcoming GLAST era.
