We present an updated timing solution and an analysis of the profile evolution - including precession and beam shape - of the young, relativistic binary pulsar J1906+0746. The 144-ms pulsar, in a 3.98-hour orbit with eccentricity 0.085 (Lorimer et al. 2006), was initially discovered during the early stages of the ALFA (Arecibo L-band Feed Array) pulsar survey (Cordes et al. 2006) using the 305-metre Arecibo telescope and was subsequently found in archival Parkes Multibeam Survey data. We have since been regularly monitoring the system using the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes, and include data from the Jodrell Bank, Parkes, Nancay and Westerbork telescopes. The nature of the binary companion will also be discussed based on improved estimates of the total and companion masses obtained from the updated timing solution.
