We report results from a Suzaku observation of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 NGC 4051. During our observation, large amplitude rapid variability is seen and the averaged 2--10 keV flux is 8.1x10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2, which is several times lower than the historical average. The X-ray spectrum hardens when the source flux becomes lower, confirming the trend of spectral variability known for many Seyfert 1 galaxies. The broad-band averaged spectrum and spectra in high and low flux intervals are analyzed. The spectra are first fitted with a model consisting of a power-law component, a reflection continuum originating in cold matter, a blackbody component, two zones of ionized absorber, and several Gaussian emission lines. The amount of reflection is rather large (R ~ 7, where R=1 corresponds to reflection by an infinite slab), while the equivalent width of the Fe-K line at 6.4 keV is modest (140 eV) for the averaged spectrum. We then model the overall spectra by introducing partial covering for the power-law component and reflection continuum independently. The column density for the former is 1x10^23 cm^-2, while it is fixed at 1x10^24 cm-2 for the latter. By comparing the spectra in different flux states, we identify the causes of spectral variability. (abridged)
