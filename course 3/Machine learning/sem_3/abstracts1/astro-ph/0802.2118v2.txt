We have monitored 41 Be/X-ray binary systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud over ~9 years using PCA-RXTE data from a weekly survey program. The resulting light curves were analysed in search of orbital modulations with the result that 10 known orbital ephemerides were confirmed and refined, while 10 new ones where determined. A large number of X-ray orbital profiles are presented for the first time, showing similar characteristics over a wide range of orbital periods. Lastly, three pulsars: SXP46.4, SXP89.0 and SXP165 were found to be misidentifications of SXP46.6, SXP91.1 and SXP169, respectively.
