We present new results with a prototype detector that is being developed by the DMTPC collaboration for the measurement of the direction tag (head-tail) of dark matter wind. We use neutrons from a Cf-252 source to create low-momentum nuclear recoils in elastic scattering with the residual gas nuclei. The recoil track is imaged in low-pressure time-projection chamber with optical readout. We measure the ionization rate along the recoil trajectory, which allows us to determine the direction tag of the incoming neutrons.
