We present here the orbital elements for the pair BC of visual binary star WDS 18253+4846 (ADS 11344 = HD 170109) and ephemerides for the period 2008-2014. As the orbital elements of pair AB already existed we analyzed mass ratio between these two pairs and concluded that components C is the biggest one in this triple system.
