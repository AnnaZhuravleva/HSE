The idea is considered that a classical non-Abelian gauge field can be considered as a dark matter candidate. It is shown that Yang-Mills equations have solutions with such distribution of the mass density that allows to describe a rotational curve of spiral galaxies. The conditions necessary for such consideration are considered. One parameter is estimated from Yang-Mills equations and from astrophysical observations (stars rotation curve). The agreement is to within 1%.
