How much can we know about our Universe? All of our observations are restricted to a finite volume, and therefore our estimates of presumably global cosmological parameters are necessarily based on incomplete information. Even assuming that the Standard Model of cosmology is correct, this means that some cosmological questions may be unanswerable. For example, is the curvature parameter Omega_K positive, negative, or identically zero? If its magnitude is sufficiently small, then due to cosmic variance no causal observation can ever answer that question. In this article, we first describe the gauge problems associated with defining the cosmic variance of cosmological parameters, then describe a solution involving the use of parameters defined on the surface of last scattering, and finally calculate the statistical variance of ideal measurements of the matter, radiation, and curvature density parameters. We find that Omega_K cannot be measured to better than about 1.5x10^(-5) (1 sigma), and that this limit has already begun to decrease due to the flattening effect of dark energy. Proposed 21 cm hydrogen experiments, for example, make this limit more than just a theoretical curiosity.
