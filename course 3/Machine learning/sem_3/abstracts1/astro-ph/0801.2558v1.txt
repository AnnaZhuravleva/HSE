I review measurements of star formation in nearby galaxies in the UV-to-FIR wavelength range, and discuss their impact on SFR determinations in intermediate and high redshift galaxy populations. Existing and upcoming facilities will enable precise cross-calibrations among the various indicators, thus bringing them onto a common scale.
