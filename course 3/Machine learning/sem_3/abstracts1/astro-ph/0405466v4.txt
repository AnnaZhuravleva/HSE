Elliptical galaxies are modelled as Sersic luminosity distributions with density profiles (DPs) for the total mass adopted from the DPs of haloes within dissipationless LambdaCDM N-body simulations. Ellipticals turn out to be inconsistent with cuspy low-concentration NFW models representing the total mass, nor are they consistent with a steeper -1.5 inner slope, nor with the shallower models proposed by Navarro et al. 04, nor with NFW models 10 times more concentrated than predicted, as deduced from several X-ray observations: the mass models, extrapolated inwards, lead to local mass-to-light ratios that are smaller than the stellar value inside an effective radius (R_e), and to central aperture velocity dispersions that are much smaller than observed. This conclusion remains true as long as there is no sharp steepening (slope < -2) of the dark matter (DM) DPs just inside 0.01 virial radii. The too low total mass and velocity dispersion produced within R_e by an NFW-like total mass profile suggests that the stellar component should dominate the DM one out to at least R_e. It should then be difficult to kinematically constrain the inner slope of the dark matter DP of ellipticals. The high concentration parameters deduced from X-ray observations appear to be a consequence of fitting an NFW model to the total mass DP made up of a stellar component that dominates inside and a DM component that dominates outwards. An appendix gives the virial mass dependence of the concentration parameter, central density, and total mass of the Navarro et al. model. In a 2nd appendix are given single integral expressions for the velocity dispersions averaged along the line-of-sight, in circular apertures and in thin slits, for general luminosity density and mass distributions, with isotropic orbits.
