We have developed a new two-dimensional hydrostatically-balanced isobaric hydrodynamic model for use in simulation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We apply this model to the infrared photosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, for which an excellent 8-micron light curve has been obtained. For reasonable parameter choices, the results of our model are consistent with these observations. In our simulations, strongly turbulent supersonic flow develops, with wind speeds of approximately 5 km/s. This flow geometry causes chaotic variation of the temperature distribution, leading to observable variations in the light curve from one orbit to the next.
