We study the properties and nature of extremely red galaxies (ERO, R-K>5.6) found behind two lensing clusters and compare them with other known galaxy populations. New HST/ACS observations, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, and Chandra/ACIS observations of the two lensing clusters Abell 1835 and AC114 contemplate our earlier optical and near-IR observations and have been used to study extremely red objects (EROs) in these deep fields. We have found 6 and 9 EROs in Abell 1835 and AC114. Several (7) of these objects are undetected up to the I and/or z band, and are hence ``optical'' drop-out sources. The photometric redshifts of most of our sources (80%) are z~0.7-1.5. According to simple colour-colour diagrams the majority of our objects would be classified as hosting old stellar populations. However, there are clear signs of dusty starbursts for several among them. These objects correspond to the most extreme ones in R-K colour. We estimate a surface density of (0.97+-0.31) arcmin-2 for EROs with (R-K>5.6) at K<20.5. Among our 15 EROs 6 (40 %) also classify as distant red galaxies (DRGs). 11 of 13 EROs with available IRAC photometry also fulfil the selection criteria for IRAC selected EROs (IEROs) of Yan et al. (2004). SED modelling shows that ~ 36 % of the IEROs in our sample are luminous or ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRG). Some very red DRGs are found to be very dusty starbursts, even (U)LIRGs, as also supported by their mid-IR photometry. No indication for AGNs is found, although faint activity cannot be excluded for all objects. From mid-IR and X-ray data 5 objects are clearly classified as starbursts. The derived properties are quite similar to those of DRGs and IEROs, except for 5 extreme objects in terms of colours, for which a very high extinction (Av>3) is found.
