Directional detection of Dark Matter allows for unambiguous direct detection of WIMPs as well as discrimination between various Dark Matter models in our galaxy. The DMTPC detector is a low-pressure TPC with optical readout designed for directional direct detection of WIMPs. By using CF4 gas as the active material, the detector also has excellent sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions of Dark Matter on protons.
