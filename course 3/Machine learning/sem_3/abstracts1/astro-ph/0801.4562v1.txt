An arbitrary initial magnetic field in an A star evolves into a stable equilibrium. Simulations are presented of the formation of non-axisymmetric equilibria consisting of twisted flux tubes meandering under the surface of the star, and analytic arguments are given relating the stability and form of these equilibria. These results may help to explain observations of Ap stars with very non-dipolar fields. This work is also applicable to other essentially non-convective stars such as white dwarfs and neutron stars.
