Predictions of the number of faint polarised radio sources that can be detected by SKA pathfinder telescopes and the SKA depend on the polarisation properties of radio sources with a total flux density around 1 mJy. Total intensity source counts suggest a transition in the dominant population from AGN to galaxies around this flux density, and the properties of brighter radio sources may not be representative for this fainter population. We show that unresolved spiral galaxies can be highly polarised radio sources, up to ~ 20% polarised at 4.8 GHz. This result is partly based on observations of nearby galaxies, including galaxies with significant deviations from axial symmetry and other peculiarities. A first analysis of polarised source counts divided into steep-spectrum AGN, flat-spectrum AGN and star forming galaxies is presented, including a prediction of polarised source counts to microjansky levels.
