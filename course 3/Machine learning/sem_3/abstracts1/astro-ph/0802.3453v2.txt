In the present investigation flat rotational curves of the galaxies are considered under the framework of brane-world models where the 4d effective Einstein equation has extra terms which arise from the embedding of the 3-brane in the $5d$ bulk. It has been shown here that these long range bulk gravitational degrees of freedom can act as a mechanism to yield the observed galactic rotation curves without the need for dark matter. The present model has the advantage that the observed rotation curves result solely from well-established non-local effects of gravitation, such as dark radiation and dark pressure under a direct use of the condition of flat rotation curves and does not invoke any exotic matter field.
