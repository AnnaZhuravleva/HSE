Aims: To determine alpha effect and turbulent magnetic diffusivity for mean magnetic fields with profiles of different length scale from simulations of isotropic turbulence, and to relate these results to nonlocal formulations in which alpha and the turbulent magnetic diffusivity correspond to integral kernels. Methods: A set of evolution equations for magnetic fields is solved which gives the response to imposed test fields, that is, mean magnetic fields with various wavenumbers. Both an imposed fully helical steady flow consisting of a pattern of screw-like motions (Roberts flow) and time-dependent statistically steady isotropic turbulence are considered. In the latter case the aforementioned evolution equations are solved simultaneously with the momentum and continuity equations. The corresponding results for the electromotive force are used to calculate alpha and magnetic diffusivity tensors. Results: For both the Roberts flow under the second--order correlation approximation and isotropic turbulence alpha and turbulent magnetic diffusivity are largest at large scales and these values diminish toward smaller scales. In both cases the alpha effect and turbulent diffusion kernels are well approximated by exponentials, corresponding to Lorentzian profiles in Fourier space. For isotropic turbulence the turbulent diffusion kernel is half as wide as the alpha effect kernel. For the Roberts flow beyond the second--order correlation approximation the turbulent diffusion kernel becomes negative at large scales.
