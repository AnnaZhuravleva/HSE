Brane cosmology presents many interesting possibilities including: phantom acceleration (w<-1), self-acceleration, unification of dark energy with inflation, transient acceleration, loitering cosmology, new singularities at which the Hubble parameter remains finite, cosmic mimicry, etc. The existence of a time-like extra dimension can result in a singularity-free cyclic cosmology.
