The constraint on the ADD model of extra dimensions coming from photon annihilation into Kaluza-Klein graviton in supernova cores is revisited. In the two photon process for a conservative choice of the core parameters, we obtain the bound on the fundamental Planck scale $M_* \gtrsim$ 1.6 TeV. The combined energy loss rate due to nucleon-nucleon brehmstrahlung and photon annihilation processes is rederived, which shows that the combined bounds add only second decimal place to $M_*$. The present study can strengthen the results that are available in the current literature for the graviton emission from SN1987A which puts a very strong constraints on models with large extra dimensions for the case of $n=3$ .
