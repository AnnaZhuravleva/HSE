In this paper we use coherently integrated visibilities (see separate paper in these proceedings, Jorgensen et al. 2008) to measure the properties of binary stars. We use only the phase of the complex visibility and not the amplitude. The reason for this is that amplitudes suffer from the calibration effect (the same for coherent and incoherent averages) and thus effectively provide lower accuracy measurements. We demonstrate that the baseline phase alone can be used to measure the separation, orientation and brightness ratio of a binary star, as a function of wavelength.
