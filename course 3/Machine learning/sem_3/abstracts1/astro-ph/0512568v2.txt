Based on the most complete list of the results of an individual comparison of the proper motions for stars of various programs common to the Hipparcos catalog, each of which is an independent realization of the inertial reference frame with regard to stellar proper motions, we redetermined the vector $\omega$ of residual rotation of the ICRS system relative to the extragalactic reference frame. The equatorial components of this vector were found to be the following: $\omega_x = +0.04\pm 0.15$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\omega_y = +0.18\pm 0.12$ mas yr$^{-1}$, and $\omega_z = -0.35\pm 0.09$ mas yr$^{-1}$.
