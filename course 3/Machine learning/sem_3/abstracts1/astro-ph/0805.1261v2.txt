The transition redshift (deceleration/acceleration) is discussed by expanding the deceleration parameter to first order around its present value. A detailed study is carried out by considering two different parameterizations: $q=q_0 + q_1z$ and $q=q_0 + q_1 z(1+z)^{-1}$, and the associated free parameters ($q_o, q_1$) are constrained by 3 different supernova samples. The previous analysis by Riess {\it{et al.}} [ApJ 607, 665, 2004] using the first expansion is slightly improved and confirmed in light of their recent data ({\emph{Gold}}07 sample). However, by fitting the model with the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) type Ia sample we find that the best fit to the redshift transition is $z_t = 0.61$ instead of $z_t = 0.46$ as derived by the High-z Supernovae Search (HZSNS) team. This result based in the SNLS sample is also in good agreement with the Davis {\it{et al.}} sample, $z_t=0.60^{+0.28}_{-0.11}$ ($1\sigma$). Such results are in line with some independent analyzes and accommodates more easily the concordance flat model ($\Lambda$CDM). For both parameterizations, the three SNe type Ia samples considered favor recent acceleration and past deceleration with a high degree of statistical confidence level. All the kinematic results presented here depend neither on the validity of general relativity nor the matter-energy contents of the Universe.
