Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients are obviously related to persistent Supergiant X-ray Binaries. Any convincing explanation for their behaviour must consistently take into account all types of X-ray sources powered by wind accretion. Here we present a common framework for wind accreting sources, within the context of clumpy wind models, that allows a coherent interpretation of their different behaviours as an immediate consequence of diverse orbital geometries.
