The afterglow of GRB 050401 presents several novel and interesting features : [1] An initially faster decay in optical band than in X-rays. [2] A break in the X-ray light curve after $\sim$ 0.06 day with an unusual slope after the break. [3] The X-ray afterglow does not show any spectral evolution across the break while the R band light curve does not show any break.   We have modeled the observed multi-band evolution of the afterglow of GRB 050401 as originating in a two component jet, interpreting the break in X-ray light curve as due to lateral expansion of a narrow collimated outflow which dominates the X-ray emission. The optical emission is attributed to a wider jet component. Our model reproduces all the observed features of multi-band afterglow of GRB 050401.   We present optical observations of GRB 050401 using the 104-cm Sampurnanand Telescope at ARIES, Nainital. Results of the analysis of multi-band data are presented and compared with GRB 030329, the first reported case of double jet.
