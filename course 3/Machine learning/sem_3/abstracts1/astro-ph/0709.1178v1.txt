We have measured a trigonometric parallax to the young brown dwarf 2MASSW J1207334-393254. The distance [54.0 (+3.2,-2.8) pc] and space motion confirm membership in the TW Hydrae Association. The primary is a ~25 M_jup brown dwarf. We discuss the "planetary mass" secondary, which is certainly below the deuterium-burning limit but whose colors and absolute magnitudes pose challenges to our current understanding of planetary-mass objects.
