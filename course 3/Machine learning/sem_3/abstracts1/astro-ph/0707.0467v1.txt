I review determinations of star formation rates (SFR) from the ultraviolet to the infrared, in the context of their use for galaxies and galaxy surveys. The mid-infrared SFR indicators have garnered interest in recent years thanks to the Spitzer capabilities and the opportunities offered by the upcoming Herschel Space Telescope. I discuss what we have learned in the mid-infrared from studies of local galaxies combining Spitzer with HST and other data.
