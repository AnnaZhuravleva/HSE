In the poster presented in Cool Star 15, we analyzed the effect of disk accretion on the evolution of very low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs and the resulting uncertainties on the determination of masses and ages. We use the Lyon evolutionary 1-D code assuming a magnetospheric accretion process, i.e., the material falls covering a small area of the radiative surface, and we take into account the internal energy added from the accreted material as a free parameter $\epsilon$. Even if the approach to this problem is phenomenological, our formalism provides important hints about characteristics of disk accretion, which are useful for improved stellar interior calculations. Using the accretion rates derived from observations our results show that accretion does not affect considerably the position of theoretical isochrones as well as the luminosity compared with standard non-accreting models.
