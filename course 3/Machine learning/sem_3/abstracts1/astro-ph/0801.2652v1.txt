Context: The distance to the Galactic Centre (GC) is of importance for the distance scale in the Universe. The value derived by Eisenhauer et al. (2005) of 7.62 +- 0.32 kpc based on the orbit of one star around the central black hole is shorter than most other distance estimates based on a variety of different methods. Aim: To establish an independent distance to the GC with high accuracy. To this end Population-II Cepheids are used that have been discovered in the OGLE-II and III surveys. Method: Thirty-nine Pop-II Cepheids have been monitored on 4 nights spanning 14 days. Light curves have been fitted using the known periods from the OGLE data to determine the mean K-band magnitude. It so happens that 37 RR Lyrae stars are in the field-of-views and mean K-band magnitudes are derived for this sample as well. Results: The period-luminosity relation of Pop-II Cepheids in the K-band is determined, and the derived slope of -2.24 +- 0.14 is consistent with the value derived by Matsunaga et al. (2006). Fixing the slope to their more accurate value results in a zero point, and implies a distance modulus to the GC of 14.51 +- 0.12, with an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.07 mag. Similarly, from the RR Lyrae K-band PL-relation we derive a value of 14.48 +- 0.17 (random) +- 0.07 (syst.). The two independent determinations are averaged to find 14.50 +- 0.10 (random) +- 0.07 (syst.), or 7.94 +- 0.37 +- 0.26 kpc.
