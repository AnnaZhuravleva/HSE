We use two-dimensional kinematic maps of simulated binary disc mergers to investigate the $\lambda_R$-parameter, which is a luminosity weighted measure of projected angular momentum per unit mass. This parameter was introduced to subdivide the SAURON sample of early type galaxies in so called fast $\lambda_R > 0.1$ and slow rotators $\lambda_R < 0.1$. Tests on merger remnants reveal that $\lambda_R$ is a robust indicator of the true angular momentum content in elliptical galaxies. We find the same range of $\lambda_R$ values in our merger remnants as in the SAURON galaxies. The merger mass ratio is decisive in creating a slow or a fast rotator in a single binary merger, the former being created mostly in an equal mass merger. Slow rotators have a $\lambda_R$ which does not vary with projection. The confusion rate with face-on fast rotators is very small. Merger with low gas fractions form slow rotators with smaller ellipticities and are in much better agreement with the SAURON slow rotators. Remergers of merger remnants are slow rotators but tend to have too high ellipticities. Fast rotators maintain the angular momentum content from the progenitor disc galaxy if merger mass ratio is high. Some SAURON galaxies have values of $\lambda_R$ as high as our progenitor disc galaxies.
