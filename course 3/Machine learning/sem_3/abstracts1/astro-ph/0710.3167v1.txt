In this brief proceedings article I summarize the review talk I gave at the IAU 246 meeting in Capri, Italy, glossing over the well-known results from the literature, but paying particular attention to new, previously unpublished material. This new material includes a careful comparison of the apparently contradictory results of two independent methods used to simulate the evolution of binary populations in dense stellar systems (the direct N-body method of Hurley, et al. 2007 and the approximate Monte Carlo method of Ivanova, et al. 2005), that shows that the two methods may not actually yield contradictory results, and suggests future work to more directly compare the two methods.
