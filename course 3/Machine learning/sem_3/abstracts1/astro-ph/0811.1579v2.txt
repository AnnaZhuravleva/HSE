(Abridged) We use N-body simulations to explore the effects of tidal stripping on the structure of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We model dSphs as King spheres embedded in NFW dark halos that orbit the Galactic potential on eccentric orbits. We find that episodes of stellar mass loss remove the initial cutoff of the bound stellar core. Once equilibrium has been re-established the outer mass profile approaches a power-law in projection that is well described by a simple Plummer model. Tides also result in transient features in the outer density profile. As the system re-equilibrates, an outward-moving "excess" of stars is found at radii where the local crossing time exceeds the time elapsed since pericenter. If the orbit is known, these results provide a simple way to assess whether "breaks" and "bumps" in the profile of dSphs are actually tidal in origin. We apply this to the Sagittarius dwarf and, encouragingly, identify two features in the profile that may be traced to its two last pericentric passages. Applied to Leo I, we find that any tidal break would locate beyond the area surveyed by current data, casting doubt on recent claims of the detection of tidal debris around this galaxy. For Carina, the tidal break should occur at a radius twice farther than observed, suggesting that the outer excess of stars is not tidal in origin unless its orbit is in error. A similar comment applies to Sculptor, whose pericenter appears too large for Galactic tides to be important but whose outer profile, like that of Draco, nonetheless follows closely a Plummer-law. Fornax and Leo II show no sign of a power-law outer profile, suggesting that they have not suffered stellar tidal stripping. Published profiles for other, fainter Milky Way dSph companions do not extend sufficiently far to allow for conclusive assessment.
