We present a first results from a long-term program of a radial velocity study of Cepheid Polaris (F7 Ib) aimed to find amplitude and period of pulsations and nature of secondary periodicities. 264 new precise radial velocity measurements were obtained during 2004-2007 with the fiber-fed echelle spectrograph Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph (BOES) of 1.8m telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory (BOAO) in Korea. We find a pulsational radial velocity amplitude and period of Polaris for three seasons of 2005.183, 2006.360, and 2007.349 as 2K = 2.210 +/- 0.048 km/s, 2K = 2.080 +/- 0.042 km/s, and 2K = 2.406 +/- 0.018 km/s respectively, indicating that the pulsational amplitudes of Polaris that had decayed during the last century is now increasing rapidly. The pulsational period was found to be increasing too. This is the first detection of a historical turnaround of pulsational amplitude change in Cepheids. We clearly find the presence of additional radial velocity variations on a time scale of about 119 days and an amplitude of about +/- 138 m/s, that is quasi-periodic rather than strictly periodic. We do not confirm the presence in our data the variation on a time scale 34-45 days found in earlier radial velocity data obtained in 80's and 90's. We assume that both the 119 day quasi-periodic, noncoherent variations found in our data as well as 34-45 day variations found before can be caused by the 119 day rotation periods of Polaris and by surface inhomogeneities such as single or multiple spot configuration varying with the time.
