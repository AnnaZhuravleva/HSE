We have surveyed all 22 known Galactic globular clusters observable with the Arecibo radio telescope and within 70kpc of the Sun for radio pulsations at ~1.4GHz. Data were taken with the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processor, which provided the large bandwidth and high time and frequency resolution needed to detect fast-spinning, faint pulsars. We have also employed advanced search techniques to maintain sensitivity to short orbital period binaries. These searches have discovered 11 new millisecond pulsars and 2 promising candidates in 5 clusters, almost doubling the population of pulsars in the Arecibo-visible globular clusters. Ten of these new pulsars are in binary systems, and 3 are eclipsing. This survey has discovered significantly more very fast-spinning pulsars (P_spin <~ 4ms) and short orbital period systems (P_orb <~ 6hr) than previous surveys of the same clusters. We discuss some properties of these systems, as well as some characteristics of the globular cluster pulsar population in general, particularly its luminosity distribution.
