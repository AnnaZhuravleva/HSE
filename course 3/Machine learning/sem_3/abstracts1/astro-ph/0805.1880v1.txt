In this brief review I consider the advances made in weak gravitational lensing over the last 8 years, concentrating on the large scales - cosmic shear. I outline the theoretical developments, observational status, and the challenges which cosmic shear must overcome to realise its full potential. Finally I consider the prospects for probing Dark Energy and extra-dimensional gravity theories with future experiments.
