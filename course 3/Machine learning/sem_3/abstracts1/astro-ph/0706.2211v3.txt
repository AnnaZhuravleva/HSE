We discuss the evolution of holographic hessence model, which satisfies the holographic principle and can naturally realizes the equation of state crossing -1. By discussing the evolution of the models in the $w w'$ plane, we find that, if $c\geq1$, $w_{he}\geq-1$ and $\dot{V}<0$ keep for all time, which are quintessence-like. However, if $c<-1$, which mildly favors the current observations, $w_{he}$ evolves from $w_{he}>-1$ to $w_{he}<-1$, and the potential is a nonmonotonic function. In the earlier time, the potential must be rolled down, and then be climbed up. Considered the current constraint on the parameter $c$, we reconstruct the potential of the holographic hessence model.
