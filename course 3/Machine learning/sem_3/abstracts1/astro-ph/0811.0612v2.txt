We study the distribution of angular positions and angular separations of unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs). HVSs are spatially anisotropic at the 3-sigma level. The spatial anisotropy is significant in Galactic longitude, not in latitude, and the inclusion of lower velocity, possibly bound HVSs reduces the significance of the anisotropy. We discuss how the observed distribution of HVSs may be linked to their origin. In the future, measuring the distribution of HVSs in the southern sky will provide additional constraints on the spatial anisotropy and the origin of HVSs.
