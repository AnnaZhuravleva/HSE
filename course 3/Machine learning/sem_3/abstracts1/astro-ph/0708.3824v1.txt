We explore the sensitivity of a neutrino detector employing strongly directional high gain radio antennae to detect the conversion of neutrinos above $10^{16}$ eV in a mountain or the earth crust. The directionality of the antennae will allow both, the low threshold and the suppression of background. This technology would have the advantage that it does not require a suitable atmosphere as optical detectors do and could therefore be deployed at any promising place on the planet. In particular one could choose suitable topographies at latitudes that are matched to promising source candidates.
