Spectroscopic observations of a solar limb flare recorded by SUMER on SOHO reveal, for the first time, hot fast magnetic reconnection outflows in the corona. As the reconnection site rises across the SUMER spectrometer slit, significant blue- and red-shift signatures are observed in sequence in the Fe XIX line, reflecting upflows and downflows of hot plasma jets, respectively. With the projection effect corrected, the measured outflow speed is between 900-3500 km/s, consistent with theoretical predictions of the Alfvenic outflows in magnetic reconnection region in solar impulsive events. Based on theoretic models, the magnetic field strength near the reconnection region is estimated to be 19-37 Gauss.
