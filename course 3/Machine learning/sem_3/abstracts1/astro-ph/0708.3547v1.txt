We have searched for nearby dwarf galaxies in 27 northern groups with characteristic distances 8-15 Mpc based on the Second Palomar Sky Survey prints. In a total area of about 2000 square degrees, we have found 90 low-surface-brightness objects, more than 60% of which are absent from known catalogs and lists. We have classified most of these objects (~80%) as irregular dwarf systems. The first 21-cm line observations of the new objects with the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope showed that the typical linear diameters (1-2 kpc), internal motions (30 km/s), and hydrogen masses (~2*10^7M_sun) galaxies correspond to those expected for the dwarf population of nearby groups.
