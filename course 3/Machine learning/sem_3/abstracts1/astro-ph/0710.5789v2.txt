Recent stellar evolutionary calculations of low-metallicity massive fast-rotating main-sequence stars yield iron cores at collapse endowed with high angular momentum. It is thought that high angular momentum and black hole formation are critical ingredients of the collapsar model of long-soft gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here, we present 2D multi-group, flux-limited-diffusion MHD simulations of the collapse, bounce, and immediate post-bounce phases of a 35-Msun collapsar-candidate model of Woosley & Heger. We find that, provided the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) operates in the differentially-rotating surface layers of the millisecond-period neutron star, a magnetically-driven explosion ensues during the proto-neutron star phase, in the form of a baryon-loaded non-relativistic jet, and that a black hole, central to the collapsar model, does not form. Paradoxically, and although much uncertainty surrounds stellar mass loss, angular momentum transport, magnetic fields, and the MRI, current models of chemically homogeneous evolution at low metallicity yield massive stars with iron cores that may have too much angular momentum to avoid a magnetically-driven, hypernova-like, explosion in the immediate post-bounce phase. We surmise that fast rotation in the iron core may inhibit, rather than enable, collapsar formation, which requires a large angular momentum not in the core but above it. Variations in the angular momentum distribution of massive stars at core collapse might explain both the diversity of Type Ic supernovae/hypernovae and their possible association with a GRB. A corollary might be that, rather than the progenitor mass, the angular momentum distribution, through its effect on magnetic field amplification, distinguishes these outcomes.
