We investigate the spacetime of anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion. The Einstein field equations are solved using different ansatz of the surface tension. In this investigation, we study two cases in details with the anisotropy as: [1] $p_t = n p_r$ [2] $p_t - p_r = \frac{1}{8 \pi}(\frac{c_1}{r^2} + c_2)$ where, n, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants. The solutions yield expressions of the physical quantities like pressure gradients and the mass.
