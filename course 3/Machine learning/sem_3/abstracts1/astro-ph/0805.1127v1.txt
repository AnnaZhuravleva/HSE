In this paper we present new results of spectraphotometrical investigations of the flaring kernels sizes and their intensities measured simultaneously in various parts of the H-alpha line profile. Our investigations were based on the very high temporal resolution spectral-imaging observations of the solar flares collected with Large Coronagraph (LC), Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass Spectrograph and Solar Eclipse Coronal Imaging System (MSDP-SECIS) at Bialkow Observatory (University of Wroclaw, Poland). We have found that the areas of the investigated individual flaring kernels vary in time and in wavelengths as well as the intensities and areas of the H-alpha flaring kernels decreased systematically when observed in consecutive wavelengths toward the wings of the H-alpha line. Our result could be explained as an effect of the cone-shaped lower parts of the magnetic loops channeling high energy particle beams exciting chromospheric plasma.
