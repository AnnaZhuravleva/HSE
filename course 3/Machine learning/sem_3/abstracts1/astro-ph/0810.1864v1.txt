A detailed solution of an initial value problem of a vertically localized initial perturbation in rotating magnetized vertically stratified disk is presented. The appropriate linearized MHD equations are solved by employing the WKB approximation and the results are verified numerically. The eigenfrequencies as well as eigenfunctions are explicitly obtained. It is demonstrated that the initial perturbation remains confined within the disk. It is further shown that thin enough disks are stable but as their thickness grows increasing number of unstable modes participate in the solution of the initial value problem. However it is demonstrated that due to the localization of the initial perturbation the growth time of the instability is significantly longer than the calculated inverse growth rate of the individual unstable eigenfunctions.
