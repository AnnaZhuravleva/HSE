The equation of state of de-confined quark matter within the MIT bag model is calculated. This equation of state is used to compute the structure of a neutron star with quark core. It is found that the limiting mass of the neutron star is affected considerably by this modification of the equation of state. Calculations are carried out for different choices of the bag constant.
