In a recent paper it was suggested that inclusion of mutual gravitational interactions among the collapsing particles can avert a singularity and give finite value for various physical quantities. In this paper we extend this idea further by the inclusion of charge and spin to the system. We have also discussed other possible scenarios by which the singular state can be averted, including a temperature dependent gravitational constant. Also possible modifications in the Einstein-Hilbert action have been discussed, which can again lead to a finite maximal curvature hence avoiding a singularity.
