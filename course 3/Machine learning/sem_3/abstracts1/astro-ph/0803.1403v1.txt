The consequences of a newly suggested value for the SN explosion energy 1.2x10^{51} erg are explored for the case of Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR). A nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in SNRs is employed to investigate the properties of Tycho's SNR and their correspondence to the existing experimental data. It is demonstrated that the large mean ratio between the radii of the contact discontinuity and the forward shock is consistent with the very effective acceleration of nuclear energetic particles at the forward shock. It is also argued that consistency of the value E_{sn} = 1.2x10^{51} erg with the gas dynamics, acceleration theory, and the existing gamma-ray measurements requires the source distance to be greater than 3.3 kpc. The corresponding ambient gas number density is lower than 0.4 cm^{-3}. Since the expected gamma-ray flux strongly depends on the source distance, F_{\gamma}\propto d^{-7}, a future experimental determination of the actual gamma-ray flux from Tycho's SNR will make it possible to determine the values of the source distance and of the mean ambient gas density. A simple inverse Compton model without a dominant population of nuclear CRs is not compatible with the present upper limit for the gamma-ray emission for any reasonable ambient interstellar B-field. Given the consistency between acceleration theory and overall, as well as internal, gas dynamics, a future gamma-ray detection would make the case for nuclear particle acceleration in Tycho's SNR incontrovertible in our view.
