It has long been known that galaxy interactions are associated with enhanced star formation. In a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying a variety of statistics to SDSS data. In particular, we showed that specific star formation rates of galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. Here we apply exactly the same techniques to AGN in the survey, showing that close neighbours are not associated with any similar enhancement of nuclear activity. Star formation is enhanced in AGN with close neighbours in exactly the same way as in inactive galaxies, but the accretion rate onto the black hole, as estimated from the extinction-corrected [O III] luminosity, is not influenced by the presence or absence of companions. Previous work has shown that galaxies with more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in their inner regions. This leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a close companion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinct events. These events may be part of the same physical process, for example a merger, provided they are separated in time. In this case, accretion onto the black hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the two interacting galaxies have merged. The major caveat in this work is our assumption that the extinction-corrected [O III] luminosity is a robust indicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole. It is thus important to check our results using indicators of AGN activity at other wavelengths.
