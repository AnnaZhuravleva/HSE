We present here the first observation of galactic AGB stars with the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our sample consists of 48 AGB stars of different chemical signature, mass loss rate and variability class. For each star we have measured IRAC photometry and colors. Preliminary results shows that IRAC colors are sensitive to spectroscopic features associated to molecules and dust in the AGB wind. Period is only loosely correlated to the brightness of the stars in the IRAC bands. We do find, however, a tight period-color relation for sources classified as semiregular variables. This may be interpreted as the lack of warm dust in the wind of the sources in this class, as opposed to Mira variables that show higher infrared excess in all IRAC bands.
