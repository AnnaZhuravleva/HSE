The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive of high-resolution ultraviolet spectra of the eclipsing semi-detached binary star, Algol (Beta Persei, HD 19356), taken from September 1978 to September 1989, is analyzed in order to characterize the movement of gas within and from this system. Light curves are constructed, using a total of 1647 continuum level measurements. These results support the semidetached status of this interacting binary star. Radial velocities, residual intensities, full width half maxima (FWHM), line asymmetries, and equivalent widths of UV absorption lines for aluminum, magnesium, iron, and silicon in a range of ionization states are determined and analyzed. For selected epochs, we were able to isolate gas stream and photospheric contributions by an examination of the differences between spectral line shapes. We observed variations in line shape and strength, with orbital phase and epoch, indicating the presence of stable gas streams and circumstellar gas, and periods of increased mass-transfer activity associated with transient gas streams. The 1989 data indicates moderate activity. This epoch was examined most closely since it provides the greatest phase coverage. Spectral line profiles in 1978 and 1984 have the strongest gas-flow absorption components, indicating that these are the epochs of the greatest activity. The dense phase coverage in September 1989 allows us to measure the mass loss rate from Algol B into Algol A which is of order ~10E-14 solar masses per year. Since the highest gas-flow velocities are in the 100 kilometer per second range, well below escape velocity, we conclude that systemic mass loss due to gas flow is small for the Algol system.
