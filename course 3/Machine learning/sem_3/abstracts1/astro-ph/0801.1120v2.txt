We consider axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal magnetic field and an ultrarelativistic equation of state, with the goal of studying the lateral structure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the medium through which they propagate. We find all self-similar steady-state solutions of the relativistic MHD equations for this setup. One of the solutions is the case of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it propagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z)\propto z^{-2}. As the jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the ambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while the magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet. Such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle \theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\gamma, where \gamma is the characteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; otherwise, different parts of the jet cannot maintain causal contact. We construct maps of optically thin synchrotron emission from our self-similar models. We suggest that the boundary pile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of M87. We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from the jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3C273 and Mkn501. Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a strong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the polarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather uncertain. For example, jets with toroidal magnetic fields display the `spine-sheath' polarization angle pattern seen in some BL Lac objects.
