We show that with GLAST there will be the possibility to detect, within the UHECR skimming at atmosphere edges, the showers generated by very high energy upward and horizontal Tau. The effective area, thanks to the large area covered by the showers at 550 Km, is less than that of AUGER, but its efficiency is comparable because the lower detection threshold and the consequent event rate may lead to a few EeV and-or few Glashow resonant signals within a decade.
