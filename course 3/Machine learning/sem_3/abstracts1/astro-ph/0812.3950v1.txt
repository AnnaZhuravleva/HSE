We study the prospects of finding the first quasars in the universe with ALMA and JWST. For this purpose, we derive a model for the high-redshift black hole population based on observed relations between the black hole mass and the host galaxy. We re-address previous constraints from the X-ray background with particular focus on black hole luminosities below the Eddington limit as observed in many local AGN. For such luminosities, up to 20% of high-redshift black holes can be active quasars. We then discuss the observables of high-redshift black holes for ALMA and JWST by adopting NGC 1068 as a reference system. We calculate the expected flux of different fine-structure lines for a similar system at higher redshift, and provide further predictions for high-J CO lines. We discuss the expected fluxes from stellar light, the AGN continuum and the Lyman $\alpha$ line for JWST. Line fluxes observed with ALMA can be used to derive detailed properties of high-redshift sources. We suggest two observational strategies to find potential AGN at high redshift and estimate the expected number of sources, which is between 1-10 for ALMA with a field of view of $\sim(1')^2$ searching for line emission and 100-1000 for JWST with a field of view of $(2.16')^2$ searching for continuum radiation. We find that both telescopes can probe high-redshift quasars down to redshift 10 and beyond, and therefore truely detect the first quasars in the universe.
