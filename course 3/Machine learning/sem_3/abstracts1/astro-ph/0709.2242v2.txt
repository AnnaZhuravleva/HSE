The black hole candidate XTE J1817-330 was discovered in outburst on 26 January 2006 with RXTE/ASM. One year later, on 28 February 2007, another X-ray transient discovered in 1996, XTE J1856+053, was detected by RXTE during a new outburst. We report on the spectra obtained by XMM-Newton of these two black hole candidates.
