We use a series of N-body simulations of the LCDM cosmology to investigate the redshift evolution since z=1 of the properties and alignment with the large-scale structure of haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids. We find that: (i) Once a rescaling of the halo mass with M*, the mass scale collapsing at redshift z, is performed, there is no further significant redshift dependence in the halo properties; (ii) The environment influences halo shape and formation time at all investigated redshifts for haloes with masses M<M*; and (iii) There is a significant alignment of both spin and shape of haloes with filaments and sheets. In detail, at all redshifts up to z=1: a) Haloes with M<M* tend to be more oblate when located in clusters than in the other environments; this trend is reversed at higher masses: above about M*, halos in clusters are typically more prolate than similar massive haloes in sheets, filaments and voids. b) Haloes with M>M* in filaments spin more rapidly than similar mass haloes in clusters; haloes in voids have the lowest median spin parameters; c) Haloes with M<M* tend to be younger in voids and older in clusters; d) In sheets, halo spin vectors tend to lie within the sheet plane independent of mass; in filaments, instead, haloes with M<M* tend to spin parallel to the filament and haloes with M>M* perpendicular to it. For masses M>M*, the major axis of haloes in filaments and sheets is strongly aligned with the filament or the sheet. Such halo-LSS alignments may be of importance in weak lensing analyses of cosmic shear. A question that is opened by our study is why, in the 0 < z < 1 redshift regime that we have investigated, the mass scale M* sets roughly the threshold below which the LSS-environment either begins to affect, or reverses, the properties of dark matter haloes.
