We present optical spectra of 14 emission-line stars in M33s giant HII regions NGC 592, NGC 595 and NGC 604: five of them are known WR stars, for which we present a better quality spectrogram, eight were WR candidates based on narrow-band imagery and one is a serendipitous discovery. Spectroscopy confirms the power of interference filter imagery to detect emission-line stars down to an equivalent width of about 5 A in crowded fields. We have also used archival HST/WFPC2 images to correctly identify emission-line stars in NGC 592 and NGC 588. emission-line stars in NGC 592 and NGC 588.
