The GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Explorer) spectroscopic survey mode, with a resolution of about 8 A in the FUV (1350 - 1750 A) and about 20 A in the NUV (1950 - 2750 A) is used for a systematic search of Ly-a emitting galaxies at low redshift. This aims at filling a gap between high-redshift surveys and a small set of objects studied in detail in the nearby universe. A blind search of 7018 spectra extracted in 5 deep exposures (5.65 sq.deg) has resulted in 96 Ly-a emitting galaxy candidates in the FUV domain, after accounting for broad-line AGNs. The Ly-a EWs (equivalent width) are consistent with stellar population model predictions and show no trends as a function of UV color or UV luminosity, except a possible decrease in the most luminous that may be due to small-number statistics. Their distribution in EW is similar to that at z about 3 but their fraction among star-forming galaxies is smaller. Avoiding uncertain candidates, a sub-sample of 66 objects in the range 0.2 < z < 0.35 has been used to build a Ly-a LF (luminosity function). The incompleteness due to objects with significant Ly-a emission but a UV continuum too low for spectral extraction has been evaluated. A comparison with H-a LF in the same redshift domain is consistent with an average Ly-a/H-a of about 1 in about 15 % of the star-forming galaxies. A comparison with high-redshift Ly-a LFs implies an increase of the Ly-a luminosity density by a factor of about 16 from z about 0.3 to z about 3. By comparison with the factor 5 increase of the UV luminosity density in the same redshift range, this suggests an increase of the average Ly-a escape fraction with redshift.
