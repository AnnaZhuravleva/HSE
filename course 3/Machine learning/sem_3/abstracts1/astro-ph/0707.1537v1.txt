We argue the behavior of Poynting flux-dominated outflows from AGN in the galactic cluster systems by performing three-dimensional MHD simulations within the framework of the "magnetic tower" model. Of particular interests are the structure of MHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, the (de)collimation, and the stability properties of magnetic tower jets. Transition between the jet/lobe and the formation of wiggling jet by growing current-driven instability are discussed.
