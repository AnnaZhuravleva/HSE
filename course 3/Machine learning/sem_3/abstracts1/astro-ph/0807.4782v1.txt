The fraction of ionizing photons which escape their host galaxy and so are able to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical parameter in studies of the reionization era and early galaxy formation. In this paper we combine observations of Lyman-alpha absorption towards high redshift quasars with the measured UV luminosity function of high redshift galaxies to constrain the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing photons from galaxies at z ~ 5.5-6. The observed Lyman-alpha transmission constrains the escape fraction to lie in the range f_esc ~ 10-25 % (at z ~ 5.5-6). Excluding halos with M< 10^10 M_sun (as might be expected if galaxy formation is suppressed due to the reionization of the IGM) implies a larger escape fraction of f_esc ~ 20-45 %. Using the numerical results to calibrate an analytic relation between the escape fraction and minimum galaxy halo mass we also extrapolate our results to a mass (M~10^8 M_sun) corresponding to the hydrogen cooling threshold. In this case we find f_esc ~ 5-10 %, consistent with observed estimates at lower redshift. We find that the escape fraction of high redshift galaxies must be greater than 5 % irrespepctive of galaxy mass. Based on these results we use a semi-analytic description to model the reionization history of the IGM, assuming ionizing sources with escape fractions suggested by our numerical simulations. We find that the IBG observed at z ~ 5.5-6 implies a sufficient number of ionizing photons to have reionized the Universe by z ~ 6. However, if the minimum mass for star-formation were greater than 10^9 M_sun, the IBG would be over-produced at redshifts less than z ~ 5. In summary, our results support a scenario in which the IGM was reionized by low mass galaxies.
