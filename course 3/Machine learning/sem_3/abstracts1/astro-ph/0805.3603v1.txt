We report on a 90 ks Suzaku observation of the radio-loud quasar 4C +74.26. The source was observed in its highest flux state to date, and we find that it brightened by about 20 per cent during the observation. We see evidence of spectral hardening as the count rate increases and also find that the rms variability increases with energy up to about 4 keV. We clearly detect a broadened Fe line but conclude that it does not require any emission from inside about 50 r_g, although a much smaller inner radius cannot be ruled out. The large inner radius of our best fit implies that the inner disc is either missing or not strongly illuminated. We suggest that the latter scenario may occur if the power-law source is located high above the disc, or if the emission is beamed away from the disc.
