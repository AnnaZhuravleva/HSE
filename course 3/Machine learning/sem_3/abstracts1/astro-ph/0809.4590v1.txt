We are currently involved in a multifaceted campaign to study extragalactic classical novae in the Local Group and beyond. Here we report on-going results from the exploitation of the POINT-AGAPE M31 dataset; initial results from our Local Group imaging, and spectroscopic CNe follow-up campaign and introduce the Liverpool Extragalactic Nova Survey.
