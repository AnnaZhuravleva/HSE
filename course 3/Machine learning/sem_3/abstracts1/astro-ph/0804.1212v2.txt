MWC 297 is a young massive nearby B[e] star. The central star has a large projected rotational velocity of 350 km/s. Despite the wealth of published observations, the nature of this object and its dust-rich surroundings is not well understood. With the present paper, we shed light on the geometrical structure of the circumstellar matter which produces the near- to mid-infrared flux excess, and construct an overall image of the source's appearance and evolutionary status. The H-, K- and N-band brightness distribution of MWC 297 is probed with the ESO interferometric spectrographs AMBER and MIDI. We have obtained visibility measurements on 3 AMBER and 12 MIDI baselines, covering a wide range of spatial frequencies. We have reconstructed the brightness distribution in H, K and N with a geometric model consisting of three Gaussian disks with different extent and brightness temperature. This model can account for the entire near- to mid-IR emission of MWC 297. The near- and mid-IR emission, including the silicate emission at 10 micron, emanates from a very compact region (FWHM < 1.5 AU) around the central star. We argue that the circumstellar matter in the MWC 297 system is organized in a disk, seen under moderate (i < 40 deg) inclination. The disk displays no inner emission-free gap at the resolution of our interferometric data. The low inclination of the disk implies that the actual rotational velocity of the star exceeds its critical velocity. We discuss the impact of this result in terms of the formation of high-mass stars, and the main-sequence evolution of classical Be stars.
