The temporal behaviour of the early optical emission from Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows can be divided in four classes: fast-rising with an early peak, slow-rising with a late peak, flat plateaus, and rapid decays since first measurement. The fast-rising optical afterglows display correlations among peak flux, peak epoch, and post-peak power-law decay index that can be explained with a structured outflow seen off-axis, but the shock origin (reverse or forward) of the optical emission cannot be determined. The afterglows with plateaus and slow-rises may be accommodated by the same model, if observer location offsets are larger than for the fast-rising afterglows, or could be due to a long-lived injection of energy and/or ejecta in the blast-wave. If better calibrated with more afterglows, the peak flux-peak epoch relation exhibited by the fast and slow-rising optical light-curves could provide a way to use this type of afterglows as standard candles.
