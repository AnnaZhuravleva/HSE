Solar prominences are cool 10$^4$ Kelvin plasma clouds supported in the surrounding 10$^6$ Kelvin coronal plasma by as-yet undetermined mechanisms. Observations from \emph{Hinode} show fine-scale threadlike structures oscillating in the plane of the sky with periods of several minutes. We suggest these transverse magnetohydrodynamic waves may represent Alfv\'en waves propagating on coronal magnetic field lines and these may play a role in heating the corona.
