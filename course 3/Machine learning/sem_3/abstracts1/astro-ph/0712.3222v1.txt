We propose a new method for determination of element abundances in stellar atmospheres aimed for the automatic processing of high-quality stellar spectra. The pan-spectral method is based on weighted cumulative line-widths Q of studied element. Difference in quantities Q found from synthetic and observed spectra gives a correction to the initial abundance. Final abundances are then found by rapidly converging iterations. Calculations can be made for many elements simultaneously and do not demand supercomputers.
