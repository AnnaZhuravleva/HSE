A mechanism is proposed to explain the outburst of comet 17P/Holmes based on; (a) oxidation of water within the porous surface of the comet nucleus to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through exposure to UV radiation, to energetic solar-wind particles and to cosmic radiation, (b) concentration of the H2O2 component through solid-, liquid- and gas-phase processes involving sublimation, evaporation, fractional crystallization, diffusion, supercooling, capillary wetting and migration in voids within the nucleus, and (c) rapid exothermic decomposition of aqueous H2O2 liberating oxygen gas via a surface catalytic reaction through interaction with finely-dispersed transition metals, metal compounds and minerals, in particular those containing Fe, localised within a differentiated multi-component comet nucleus. An accelerated release of gaseous oxygen, concomitant self-heating and volatilisation of hydrocarbons within the nucleus results in its explosive disruption. This mechanism may also explain the observation of a repeat outburst of this comet in 1893. Laboratory studies to investigate H2O2 formation in simulated cometary environments and to evaluate H2O2 decomposition on meteoritic samples are recommended.
