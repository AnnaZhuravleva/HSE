Recent direct $H(z)$ data indicate that the parameter $H(z)$ may wiggle with respect to $z$. On the other hand the luminosity distance data of supernovae flatten the wiggles of $H(z)$ because of integration effect. It is expected that the fitting results can be very different in a model permitting a wiggling $H(z)$ because the data of supernovae is highly degenerated to such a model. As an example the natural phantom dark energy is investigated in this paper. The dynamical property of this model is studied. The model is fitted by the direct $H(z)$ data set and the SNLS data set, respectively. And the results are quite different, as expected. The quantum stability of this model is also shortly discussed. We find it is a viable model if we treat it as an effective theory truncated by an upperbound.
