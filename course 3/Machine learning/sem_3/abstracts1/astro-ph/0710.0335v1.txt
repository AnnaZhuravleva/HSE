The microquasar 1E 1740.7-2942 is one of the most appealing source of the Galactic Centre region. The high energy feature detected once by SIGMA has been searched in the last years by INTEGRAL, but never confirmed. Classified as a persistent source, on 2004 it showed a quiescent-like state. In fact for few month 1E 1740.7-2942 was below the detector sensitivity level. We present the long term temporal behaviour of 1E 1740.7-2942 observed by INTEGRAL and RXTE in 2004 and 2005, as well as preliminary results on possible spectral transitions.
