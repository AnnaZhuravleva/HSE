We present a model-independent method to test for scale-dependent non-Gaussianities in combination with scaling indices as test statistics. Therefore, surrogate data sets are generated, in which the power spectrum of the original data is preserved, while the higher order correlations are partly randomised by applying a scale-dependent shuffling procedure to the Fourier phases. We apply this method to the WMAP data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and find signatures for non-Gaussianities on large scales. Further tests are required to elucidate the origin of the detected anomalies.
