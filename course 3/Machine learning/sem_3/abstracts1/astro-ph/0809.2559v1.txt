We present new abundances and radial velocities for stars in the field of the open cluster Tombaugh 2, which has been suggested to be associated with the Galactic Anticenter Stellar Structure (also known as the Monoceros stream). Using VLT/FLAMES with the UVES and GIRAFFE spectrographs, we find a radial velocity (RV) of <V_{r}> = 121 \pm 0.4 km/s using eighteen Tombaugh 2 cluster stars. Our abundance analysis of RV-selected members finds that Tombaugh 2 is more metal-rich than previous studies have found; moreover, unlike the previous work, our larger sample also reveals that stars with the velocity of the cluster show a relatively large spread in chemical properties (e.g., Delta[Fe/H] > 0.2). This is the first time a possible abundance spread has been observed in an open cluster, though this is one of several possible explanations for our observations. While there is an apparent trend of [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H], the distribution of abundances of these "RV cluster members" also may hint at a possible division into two primary groups with different mean chemical characteristics -- namely (<[Fe/H]>,<[Ti/Fe]>) ~ (-0.06, +0.02) and (-0.28, +0.36). Based on position and kinematics Tombaugh 2 is a likely member of the GASS/Monoceros stream, which makes Tombaugh 2 the second star cluster within the originally proposed GASS/Monoceros family. However, we explore other possible explanations for the observed spread in abundances and two possible sub-populations, with the most likely explanation being that the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28), more centrally-concentrated population being the true Tombaugh 2 clusters stars and the metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.06) population being an overlapping, and kinematically associated, but "cold" (sigma_V < 2 km/s) stellar stream at R_{gc} >= 15 kpc.
