Many astrophysicists believe that Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars (AXP), Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGR), Rotational Radio Transients (RRAT), Compact Central Objects (CCO), and X-Ray Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (XDINS) belong to different classes of anomalous objects with neutron stars as the central bodies inducing all their observable peculiarities. We have shown earlier (I.F.Malov and G.Z.Machabeli, Astron. Astrophys. Trans. 25, 7, 2006) that AXPs and SGRs could be described by the drift model in the framework of preposition on usual properties of the central neutron star (rotation periods P ~ 0.1 - 1 sec, surface magnetic fields B ~ 10^11 - 10^13 G). Here we shall try to show that some differences of considered sources will be explained by their geometry (particularly, by the angle BETA between their rotation and magnetic axes). If BETA < 10 deg. (the aligned rotator) the drift waves at the outer layers of the neutron star magnetosphere should play a key role in the observable periodicity. For large values of BETA (the case of the nearly orthogonal rotator) an accretion from the surrounding medium (for example, from the relic disk) can cause some modulation and transient events in received radiation.
