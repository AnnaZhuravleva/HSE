Several recent studies indicate that bulges are more complex than merely structureless relaxed stellar systems. We study the HST images of a sample of 130 nearby early type (S0-Sab) disc galaxies and detect pure structureless bulges with the Sersic index n > 2 for only 12% of the galaxies. Other galaxies show varied substructure in their inner regions (inner bars, inner spiral arms, inner rings) and sometimes contain no bulge at all. Inner substructure is more common for these galaxies, which also display structure at larger scales.
