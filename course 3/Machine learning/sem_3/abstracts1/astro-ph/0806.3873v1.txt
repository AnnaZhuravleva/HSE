We study the development of finite eccentricity in accretion disks in close binary systems using a two-dimensional grid-based numerical scheme. We perform detailed parameter studies to explore the dependence on viscosity, disk aspect ratio, the inclusion of a mass-transfer stream and the role of the boundary conditions. We consider mass ratios 0.05<q<0.3 appropriate to superoutbursting cataclysmic binary systems.   Instability to the formation of a precessing eccentric disk that attains a quasi-steady state with mean eccentricity in the range 0.3-0.5 occurs readily. The shortest growth times are ~15 binary orbits for the largest viscosities and the instability mechanism is for the most part consistent with the mode-coupling mechanism associated with the 3:1 resonance proposed by Lubow. However, the results are sensitive to the treatment of the inner boundary and to the incorporation of the mass-transfer stream. In the presence of a stream we found a critical viscosity below which the disk remains circular.   Incorporation of a mass-transfer stream tends to impart stability for small enough viscosity (or, equivalently, mass-transfer rate through the disk) and does assist in obtaining a prograde precession rate that is in agreement with observations. For the larger q the location of the 3:1 resonance is pushed outwards towards the Roche lobe where higher-order mode couplings and nonlinearity occur. It is likely that three-dimensional simulations that properly resolve the disk's vertical structure are required to make significant progress in this case.
