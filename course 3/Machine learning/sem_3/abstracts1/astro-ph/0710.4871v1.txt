We present the detection of low-amplitude, long-period g-modes in two individual sdBV stars which are known to be p-mode pulsators. Only few of these hybrid objects, showing both p- and g-modes, are known today. We resolve the g-mode domain in HS0702+6043 and add HS2201+2610 to the list of hybrid pulsators. To discover the low-amplitude g-modes, a filtering algorithm based on wavelet transformations was applied to denoise observational data.
