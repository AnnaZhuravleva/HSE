Context: It is generally presumed that the outflows from a YSO are directed close to its rotation axis (i.e. along its angular momentum vector and orthogonal to any attendant accretion disc). Many YSOs are formed from dense prestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations of outflows and filaments may place useful constraints on the dynamics of core formation.   Aims: We explore this possibility, from the viewpoint of what it may tell us about the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress that we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and outflows to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently also an interesting issue.   Results: Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible selection effects or correlations between nearby outflows, we infer that the observed outflows have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that contain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions of the filaments and outflows are well defined, we infer statistically that 72% of outflows are within $45^{\rm o}$ of being orthogonal to the filament, and only 28% are within $45^{\rm o}$ of being parallel to the filament.   Conclusions: This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs driving the observed outflows had angular momenta which were approximately orthogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed. We briefly discuss the implications of this for two proposed core formation mechanisms.
