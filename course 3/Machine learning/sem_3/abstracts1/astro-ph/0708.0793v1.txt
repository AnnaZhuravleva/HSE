We obtain fields of a relativistic radiating star of non-static mass in the framework of higher dimensional spacetime. Assuming energy-momentum tensor in Higher dimensions analogous to that considered by Vaidya in 4 dimensions we obtain solution of a radiating spherically symmetric star. The solution obtained here is new in higher dimensions which however reduces to that obtained by Vaidya in 4 dimensions. It is also different in form from that obtained by Iyer and Vishveshwara. The interesting observation is that the radius of a radiating star in higher dimensions oscillates. The radial size of radiating star oscillates with a period which depends on the modes of vibration and dimensions of the space-time.
