We report the discovery of a new open cluster (OC) in the Galaxy at $\ell=167.0^\circ$ and $b=-1.0^\circ$. Its field includes the planetary nebula (PN) PK 167-0.1. We study the possible associations of the PN/OC pairs NGC 2818/NGC 2818A, NGC 2438/M 46 (NGC 2437), PK 6+2.5/NGC 6469, as well as of the PN PK 167-0.1 with New Cluster 1. The analyses are based on near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and stellar radial density profiles (RDPs). NGC 6469 is located in a heavily contaminated bulge field. The CMD morphology, especially for the latter two cases, is defined with a field star decontamination algorithm applied to the 2MASS \jj, \hh, and \ks photometry. Field decontamination for the OCs NGC 2818A and M 46 produced better defined CMDs and more accurate cluster parameters than in the literature. Those pieces of evidence point to M 46 as physically associated with the PN NGC 2438. The same occurs for the OC NGC 2818A and the PN NGC 2818, however previous radial velocity arguments indicate that they are not associated. The OC NGC 6469 does not appear to be associated with the PN PK 6+2.5, which probably belongs to the bulge. Finally, the distance of the OC New Cluster 1 is consistent with a physical association with the PN PK 167-0.1.
