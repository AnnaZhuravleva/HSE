The evolution of the primordial low mass black hole (PBH) in hot universe is considered. Increase of mass and decrease of PBH spin due to the accretion of radiation dominated matter are estimated with using of results of numerical simulation of PBH formation and approximate relations for accretion to a rotating black hole.
