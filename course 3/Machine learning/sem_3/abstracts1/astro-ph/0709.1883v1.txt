Following procedures pioneered by Castor, Abbott & Klein (1975, [CAK]), spherically-symmetric supersonic winds for O stars are computed for matching to plane-parallel moving reversing layers (RL's) from Paper I (Lucy 2007). In contrast to a CAK wind, each of these solutions is singularity-free, thus allowing its mass-loss rate to be fixed by the regularity condition at the sonic point within the RL. Moreover, information propagation in these winds by radiative-acoustic waves is everywhere outwardly-directed, justifying the implicit assumption in Paper I that transonic flows are unaffected by inwardly-directed wave motions.
