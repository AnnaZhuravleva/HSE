The basic idea of the kd-tree algorithm is to recursively partition a point set P by hyperplanes, and to store the obtained partitioning in a binary tree. Due to its immense popularity, many applications in astronomy have been implemented. The algorithm can been used to solve a near neighbor problem for cross-identification of huge catalogs and realize the classification of astronomical objects. Since kd-tree can speed up query and partition spaces, some approaches based on it have been applied for photometric redshift measurement. We give the case studies of kd-tree in astronomy to show its importance and performance.
