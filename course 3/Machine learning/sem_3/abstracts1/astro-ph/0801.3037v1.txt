The new EAS Cherenkov array Tunka-133, with about 1 km**2 sensitive area, is being installed in the Tunka Valley since the end of 2005. This array will permit a detailed study of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the mass composition in the energy range of 10**15-10**18 eV with a unique method. The array will consist of 19 clusters, each composed of 7 optical detectors. The first cluster started operation in October 2006. We describe the data acquisition system and present preliminary results from data taken with the first cluster.
