We use a disk galaxy evolution model to investigate the impact of mass outflows (a.k.a. feedback) on disk galaxy scaling relations. Our model follows the accretion, cooling, star formation and ejection of baryonic mass inside growing dark matter haloes, with cosmologically motivated specific angular momentum distributions. Models without feedback produce disks that are too small and rotate too fast. Feedback reduces the baryonic masses of galaxies, resulting in larger disks with lower rotation velocities. Models with feedback can reproduce the zero points of the scaling relations between rotation velocity, stellar mass and disk size, but only in the absence of adiabatic contraction. Our feedback mechanism is maximally efficient in expelling mass, but our successful models require 25% of the SN energy, or 100% of the SN momentum, to drive the outflows. It remains to be seen whether such high efficiencies are realistic or not. Our energy and momentum driven wind models result in different slopes of various scaling relations, such as size - stellar mass, stellar mass - halo mass, and metallicity - stellar mass. Observations favor the energy driven wind at stellar masses below Mstar = 10^{10.5} Msun, but the momentum driven wind model at high masses. The ratio between the specific angular momentum of the baryons to that of the halo, (j_gal/m_gal), is not unity in our models. Yet this is the standard assumption in models of disk galaxy formation. Feedback preferentially ejects low angular momentum material because star formation is more efficient at smaller galactic radii. This results in (j_gal/m_gal) increasing with decreasing halo mass. This effect helps to resolve the discrepancy between the high spin parameters observed for dwarf galaxies with the low spin parameters predicted from LCDM. [Abridged]
