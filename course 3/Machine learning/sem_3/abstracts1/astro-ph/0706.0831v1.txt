Dim radio-quiet neutron star (DRQNS) 1E 1207.4-5209 is one of the most heavily examined isolated neutron stars. Wide absorption lines were observed in its spectrum obtained by both XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray satellites. These absorption lines can be interpreted as a principal frequency centered at 0.7 keV and its harmonics at 1.4, 2.1 and possibly 2.8 keV. The principal line can be formed by resonant proton cyclotron scattering leading to a magnetic field which is two orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular component of the surface dipole magnetic field (B) found from the rotation period (P) and the time rate of change in the rotation period (\.{P}) of 1E 1207.4-5209. Besides, age of the supernova remnant (SNR) G296.5+10.0 which is physically connected to 1E 1207.4-5209 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic age ($\tau$=P/2\.{P}) of the neutron star. These huge differences between the magnetic field values and the ages can be explained based on a B-decay model. If the decay is assumed to be exponential, the characteristic decay time turns out to be several thousand years which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the characteristic decay time of radio pulsars represented in an earlier work. The lack of detection of radio emission from DRQNSs and the lack of point sources and pulsar wind nebulae in most of the observed SNRs can also be partly explained by such a very rapid exponential decay. The large difference between the characteristic decay times of DRQNSs and radio pulsars must be related to the differences in the magnetic fields, equation of states and masses of these isolated neutron stars.
