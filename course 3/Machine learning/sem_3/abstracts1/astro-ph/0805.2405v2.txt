We study wave instability in an collisionless, rarefied hot plasma (e.g. solar wind or corona). We consider the anisotropy produced by the magnetic field, when the thermal gas pressures across and along the field become unequal. We apply the 16-moment transport equations (obtained from the Boltzmann-Vlasov kinetic equation) including the anisotropic thermal fluxes. The general dispersion relation for the incompressible wave modes is derived. It is shown that a new, more complex wave spectrum with stable and unstable behavior is possible, in contrast to the classic fire-hose modes obtained in terms of the 13-moment integrated equations.
