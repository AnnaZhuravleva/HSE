Considering thermal conduction, compressive viscosity and optically thin radiation as damping mechanisms for MHD waves, we derive a six-order general dispersion relation. We point out a fundamental flaw in the derivation of five-order dispersion relation by Kumar and Kumar (2006) who adopt as a basis vector. The correct definition of the motion in the x-z plane (2-D vector space) stems from the two independent variables, namely .
