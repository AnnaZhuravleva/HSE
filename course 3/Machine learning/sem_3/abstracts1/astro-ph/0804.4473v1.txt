The ever-expanding depth and quality of photometric and spectroscopic observations of stellar populations increase the need for theoretical models in regions of age-composition parameter space that are largely unexplored at present. Stellar evolution models that employ the most advanced physics and cover a wide range of compositions are needed to extract the most information from current observations of both resolved and unresolved stellar populations. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is a collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that spans a range of [Fe/H] from -2.5 to +0.5, [alpha/Fe] from -0.2 to +0.8 (for [Fe/H] <=0) or +0.2 (for [Fe/H] >0), and initial He mass fractions from Y=0.245 to 0.40. Stellar evolution tracks were computed for masses between 0.1 and 4 Msun, allowing isochrones to be generated for ages as young as 250 Myr. For the range in masses where the core He flash occurs, separate He-burning tracks were computed starting from the zero age horizontal branch. The tracks and isochrones have been transformed to the observational plane in a variety of photometric systems including standard UBV(RI)c, Stromgren uvby, SDSS ugriz, 2MASS JHKs, and HST ACS-WFC and WFPC2. The Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database is accessible through a website at http://stellar.dartmouth.edu/~models/ where all tracks, isochrones, and additional files can be downloaded.
