Hubble Space Telescope images of the Helix Planetary Nebula are interpreted using the hydro-gravitational-dynamics theory (HGD) of Gibson 1996-2006. HGD claims that baryonic-dark-matter (BDM) dominates the halo masses of galaxies (Schild 1996) as Jovian (Primordial-fog-particle [PFP]) Planets (JPPs) in proto-globular-star-cluster (PGC) clumps for all galaxy halo diameters bounded by stars. From HGD, supernova Ia (SNe Ia) events always occur in planetary nebulae (PNe) within PGCs. The dying central star of a PNe slowly accretes JPP mass to grow the white-dwarf to instability. Plasma jets, winds and radiation driven by contraction and spin-up of the carbon star evaporate JPPs revealing its Oort accretional cavity. SNe Ia events may thus be obscured or not obscured by radiation-inflated JPP atmospheres producing systematic SNe Ia distance errors, so the otherwise mysterious ``dark energy'' concept is unnecessary. HST/ACS and WFPC2 Helix images show >7,000 cometary globules and SST/IRAC images show >20,000-40,000, here interpreted as gas-dust cocoons of JPPs evaporated by the spin powered radiation of the PNe central white-dwarf. Observed JPP masses fossilizes the primordial density existing when the plasma universe fragmented into proto-superclusters, proto-clusters, and proto-galaxies. Pulsar scintillation spectra support the postulated multi-planet atmospheres.
