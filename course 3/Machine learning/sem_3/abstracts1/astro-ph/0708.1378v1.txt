While the radio-loud, obscured quasars (the radio galaxies) have been known and studied for decades, new and sensitive X-ray and mid-infrared surveys are now beginning to reveal large numbers of their radio-quiet counterparts beyond the local Universe. Consequently, we are approaching the compilation of a relatively complete census of AGN of all types coving a large fraction of cosmic time. This is revealing a remarkably intimate connection between the supermassive black hole and its host galaxy. The workshop reported here was designed to explore the results of these rapid observational developments and the nature of the relationships between the stellar and AGN components.
