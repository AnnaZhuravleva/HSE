We present observations of the Crab Nebula above 20 keV by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope during more than 5 years of operations. Our study demonstrates the stability of the instrument with time and allows a detailed analysis of the emission observed from the Crab Nebula between 20 keV and 1 MeV. The flux stability is discussed and serves a robust spectral shape analysis. We find that a single power law is clearly excluded since the photon spectrum presents a curvature in the considered energy domain. We have modelled it by a broken power law with the energy break fixed to 100 keV and determined the two photon indices together with the 100 keV flux for 9 periods between 2004 and 2008. The spectral shape of the Crab nebula is very stable as well as its intensity and connects nicely with previous measurements, at lower (X-rays) or higher (MeV) energies.
