We study the properties of the shock waves for a viscous accretion flow having low angular momentum in presence of synchrotron cooling. We present all possible accretion solutions in terms of flow parameters. We identify the region of the parameter space for steady and oscillating shocks and show the effect of various energy dissipation processes on it. We discuss the role of the shock waves while explaining the observations from black hole candidates.
