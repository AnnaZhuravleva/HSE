The ISO/LWS far-infrared spectrum of the ultraluminous galaxy Mkn 231 shows OH and H_2O lines in absorption from energy levels up to 300 K above the ground state, and emission in the [O I] 63 micron and [C II] 158 micron lines. Our analysis shows that OH and H_2O are radiatively pumped by the far-infrared continuum emission of the galaxy. The absorptions in the high-excitation lines require high far-infrared radiation densities, allowing us to constrain the properties of the underlying continuum source. The bulk of the far-infrared continuum arises from a warm (T_dust=70-100 K), optically thick (tau_100micron=1-2) medium of effective diameter 200-400 pc. In our best-fit model of total luminosity L_IR, the observed OH and H2O high-lying lines arise from a luminous (L/L_IR~0.56) region with radius ~100 pc. The high surface brightness of this component suggests that its infrared emission is dominated by the AGN. The derived column densities N(OH)>~10^{17} cm^{-2} and N(H_2O)>~6x10^{16} cm^{-2} may indicate XDR chemistry, although significant starburst chemistry cannot be ruled out. The lower-lying OH, [C II] 158 micron, and [O I] 63 micron lines arise from a more extended (~350 pc) starburst region. We show that the [C II] deficit in Mkn 231 is compatible with a high average abundance of C+ because of an extreme overall luminosity to gas mass ratio. Therefore, a [C II] deficit may indicate a significant contribution to the luminosity by an AGN, and/or by extremely efficient star formation.
