The objective of this article is to use Fourier-Hankel decomposition as suggested earlier by Braun & Fan (1998) to estimate the integrated horizontal meridional flow velocity as a function of mode penetration depth, and to find ways of potentially improve this technique. We use a time series of 43200 (30 days) consecutive full-disk Dopplergrams obtained by the MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager) instrument aboard the SOHO (Solar Heliospheric Observatory) spacecraft in April 1999. We find averaged meridional flow estimates of 15 m/s for modes with a penetration depth in the upper 20 Mm of the solar convection zone. This reproduces the results of the earlier investigations. Moreover we conclude that this method has the potential to become a new technique to measure the meridional circulation in the deep convection zone, if some improvements will be applied.
