We present preliminary results from recent high-resolution double-degenerate merger simulations with the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. We put particular emphasis on verification and validation in our effort and show the importance of details in the initial condition setup for the final outcome of the simulation. We also stress the dynamical importance of including shocks in the simulations. These results represent a first step toward a suite of simulations that will shed light on the question whether double-degenerate mergers are a viable path toward type 1a supernovae. In future simulations, we will make use of the capabilities of the NuGrid collaboration in post-processing SPH particle trajectories with a complete nuclear network to follow the detailed nuclear reactions during the dynamic merger phase.
