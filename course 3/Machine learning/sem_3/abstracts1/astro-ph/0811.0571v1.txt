A summary of the current knowledge on hypervelocity stars (HVSs). HVSs are fascinating because their properties are linked to Sgr A* and the stellar environment of the Galactic Center. Observing the distribution of HVSs can address: 1) the nature of the black hole ejection mechanism, 2) the in-fall history of stars onto Sgr A*, 3) the types of stars orbiting Sgr A*, and 4) a unique measurement the shape of the Galaxy's dark matter potential. The challenge to observers is to find new HVSs and strengthen the connection between HVSs and the Galactic Center.
