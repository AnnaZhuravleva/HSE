The 4D Eigenvector 1 parameter space was introduced seven years ago as an attempt at multiwavelength spectroscopic representation of quasars. It appears to be the most effective diagnostic space for unifying the diversity of broad line AGN. This progress report shows that the diagnostic power of 4DE1 is confirmed using optical spectra from the SDSS, UV spectra from HST and X-ray spectra from XMM. Our introduction of the population A-B concept continues to provide useful insights into quasar diversity. Largely radio-quiet, high accreting, low BH mass Pop. A sources (FWHM H_beta <= 4000 km/s) show strong FeII emission, a soft X-ray excess and a CIV profile blueshift. Low accreting large BH mass Pop. B quasars (FWHM H_beta > 4000 km/s) include most radio-loud AGN and show weak FeII emission and little evidence for a soft X-ray excess or a CIV blueshift.
