Periodicity search in gamma-ray data is usually difficult because of the small number of detected photons. A periodicity in the timing signal at other energy bands from the counterpart to the gamma-ray source may help to establish the periodicity in the gamma-ray emission and strengthen the identification of the source in different energy bands. It may, however, still be difficult to find the period directly from X-ray data because of limited exposure. We developed a procedure, by cross-checking two X-ray data sets, to find candidate periods for X-ray sources which are possible counterparts to gamma-ray pulsar candidates. Here we report the results of this method obtained with all the currently available X-ray data of 8 X-ray sources. Some tempting periodicity features were found. Those candidate periods can serve as the target periods for future search when new data become available so that a blind search with a huge number of trials can be avoided.
