The standard model of gravitational structure formation is based on the Jeans 1902 acoustic theory, neglecting nonlinear instabilities controlled by viscosity, turbulence and diffusion. Because the Jeans scale L_J for the hot primordial plasma is always slightly larger than the scale of causal connection ct, where c is the speed of light and t is the time after the big bang, it has been assumed that no plasma structures could form without guidance from a cold (so L_J CDM is small) collisionless cold-dark-matter CDM fluid to give condensations that gravitationally collect the plasma. Galaxies by this CDM model form by gradual hierarchical-clustering of CDM halos to galaxy mass over billions of years. No observations exist of CDM halos. Gravitational instability is non-linear and absolute, controlled by viscous and turbulent forces or by diffusivity at Schwarz length scales smaller than ct. Because the universe during the plasma epoch is rapidly expanding, the first structures formed were at density minima by fragmentation when the viscous-gravitional scale L_SV first matched ct at 30,000 years to produce protosupercluster voids and protosuperclusters. Weak turbulence produced at expanding void boundaries guide the morphology of smaller fragments down to protogalaxy size just before transition to gas at 300,000 years. The size of the protogalaxies reflect the plasma Kolmogorov scale with a linear and spiral morphology predicted by the Nomura direct numerical simulations and confirmed by deep field space telescope observations. On transition to gas the kinematic viscosity decreases by ten trillion so the protogalaxies fragment as Jeans scale clouds, each with a trillion earth-mass planets, as predicted by Gibson 1996 and observed by Schild 1996.
