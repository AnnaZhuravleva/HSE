We employ an analytical approach to investigate the signatures of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) on the convergence power spectrum of weak lensing by large scale structure. It is shown that the BAOs wiggles can be found in both of the linear and nonlinear convergence power spectra of weak lensing at about $40\le l\le600$, but they are weaker than that of matter power spectrum. Although the statistical error for LSST are greatly smaller than that of CFHT and SNAP survey especially at about $30<l<300$, they are still larger than the their maximum variations of BAOs wiggles. Thus, the detection of BAOs with the ongoing and upcoming surveys such as LSST, CFHT and SNAP survey confront a technical challenge.
