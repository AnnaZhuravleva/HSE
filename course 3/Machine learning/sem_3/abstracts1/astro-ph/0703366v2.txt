A non-perturbative nonlinear statistical approach is presented to describe turbulent magnetic systems embedded in a uniform mean magnetic field. A general formula in the form of an ordinary differential equation for magnetic field-line wandering (random walk) is derived. By considering the solution of this equation for different limits several new results are obtained. As an example, it is demonstrated that the stochastic wandering of magnetic field-lines in a two-component turbulence model leads to superdiffusive transport, contrary to an existing diffusive picture. The validity of quasilinear theory for field-line wandering is discussed, with respect to different turbulence geometry models, and previous diffusive results are shown to be deduced in appropriate limits.
