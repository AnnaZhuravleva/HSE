A brief review of the indirect detection signatures of dark matter is given. In particular, detection methods of dark matter particle annihilation to antimatter and gamma-rays are reviewed. With the GLAST satellite soon to be launched, a crucial window in the energy range of a few GeV up to 300 GeV will open. The good angular and energy resolution of the instrument means that structures predicted by cold dark matter models can be searched for. Large, currently planned ground-based imaging Cherenkov telescope arrays, may further improve the limits, or discover a signal, if the current understanding of halo dark matter structure is correct.
