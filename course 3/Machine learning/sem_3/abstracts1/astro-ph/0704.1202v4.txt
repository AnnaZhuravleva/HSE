Using a widely used stellar population synthesis model, we study the ability of using pairs of AB system colours to break the well-known stellar age--metallicity degeneracy and give constraints on the two stellar-population parameters (age and metallicity). The relative age and metallicity sensitivities of AB system colours that relate to u, B, g, V, r, R, i, I, z, J, H, and K bands are presented, and the abilities of various colour pairs for breaking the age--metallicity degeneracy are quantified by an uncertainty parameter (UP) method. Our results suggest that a few pairs of colours can be used to constrain the two above stellar-population parameters. This will be very useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies. In detail, colour pairs [(r-K), (u-R)] and [(r-K), (u-r)] are shown to be the best pairs for estimating stellar ages and metallicities. They can constrain two stellar-population parameters on average with age uncertainties less than 3.89 Gyr and metallicity uncertainties less than 0.34 dex for typical uncertainties in colours. Some other colour pairs, such as [(R-K), (u-R)], [(I-K), (u-R)], [(R-K), (u-r)] and [(i-J), (u-R)], can possibly be used for constraining the two parameters, too. As a whole, our results suggest that colours relating to both UBVRIJHK and ugriz magnitudes are much better than either UBVRIJHK colours or ugriz colours for breaking the well-known degeneracy. The results also show that the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) can be estimated via photometry data. It is also shown that the colours can be used in conjunction with line indices to measure stellar-population parameters.
