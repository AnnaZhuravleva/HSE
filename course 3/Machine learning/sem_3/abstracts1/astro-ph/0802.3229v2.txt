An unexpected alignment of 2-4-8-16 cosmic microwave background spherical harmonic directions with the direction of a surprisingly large WMAP temperature minimum, a large radio galaxy void, and an unexpected alignment and handedness of galaxy spins have been observed. The alignments point to RA=202 degrees, delta = 25 degrees and are termed the ``Axis of Evil''. Already many authors have commented about how the AE impacts our understanding of how structure emerged in the Universe within the framework of Lamda-CDM, warm dark matter, string theory, and hydro-gravitational dynamics (HGD). The latter uniquely predicts the size scales of the voids and matter condensations, based upon estimates of fluid forces in the early phases of structure formation. Reported departures from simple Gaussian properties of the WMAP data favor two regimes of turbulent structure formation, and from these we make predictions of the nature of finer structure expected to be measured with the PLANCK spacecraft.   From HGD, friction has limited the expansion of superclusters to 30 Mpc but supervoids have expanded with the universe to 300 Mpc.
