We present absorption line strength maps of a sample of 24 representative early-type spiral galaxies, mostly of type Sa, obtained as part of the SAURON survey of nearby galaxies using our custom-built integral-field spectrograph. Using high-quality spectra, spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, we measure several key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from the Lick/IDS system over a contiguous two-dimensional field including bulge and inner disc. We present maps of H beta, Fe 5015 and Mg b, for each galaxy   The absorption line maps show that many galaxies contain some younger populations (<= 1 Gyr), distributed in small or large inner discs, or in circumnuclear star forming rings. In many cases these young stars are formed in circumnuclear mini-starbursts, which are dominating the light in the centres of some of the early-type spirals. These mini-starburst cause a considerable scatter in index-index diagrams such as Mg b- H beta and Mg b -Fe 5015, more than is measured for early-type galaxies. We find that the central regions of Sa galaxies display a wide range in ages, even within the galaxies. 50% of the sample show velocity dispersion drops in their centres.   All of the galaxies of our sample lie on or below the Mg b- $\sigma$ relation for elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster, and above the H beta absorption line - $\sigma$ relation for elliptical galaxies. If those relations are considered to be relations for the oldest local galaxies we see that our sample of spirals has a considerable scatter in age, with the largest scatter at the lowest $\sigma$. This is in disagreement with highly inclined samples, in which generally only old stellar populations are found in the central regions.   All this can be understood if ...
