The atmospheres of (exo) planets and moons, as well as reflection nebulae, contain in general independently scattering particles in random orientation and are often supposed to be plane-parallel. Relations are presented for the (bidirectional) reflection function and several related functions of such a medium in case the directions of incidence and reflection both tend to horizontal directions. The results are quite general. The medium may be semi-infinite or finite, with or without a reflecting surface underneath, and vertically homogeneous or inhomogeneous. Some approximative formulae for the reflection function of a plane-parallel medium with independently scattering particles in random orientation, including Lambert's law, may be very inaccurate if the directions of incidence and reflection are both nearly horizontal.
