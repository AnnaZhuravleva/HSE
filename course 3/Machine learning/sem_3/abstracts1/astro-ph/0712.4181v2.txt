Recently there has been a growing evidence in favor of the presence of an Intermediate Mass Black Hole in the globular cluster G1, in Andromeda Galaxy. In this paper, we explore whether the adiabatic growth in the dark matter density due to the presence of a black hole could result in an observable gamma ray signal due to dark matter annihilation in this globular cluster. Starting from an initial NFW matter profile, with density parameters consistent with G1 observations, we find that indeed, if the spike in the density has been formed and has survived till present, the signal could be observed by GLAST and current ACT detectors.
