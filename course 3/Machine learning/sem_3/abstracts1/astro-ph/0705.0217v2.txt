The full three-year WMAP results (WMAP3) reinforce the absence of large-angle correlations at scales greater than 60 degrees. The Poincare dodecahedral space (PDS) model model, which may naturally explain such features, thus remains a plausible cosmological model, despite recent controversy about whether matched circle searches would or would not push the topology beyond the horizon. Here, we have used new eigenmode calculations of the dodecahedral space to predict the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations in such models, with an improved angular resolution. We have simulated CMB maps and confirmed the expected presence of matching circles. For a set of plausible cosmological parameters, we have derived the angular power spectrum of the CMB up to large wavenumbers. Comparison with the WMAP3 observations confirms a remarkable fit with a PDS model, for a value $\Omega_0 = 1.018$ of the average total energy density.
