Context. More than ten Centaurs are now known to have cometary activity at large heliocentric distance (i.e. $\simeq$ 5-13 AU). Among these objects, 174P/Echeclus which showed cometary activity at 13 AU from the Sun, is a unique case, because of: (i) the amplitude of its outburst, (ii) the source of cometary activity that appears distinct from Echeclus itself.   Aims. This paper aims at investigating the physical conditions that have led to this unusual outburst. The purpose is also to quantify this phenomenon and to provide observational constraints for its modeling.   Methods. We use observations from different telescopes, performed before, during, and after the outburst. We performed the main observations on March 23 and 30, 2006, with the 8.2-m ESO Very Large Telescope and FORS 1 instrument. They consist of visible images and spectra.   Results. Our main results are: (i) a cometary source distinct from Echeclus itself that presents a brightness distribution compatible with a diffuse source; (ii) a total dust production rate Q_dust equal to about 86 kg.s^-1 and a parameter Afrho equal to 10,000cm; (iii) no emission lines (CN and C_2) can be detected in the visible range; (iv) the upper limits for the CN and C_2 production rates are about 3.8x10^25 and 10^26 molecules.s^-1 respectively; (v) we detected no Echeclus' satellite before the outburst up to M_R equal to about 26; (vi) the upper limit for the object generating the coma is about 8 km in diameter; (vii) and we detected no cometary activity one year later, in March 2007.
