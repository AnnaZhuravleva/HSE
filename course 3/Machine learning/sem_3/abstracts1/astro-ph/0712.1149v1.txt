The thickness of isothermal gaseous layers and their midplane volume densities \rho_{gas}(R) were calculated for several spiral and LSB galaxies by solving the self-consistent equilibrium equations for gaseous discs embedded into a stellar one. The self-gravity of the gas and influence of dark halo on the disk thickness were taken into account. The resulting midplane volume densities of spiral galaxies were compared with the azimuthally averaged star formation rate SFR to verify the feasibility and universality of the Schmidt law SFR ~ \rho_{gas}^n.
