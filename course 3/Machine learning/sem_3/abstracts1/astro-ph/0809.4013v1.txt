We present the analysis of the variability of HD 170699, a COROT star showing the characteristics of a non evolutionary Delta Scuti star with high rotational velocity. There is a clear period of 10.45 c/d with 5.29 mmag amplitude in the y filter. From the data, it can be seen that the star shows multi-periodicity and it is necessary to add more frequencies to adjust the observations
