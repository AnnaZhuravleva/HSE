In the outer envelope of the Sun and in other stars, differential rotation and meridional circulation are maintained via the redistribution of momentum and energy by convective motions. In order to properly capture such processes in a numerical model, the correct spherical geometry is essential. In this paper I review recent insights into the maintenance of mean flows in the solar interior obtained from high-resolution simulations of solar convection in rotating spherical shells. The Coriolis force induces a Reynolds stress which transports angular momentum equatorward and also yields latitudinal variations in the convective heat flux. Meridional circulations induced by baroclinicity and rotational shear further redistribute angular momentum and alter the mean stratification. This gives rise to a complex nonlinear interplay between turbulent convection, differential rotation, meridional circulation, and the mean specific entropy profile. I will describe how this drama plays out in our simulations as well as in solar and stellar convection zones.
