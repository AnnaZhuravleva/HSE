PSR B1931+24 is the first intermittent radio pulsar discovered to date, characterized by a 0.8 s pulsation which turns on and off quasi-periodically every ~35 days, with a duty cycle of ~10%. We present here X-ray and optical observations of PSR B1931+24 performed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Isaac Newton Telescope, respectively. Simultaneous monitoring from the Jodrell Bank Observatory showed that this intermittent pulsar was in the radio-on phase during our observations. We do not find any X-ray or optical counterpart to PSR B1931+24 translating into an upper limit of ~2x10^{31} erg/s on the X-ray luminosity, and of g' > 22.6 on the optical magnitude. If the pulsar is isolated, these limits cannot constrain the dim X-ray and optical emission expected for a pulsar of that age (~1.6 Myr). We discuss the possibility that the quasi-periodic intermittent behavior of PSR B1931+24 is due to the presence of a low mass companion star or gaseous planet, tight with the pulsar in an eccentric orbit. In order to constrain the parameters of this putative binary system we re-analysed the pulsar radio timing residuals and we found that (if indeed hosted in a binary system), PSR B1931+24 should have a very low mass companion and an orbit of low inclination.
