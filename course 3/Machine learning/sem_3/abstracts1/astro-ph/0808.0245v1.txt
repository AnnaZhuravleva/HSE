We present self-similar solutions for advection -dominated accretion flows with thermal conduction in the presence of outflows. Possible effects of outflows on the accretion flow are parametrized and a saturated form of thermal conduction, as is appropriate for the weakly-collisional regime of interest, is included in our model. While the cooling effect of outflows is noticeable, thermal conduction provides an extra heating source. In comparison to accretion flows without winds, we show that the disc rotates faster and becomes cooler because of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by the winds. But thermal conduction opposes the effects of winds and not only decreases the rotational velocity, but increases the temperature. However, reduction of the surface density and the enhanced accretion velocity are amplified by both of the winds and the thermal conduction. We find that for stronger outflows, a higher level of saturated thermal conduction is needed to significantly modify the physical profiles of the accretion flow.
