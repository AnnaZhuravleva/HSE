We investigate the statistical anisotropy and Gaussianity of temperature fluctuations of Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB) data from {\it Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe} survey, using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, rescaled range and scaled windowed variance methods. The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis shows that CMB fluctuations has a long range correlation function with a multifractal behavior. By comparing the shuffled and surrogate series of CMB data, we conclude that the multifractality nature of temperature fluctuation of CMB is mainly due to the long-range correlations and the map is consistent with a Gaussian distribution.
