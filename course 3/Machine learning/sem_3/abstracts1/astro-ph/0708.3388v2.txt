Velocity shifts and differential broadening of radio recombination lines are used to estimate the densities and velocities of the ionized gas in several hypercompact and ultracompact HII regions. These small HII regions are thought to be at their earliest evolutionary phase and associated with the youngest massive stars. The observations suggest that these HII regions are characterized by high densities, supersonic flows and steep density gradients, consistent with accretion and outflows that would be associated with the formation of massive stars.
