The size distribution of the stability region around the Lagrangian point L4 is investigated in the elliptic restricted three-body problem as the function of the mass parameter and the orbital eccentricity of the primaries. It is shown that there are minimum zones in the size distribution of the stability regions, and these zones are connected with secondary resonances between the frequencies of librational motions around L4. The results can be applied to hypothetical Trojan planets for predicting values of the mass parameter and the eccentricity for which such objects can be expected or their existence is less probable.
