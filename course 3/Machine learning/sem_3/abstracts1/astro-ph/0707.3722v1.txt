SpectroWeb is an online maintained interactive graphical database of digital spectral atlases of spectral standard stars at http://spectra.freeshell.org . It is an efficient and user-friendly research tool for accurate analyses of stellar spectra observed with large spectral resolution, including the solar spectrum. The web-interface displays observed and theoretical stellar spectra, and comprehensively provides detailed atomic and molecular line information via user interaction. It fully integrates interactive spectrum visualization tools for the analysis, management, and maintenance of large volumes of spectral line-identification, -transition, and -property data. SpectroWeb 1.0 currently offers optical (3300-6800 A) flux normalized high-resolution spectra of Betelgeuse (M2), Arcturus (K1), The Sun (G2), Beta Aqr (G0), Procyon (F5), and Canopus (F0). The provided line identifications are based on state of the art spectrum synthesis calculations. The graphical database is under permanent development as an online repository of identified (absorption) lines in spectral standard reference stars, covering a broad range of stellar spectral types. Its object-oriented (Java) implementation offers future expansion capabilities to link and read stellar spectral atlases from various public internet sites.
