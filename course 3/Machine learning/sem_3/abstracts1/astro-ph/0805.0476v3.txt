This study inspects the light and radial-velocity curves of the eclipsing binary AV Del. In comparison with other studies already done, the study shows that the absolute elements, fundamental orbital and physical parameters of the system can be determined using the Wilson-Devinney code. Using these parameters, the configuration of the system is presented. Then, an accretion disc model for the system is introduced by using the SHELLSPEC code. The results indicate that AV Del is a semi-detached system in which an optically thick accretion disc is surrounding the primary star. The outer radius of the disc is 8.0 R_sun}, corresponding to a distance of 1.1 R_sun} from the surface of the secondary. Also, the temperature of the disc is calculated to be T=5700 K.
