We discuss the recent constraints on the nuclear equation of state from pulsar mass measurements and from subthreshold production of kaons in heavy-ion collisions. While recent pulsar data points towards a hard equation of state, the analysis of the heavy-ion data allows only for soft equations of state. We resolve the apparent contradiction by considering the different density regimes probed. We argue that future measurements of global properties of low-mass pulsars can serve as an excellent cross-check to heavy-ion data.
