We consider scalar-tensor theories and reconstruct their potential U(\Phi) and coupling F(\Phi) by demanding a background LCDM cosmology. In particular we impose a background cosmic history H(z) provided by the usual flat LCDM parameterization through the radiation (w_{eff}=1/3), matter (w_{eff}=0) and deSitter (w_{eff}=-1) eras. The cosmological dynamical system which is constrained to obey the LCDM cosmic history presents five critical points in each era, one of which corresponding to the standard General Relativity (GR). In the cases that differ from GR, the reconstructed coupling and potential are of the form F(\Phi)\sim \Phi^2 and U(\Phi)\sim F(\Phi)^m where m is a constant. This class of scalar tensor theories is also theoretically motivated by a completely independent approach: imposing maximal Noether symmetry on the scalar-tensor Lagrangian. This approach provides independently: i) the form of the coupling and the potential as F(\Phi)\sim \Phi^2 and U(\Phi)\sim F(\Phi)^m, ii) a conserved charge related to the potential and the coupling and iii) allows the derivation of exact solutions by first integrals of motion.
