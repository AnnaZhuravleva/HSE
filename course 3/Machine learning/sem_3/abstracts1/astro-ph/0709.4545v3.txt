The Sloan Digital Sky Survey turned out to be very efficient in identifying white dwarf/main sequence binaries (WDMS). The population of WDMS systems consists of wide systems whose stellar components evolve like single stars and - more interesting in the context of close binary evolution - PCEBs. We pursue a large-scale follow-up survey to identify and characterise the PCEBs among the WDMS binaries that have been found with SDSS. We use a two-step strategy with the identification of PCEBs among WDMS in the first and orbital period determinations in the second phase. Here we present first results of our VLT/FORS2 pilot-study that has the target of identifying the PCEBs among the fainter (g>~18.5) SDSS-WDMS. From published SDSS catalogues we selected 26 WDMS targets to be observed with VLT/FORS2. Using a spectral decomposition/fitting technique we determined the white dwarf effective temperatures and surface gravities, masses, and secondary star spectral types for all WDMS in our sample. We used the NaI 8183.27,8194.81 doublet to measure radial velocity variations of our targets and performed additional follow-up spectroscopy using Magellan-Clay/LDSS3 of two systems showing significant radial velocity variations. Among the 26 WDMS systems we find 9 strong PCEB candidates showing clear (>=3sigma) radial velocity variations and we estimate the fraction of PCEBs among SDSS WDMS to be ~35%. We find indications for a dependence of the relative number of PCEBs among SDSS-WDMS on the spectral type of the secondary star. These results are subject to small number statistics and need to be confirmed by additional observations. For two of the identified PCEB candidates, SDSSJ1047+0523 and SDSSJ1414-0132, we measured the orbital periods to be 9.17hrs and 17.48hrs respectively.
