The study of young star cluster (YSC) systems, preferentially in starburst and merging galaxies, has seen great interest in the recent past, as it provides important input to models of star formation. However, even some basic properties (like the luminosity function [LF]) of YSC systems are still under debate. Here we study the photometric properties of the YSC system in the nearest major merger system, the Antennae galaxies. We find evidence for the existence of a statistically significant turnover in the LF.
