IC348 is an excellent laboratory for studies of low-mass star formation being nearby, compact and rich. A Chandra observation was carried out early in the satellite's lifetime. The extensive new data in optical and infrared wavelengths accumulated in subsequent years have changed the cluster census calling for a re-analysis of the X-ray data.
