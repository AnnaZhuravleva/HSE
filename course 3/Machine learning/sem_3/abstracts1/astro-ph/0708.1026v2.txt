We present the results of observations of the radio emission from Supernova 2001gd in NGC 5033 from 2002 February 8 through 2006 September 25. The data were obtained using the Very Large Array at wavelengths of 1.3 cm (22.4 GHz), 2 cm (14.9 GHz), 3.6 cm (8.4 GHz), 6 cm (4.9 GHz), and 20 cm (1.5 GHz), with one upper limit at 90 cm (0.3 GHz). In addition, one detection has been provided by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 21 cm (1.4 GHz). SN 2001gd was discovered in the optical well past maximum light, so that it was not possible to obtain many of the early radio "turn-on" measurements which are important for estimating the local circumstellar medium (CSM) properties. Only at 20 cm were turn-on data available. However, our analysis and fitting of the radio light curves, and the assumption that the Type IIb SN 2001gd resembles the much better studied Type IIb SN 1993J, enables us to describe the radio evolution as being very regular through day ~550 and consistent with a nonthermal-emitting model with a thermal absorbing CSM. The presence of synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) at early times is implied by the data, but determination of the exact relationship between the SSA component from the emitting region and the free-free absorption component from the CSM is not possible as there are insufficient early measurements to distinguish between models. After day ~550, the radio emission exhibits a dramatically steeper decline rate which, assuming similarity to SN 1993J, can be described as an exponential decrease with an e-folding time of 500 days. We interpret this abrupt change in the radio flux density decline rate as implying a transition of the shock front into a more tenuous region of circumstellar material. A similar change in radio evolution has been seen earlier in other SNe such as SN 1988Z, SN 1980K, and SN 1993J.
