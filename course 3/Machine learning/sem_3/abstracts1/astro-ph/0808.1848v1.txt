In this study we present the absolute magnitude calibrations of thin disc main-sequence stars in the optical ($M_{V}$), and in the near-infrared ($M_{J}$). Thin disc stars are identified by means of Padova isochrones, and absolute magnitudes for the sample are evaluated via the newly reduced Hipparcos data. The obtained calibrations cover a large range of spectral types: from A0 to M4 in the optical and from A0 to M0 in the near-infrared. Also, we discuss the of effects binary stars and evolved stars on the absolute magnitude calibrations. The usage of these calibrations can be extended to the estimation of galactic model parameters for the thin disc individually, in order to compare these parameters with the corresponding ones estimated by $\chi{^2}_{min}$ statistics (which provides galactic model parameters for thin and thick discs, and halo simultaneously) to test any degeneracy between them. The calibrations can also be used in other astrophysical researches where distance plays an important role in that study.
