Rapid variability of the TeV emission in several blazars implies a central black hole mass $M_{BH}<10^8M_\odot$, appreciably smaller than the values estimated from the $M_{BH}-L_{bulg}$ relation, and Doppler factors for the $\gamma$-ray emitting fluid much larger than those associated with radio patterns. We discuss the conditions in the central engine required to account for the short timescales and large luminosities observed, and propose some explanations for the inferred kinematics of the source on various scales.
