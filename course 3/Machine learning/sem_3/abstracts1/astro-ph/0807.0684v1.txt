The QCD phase transition has important consequences in the context of both the early universe as well as compact stars. Such transitions are being studied for high temperature and small chemical potential scenario in the laboratory. There are also plans to study systems with large chemical potential and small temperatures. Here we have reviewed the role of strange quark matter and the phase transition in all the above scenarios.
