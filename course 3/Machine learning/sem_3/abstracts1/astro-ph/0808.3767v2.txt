We investigate the angular two-point correlation function of temperature in the WMAP maps. Updating and extending earlier results, we confirm the lack of correlations outside the Galaxy on angular scales greater than about 60 degrees at a level that would occur in 0.025 per cent of realizations of the concordance model. This represents a dramatic increase in significance from the original observations by the COBE-DMR and a marked increase in significance from the first-year WMAP maps. Given the rest of the reported angular power spectrum C_\ell, the lack of large-angle correlations that one infers outside the plane of the Galaxy requires covariance among the C_\ell up to \ell=5. Alternately, it requires both the unusually small (5 per cent of realizations) full-sky large-angle correlations, and an unusual coincidence of alignment of the Galaxy with the pattern of cosmological fluctuations (less than 2 per cent of those 5 per cent). We argue that unless there is some undiscovered systematic error in their collection or reduction, the data point towards a violation of statistical isotropy. The near-vanishing of the large-angle correlations in the cut-sky maps, together with their disagreement with results inferred from full-sky maps, remain open problems, and are very difficult to understand within the concordance model.
