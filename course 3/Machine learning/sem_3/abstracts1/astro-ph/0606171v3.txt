A two-component fluid representing dark energy is studied. One of the components has a polytropic form, while the other has a barotropic form. Exact solutions are obtained and the cosmological parameters are constrained using supernova type Ia data. In general, an open universe is predicted. A big rip scenario is largely preferred, but the dispersion in the parameter space is very high. Hence, even if scenarios without future singularities can not be excluded with the allowed range of parameters, a phantom cosmology, with an open spatial section, is a general prediction of the model. For a wide range of the equation of state parameters there is an asymptotic de Sitter phase.
