Mergers of supermassive black hole binaries release peak power of up to ~10^57 erg/s in gravitational waves (GWs). As the GWs propagate through ambient gas, they induce shear and a small fraction of their power is dissipated through viscosity. The dissipated heat appears as electromagnetic (EM) radiation, providing a prompt EM counterpart to the GW signal. For thin accretion disks, the GW heating rate exceeds the accretion power at distances farther than 10^3 Schwarzschild radii, independently of the accretion rate and viscosity coefficient.
