New angular diameter determinations for the bright southern F8 supergiant Delta CMa enable the bolometric emergent flux and effective temperature of the star to be determined with improved accuracy. The spectral flux distribution and bolometric flux have been determined from published photometry and spectrophotometry and combined with the angular diameter to derive the bolometric emergent flux F = (6.50 plus/minus 0.24) x 10^7 W/m^2 and the effective temperature Teff = 5818 plus/minus 53 K. The new value for the effective temperature is compared with previous interferometric and infrared flux method determinations. The accuracy of the effective temperature is now limited by the uncertainty in the bolometric flux rather than by the uncertainty in the angular diameter.
