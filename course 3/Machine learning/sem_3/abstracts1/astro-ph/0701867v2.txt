Bayesian model selection provides the cosmologist with an exacting tool to distinguish between competing models based purely on the data, via the Bayesian evidence. Previous methods to calculate this quantity either lacked general applicability or were computationally demanding. However, nested sampling (Skilling 2004), which was recently applied successfully to cosmology by Muhkerjee et al. 2006, overcomes both of these impediments. Their implementation restricts the parameter space sampled, and thus improves the efficiency, using a decreasing ellipsoidal bound in the n-dimensional parameter space centred on the maximum likelihood point. However, if the likelihood function contains any multi-modality, then the ellipse is prevented from constraining the sampling region efficiently. In this paper we introduce a method of clustered ellipsoidal nested sampling which can form multiple ellipses around each individual peak in the likelihood.   In addition we have implemented a method for determining the expectation and variance of the final evidence value without the need to use sampling error from repetitions of the algorithm ; this further reduces the computational load by at least an order of magnitude. We have applied our algorithm to a pair of toy models and one cosmological example where we demonstrate that the number of likelihood evaluations required is ~ 4% of that necessary for using previous algorithms.   We have produced a fortran library containing our routines which can be called from any sampling code, in addition for convenience we have incorporated it into the popular CosmoMC code as CosmoClust.
