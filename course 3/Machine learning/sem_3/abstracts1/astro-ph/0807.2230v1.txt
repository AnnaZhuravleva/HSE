*AIMS: To study the interaction between young AGN and their host galaxies based on their ionized gas and radio emission, and to analyze possible implications for the radio galaxy evolution.   *METHODS: The [OIII] 5007 line and 5-GHz radio properties are compared and studied on a large, representative sample of GPS and CSS (i.e., young) quasars and radio galaxies as well as large-scale sources using [OIII] 5007 line and 5-GHz radio data from literature and our observations.   *RESULTS: Several correlations between the [OIII] 5007 line and 5-GHz radio emission have been found. The main result is that the [OIII] 5007 emission is strongly related to the GPS/CSS source size indicating that the [OIII] 5007 emission is clearly enhanced by the jet expansion through the host galaxy ISM. Shocks are the most likely enhancing mechanism, although jet-induced star formation could also be, partly, responsible for the [OIII] 5007 emission. The data also suggests a possible deceleration of the jet as it grows. In this case, however, the correlation is weak.
