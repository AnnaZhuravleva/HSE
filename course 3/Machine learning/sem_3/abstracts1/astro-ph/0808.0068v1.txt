An overview is given of the chemical processes that occur in primordial systems under the influence of radiation, metal abundances and dust surface reactions. It is found that radiative feedback effects differ for UV and X-ray photons at any metallicity, with molecules surviving quite well under irradiation by X-rays. Starburst and AGN will therefore enjoy quite different cooling abilities for their dense molecular gas. The presence of a cool molecular phase is strongly dependent on metallicity. Strong irradiation by cosmic rays (>100x the Milky Way value) forces a large fraction of the CO gas into neutral carbon. Dust is important for H2 and HD formation, already at metallicities of 10^-4-10^-3 solar, for electron abundances below 10^-3.
