We present a highly reliable flux-limited census of 18,949 point sources in the Galactic mid-plane that have intrinsically red mid-infrared colors. These sources were selected from the Spitzer Space Telescope GLIMPSE I and II surveys of 274 deg^2 of the Galactic mid-plane, and consist mostly of high- and intermediate- mass young stellar objects (YSOs) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The selection criteria were carefully chosen to minimize the effects of position- dependent sensitivity, saturation, and confusion. The distribution of sources on the sky and their location in IRAC and MIPS 24 microns color-magnitude and color-color space are presented. Using this large sample, we find that YSOs and AGB stars can be mostly separated by simple color-magnitude selection criteria into approximately 50-70% of YSOs and 30-50% of AGB stars. Planetary nebulae and background galaxies together represent at most 2-3% of all the red sources. 1,004 red sources in the GLIMPSE II region, mostly AGB stars with high mass- loss rates, show significant (>0.3 mag) variability at 4.5 and/or 8.0 microns. With over 11,000 likely YSOs and over 7,000 likely AGB stars, this is to date the largest uniform census of AGB stars and high- and intermediate mass YSOs in the Milky-Way Galaxy.
