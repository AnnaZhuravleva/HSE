We observed the first known very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitting unidentified source, TeV J2032+4130, for 94 hours with the MAGIC telescope. The source was detected with a significance of 5.6 sigma. The flux, position, and angular extension are compatible with the previous ones measured by the HEGRA telescope system five years ago. The integral flux amounts to (4.5+-0.3stat+-0.35sys)x10^{-13} ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above 1 TeV. The source energy spectrum, obtained with the lowest energy threshold to date, is compatible with a single power law with a hard photon index of Gamma=-2.0+-0.3stat+-0.2sys.
