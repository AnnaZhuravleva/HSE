We perform evolutionary calculations of binary stars to find progenitors of system with parameters similar to the eclipsing binary system V228. We show that a V228 binary system may be formed starting with an initial binary system which has a low main sequence star as an accretor. We also show that the best fitting model implies loss of about 50 per cent of initial total orbital momentum but only 5 per cent of initial total mass.
