We present spectroscopic evidence for a low-luminosity, low-excitation active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 1042, powered by an intermediate-mass black hole. These findings are significant in that the AGN is coincident with a compact star cluster known to reside in the nucleus, thus providing an example where the two types of central mass concentration coexist. The existence of a central black hole is additionally remarkable in that NGC 1042 lacks a stellar bulge. Objects such as NGC 1042 may have an important role in testing theories for the genesis of massive black holes in galaxy nuclei, and the extent to which they are in symbiosis with the larger stellar host.
