We report on the X-ray observation of the Seyfert 1 ESO323-G077 performed with XMM-Newton. The spectra show a complex spectrum with conspicuous absorption and emission features. The continuum emission can be modelled with a power law with an index of 1.99+/-0.02 in the whole XMM-Newton energy band, marginally consistent with typical values of Type-I objects. An absorption component with an uncommonly high equivalent Hydrogen column, n_H=5.82(+0.12/-0.11)x10^22 cm-2, is affecting the soft part of the spectrum. Additionally, two warm absorption components are also present. The lower ionised one has an ionisation parameter of Log(U)=2.14(+0.06/-0.07) and an outflowing velocity of v=3200(+600/-200) km/s. Two absorption lines located at ~6.7 and ~7.0 keV can be modelled with the highly ionised absorber. The ionisation parameter and outflowing velocity of the gas measured are Log(U)=3.26(+0.19/-0.15) and v=1700(+600/-400) km/s, respectively. Four emission lines were also detected in the soft energy band. The most likely explanation for these emission lines is that they are associated with an outflowing gas with a velocity of ~2000 km/s. The data suggest that the same gas which is causing the absorption could also being responsible of these emission features. Finally, the spectrum shows the presence of a relativistic iron emission line likely originated in the accretion disc of a Kerr BH with an inclination of ~25 deg. We propose a model to explain the observed X-ray properties which invokes the presence of a two-phase outflow with cone-like structure and a velocity of the order of 2,000-4,000 km/s. The inner layer of the cone would be less ionised, or even neutral, than the outer layer. The inclination angle would be lower than the opening angle of the outflowing cone.
