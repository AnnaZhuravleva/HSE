We report the results from our analysis of {\it Suzaku} XIS (0.5-10 keV) and HXD/PIN (15-40 keV) observations of five well-known local ULIRGs: {\em IRAS} F05189-2524, {\em IRAS} F08572+3915, Mrk 273, PKS 1345+12, and Arp 220. The XIS observations of F05189-2524 and Mrk 273 reveal strong iron lines consistent with Fe K$\alpha$ and changes in spectral shapes with respect to previous {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM-Newton} observations. Mrk 273 is also detected by the HXD/PIN at $\sim$1.8-$\sigma$. For F05189-2524, modeling of the data from the different epochs suggests that the change in spectral shape is likely due to the central source switching off, leaving behind a residual reflection spectrum, or an increase in the absorbing column. An increase in the covering fraction of the absorber can describe the spectral variations seen in Mrk 273, although a reduction in the intrinsic AGN luminosity cannot be formally ruled out. The {\it Suzaku} spectra of Mrk 273 are well fit by a ~94% covering fraction model with a column density of $\sim10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The absorption-corrected log[$L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$ / $L_{\rm IR}$] ratio is consistent with those found in PG Quasars. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum of PKS 1345+12 and Arp 220 seem unchanged from previous observations and their hard X-ray emission is not convincingly detected by the HXD/PIN. The large column density derived from CO observations and the large equivalent width of an ionized Fe line in Arp 220 can be reconciled by an ionized reflection model. F08572+3915 is undetected in both the XIS and HXD/PIN, but the analysis of unpublished {\em Chandra} data provides a new measurement at low energies.
