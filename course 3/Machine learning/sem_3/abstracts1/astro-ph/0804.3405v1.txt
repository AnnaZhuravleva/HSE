Using the ISOPHOT Serendipity Survey (ISOSS) at 170um a sample of galactic star-forming regions exhibiting very cold dust temperatures (< 20 K) and high masses (> 100 M_sun) has been established. We characterise the star-forming content of five regions that were selected as potential sites for early stage high-mass star formation using SCUBA (JCMT) and Spitzer observations. In every region we identify one to four submillimeter clumps with projected sizes between 0.1 and 0.4 pc. The dust temperatures range from 11.6 to 21.3 K and the estimated clump masses are 2 to 166 M_sun. Towards the majority of submillimeter peaks we find point sources in the near- to mid-infrared. Most are interpreted as low-mass young stellar objects but we also detect very red sources. They probably represent very young and deeply embedded protostars that continue to accrete clump material and may reach higher masses. Several candidate intermediate-mass proto- or pre-main-sequence stars embedded in the clumps are identified. A subset of four clumps may be massive enough (> 100 M_sun) to form high-mass stars and accompanying clusters. The absence of stellar precursors with current masses in the high-mass regime leave the type of star formation occuring in the clumps unsettled. We confirm the presence of large fractions of cold material as derived from large-scale far-infrared measurements which dominates the emission of most clumps and suggests that the star-forming process will continue.
