The formation of resonant planets pairs in exoplanetary systems involves planetary migration inside the protoplanetary disc : an inwards migrating outer planet captures in Mean Motion Resonance an inner planet. During the migration of the resonant pair of planets, the eccentricities are expected to rise excessively, if no damping mechanism is applied on the inner planet. We express the required damping action to match the observations, and we show that the inner disk can play this role. This result applies for instance to the system GJ 876 : we reproduce the observed orbital elements through a fully hydrodynamical simulation of the evolution of the resonant planets.
