IceCube is a 1 km$^3$ neutrino detector now being built at the South Pole. Its 4800 optical modules will detect Cherenkov radiation from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions. IceCube will search for neutrinos of astrophysical origin, with energies from 100 GeV up to $10^{19}$ eV. It will be able to separate $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$. In addition to detecting astrophysical neutrinos, IceCube will also search for neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun and the Earth, look for low-energy (10 MeV) neutrinos from supernovae, and search for a host of exotic signatures. With the associated IceTop surface air shower array, it will study cosmic-ray air showers.   IceCube construction is now 50% complete. After presenting preliminary results from the partial detector, I will discuss IceCube's future plans.
