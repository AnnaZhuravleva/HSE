We present new photometric observations of 15 symbiotic stars (EG And, Z And, AE Ara, BF Cyg, CH Cyg, CI Cyg, V1329 Cyg, TX CVn, AG Dra, Draco C-1, RW Hya, SY Mus, AR Pav, AG Peg, AX Per) covering their last orbital cycle(s) from 2003.9 to 2007.2. We obtained our data by both classical photoelectric and CCD photometry. Main results are: EG And brightened by about 0.3 mag in U from 2003. A 0.5 mag deep primary minimum developed in the U light curve (LC) at the end of 2006. Z And continues its recent activity that began during the 2000 autumn. A new small outburst started in summer of 2004 with the peak U-magnitude of about 9.2. During the spring of 2006 the star entered a massive outburst. It reached its historical maximum at U = 8.0 in 2006 July. AE Ara erupted in 2006 February with Dm(vis) approx. 1.2 mag. BF Cyg entered a new active stage in 2006 August. A brightness maximum (U approx. 9.4) was measured during 2006 September. CH Cyg persists in a quiescent phase. During 2006 June - December about 2 mag decline in all colours was measured. CI Cyg started a new active phase during 2006 May - June. After 31 years it erupted by about 2 mag in U. TX CVn maintains a bright stage with U approx. 10.5 from 2003. AG Dra entered a new major outburst in 2006 June. It reached its maximum at U = 8.0 in 2006 September. AR Pav persists at a low level of the activity. AG Peg's LC profile varies markedly during different orbital cycles. AX Per continues its quiescent phase.
