Direct solar coronal magnetic field measurements have become possible since recent development of high-sensitivity infrared detection technology. The SOLARC instrument installed on Mt. Haleakala is such a polarimetric coronagraph that was designed for routinely observing Stokes parameter profiles in near infrared (NIR) wavelengthes. The Fe$^{+12}$ 1075 nm forbidden coronal emission line (CEL) is potential for weak coronal magnetic field detection. As a first step the potential field model has been used to compare with the SOLARC observation in the Fe$^{+12}$ 1075 nm line (Liu and Lin 2008). It's found that the potential fields can be a zeroth-order proxy for approaching the observed coronal field above a simple stable sunspot. In this paper we further discuss several nodi that are hampering the progress for reconstructing the real coronal magnetic field structures. They include the well-known Van Vleck effect in linear polarization signals, ignorance of the information of the NIR emission sources (i.e., inversion problem of coronal magnetic fields), a fat lot of global non-linear force-free field tools available for better modeling coronal magnetic fields, and so on.
