In this letter we show that the presence of the long-range Coulomb force in dense stellar matter implies that the total charge cannot be associated with a chemical potential, even if it is a conserved quantity. As a further consequence, the analytical properties of the partition sum are modified, changing the order of the phase transitions and affecting the possible occurrence of critical behaviours. The peculiar thermodynamic properties of the system can be understood introducing a model hamiltonian in which each charge is independently neutralized by a uniform background of opposite charge.
