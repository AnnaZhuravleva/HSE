We study the black hole formation and the neutrino signal from the gravitational collapse of a non-rotating massive star of 40 Msun. Adopting two different sets of realistic equation of state (EOS) of dense matter, we perform the numerical simulations of general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics under the spherical symmetry. We make comparisons of the core bounce, the shock propagation, the evolution of nascent proto-neutron star and the resulting re-collapse to black hole to reveal the influence of EOS. We also explore the influence of EOS on the neutrino emission during the evolution toward the black hole formation. We find that the speed of contraction of the nascent proto-neutron star, whose mass increases fast due to the intense accretion, is different depending on the EOS and the resulting profiles of density and temperature differ significantly. The black hole formation occurs at 0.6-1.3 sec after bounce when the proto-neutron star exceeds its maximum mass, which is crucially determined by the EOS. We find that the average energies of neutrinos increase after bounce because of rapid temperature increase, but at different speeds depending on the EOS. The duration of neutrino emission up to the black hole formation is found different according to the different timing of re-collapse. These characteristics of neutrino signatures are distinguishable from those for ordinary proto-neutron stars in successful core-collapse supernovae. We discuss that a future detection of neutrinos from black-hole-forming collapse will contribute to reveal the black hole formation and to constrain the EOS at high density and temperature.
