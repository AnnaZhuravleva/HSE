If the gas in the evolving cosmic halos is dissipating energy (cooling) then due to the variation of the gravitational potential the dark matter halo also undergoes a compactification. This is well-known as Adiabatic contraction (AC). Complementary to the AC we investigate the resulting dynamical behaviour of the whole system if the backreaction of the AC of DM onto the gas is taken into account. In order to achieve sufficient high resolution also within the central halo region, we use a crude fluid approximation for the DM obeying the adiabatic contraction behaviour. Further, we restrict ourself to spherical symmetry and vanishing angular momentum of the studied matter configurations. The computations are done using a first-order Godunov type scheme. Our results show that the dynamical interaction between gas and DM may lead to significant shorter collapse times. If the gas cools the dynamical behaviour of the whole system depends strongly on the shape of the initial density profile. Our findings indicate that for a certain mass range of halo configurations the dynamical interaction between gas and DM might be important for the halo evolution and must be taken into account.
