In previous work stable approximately axisymmetric equilibrium configurations for magnetic stars were found by numerical simulation. Here I investigate the conditions under which more complex, non-axisymmetric configurations can form. I present numerical simulations of the formation of stable equilibria from turbulent initial conditions and demonstrate the existence of non-axisymmetric equilibria consisting of twisted flux tubes lying horizontally below the surface of the star, meandering around the star in random patterns. Whether such a non-axisymmetric equilibrium or a simple axisymmetric equilibrium forms depends on the radial profile of the strength of the initial magnetic field. The results could explain observations of non-dipolar fields on stars such as the B0.2 main-sequence star tau-Sco or the pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209. The secular evolution of these equilibria due to Ohmic and buoyancy processes is also examined.
