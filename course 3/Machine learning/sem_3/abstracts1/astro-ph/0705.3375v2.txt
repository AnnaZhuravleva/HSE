A class of Modified Gravity Models, consisting of inverse powers of linear combination of quadratic curvature invariants, is studied in the full parameter space. We find that singularity-free cosmological solutions, interpolating between an almost-Friedmann universe at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and an accelerating universe today, exist only in a restricted parameter space. Furthermore, for all parameters of the models, there is an unstable scalar mode of the gravitational field. Therefore we conclude that this class of Modified Gravity Models is not viable.
