Three models of a flat universe of coupled matter and dark energies with different low-redshift parameterizations of the dark energy equation of state are considered. The dark energy is assumed to vary with time like the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of cosmic matter. In the radiation-dominated era the models reduce to standard cosmology. In the matter-dominated era they are, for modern values of the cosmological parameters, consistent with data from SNe Ia searches and with the data of Gurvits et al.(1999)for angular sizes of ultra compact radio sources. We find that the angular size-redshift tests for our models offer a higher statistical confidence than that based on SNe Ia data. A comparison of our results with a recent revised analysis of angular size-redshift legacy data is made,and the implications of our models with optimized relativistic beaming in the radio sources is discussed. In particular we find that relativistic beaming implies a Lorentz factor less than 6,in agreement with its values for powerful Active Galactic Nuclei.
