HST NICMOS narrowband images of the shocked molecular hydrogen emission in OMC-1 are analyzed to reveal new information on the BN/KL outflow. The outstanding morphological feature of this region is the array of molecular hydrogen ``fingers'' emanating from the general vicinity of IRc2 and the presence of several Herbig-Haro objects. The NICMOS images appear to resolve individual shock fronts. This work is a more quantitative and detailed analysis of our data from a previous paper (Schultz etal. 1999).   Line strengths for the H_2 1--0 S(4) plus 2--1 S(6) lines at 1.89 micron are estimated from measurements with the Paschen_alpha continuum filter F190N at 1.90 micron, and continuum measurements at 1.66 and 2.15 micron. We compare the observed H_2 line strengths and ratios of the 1.89 micron and 2.12 micron 1--0 S(1) lines with models for molecular cloud shock waves. Most of the data cannot be fit by J-shocks, but are well matched by C-shocks with shock velocities in the range of 20--45 km/s and preshock densities of 10^{4} - 10^{6} cm^{-3}, similiar to values obtained in larger beam studies which averaged over many shocks. There is also some evidence that shocks with higher densities have lower velocities.
