What is the role of the constants of nature in physical theory? I hypothesize that the observable universe, u0, constitutes a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) constrained by algorithmically random logical tape parameters defining its material properties (a physical UTM). The finite non-zero empirical values of Planck's constant, h, and other constants of nature exemplify those logical parameters. Their algorithmic randomness is necessary and sufficient for the consistent operation of a physical UTM. At any given time, ti, these constants correspond to the first n random halt digits, Omega-n, of Chaitin's Halting Probability, Omega. Planck's equation E=hv and Boltzmann's relation S=kLogW are shown to apply to the operation of a physical UTM. The genomic evolution of u0 in constants of nature space (CON space) from an undecidable state in u0's Planck era to its current ordered condition occurs through the algorithmically random, symmetry-breaking addition of new constants to the laws by which u0 operates -- a process called logical tunneling. The temperature of u0 for t<=tp is shown to be T=0K. The energy dissipated when a physical UTM clears its memory after each computation is proposed as a candidate for cold dark matter (CDM) and is calculated to comprise 87.5% of the cosmological matter content, Omega-M, of u0. This result concurs with current astronomical estimates that 87.1% of the matter content of u0 consists of CDM. The energy incorporated in u0 through the process of logical tunneling from undecidable states of the complete Universe, E, to decidable states of u0 is suggested as a candidate for the unexplained "dark energy", Omega-X, hypothesized to drive the accelerating cosmological expansion of space and believed to constitute 66% of the critical mass, Omega-0, of the observable universe.
