We present a Very Long Baseline Interferometry image of the water maser emission in the nuclear region of NGC3393. The maser emission has a linear distribution oriented at a position angle of $\sim -34\degr$, perpendicular to both the kpc-scale radio jet and the axis of the narrow line region. The position-velocity diagram displays a red-blue asymmetry about the systemic velocity and the estimated dynamical center, and is thus consistent with rotation. Assuming Keplerian rotation in an edge-on disk, we obtain an enclosed mass of $(3.1\pm 0.2) \times 10^7 M_{\sun}$ within $0.36\pm 0.02$ pc ($1.48\pm 0.06$ mas), which corresponds to a mean mass density of $\sim10^{8.2} M_{\sun}$ pc$^{-3}$. We also report the measurement with the Green Bank Telescope of a velocity drift, a manifestation of centripetal acceleration within the disk, of $5\pm 1$ km s $^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ in the $\sim3880$ km s$^{-1}$ maser feature, which is most likely located along the line of sight to the dynamical center of the system. From the acceleration of this feature, we estimate a disk radius of $0.17\pm 0.02$ pc, which is smaller than the inner disk radius ($0.36\pm 0.02$ pc) of emission that occurs along the midline (i.e., the line of nodes). The emission along the line of sight to the dynamical center evidently occurs much closer to the center than the emission from the disk midline, contrary to the situation in the archetypal maser systems NGC4258 and NGC1068. The outer radius of the disk as traced by the masers along the midline is about 1.5 pc.
