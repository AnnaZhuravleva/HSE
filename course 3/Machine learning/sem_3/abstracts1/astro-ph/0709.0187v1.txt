The non-thermal X-rays from the SN 1006 NE rim present characteristic scale lengths that are interpreted in the context of diffusion of a relativistic electron. The adopted theoretical framework is the mathematical diffusion in 3D, 1D and 1D with drift as well as the Monte Carlo random walk in 1D with drift. The asymmetric random walk with diffusion from a plane can explain the scale widths of 0.04 pc upstream and 0.2 pc downstream in the non thermal intensity of X-ray emission in SN 1006. A mathematical image of the non thermal X-flux from an supernova remnant as well as profiles function of the distance from the center can be simulated. This model provides a reasonable description of both the limbs and the central region of SN 1006. A new method to deduce the magnetic field in supernova remnant is suggested.
