Searches for planets around evolved G-K subgiant and giant stars are essential for developing general understanding of planet formation and evolution of the planetary systems. Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of giants have lead to the discovery of ten planets around such star. However, the long period radial velocity variations of red giants may also have other than planetary nature. Non-radial oscillations or rotational modulation due to starspots can also induce RV variations, thereby mimicking the gravitational influence of low-mass companions. In this work we present bisector analysis of five carefully selected lines for two stars from our survey.
