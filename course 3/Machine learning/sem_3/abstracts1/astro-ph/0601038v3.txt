Within the context of a fractal paradigm that emphasizes nature's well-stratified hierarchical organization, the delta Scuti class of variable stars is investigated for evidence of discrete cosmological self-similarity. Methods that were successfully applied to the RR Lyrae class of variable stars are used to identify Atomic Scale analogues to delta Scuti stars and their relevant range of energy levels. The mass, pulsation mode and fundamental oscillation period of a well-studied delta Scuti star are shown to be quantitatively self-similar to the counterpart parameters of a uniquely identified Atomic Scale analogue. Several additional tests confirm the specificity of the discrete fractal relationship.
