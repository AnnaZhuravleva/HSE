We use the bulge Sersic index n and bulge-to-total ratio (B/T) to explore the fundamental question of how bulges form. We perform 2D bulge-disk-bar decomposition on H-band images of 143 bright, high stellar mass (>1.0e10 solar masses) low-to-moderately inclined (i<70 degrees) spirals. Our results are: (1) Our H-band bar fraction (~58%) is consistent with that from ellipse fits. (2) 70% of the stellar mass is in disks, 10% in bars, and 20% in bulges. (3) A large fraction (~69%) of bright spirals have B/T<0.2, and ~76% have low n<2 bulges. These bulges exist in barred and unbarred galaxies across a wide range of Hubble types. (4) About 65% (68%) of bright spirals with n<2 (B/T<0.2) bulges host bars, suggesting a possible link between bars and bulges. (5) We compare the results with predictions from a set of LCDM models. In the models, a high mass spiral can have a bulge with a present-day low B/T<0.2 only if it did not undergo a major merger since z<2. The predicted fraction (~1.6%) of high mass spirals, which have undergone a major merger since z<4 and host a bulge with a present-day low B/T<0.2, is a factor of over thirty smaller than the observed fraction (~66%) of high mass spirals with B/T<0.2. Thus, contrary to common perception, bulges built via major mergers since z<4 seriously fail to account for the bulges present in ~66% of high mass spirals. Most of these present-day low B/T<0.2 bulges are likely to have been built by a combination of minor mergers and/or secular processes since z<4.
