We study populations of High-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Galaxy using data of the INTEGRAL observatory in a hard X-ray energy band. More than two hundreds of sources were detected with INTEGRAL near the galactic plane (|b|<5 deg), most of them have a galactic origin and belong to high (HMXB) and low mass (LMXB) X-ray binaries. We investigated properties and spectra of a large sample of HMXBs and concluded that most of them are belong to X-ray pulsars. We also build the distribution of HMXBs for the whole Galaxy and showed that its peaks are practically coincident with spiral arm tangents. The obtained results are discussed in terms of some model estimations of the density of different components of the Galaxy.
