I present and discuss a unified scheme for jet launching that is based on stochastic dissipation of the accretion disk kinetic energy, mainly via shock waves. In this scheme, termed thermally-launched jet model, the kinetic energy of the accreted mass is transferred to internal energy, e.g., heat or magnetic energy. The internal energy accelerates a small fraction of the accreted mass to high speeds and form jets. For example, thermal energy forms a pressure gradient that accelerates the gas. A second acceleration stage is possible wherein the primary outflow stretches magnetic field lines. The field lines then reconnect and accelerate small amount of mass to very high speeds. This double-stage acceleration process might form highly relativistic jets from black holes and neutron stars. The model predicts that detail analysis of accreting brown dwarfs that launch jets will show the mass accretion rate to be larger than 10^{-9}-10^{-8} Mo/year, which is higher than present claims in the literature.
