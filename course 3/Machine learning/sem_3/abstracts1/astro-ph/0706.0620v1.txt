The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) offer an outstanding variety of young stellar associations, in which large samples of low-mass stars (with masses less than 1 solar mass) currently in the act of formation can be resolved and explored sufficiently with the Hubble Space Telescope. These pre-main sequence (PMS) stars provide a unique snapshot of the star formation process, as it is being recorded for the last 20 Myr, and they give important information on the low-mass Initial Mass Function (IMF) of their host environments. We present the latest results from observations with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) of such star-forming regions in the MCs, and discuss the importance of Hubble}for a comprehensive collection of substantial information on the most recent low-mass star formation and the low-mass IMF in the MCs.
