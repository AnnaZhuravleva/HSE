We report photometric observations of AL Com during its rare outburst in 2007. The light curve is reminiscent of its past superoutbursts in 1995 and 2001, except for the rebrightening phase after the main superoutburst. During the rebrightening phase in 2007, we found clear modulations between V=16.2-15.2. In conjunction with the lack of prominent superhumps in our time-series observations, the modulations can most naturally be interpreted as repetitive short rebrightenings with a cycle of 1-2 days. The rebrightening characteristics in 2007 are different from those in 1995 and 2001. This indicates that the type of rebrightenings in WZ Sge stars depends not on binary parameters of objects, but on the mass-accretion process for each outburst.
