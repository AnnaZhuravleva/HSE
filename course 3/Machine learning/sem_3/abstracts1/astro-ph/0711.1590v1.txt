The artificial viscosity is reconsidered in smoothed particle hydrodynamics to prevent inter-particle penetration, unwanted heating, and unphysical solutions. The coefficients in the Monaghan's standard artificial viscosity are considered as time variable, and a restriction on them is proposed such that avoiding the undesired effects in the subsonic regions. The shock formation in adiabatic and isothermal cases are used to study the ability of this modified artificial viscosity recipe. The computer experiments show that the proposal appears to work and the accuracy of this restriction is acceptable.
