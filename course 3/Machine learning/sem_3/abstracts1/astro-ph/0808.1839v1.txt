Using measured radial velocity data of nine double lined spectroscopic binary systems NSV 223, AB And, V2082 Cyg, HS Her, V918 Her, BV Dra, BW Dra, V2357 Oph, and YZ Cas, we find corresponding orbital and spectroscopic elements via the method introduced by Karami & Mohebi (2007a) and Karami & Teimoorinia (2007). Our numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained by others using more traditional methods.
