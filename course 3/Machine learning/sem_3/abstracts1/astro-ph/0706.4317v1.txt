We present a photoionization model study of the effects of micro-turbulence and dissipative heating on emission lines for number and column densities, elemental abundances, and ionizations typical for the narrow emission line regions (NLRs) of Seyfert galaxies. Earlier studies of NLR spectra generally found good agreement between the observations and the model predictions for most strong emission lines, such as [O III] $\lambda$5007, [O II] $\lambda$3727, [N II] $\lambda$6583, [Ne III] $\lambda$3869, and the H and He recombination lines. Nevertheless, the strengths of lines from species with ionization potentials greater than that of He$^{+}$(54.4 eV), e.g. N$^{+4}$ and Ne$^{+4}$, were often under-predicted. Among the explanations suggested for these discrepancies were (selectively) enhanced elemental abundances and contributions from shock heated gas. Interestingly, the NLR lines have widths of several 100 km s$^{-1}$, well in excess of the thermal broadening. If this is due to micro-turbulence, and the turbulence dissipates within the emission-line gas, the gas can be heated in excess of that due to photoionization. We show that the combined effects of turbulence and dissipative heating can strongly enhance N V $\lambda$1240 (relative to He II $\lambda$1640), while the heating alone can boost the strength of [Ne V] $\lambda$3426. We suggest that this effect is present in the NLR, particularly within $\sim$ 100 pc of the central engine. Finally, since micro-turbulence would make clouds robust against instabilities generated during acceleration, it is not likely to be a coincidence that the radially outflowing emission-line gas is turbulent.
