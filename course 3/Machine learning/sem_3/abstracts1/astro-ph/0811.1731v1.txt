The main properties of AGN are reviewed, focussing on the accretion process and on the question of whether AGN are the best factories of ultra high energy particles and photons. I recall the large differences between the accretion/ejection flows in strong and weak accretors, and I conclude that, since low luminosity AGN and even "dormant" massive black holes in nuclei of galaxies are powering strong confined magnetized jets able to accelerate high energy particles, and are present in a large proportion of galaxies, they might be better potential sources of high energy particles and photons than luminous AGN and powerful radio galaxies.
