In the present paper, it is found that dark energy emerges spontaneously from the modified gravity. According to cosmological scenario, obtained here, the universe inflates for $\sim 10^{-37}$ sec. in the beginning and late universe accelerates after 8.58 Gyrs. During the long intermediate period, it decelerates driven by radiation and subsequently by matter. Emerged gravitational dark energy mimics quintessence and its density falls by 115 orders from its initial value $2.58\times 10^{68} {\rm GeV}^4$ to its current value $2.19\times 10^{-47} {\rm GeV}^4$ .
