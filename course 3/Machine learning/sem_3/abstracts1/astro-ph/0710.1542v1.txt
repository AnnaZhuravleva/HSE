The initial-final mass relationship of white dwarfs, which is poorly constrained, is of paramount importance for different aspects in modern astrophysics. From an observational perspective, most of the studies up to now have been done using white dwarfs in open clusters. In order to improve the initial-final mass relationship we explore the possibility of deriving a semi-empirical relation studying white dwarfs in common proper motion pairs. We have acquired long-slit spectra of the white dwarf members of the selected common proper motion pairs, as well as high resolution spectra of their companions. From these observations, a full analysis of the two members of each common proper motion pair has lead to the initial and final masses of the white dwarfs. These observations have allowed us to provide updated information for the white dwarfs, since some of them were misclassified. This work is the first one in using common proper motion pairs to improve the initial-final mass relationship, and has also allowed to cover the poorly explored low-mass domain. As in the case of studies based on white dwarfs in open clusters, the distribution of the semi-empirical data presents a large scatter, which is higher than the expected uncertainties in the derived values. This suggests that the initial-final mass relationship may not be a single-valued function.
