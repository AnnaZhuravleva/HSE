We present the properties of a large sample (12,282) of nearly face-on low surface brightness (LSB) disk galaxies selected from the main galaxy sample of SDSS-DR4. These properties include B-band central surface brightness mu_0(B), scale lengths h, integrated magnitudes, colors, and distances D. This sample has mu_0(B) values from 22 to 24.5 mag arcsec^{-2} with a median value of 22.42 mag arcsec^{-2}, and disk scale lengths ranging from 2 to 19 kpc. They are quite bright with M_B taking values from -18 to -23 mag with a median value of -20.08 mag. There exist clear correlations between logh and M_B, logh and logD, logD and M_B. However, no obvious correlations are found between mu_0(B) and logh, colors etc. The correlation between colors and logh is weak even though it exists. Both the optical-optical and optical-NIR color-color diagrams indicate that most of them have a mixture of young and old stellar populations. They also satisfy color-magnitude relations, which indicate that brighter galaxies tend generally to be redder. The comparison between the LSBGs and a control sample of nearly face-on disk galaxies with higher surface brightness (HSB) with mu_0(B) from 18.5 to 22 mag arcsec^{-2} show that, at a given luminosity or distance, the observed LSB galaxies tend to have larger scale lengths. These trends could be seen gradually by dividing both the LSBGs and HSBGs into two sub-groups according to surface brightness. A volume-limited sub-sample was extracted to check the incompleteness of surface brightness. The only one of the property relations having an obvious change is the relation of logh versus mu_0(B), which shows a correlation in this sub-sample.
