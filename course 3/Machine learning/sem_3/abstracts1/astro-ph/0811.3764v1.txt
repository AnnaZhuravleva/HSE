We investigate the possible gravitational redshift values for boson stars with a self-interaction, studying a wide range of possible masses. We find a limiting value of z_lim \simeq 0.687 for stable boson star configurations. We can exclude the direct observation of boson stars. X-ray spectroscopy is perhaps the most interesting possibility.
