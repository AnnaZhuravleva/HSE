We discuss the cosmological degeneracy between the age of the Universe, the Hubble parameter and the effective number of relativistic particles N_eff. We show that independent determinations of the Hubble parameter H(z) as those recently provided by Simon,Verde, Jimenez (2006), combined with other cosmological data sets can provide the most stringent constraint on N_eff, yielding N_eff=3.7 (-1.2) (+1.1) at 95% confidence level. A neutrino background is detected with high significance: N_eff >1.8 at better than 99% confidence level. Constraints on the age of the universe in the framework of an extra background of relativistic particles are improved by a factor 3.
