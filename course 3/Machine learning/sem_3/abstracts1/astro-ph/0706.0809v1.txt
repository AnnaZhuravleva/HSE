KUV 23182+1007 was identified as a blue object in the Kiso UV Survey in the 1980s. Classification-dispersion spectroscopy showed a featureless continuum except for a strong emission line in the region of He II 4686 A. This is a hallmark of the rare AM CVn class of cataclysmic variable star, so we have obtained a high-S/N blue spectrum of this object to check its classification. Instead, the spectrum shows a strong quasar-like emission line centred on 4662 A. Comparison with the SDSS quasar template spectra confirms that KUV 23182+1007 is a quasar with a redshift of z = 0.665.
