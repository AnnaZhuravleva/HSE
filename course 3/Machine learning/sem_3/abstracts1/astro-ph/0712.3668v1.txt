We present the results of a search for variable stars in the central part of the globular cluster NGC 6752. The monitored sample included 160 BHB and 107 EHB stars, respectively. A total of 17 variables were detected of which 14 are new identifications. Five variables are BHB/EHB stars. We report also on identification of a detached eclipsing binary being likely a member of the cluster. Moreover, we detected an outburst of a dwarf nova located in the cluster core.
