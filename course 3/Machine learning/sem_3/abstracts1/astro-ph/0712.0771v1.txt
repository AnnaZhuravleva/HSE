Recently, strong, globally-ordered magnetic fields have been detected in some Herbig Ae and Be (HAeBe) stars, suggesting a possible evolutionary connection to main sequence magnetic chemically peculiar Ap and Bp stars. We have undertaken a detailed study of the binary system HD 72106, which contains a B9 magnetic primary and a HAeBe secondary, using the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter mounted on the CFHT. A careful analysis of the very young primary reveals that it has an approximately dipolar magnetic field geometry, strong chemical peculiarities, and strong surface chemical abundance inhomogeneities. Thus the primary is very similar to an Ap/Bp star despite having completed less then 1.5% of its main sequence life, and possibly still being on the pre-main sequence. In contrast, a similar analysis of the secondary reveals solar chemical abundances and no magnetic field.
