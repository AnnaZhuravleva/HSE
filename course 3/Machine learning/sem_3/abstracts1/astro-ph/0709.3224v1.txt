A new method of frequency analysis is presented in detail. This new method - Variable Sine Algorithmic Analysis, (VSAA) - is based on a single variable sine function and it is powered by the simplex algorithm. It is used in cases of phenomena triggered by a single mechanism, where Fourier Transform and Wavelet Analysis fail to describe practically and efficiently. Applications are given on the orbital period variation of two RS CVn type binaries: RS CVn itself and CG Cyg. With the use of the Applegate's mechanism, the variation of their subsurface magnetic field has been acquired.
