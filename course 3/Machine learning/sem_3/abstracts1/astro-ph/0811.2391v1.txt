The combination of two-dimensional kinematics and gravitational lens modelling permits detailed reconstruction of the phase-space structure of early-type galaxies and sets constraints on the dark-matter distribution in their inner regions. We describe a project which combines integral-field spectroscopy from an ESO Large Programme using VIMOS on the VLT with deep HST ACS and NICMOS images to study a sample of 17 early-type lens galaxies at redshifts between 0.1 and 0.3, drawn from the Sloan Lens ACS survey (SLACS).
