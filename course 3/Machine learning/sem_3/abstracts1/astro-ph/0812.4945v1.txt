We present the general properties of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and discuss the origin and structure of jets that are associated to a fraction of these objects. We then we address the problems of particle acceleration at highly relativistic energies and set limits on the luminosity of AGN jets for being origin of UHECRs.
