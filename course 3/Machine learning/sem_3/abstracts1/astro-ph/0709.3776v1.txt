NGC6334I and I(N) have been observed with the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope, SEST, at wavelengths of 3, 2, and 1.3 mm. Especially NGC6334 I shows rich emission from many different molecules, comparable in line density to prototypical hot cores such as Orion-KL and SgrB2(N). In addition, a 4' by 4' region enfolding NGC 6334 I and I(N) has been mapped at a wavelength of 3 mm (75 to 116 GHz) with the Mopra telescope.
