We report on an observation of the Vela-like pulsar B1823-13 and its synchrotron nebula with Chandra.The pulsar's spectrum fits a power-law model with a photon index Gamma_PSR=2.4 for the plausible hydrogen column density n_H=10^{22} cm^{-2}, corresponding to the luminosity L_PSR=8*10^{31} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.5-8 keV band, at a distance of 4 kpc. The pulsar radiation likely includes magnetospheric and thermal components, but they cannot be reliably separated because of the small number of counts detected and strong interstellar absorption. The pulsar is surrounded by a compact, 25''x 10'', pulsar wind nebula (PWN) elongated in the east-west direction, which includes a brighter inner component, 7''x 3'', elongated in the northeast-southwest direction. The slope of the compact PWN spectrum is Gamma_comp=1.3, and the 0.5-8 keV luminosity is L_comp~3*10^{32} ergs s^{-1}. The compact PWN is surrounded by asymmetric diffuse emission (extended PWN) seen up to at least 2.4' south of the pulsar, with a softer spectrum (Gamma_ext=1.9), and the 0.5-8 keV luminosity L_ext~10^{33}-10^{34} ergs s^{-1}. We also measured the pulsar's proper motion using archival VLA data: \mu_\alpha=23.0+/-2.5 mas yr^{-1},   \mu_\delta=-3.9+/-3.3 mas yr^{-1}, which corresponds to the transverse velocity v_perp=440 km s^{-1}. The direction of the proper motion is approximately parallel to the elongation of the compact PWN, but it is nearly perpendicular to that of the extended PWN and to the direction towards the center of the bright VHE gamma-ray source HESS J1825-137, which is likely powered by PSR B1823-13.
