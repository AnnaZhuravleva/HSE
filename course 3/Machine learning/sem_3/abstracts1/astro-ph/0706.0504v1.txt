This work presents preliminary results for the time-dependent cosmic-ray propagation in the Galaxy by a fully 3-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. The distribution of cosmic-rays (both protons and helium nuclei) in the Galaxy is studied on various spatial scales for both constant and variable cosmic-ray sources. The continuous diffuse gamma-ray emission produced by cosmic-rays during the propagation is evaluated.
