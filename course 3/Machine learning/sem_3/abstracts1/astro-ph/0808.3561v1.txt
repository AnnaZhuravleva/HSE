The stellar asymmetry of faint thick disk/inner halo stars in the first quadrant first reported by Larsen & Humphreys (1996) and investigated further by Parker et al. (2003, 2004) has been recently confirmed by SDSS (Juric et al. 2008). Their interpretation of the excess in the star counts as a ringlike structure, however, is not supported by critical complimentary data in the fourth quadrant not covered by SDSS. We present stellar density maps from the Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS) Catalog of the POSS I showing that the overdensity does not extend into the fourth quadrant. The overdensity is most probably not a ring. It could be due to interaction with the disk bar, evidence for a triaxial thick disk, or a merger remnant/stream. We call this feature the Hercules Thick Disk Cloud.
