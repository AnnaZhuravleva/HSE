We have performed time resolved photometry on the dwarf nova CG Dra and have established for the first time that it is an eclipsing system. By measuring the times of the eclipses, we determined the orbital period as 0.18864(4) d, or 4h 31m 38 +/- 3s. This value is consistent with the shorter of two periods proposed from earlier spectroscopic studies. The orbital period places CG Dra above the period gap. The symmetrical eclipses are of short duration (FWHM 18+/-2 min, or 0.066(7) of the orbital period) and shallow (average 0.16+/-0.02 mag), suggesting a grazing eclipse which is consistent with an orbital inclination just above the critical value. Flickering persists through the eclipse which means that the flickering source is not occulted by the secondary star.
