The 2MASS photometric calibration observations cover ~6 square degrees on the sky in 35 "calibration fields" each sampled in nominal photometric conditions between 562 and 3692 times during the four years of the 2MASS mission. We compile a catalog of variables from the calibration observations to search for M dwarfs transited by extra-solar planets. We present our methods for measuring periodic and non-periodic flux variability. From 7554 sources with apparent Ks magnitudes between 5.6 and 16.1, we identify 247 variables, including extragalactic variables and 23 periodic variables. We have discovered three M dwarf eclipsing systems, including two candidates for transiting extrasolar planets.
