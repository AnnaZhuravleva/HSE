We present results from a near-infrared narrow-band survey of emission-line galaxies at z=2.23, using the Wide Field Camera on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. The H2S1 narrow-band filter (lambda_c=2.121um) we employ selects the H-alpha emission line redshifted to z=2.23, and is thus suitable for selecting 'typical' star forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at this epoch. The pilot study was undertaken in the well studied Cosmological Evolution Survey field (COSMOS) and is already the largest near-infrared narrow-band survey at this depth, with a line flux limit of F(H-alpha)~10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 over 0.60 square degrees, probing ~220x10^3 Mpc^3 (co-moving) down to a limiting star formation rate of 30 M_sun/yr (3sigma). In this paper we present the results from our pilot survey and evaluate the H-alpha luminosity function and estimate the clustering properties of H-alpha emitters at z=2.23 from 55 detected galaxies. The integrated luminosity function is used to estimate the volume averaged star formation rate at z=2.23: SFRD = 0.17^{+0.16}_{-0.09} M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 for L(H-alpha) > 10^42 erg/s. For the first time, we use the H-alpha star-formation tracer to reliably constrain SFRD out to z=2.23 demonstrating the rapid increase in SRFD out to this redshift as well as confirming the flattening in SFRD between z~1-2. In addition to the luminosity distribution, we analyse the clustering properties of these galaxies. Using the 2-point angular correlation function, we estimate a real space correlation length of r_0= 4.2^{+0.4}_{-0.2} h^-1 Mpc. In comparison to models of clustering which take into account bias evolution, we estimate that these galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos of mass M_halo ~ 10^12 M_sun consistent with the progenitors of the Milky Way.
