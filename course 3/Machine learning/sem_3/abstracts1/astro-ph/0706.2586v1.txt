The transport of the nuclear cosmic ray flux in the atmosphere is studied and the atmospheric corrections to be applied to the measurements are calculated. The contribution of the calculated corrections to the accuracy of the experimental results are discussed and evaluated over the kinetic energy range 10-10$^{3}$ GeV/n. The Boron (B) and Carbon (C) elements system is used as a test case. It is shown that the required corrections become largely dominant at the highest energies investigated. The results are discussed.
