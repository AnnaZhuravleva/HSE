We investigate the chemical abundances of NGC3603 in the Milky Way, of 30Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and of N66 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Mid-infrared observations with the Infrared Spectrograph onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope allow us to probe the properties of distinct physical regions within each object: the central ionizing cluster, the surrounding ionized gas, photodissociation regions, and buried stellar clusters. We detect [SIII], [SIV], [ArIII], [NeII], [NeIII], [FeII], and [FeIII] lines and derive the ionic abundances. Based on the ionic abundance ratio (NeIII/H)/(SIII/H), we find that the gas observed in the MIR is characterized by a higher degree of ionization than the gas observed in the optical spectra. We compute the elemental abundances of Ne, S, Ar, and Fe. We find that the alpha-elements Ne, S, and Ar scale with each other. Our determinations agree well with the abundances derived from the optical. The Ne/S ratio is higher than the solar value in the three giant HII regions and points toward a moderate depletion of sulfur on dust grains. We find that the neon and sulfur abundances display a remarkably small dispersion (0.11dex in 15 positions in 30Doradus), suggesting a relatively homogeneous ISM, even though small-scale mixing cannot be ruled out.
