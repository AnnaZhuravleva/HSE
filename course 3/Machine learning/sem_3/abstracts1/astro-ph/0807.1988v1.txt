The fractal structure of the interstellar medium suggests that the interaction of UV radiation with the ISM as described in the context of photon-dominated regions (PDR) dominates most of the physical and chemical conditions, and hence the far-infrared and submm emission from the ISM in the Milky Way. We investigate to what extent the Galactic FIR line emission of the important species CO, C, C+, and O, as observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite can be modeled in the framework of a clumpy, UV-penetrated cloud scenario. The far-infrared line emission of the Milky Way is modeled as the emission from an ensemble of clumps with a power law clump mass spectrum and mass-size relation with power-law indices consistent with the observed ISM structure. The individual clump line intensities are calculated using the KOSMA-tau PDR-model for spherical clumps. The model parameters for the cylindrically symmetric Galactic distribution of the mass density and volume filling factor are determined by the observed radial distributions. A constant FUV intensity, in which the clumps are embedded, is assumed. We show that this scenario can explain, without any further assumptions and within a factor of about 2, the absolute FIR-line intensities and their distribution with Galactic longitude as observed by COBE.
