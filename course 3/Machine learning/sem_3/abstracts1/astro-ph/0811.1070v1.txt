The LUNASKA (Lunar UHE Neutrino Astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array) project is a theoretical and experimental project developing the lunar Cherenkov technique for the next generation of giant radio-telescope arrays. This contribution presents our simulation results on the directional dependence of the technique for UHE neutrino detection. In particular, these indicate that both the instantaneous sensitivities and time-integrated limits from lunar Cherenkov experiments such as those at Parkes, Goldstone, Kalyazin and ATCA are highly anisotropic. We study the regions of the sky which have not been probed by either these or other experiments, and present the expected sky coverage of future experiments with the SKA. Our results show how the sensitivity of Lunar Cherenkov observations to potential astrophysical sources of UHE particles may be maximised by choosing appropriate observations dates and antenna-beam pointing positions.
