Absorption lines of OVII at redshift zero are observed in high quality Chandra spectra of extragalactic sightlines. The location of the absorber producing these lines, whether from the corona of the Galaxy or from the Local Group or even larger scale structure, has been a matter of debate. Here we study another poor group like our Local Group to understand the distribution of column density from galaxy to group scales. We show that we cannot yet rule out the group origin of z=0 systems. We further argue that the debate over Galactic vs. extragalactic origin of z=0 systems is premature as they likely contain both components and predict that future higher resolution observations will resolve the z=0 systems into multiple components.
