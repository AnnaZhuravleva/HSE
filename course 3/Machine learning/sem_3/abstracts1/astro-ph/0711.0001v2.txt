Star-forming galaxies constitute the majority of galaxies with stellar masses >10^10 M_Sun/h^2 at z~2 and dominate the star-formation rate density of the Universe at this early epoch. It is thus critical to understand their origins, evolution, and connection to the underlying dark matter distribution. To this end, we identify the dark matter halos (including subhalos) that are likely to contain star-forming galaxies at z~2 (z2SFGs) within a large dissipationless cosmological simulation and then use halo merger histories to follow the evolution of z2SFG descendants to z~1 and z~0. The evolved halos at these epochs are then confronted with an array of observational data in order to uncover the likely descendants of z2SFGs. Though the evolved halos have clustering strengths comparable to red galaxies at z~1 and z~0, we find that the bulk of z2SFGs do not evolve into red galaxies, at either epoch. This conclusion is based primarily on the fact that the space density of z2SFGs is much higher than that of lower redshift red galaxies, even when accounting for the merging of z2SFG descendants, which decreases the number density of z2SFG descendants by at most a factor of two by z~0. Of the ~50% of z2SFGs that survive to z~0, ~70% reside at the center of z~0 dark matter halos with M>10^12 M_Sun/h. Halo occupation modeling of z~0 galaxies suggests that such halos are occupied by galaxies with M_r<-20.5, implying that these z2SFGs evolve into ``typical'' ~ L* galaxies today, including our own Galaxy. The remaining ~30% become satellite galaxies by z~0, and comparison to halo occupation modeling suggests that they are rather faint, with M_r<-19.5. (ABRIDGED)
