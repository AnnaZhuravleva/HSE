AstraLux is the Lucky Imaging camera for the Calar Alto 2.2-m telescope and the 3.5-m NTT at La Silla. It allows nearly diffraction limited imaging in the SDSS i' and z' bands of objects as faint as i'=15.5mag with minimum technical effort.   One of the ongoing AstraLux observing programs is a binarity survey among late-type stars with spectral types K7 to M8, covering more than 1000 targets on the northern and southern hemisphere. The survey is designed to refine binarity statistics and especially the dependency of binarity fraction on spectral type. The choice of the SDSS i' and z' filters allows to obtain spectral type and mass estimates for resolved binaries.   With an observing efficiency of typically 6 targets per hour we expect to complete the survey in mid-2009. Selected targets will be followed up astrometrically and photometrically, contributing to the calibration of the mass-luminosity relation at the red end of the main sequence and at visible wavelengths.
