We acquired high resolution spectroscopic and low resolution spectropolarimetric observations to achieve the following goals: a) to improve the orbital parameters to allow a more in-depth discussion on the possibility of mass transfer in the binary system, b) to carry out a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundance analysis, and c) to search for the presence of a magnetic field.   The study of the radial velocities using CORALIE spectra allowed us to significantly improve the orbital parameters. A comparative NLTE abundance analysis was undertaken for theta Car and two other early B-type stars with recently detected magnetic fields, tau Sco and xi^1 CMa. The analysis revealed significantly different abundance patterns: a one-order-of-magnitude nitrogen overabundance and carbon depletion was found in theta Car, while the oxygen abundance is roughly solar. For the stars xi^1 CMa and tau Sco the carbon abundance is solar and, while an N excess is also detected, it is of much smaller amplitude (0.4-0.6dex). Such an N overabundance is typical of the values already found for other slowly-rotating (magnetic) B-type dwarfs. For theta Car, we attribute instead the chemical peculiarities to a past episode of mass transfer between the two binary components. The results of the search for a magnetic field using FORS1 at the VLT consisting of 26 measurements over a time span of ~1.2h are rather inconclusive: only few measurements have a significance level of 3sigma. Although we detect a periodicity of the order of ~8.8min in the dataset involving the measurements on all hydrogen Balmer lines with the exception of the Halpha and Hbeta lines, these results have to be confirmed by additional time-resolved magnetic field observations.
