Recent Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data confirm the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) quadrupole anomaly. We further elaborate our previous proposal that the quadrupole power can be naturally suppressed in axis-symmetric universes. In particular, we discuss in greater detail the CMB quadrupole anisotropy and considerably improve our analysis. As a result, we obtain tighter constraints on the direction of the axis of symmetry as well as on the eccentricity at decoupling. We find that the quadrupole amplitude can be brought in accordance with observations with an eccentricity at decoupling of about 0.35 10^{-2}. Moreover, our determination of the direction of the symmetry axis is in reasonable agreement with recent statistical analyses of cleaned CMB temperature fluctuation maps obtained by means of improved internal linear combination methods as Galactic foreground subtraction technique.
