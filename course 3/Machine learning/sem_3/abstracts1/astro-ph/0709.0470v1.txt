Dirac showed that the existence of one magnetic pole in the universe could offer an explanation of the discrete nature of the electric charge. Magnetic poles appear naturally in most grand unified theories. Their discovery would be of greatest importance for particle physics and cosmology. The intense experimental search carried thus far has not met with success. I proposed a universe with magnetic poles which are not observed free because they hide in deeply bound monopole--anti-monopole states named monopolium. I discuss the realization of this proposal and its consistency with known cosmological features. I furthermore analyze its implications and the experimental signatures that confirm the scenario.
