Only astronomical observations can effectively probe in space-time the variabil ity of the physical dimensionless constants such as the fine structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio, \mu, which are related to fund amental forces of nature. Several theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) allow fundamental constants to vary, but they cannot make quantitative predictions so that only laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can show if th is is the case or set the allowed bounds. At the moment of writing there are c laims for a variability of both \alpha and \mu at 5 and 4\sigma of C.L., respectively, although for \alpha they are contrasted by null results. The observations are challenging and a new spectrograph such as ESPRESSO at the combined incoherent focus of 4 VLT units (a potential 16 m equivalent telescope) will allow for a significant improvement in the precision measurement clearing up the controversy. If the variations will be confirmed, the implications are far reaching, revealing new physics beyond the SM and pointing a direction for GUTs theories. A most exciting ossibility is that a variation of \alpha is induced by quintessence through its coupling with the electromagnetic field. If this is the case an accurate measurement of the variability could provide a way for reconstructing the equation of state of Dark Energy (Avelino et al 2006).
