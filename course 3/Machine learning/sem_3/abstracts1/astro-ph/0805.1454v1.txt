Phobos is a moon of mars below the synchronous orbit. Because of tidal interaction it is losing its altitude and is launched on a shrinking spiral path of total destruction. Based on planetary-satellite dynamics its rate of loss of altitude is calculated to be twenty meters per century and its doomsday is predicted to be at eleven mega years from now.
