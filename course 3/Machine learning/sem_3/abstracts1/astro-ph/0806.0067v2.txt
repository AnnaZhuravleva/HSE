We report the discovery of three very late T dwarfs in the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Third Data Release: ULAS J101721.40+011817.9 (ULAS1017), ULAS J123828.51+095351.3 (ULAS1238) and ULAS J133553.45+113005.2 (ULAS1335).We detail optical and near-infrared photometry for all three sources, and mid-infrared photometry for ULAS1335. We use near-infrared spectra of each source to assign spectral types T8p (ULAS1017), T8.5 (ULAS1228) and T9 (ULAS1335) to these objects. We estimate that ULAS1017 has 750 < Teff < 850K, and 5.0 < log g < 5.5, assuming solar metallicity, an age of 1.6-15 Gyr, a mass of 33-70 MJ and lies at a distance of 31-54 pc. We extend the unified scheme of Burgasser et al. (2006) to the type T9 and suggest the inclusion of the WJ index to replace the now saturated J-band indices. ULAS1335 is the same spectral type as ULAS J003402.77-005206.7 and CFBDS J005910.90-011401.3. Comparison of model spectra with that of ULAS1335 suggest a temperature below 600K. We find ULAS1335 to be extremely red in near to mid-infrared colours, with H-[4.49]=4.34+/-0.04. This is the reddest near to mid-infrared colour yet observed for a T dwarf, which supports Teff < 600K, and we estimate Teff ~550-600K for ULAS1335. We estimate that ULAS1335 has an age of 0.6-5.3 Gyr, a mass of 15-31 MJ and lies at a distance of 8-12 pc.
