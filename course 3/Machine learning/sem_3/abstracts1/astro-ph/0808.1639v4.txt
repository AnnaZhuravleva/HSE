Orbital periods in AM Her stars (polars) are synchronized with spin periods of white dwarf by its high magnetic field. Since the last study of Porb distribution of these systems, the number of known objects of such type has more than doubled. This challenged us to compile a new updated catalogue of cataclysmic variables with highly magnetic white dwarfs (polars) and to study their Porb distribution. In this paper we also discus if "spike" is reliable feature in the distribution. ("Spike" is a concentration of polars in the distribution of their orbital periods near Porb = 114 min and was previously discussed by Ritter & Kolb (1992) and Shahbaz & Wood (1996).)
