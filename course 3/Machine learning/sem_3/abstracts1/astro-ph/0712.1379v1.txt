Molecular gas in external galaxies is a subject of crucial importance for observational and theoretical studies of galaxy formation. Compact molecular gas around an active galactic nuclei (AGN) is expected to be an energy budget of AGN and/or nuclear starburst. Recent observational studies suggest that line ratios in millimeter and submillimeter band may be a good tool to reveal the long-standing question on the origin of activity -- AGN or nuclear starburst. We have constructed a powerful "telescope" of theory, three-dimensional nonLTE line transfer code, preceding the high resolution and sensitivity observations such as ALMA.
