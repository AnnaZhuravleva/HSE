I review the development of ideas regarding the angular momentum evolution of solar-type stars, from the early 60's to the most recent years. Magnetic fields are the central agent that dictates the rotational evolution of solar-type stars, both during the pre-main sequence, through star-disk magnetic coupling, and during the main sequence, through magnetized winds. Key theoretical developments as well as important observational results are summarized in this review.
