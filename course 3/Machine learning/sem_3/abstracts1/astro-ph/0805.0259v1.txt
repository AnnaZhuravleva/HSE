We study the population of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Galactic bulge using the deep survey of this region by the IBIS telescope aboard the INTEGRAL observatory. Thanks to the increased sensitivity with respect to previous surveys of this field, we succeeded to probe the luminosity function (LF) of LMXBs down to ~7e34 erg/sec in the 17-60keV energy band. The slope dlog N/dlog L=-0.96+/0.20 measured in the 1e35-1e37 erg/sec range confirms that the LMXB LF flattens below L_x<1e37 erg/sec with respect to higher luminosities. We discuss the origin of the observed LF flattening. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of persistent LMXBs in the Galactic Center/Galactic bulge region is consistent with a model of stellar mass distribution that includes the nuclear stellar disk component in the innermost degree of the Galaxy. The spatial distribution of transient LMXBs detected in the Galactic Center region indicates an increased fraction of transient sources in the innermost degree of the Galaxy with respect to outer regions.
