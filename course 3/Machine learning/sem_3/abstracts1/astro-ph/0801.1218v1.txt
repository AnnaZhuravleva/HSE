Scaling relations for the mass, angular momentum and other properties of a wide range of self-similar structures in the universe are seen to have universal features. As a consequence of the ideas elaborated in earlier papers these relations can be connected to a background constant curvature given by the cosmological constant dominating cosmical dynamics.
