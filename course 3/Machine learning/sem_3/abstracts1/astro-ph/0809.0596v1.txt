A new search result of the Tokyo axion helioscope is presented. The axion helioscope consists of a dedicated cryogen-free 4T superconducting magnet with an effective length of 2.3 m and PIN photodiodes as x-ray detectors. Solar axions, if exist, would be converted into X-ray photons through the inverse Primakoff process in the magnetic field. Conversion is coherently enhanced even for massive axions by filling the conversion region with helium gas. The present third phase measurement sets a new limit of g_{a\gamma\gamma}<(5.6--13.4)\times10^{-10} GeV^{-1} for the axion mass of 0.84<m_a<1.0 eV at 95% confidence level.
