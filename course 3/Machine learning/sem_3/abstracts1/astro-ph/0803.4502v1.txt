The galaxy NGC6384 has been observed with an IPCS through H alpha and [NII] narrow-band interference filters for direct imagery with the 2.6 m Byurakan telescope. We studied main physical parameters of identified 98 HII regions, their diameter and luminosity functions, as well [NII]/H alpha ratio distribution. The integrated distribution function of the HII region diameters can be well fitted by the exponential function. The characteristic diameter has the value (Do = 217 pc) predicted for a galaxy of its measured absolute luminosity. The luminosity function of HII regions has double power laws profile with relatively shallow slope at low luminosities (a = - 0.4), an abrupt turnover at log L(H alpha) = 38.75, and sharper slope at higher luminosities (a = - 2.3). Correlation between luminosity and diameter of HII regions confirms that in general they are constant density, radiation-bound systems. [NII]/H alpha ratio data for HII regions show that there is a negative radial gradient of [NII]/H alpha. In the central region of the galaxy, nitrogen abundance is higher than in the periphery. The properties of the HII regions population of this AGN galaxy does not differs significantly from the properties of the HII regions population of the "normal" galaxies. Reexamining the location of the type Ia SN 1971L in the galaxy, we confirm that it lies on the spiral arm at about 8.6" far from the closest HII region #53 (F81). Such a location can be taken as prove that the progenitor of this SN do not belong to an old, evolved stellar population.
