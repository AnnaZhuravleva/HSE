We present a 1.5deg x 8deg (220pc x 1195pc) Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer 24um image of the Galactic Center and an accompanying point source list. This image is the highest spatial resolution (6" ~ 0.25pc) and sensitivity map ever taken across the GC at this wavelength, showing the emission by warm dust in unprecedented detail. Over 120,000 point sources are identified in this catalog with signal-to-noise ratios greater than five and flux densities from 0.6mJy to 9Jy.
