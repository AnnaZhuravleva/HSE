A unified model of dark energy and matter is presented using the modified variable Chaplygin gas for interacting dark energy in a non-flat universe. The two entities interact with each other non-gravitationally which involves a coupling constant. Due to dynamic interaction, the variation in this constant arises that henceforth changes the equations of state of these quantities. We have derived the effective equations of state corresponding to matter and dark energy in this interacting model. Moreover, the case of phantom energy is deduced by putting constraints on the parameters involved.
