This is to announce a recent release of version 1.0.1a9 of parallel load balanced adaptive P3M cosmological N-body code named GRACOS. The code has been under development over years and is available for the download at http://www.gracos.org. GRACOS features: embedded script environment, cosmological initial conditions generator including non-gaussian initial conditions, particle data imager, mass density power spectrum estimator, particle position and velocity integrator with a choice between KDK and DKD integration schemes with Plummer force softening, file input and output with four supported serial and one dynamic distributed data format, standard installation procedure, and version specific documentation. GRACOS is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). High efficiency is achieved with a number of implemented techniques such as timer-based load balancing using Hilbert space filling curve, adaptive P3M method for short range force computation, run-level compression in interprocessor communication, dynamic allocation for irregular domains and various sorting algorithms.
