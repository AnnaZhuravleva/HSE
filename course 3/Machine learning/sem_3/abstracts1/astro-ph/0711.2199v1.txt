This thesis deals with different aspects of a special kind of high redshift galaxy, namely Ly-alpha emitters. Ly-alpha emitters are galaxies found through their Ly-alpha emission, at redshifts larger than z >~ 2 where the emission line has been redshifted into the optical or near-infrared regime. The thesis has two main parts; a lower redshift, observational part (z ~ 3) and a more technical/theoretical very high redshift part (z ~ 9).   In the first, lower redshift part I present the analysis of a narrow-band image taken in the GOODS-S field, focused on a redshift for Ly-alpha of z = 3.15. The image, covering a central part of the GOODS-S field revealed 25 Ly-alpha emitting candidates, of which one turned out to be a so-called Ly-alpha blob. In the second part, I discuss future, very high redshift narrow-band surveys for Ly-alpha emitters. Finally, in a project unrelated to the other two parts of the thesis, I present a search for a 'Fundamental plane' of Ly-alpha emitters in the colour space produced by large-scale multi-wavelength surveys such as GOODS or COSMOS.
