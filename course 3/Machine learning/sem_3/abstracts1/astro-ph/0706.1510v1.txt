We study the evolution of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) emitters across the illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula and especially their survival and properties in the HII region. We present spectral mapping observations taken with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) at wavelengths 5.2-38 microns. A strong AIB at 11.3 microns is detected in the HII region, relative to the other AIBs at 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 microns. The intensity of this band appears to be correlated with the intensity of the [NeII] at 12.8 microns and of Halpha, which shows that the emitters of the 11.3 microns band are located in the ionised gas. The survival of PAHs in the HII region could be due to the moderate intensity of the radiation field (G0 about 100) and the lack of photons with energy above about 25eV. The enhancement of the intensity of the 11.3 microns band in the HII region, relative to the other AIBs can be explained by the presence of neutral PAHs. Our observations highlight a transition region between ionised and neutral PAHs observed with ideal conditions in our Galaxy. A scenario where PAHs can survive in HII regions and be significantly neutral could explain the detection of a prominent 11.3 microns band in other Spitzer observations.
