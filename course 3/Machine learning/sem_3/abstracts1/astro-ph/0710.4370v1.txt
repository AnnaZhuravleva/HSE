Based on a simulation of galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, we suggest that a consistent picture for Gamma-Ray Bursts and star formation may be found that is in broad agreement with observations: GRBs preferentially form in low metallicity environments and in galaxies substantially less luminous that L*. We find that the computed formation rate of stars with metallicity less than 0.1Zsun agrees remarkably well with the rate evolution of Gamma-Ray Bursts observed by Swift from z=0 to z=4, whereas the evolution of total star formation rate is weaker by a factor of about 4. Given this finding, we caution that any inference of star formation rate based on observed GRB rate may require a more involved exercise than a simple proportionality.
