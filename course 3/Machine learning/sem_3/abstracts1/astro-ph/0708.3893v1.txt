This document contains refereed supplementary information for the paper ``Rapid planetesimal formation in turbulent circumstellar discs''. It contains 15 sections (\S1.1 -- \S1.15) that address a number of subjects related to the main paper. We describe in detail the Poisson solver used to find the self-potential of the solid particles, including a linear and a non-linear test problem (\S1.3). Dissipative collisions remove energy from the motion of the particles by collisional cooling (\S1.4), an effect that allows gravitational collapse to occur in somewhat less massive discs (\S1.7). A resolution study of the gravitational collapse of the boulders is presented in \S1.6. We find that gravitational collapse can occur in progressively less massive discs as the grid resolution is increased, likely due to the decreased smoothing of the particle-mesh self-gravity solver with increasing resolution. In \S1.10 we show that it is in good agreement with the Goldreich & Ward (1973) stability analysis to form several-hundred-km-sized bodies, when the analysis is applied to 5 AU and to regions of increased boulder column density. \S11 is devoted to the measurement of random speeds and collision speeds between boulders. We find good agreement between our measurements and analytical theory for the random speeds, but the measured collision speeds are 3 times lower than expected from analytical theory. Higher resolution studies, and an improved analytical theory of collision speeds that takes into account epicyclic motion, will be needed to determine whether collision speeds have converged. In \S1.12 we present models with no magnetic fields. The boulder layer still exhibits strong clumping, due to the streaming instability, if the global solids-to-gas ratio is increased by a factor 3. Gravitational collapse occurs as readily as in magnetised discs.
