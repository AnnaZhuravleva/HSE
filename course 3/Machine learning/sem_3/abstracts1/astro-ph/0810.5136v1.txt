This proceeding concentrates on the BAO signature of dark energy, and how the SKA dark energy case has been complicated by the emergence of HI structure experiments modeled after the Epoch of Reionization observatories. The purpose of the conference talk was to review the current status of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and show the applications of HI structure observations for both reionization and dark energy measurements. Since the status of the MWA is changing weekly, please see the website www.haystack.mit.edu/ast/arrays/mwa/ for the current status. This proceedings will instead concentrate on HI structure observations, their applicability to reionization and cosmography, and the implications for the SKA and future HI structure observations of dark energy.
