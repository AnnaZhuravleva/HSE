The study of PN has been confronting a growing list of dilemmas which have yet to find coherent resolution. These issues are both observational and theoretical and can be stated as a series of "facts" which can not, as of yet, be accounted for via a single framework. We review these facts and propose a skeleton framework for developing a new understanding post-AGB stars, PPN and PN. Our framework represents an attempt to articulate a a global perspective on the late stages of stellar evolution that can embrace both the nature of the central engine and the outflows they produce. Our framework focuses on interacting binary central stars which drive collimated outflows through MHD processes. We propose that the field of AGB/PN studies now faces a "Grand Challenge" in articulating the observational systematics of these objects in a way that can address issues related to binarity and magnetic shaping. A theoretical Grand Challenge is also faced in the form of integrated studies which can explicate the highly non-linear processes associated with MHD outflows driven by interacting binaries. These issues include the generation of magnetic fields via dynamo processes, the creation of accretion disks, the dynamics of Common Envelope ejection and the creation of magnetized jets.
