The Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxy (CoNFIG) survey was defined by selecting all sources with S_1.4GHz > 1.3Jy from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) in the north field of the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. We carried out FRI/FRII morphology classification from NVSS and FIRST survey data; to complete this process, new 8GHz VLA observations for 31 sources were obtained at 0.24 arcsec resolution. Optical identifications and redshift information were compiled for about ~80% of the 270 radio sources in the sample, the mean redshift being ~0.6. A major goal of this sample is a better definition of the individual luminosity distributions and source counts for FRI and FRII sources, in order to determine accurately the evolution of the luminosity function for both types. Amongst the aims are the issues of whether the two populations are really distinct, whether physical evolution schemes permit one type to evolve into the other, whether the dual-population unified scheme for radio AGN remains viable, and the role radio AGN - star-formation feedback mechanisms.
