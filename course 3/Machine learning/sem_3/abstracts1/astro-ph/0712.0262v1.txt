The well defined selection function of the XMM-LSS survey enables a simultaneous modelling of the observed cluster number counts and of the evolution of the L-T relation. We present results pertaining to the first 5 deg2 for a well controlled sample comprising 30 objects: they are compatible with the WMAP3 parameter set along with cluster self-similar evolution. Extending such a survey to 200 deg2 would (1) allow discriminating between the major scenarios of the cluster L-T evolution and (2) provide a unique self-sufficient determination of sigma8 and Gamma with an accuracy of ~ 5% and 10% respectively, when adding mass information from weak lensing and S-Z observations.
