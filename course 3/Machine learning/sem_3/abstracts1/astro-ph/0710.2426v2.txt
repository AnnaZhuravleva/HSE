Sgr A* is a source of strongly variable emission in several energy bands. It is generally agreed that this emission comes from the material surrounding the black hole which is either falling in or flowing out. The activity must be driven by accretion but the character of accretion flow in this object is an open question. We suggest that the inflow is dominated by the relatively low angular momentum material originating in one of the nearby group of stars. Such material flows in directly towards the black hole up to the distance of order of ten Schwarzschild radii or less, where it hits the angular momentum barrier which leads naturally to a flow variability. We study both the analytical and the numerical solutions for the flow dynamics, and we analyze the radiation spectra in both cases using the Monte Carlo code to simulate the synchrotron, bremsstrahlung and the Compton scattering. Our model roughly reproduces the broad band spectrum of Sgr A* and its variability if we allow for a small fraction of energy to be converted to non-thermal population of electrons. It is also consistent (for a range of viewing angles) with the strong constraints on the amount of circumnuclear material imposed by the measurements of the Faraday rotation.
