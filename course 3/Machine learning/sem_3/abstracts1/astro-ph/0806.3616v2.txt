During last years a few massive binary systems have been detected in the TeV gamma-rays. This gamma-ray emission is clearly modulated with the orbital periods of these binaries suggesting its origin inside the binary system. In this paper we summarize the anisotropic IC e-p pair cascade model as likely explanation of these observations. We consider scenarios in which particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, either due to the presence of an energetic pulsar inside the binary, or as a result of accretion process onto the compact object during which the jet is launched from the inner part of the accretion disk, or in collisions of stellar winds from the massive companions.
