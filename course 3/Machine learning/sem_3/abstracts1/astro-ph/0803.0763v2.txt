We present K-band imaging of two ~30'x30' fields covered by the MUSYC Wide NIR Survey. The 1030 and 1255 fields were imaged with ISPI on the 4m Blanco telescope at CTIO to a 5 sigma point-source limiting depth of K~20 (Vega). Combining this data with the MUSYC Optical UBVRIz imaging, we created multi-band K-selected source catalogs for both fields. These catalogs, together with the MUSYC K-band catalog of the ECDF-S field, were used to select K<20 BzK galaxies over an area of 0.71 deg^2. This is the largest area ever surveyed for BzK galaxies. We present number counts, redshift distributions and stellar masses for our sample of 3261 BzK galaxies (2502 star-forming (sBzK) and 759 passively evolving (pBzK)), as well as reddening and star formation rate estimates for the star-forming BzK systems. We also present 2-point angular correlation functions and spatial correlation lengths for both sBzK and pBzK galaxies and show that previous estimates of the correlation function of these galaxies were affected by cosmic variance due to the small areas surveyed. We have measured correlation lengths r_0 of 8.89+/-2.03 Mpc and 10.82+/-1.72 Mpc for sBzK and pBzK galaxies respectively. This is the first reported measurement of the spatial correlation function of passive BzK galaxies. In the LambdaCDM scenario of galaxy formation, these correlation lengths at z~2 translate into minimum masses of ~4x10^{12} M_sun and ~9x10^{12} M_sun for the dark matter (DM) halos hosting sBzK and pBzK galaxies respectively. The clustering properties of the galaxies in our sample are consistent with them being the descendants of bright LBG at z~3, and the progenitors of present-day >1L* galaxies.
