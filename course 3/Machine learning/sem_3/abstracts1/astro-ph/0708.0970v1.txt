Observational consequences of a jet-driven supernova (SN) explosion model are presented. The results are compared in detail with optical observations of SN 1998bw associated with a Gamma-Ray Burst. It is shown that the jet model is able to reproduce virtually all the optical observations available for this SN, although a spherical model fails to explain some of observed features. Because of the viewing angle effect, the required kinetic energy of the SN ejecta is reduced to ~ 2 x 10^{52} erg as compared to that obtained by the previous spherical model (~ 5 x 10^{52} erg), but this is still much larger than that of a canonical SN (~10^{51} erg).
