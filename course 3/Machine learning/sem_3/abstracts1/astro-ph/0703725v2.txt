The discovery of the short-period giant exoplanet population, the so-called hot Jupiter population, and their link to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars challenges the conventional view of planet formation and evolution. We took advantage of the multi-fiber facilities GIRAFFE and FLAMES-UVES (VLT) to perform the first large radial velocity survey using a multi-fiber spectrograph, aiming at detecting planetary and brown dwarfs candidates and binaries. We observed during 5 consecutive half-nights 816 stars selected within one of the exoplanet field of the space mission CoRoT. We computed the radial velocities of these stars and shown that a systematic error of 30 m s$^{-1}$ has been reached over 5 consecutive nights. Over the whole sample the Doppler measurements allowed us to identify a sample of 50 binaries, 9 active or blended binary stars, 5 unsolved cases and 14 exoplanets and brown dwarf candidates. Further higher precision Doppler measurements are now necessary to confirm and better characterize these candidates. This study demonstrates the efficiency of such a multi-fiber approach for large radial velocity surveys in search for exoplanets as well as the follow-up of transiting exoplanet candidates of existing and future programs like the CoRoT space mission.
