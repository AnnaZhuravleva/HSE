Aims: We derive the 3-D HI volume density distribution for the Galactic disk out to R = 60 kpc. Methods: Our analysis is based on parameters for the warp and rotation curve derived previously. The data are taken from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. Results: The Milky Way HI disk is significantly warped but shows a coherent structure out to R = 35 kpc. The radial surface density distribution, the densities in the middle of the warped plane, and the HI scale heights all follow exponential relations. The radial scale length for the surface density distribution of the HI disk is 3.75 kpc. Gas at the outskirts for 40 < R < 60 kpc is described best by a distribution with an exponential radial scale length of 7.5 kpc and a velocity dispersion of 74 km/s. Such a highly turbulent medium fits also well with the average shape of the high velocity profile wings observed at high latitudes. The turbulent pressure gradient of such extra-planar gas is on average in balance with the gravitational forces. About 10% of the Milky Way HI gas is in this state. The large scale HI distribution is lopsided; for R < 15 kpc there is more gas in the south. The HI flaring indicates that this asymmetry is caused by a dark matter wake, located at R = 25 kpc in direction of the Magellanic System. Conclusions: The HI disk is made up of two major components. Most prominent is the normal HI disk which can be traced to R = 35 kpc. This is surrounded by a patchy distribution of highly turbulent gas reaching large scale heights but also large radial distances. At the position of the Sun the exponential scale height in the z direction is 3.9 kpc. This component resembles the anomalous gas discovered previously in some galaxies.
