A rigorous approach to simultaneously determine a Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) and Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) is now currently applied on a routine basis in a coordinated project within the Groupe de Recherches de G\'eod\'esie Spatiale (GRGS) in France. Observations of the various space geodetic techniques (VLBI, SLR, LLR, DORIS and GPS) are separately processed by different analysis centers with the software package GINS-DYNAMO, developed and maintained at the GRGS/CNES (Toulouse). This project is aimed at facilitating fine geophysical analyses of the global Earth system (GGOS project). In this framework, Bordeaux Observatory is in charge of the VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) analyses with GINS for combination with the data of the other space geodetic techniques at the observation level. In this paper, we present (i) the analyses undertaken with this new VLBI software, and (ii) the results obtained for the EOP from beginning 2005 until 2007. Finally, we compare this EOP solution with the IVS (International VLBI Service) Analysis Coordinator combined results. The agreement is at the 0.2 mas level, comparable to that of the other IVS Analysis Centers, which demonstrates the VLBI capability of the GINS software.
