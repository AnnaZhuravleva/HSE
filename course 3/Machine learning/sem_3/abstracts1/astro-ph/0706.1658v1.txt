With the Pierre Auger Observatory we have the capability of detecting ultra-high energy neutrinos by searching for very inclined showers with a significant electromagnetic component. In this work we discuss the discrimination power of the instrument for earth skimming tau neutrinos with ultra-high energies. Based on the data collected since January 2004 an upper limit to the diffuse flux of neutrinos atEeV energies is presented and systematic uncertainties are discussed.
