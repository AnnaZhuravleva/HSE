This paper reports a direct measurement of the Be7 solar neutrino signal rate performed with the Borexino low background liquid scintillator detector. This is the first real-time spectral measurement of sub-MeV solar neutrinos. The result for 0.862 MeV Be7 is 47 +- 7 (stat} +- 12 (sys} counts/(day x 100 ton), consistent with predictions of Standard Solar Models and neutrino oscillations with LMA-MSW parameters.
