Three epochs of high resolution spectra of the star BD+20 307 show that it is a short period (~3.5 day) spectroscopic binary of two nearly identical stars. Surprisingly, the two stars, though differing in effective temperature by only ~250 K and having a mass ratio of 0.91, show very different Li line equivalent widths. A Li 6707 Angstrom line is only detected from the primary star, and it is weak. This star is therefore likely to be older than 1 Gyr. If so, the large amount of hot circumbinary dust must be from a very large and recent, but very late evolutionarily, collision of planetesimals.
