$\iota$ Dra (HIP 75458) is a well-known example for a K giant hosting a substellar companion since its discovery by Frink et al. (2002). We present radial velocity measurements of this star from observations taken with three different instruments spanning nearly 8 years. They show more clearly that the RV period is long-lived and coherent thus supporting the companion hypothesis. The longer time baseline now allows for a more accurate determination of the orbit with a revised period of P=511 d and an additional small linear trend, indicative of another companion in a wide orbit. Moreover we show that the star exhibits low amplitude, solar like oscillations with frequencies around 3-4 d$^{-1}$ (34.7-46.3 $\mu$Hz).
