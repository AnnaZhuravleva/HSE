The Gaia mission will provide an unprecedented 3D view of our galaxy, it will obtain astrometric, photometric and spectrographic data for roughly one billion stars. We are particularly interested in the treasure chest of new data Gaia will produce for hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars. In order for Gaia to classify sdBs and estimate parameters model spectra covering a wide parameter range are needed. Here we describe the construction of an extensive grid, which will be used for this purpose.
