We present updated results for anisotropy searches in the direction of the Galactic Center (GC) at energies in the ranges: 0.1<E<1 EeV and 1<E<10 EeV. We use data from the Pierre Auger Observatory up to March, 2007. Present analyzes are therefore based on a substantially larger data set than our previous published results. A limit on the flux coming from a hypothetical point-like neutron source at the GC for 1<E<10 EeV was imposed, and searches for extended excesses were also performed.
