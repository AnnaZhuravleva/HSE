We present X-ray, infrared and radio observations of the field centered on X-ray source 1E 1547.0-5408 in the Galactic Plane. A new Chandra observation of this source shows it is unresolved at arc-second resolution, and a new XMM observation shows that its X-ray spectrum is best described by an absorbed power-law and blackbody model. A comparison of the X-ray flux observed from this source between 1980 and 2006 reveals that its absorbed 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux decreased from ~2x10^-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 to ~3x10^-13 ergs cm-2 during this period. The most recent XMM observation allows us to put a 5 sigma confidence upper limit of 14% for the 0.5-10 keV peak-to-peak pulsed fraction. A near-infrared observation of this field shows a source with magnitude Ks = 15.9+/-0.2 near the position of 1E 1547.0-5408, but the implied X-ray to infrared flux ratio indicates the infrared emission is from an unrelated field source, allowing us to limit the IR magnitude of 1E 1547.0-5408 to >17.5. Archival radio observations reveal that 1E 1547.0-5408 sits at the center of a faint, small (4' diameter) radio shell, G327.24-0.13, which is possibly a previously unidentified supernova remnant. The X-ray properties of 1E 1547.0-5408 suggest that this source is a magnetar - a young neutron star whose X-ray emission is powered by the decay of its extremely strong magnetic field. The spatial coincidence between this source and G327.24-0.13 suggests that 1E 1547.0-5408 is associated with a young supernova remnant, supporting a neutron star interpretation. Additional observations are needed to confirm the nature of both 1E 1547.0-5408 and G327.24-0.13, and to determine if these sources are associated. If so, this pair will be an important addition to the small number of known associations between magnetars and supernova remnants.
