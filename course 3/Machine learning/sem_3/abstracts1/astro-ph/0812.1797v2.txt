We present projections for reconstruction of the inflationary potential expected from ESA's upcoming Planck Surveyor CMB mission. We focus on the effects that tensor perturbations and the presence of non-Gaussianities have on reconstruction efforts in the context of non-canonical inflation models. We consider potential constraints for different combinations of detection/null-detection of tensors and non-Gaussianities. We perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo and flow analyses on a simulated Planck-precision data set to obtain constraints. We find that a failure to detect non-Gaussianities precludes a successful inversion of the primordial power spectrum, greatly affecting uncertainties, even in the presence of a tensor detection. In the absence of a tensor detection, while unable to determine the energy scale of inflation, an observable level of non-Gaussianities provides correlations between the errors of the potential parameters, suggesting that constraints might be improved for suitable combinations of parameters. Constraints are optimized for a positive detection of both tensors and non-Gaussianities.
