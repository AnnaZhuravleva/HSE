We consider a scenario where keV sterile neutrinos constitute all of the currently inferred dark matter abundance, whose radiative decays could potentially account for the flux contributions to the X-ray background attributed to unresolved sources. Here we apply integrated flux methods to results from the observations of the North and South Chandra deep fields in order to deduce constraints on the sterile neutrino mass-mixing parameters.
