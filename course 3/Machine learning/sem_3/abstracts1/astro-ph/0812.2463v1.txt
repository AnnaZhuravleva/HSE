An overview of the ESO/Radionet workshop devoted to 3D optical/near-infrared and sub-mm/radio observations of gas and stars in galaxies is presented. There will be no published proceedings but presentations are available at http://www.eso.org/sci/meetings/gal3D2008/program.html . The main aim of this ESO/Radionet workshop was to bring together the optical/ near-IR and sub-mm/radio communities working on three-dimensional (3D) extragalactic data. The meeting was attended by more than 150 scientists. This article, due to space limitations, provides a, necessarily biased, overview of the meeting.
