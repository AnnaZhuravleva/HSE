The simplest version of the daemon paradigm suggests the modulated 2-6-keV range events in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA detectors are caused by the iodine ions knocked out elastically by the electrically neutral c-daemons moving with V = 30-50 km/s (c-daemon is a complex of negative daemon located in a remainder of formerly captured nucleus where the daemon decomposes nucleons one by one with ~10^-6 s mean interval). Furthermore, after the 2-6 keV event occurred, in subsequent ~10^-6 s, the c-daemon (which becomes negative during this time) recaptures new nucleus with resulting scintillations in ~10 MeV range! The last possibility was so far overlooked in the experiments as it did not stem from WIMP hypotheses. A modification of the NaI(Tl) experiments is suggested for revealing the effect described. Independently of the outcome, any obtained result will be important for refining the daemon paradigm further on.
