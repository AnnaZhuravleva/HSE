The cannibalism mechanism of formation of cD galaxies in clusters of Bautz-Morgan class I is analyzed. Dependences between absolute magnitude of cD galaxies, and of the clusters in which they reside (richness, redshifts) are considered. Evidences are presented in favor of formation of cD galaxies by cannibalism and their evolution.
