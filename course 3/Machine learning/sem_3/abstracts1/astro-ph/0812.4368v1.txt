We present some results of an observational and theoretical study on unresolved stellar systems based on the Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) technique. It is shown that SBF magnitudes are a valuable tracer of stellar population properties, and a reliable distance indicator. SBF magnitudes, SBF-colors, and SBF-gradients can help to constrain within relatively narrow limits the metallicity and age of the dominant stellar component in distant stellar systems, especially if coupled with other spectro-photometric indicators.
