The detached eclipsing binary V20 in the old, metal--rich open cluster NGC 6791 is studied in order to determine highly accurate masses and radii of its components. This allows the cluster age to be established with high precision, using isochrones in the mass-radius diagram. We employ high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of V20 to determine the spectroscopic orbit and time-series V, I photometry to obtain the photometric elements. The masses and radii of the V20 components are found to be1.074+/-0.008Msun and 1.399+/-0.016Rsun (primary) and 0.827+/-0.004Msun and 0.768+/-0.006Rsun (secondary). The primary is located almost exactly at the hottest point along the cluster isochrone, and the secondary is a ~7 times fainter main--sequence star. We determine an apparent cluster distance-modulus of (m-M)_V = 13.46+/-0.10 (average of primary and secondary). The cluster age is obtained from comparisons with theoretical isochrones in the mass--radius diagram. Using the isochrones from Victoria--Regina with [Fe/H] =+0.37 we find 7.7+/-0.5Gyr, whereas the Yonsei-Yale (Y2) isochrones lead to 8.2+/-0.5Gyr, and BaSTI isochrones to 9.0+/-0.5Gyr. In a mass-radius diagram, the 7.7Gyr VRSS and 9.0Gyr BaSTI isochrones overlap nearly perfectly despite the age-difference. This model dependence, which is significantly larger than the precision determined from mass, radius, and abundance uncertainties, prevents a definitive age-determination of the cluster. By observing a suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters it should be possible to calibrate the age--scale and provide firm constraints which stellar models must reproduce.
