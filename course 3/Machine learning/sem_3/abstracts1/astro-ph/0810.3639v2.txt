H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System), which is designed to detect TeV gamma-rays, is a system of four Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes situated in Namibia. The system has been shown to be very successful in detecting and observing galactic and extra-galactic TeV sources. In order to explore the highest energy end of GRB spectra, a GRB observing program has been established in the H.E.S.S. collaboration. Here we introduce our GRB observing program and report on its current status.
