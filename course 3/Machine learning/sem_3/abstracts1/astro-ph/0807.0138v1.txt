Properties of Lyman Break Galaxies at $z\sim5$ are presented and are compared with those at $z\sim 2-3$ LBGs to see evolution of LBGs from $z\sim5$ to $z \sim3-2$. The LBGs at $z\sim5$ are tend to have smaller stellar masses, but they may show large star formation rates and specific star formation rates.
