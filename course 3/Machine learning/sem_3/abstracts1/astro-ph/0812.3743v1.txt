The bulge is a region of the Galaxy of tremendous interest for understanding galaxy formation. However measuring photometry and kinematics in it raises several inherent issues, such as severe crowding and high extinction in the visible. Using the Besancon Galaxy model and a 3D extinction map, we estimate the stellar density as a function of longitude, latitude and apparent magnitude and we deduce the possibility of reaching and measuring bulge stars with Gaia. We also present an ongoing analysis of the bulge using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.
