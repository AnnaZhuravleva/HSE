Completion of the SUPERBLINK proper motion survey in the southern celestial hemisphere has turned up 170 new stars with proper motion 0.45 arcsec/yr < pm < 2.0 arcsec/yr. This fourth and final installment completes the all-sky, data-mining of the Digitized Sky Surveys for stars with large proper motions. The areas investigated in this final installment comprise 11,600 square degrees in the declination range -30 degrees < Decl. <0 degrees, and in low galactic latitude areas south of Decl.= -30 degrees which had not been covered in earlier data releases. Astrometric and photometric data are provided for the 170 new stars, along with finder charts. Most of the new discoveries are found in densely populated fields along the Milky Way, towards the Galactic bulge/center. The list of new discoveries includes 4 stars with proper motion pm >1.0 arcsec/yr. The total list of high proper motion stars recovered by SUPERBLINK in the southern sky now includes 2,228 stars with proper motions 0.45 arcsec/yr < pm <2.0 arcsec/yr.
