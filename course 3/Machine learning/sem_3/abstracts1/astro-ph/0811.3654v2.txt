We present an analysis of a 40 ksec Chandra observation of the galaxy group AWM 5. It has a small ($\sim8$ kpc) dense cool core with a temperature of $\sim1.2$ keV and the temperature profile decreases at larger radii, from $\sim3.5$ keV just outside the core to $\sim2$ keV at $\sim300$ kpc from the center. The abundance distribution shows a "hole" in the central $\sim10$ kpc, where the temperature declines sharply. An abundance of at least a few times solar is observed $\sim15-20$ kpc from the center. The deprojected electron density profile shows a break in slope at $\sim13$ kpc and can be fit by two $\beta$-models, with $\beta=0.72_{-0.11}^{+0.16}$ and $r_c=5.7_{-1.5}^{+1.8}$ kpc, for the inner part, and $\beta=0.34\pm0.01$ and $r_c=31.3_{-5.5}^{+5.8}$ kpc, for the outer part. The mass fraction of hot gas is fairly flat in the center and increases for $r>30$ kpc up to a maximum of $\sim6.5%$ at $r\sim380$ kpc. The gas cooling time within the central 30 kpc is smaller than a Hubble time, although the temperature only declines in the central $\sim8$ kpc region. This discrepancy suggests that an existing cooling core has been partially re-heated. In particular, thermal conduction could have been a significant source of re-heating. In order for heating due to conduction to balance cooling due to emission of X-rays, the conductivity must be suppressed by a large factor (at least $\sim100$). Past AGN activity (still visible as a radio source in the center of the group) is however the most likely source that re-heated the central regions of AWM 5.
