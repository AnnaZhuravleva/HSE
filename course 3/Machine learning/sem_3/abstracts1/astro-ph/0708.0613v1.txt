We present a study of MSX point sources in the Galactic bulge (|l| < 3 deg, 1 deg < |b| < 5 deg), observed at A, C, D and E-band (8 to 21 micron), with a total area ~ 48 deg^2. We discuss the nature of the MSX sources (mostly AGB stars), their luminosities, the interstellar extinction, the mass-loss rate distribution and the total mass-loss rate in the bulge. The MIR data of MSX point sources have been combined with the NIR (J, H and Ks) data of 2MASS survey. The cross-identification was restricted to Ks-band detected sources with Ks <= 11 mag. However, for those bright MSX D-band sources ([D] < 4.0 mag), which do not satisfy this criteria, we have set no Ks-band magnitude cut off. The relation between Mdot and (Ks-[15])0 was used to derive the mass-loss rate of each MSX source in the bulge fields. Except for very few post-AGB stars, PNe and OH/IR stars, a large fraction of the detected sources at 15 micron (MSX D-band) are AGB stars well above the RGB tip. A number of them show an excess in ([A]-[D])0 and (Ks-[D])0 colours, characteristic of mass-loss. These colours, especially (Ks-[D])0, enable estimation of the mass-loss rates (Mdot) of the sources in the bulge fields which range from 10^{-7} to 10^{-4} Msun/yr. Taking into consideration the completeness of the mass-loss rate bins, we find that the contribution to the integrated mass-loss is probably dominated by mass-loss rates larger than 3x10^{-7} Msun/yr and is about 1.96 x 10^{-4} Msun/yr/deg^2 in the "intermediate" and "outer" bulge fields of sources with mass-loss rates, Mdot > 3x10^{-7} Msun/yr. The corresponding integrated mass-loss rate per unit stellar mass is 0.48x10^{-11} yr^{-1}. Apart from this, the various MIR and NIR CC and CM diagrams are discussed in the paper to study the nature of the stellar population in the MSX bulge fields.
