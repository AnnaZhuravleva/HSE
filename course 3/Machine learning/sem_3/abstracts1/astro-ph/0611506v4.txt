Several independent observations of the Galactic core suggest hitherto unexplained sources of energy. We suggest that dark matter in the form of dense antimatter nuggets could provide a natural site for electron and proton annihilation, providing 511 keV photons, gamma-rays, and diffuse keV x-ray radiation. We show that identifying dark matter as antimatter nuggets is consistent with the observed emissions, and we make definite predictions about their spectrum and morphology. If correct, our proposal not only identifies dark matter and explains baryogenesis, but allows x-ray observations to directly probe the matter distribution in our Galaxy.
