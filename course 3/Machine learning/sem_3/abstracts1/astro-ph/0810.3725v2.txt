We analyzed the regions of star formation in the spiral galaxies NGC 3184 and NGC 3938 from archive images at multiple wavelengths (NUV from GALEX, H-alpha from JKT and KPNO, 8 and 24 um from Spitzer, and CO from BIMA). We used the Clump Find Algorithm to extract the properties of the star forming tracers shown as emission regions at each wavelength. We obtained a power-law relation between the luminosity and the emission region volume that scales as expected, $L proportional to V, for the H-alpha and NUV emission; but much faster for the dust (8 and 24 um) and molecular gas emitting regions in CO. This is interpreted as a change on the emissivity with the size of the cloud, either by an augmentation of the overall density or due to the presence of high density clumps, with high local emissivity coefficients. Although the clumpy nature of molecular gas may not be surprising, the clumpy nature of mid-infrared emission regions, that could be explained by newly formed high to intermediate mass stars embedded into the dust and heating it, is clearly revealed in both galaxies.
