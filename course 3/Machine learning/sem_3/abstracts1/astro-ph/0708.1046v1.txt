Searching for lopsided/interacting objects among ~1500 isolated galaxies yields only eight strongly disturbed galaxies which may be explained as a result of their interaction with massive dark objects. We present results of spectral and photometric observations of these galaxies performed with the 6-m telescope that lead to significant restriction on cosmic abundance of dark galaxies.
