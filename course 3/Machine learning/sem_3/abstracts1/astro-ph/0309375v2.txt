Using a combination of N-body simulations with different resolutions, we study in detail how the concentrations of cold dark matter (CDM) halos depend on halo mass at different redshifts. We confirm that halo concentrations at the present time depend strongly on halo mass, but our results also show marked differences from the predictions of some early empirical models. Our main result is that the mass dependence of the concentrations becomes weaker at higher redshifts, and at z >~ 3 halos of mass greater than 10^{11} Msun/h all have a similar median concentration, c ~ 3.5. While the median concentrations of low-mass halos grow significantly with time, those of massive halos change only little with redshifts. These results are quantitatively in good agreement with the empirical model proposed by Zhao et al. which shows that halos in the early fast accretion phase all have similar concentrations.
