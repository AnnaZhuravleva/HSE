In recent years, increasing evidence for chemical complexity and multiple stellar populations in massive globular clusters (GCs) has emerged, including extreme horizontal branches (EHBs) and UV excess. Our goal is to improve our understanding of UV excess in the regime of both massive GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). To this end, we use deep archival GALEX data of the central Fornax cluster to measure NUV and FUV magnitudes of UCDs and massive GCs. We obtain NUV photometry for a sample of 35 compact objects with -13.5<M_V<-10 mag. Of those, 21 objects also have FUV photometry. Roughly half of the sources fall into the UCD luminosity regime (M_V <=-11 mag). We find that seven out of 17 massive Fornax GCs exhibit a NUV excess with respect to expectations from stellar population models, even for models with enhanced Helium abundance. This suggests that not only He-enrichment has contributed to forming the EHB population of these GCs. The GCs extend to stronger UV excess than GCs in M31 and massive GCs in M87, at the 97% confidence level. Most of the UCDs with FUV photometry also show evidence for UV excess, but their UV colours can be matched by isochrones with enhanced Helium abundances and old ages 12-14 Gyrs. We find that Fornax compact objects with X-ray emission detected from Chandra images are almost disjunct in colour from compact objects with GALEX UV detection, with only one X-ray source among the 35 compact objects. However, since this source is one of the three most UV bright GCs, we cannot exclude that the physical processes causing X-ray emission also contribute to some of the observed UV excess.
