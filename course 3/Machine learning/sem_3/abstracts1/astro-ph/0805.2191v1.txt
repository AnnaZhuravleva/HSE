Using a high resolution cosmological simulation of reionization we have examined the differing structures formed by gas and dark matter at a redshift of 5.1. Baryon-rich regions form a small number of filaments, which connect the largest galaxies in the simulation. More detailed examination of the ten largest galaxies reveals long, slender gaseous filaments about 5 proper kpc in width radiating from the galaxy centers. Extending out from each filament are a few smooth, thin, nearly planar gaseous sheets. By contrast, the dark matter concentrates into quasi-spherical bodies. The results have implications for our understanding of structure formation in the early universe and of the Lyman alpha forest.
