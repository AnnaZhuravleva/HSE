We discuss the consequences of the accretion of dark matter (DM) particles on compact stars such as white dwarfs and neutron stars. We show that in large regions of the DM parameter space, these objects are sensitive probes of the presence of DM and can be used to set constraints both on the DM density and on the physical properties of DM particles.
