VERITAS is an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array designed to study astrophysi cal sources of very-high-energy gamma radiation. Located in southern Arizona, USA, the array consists of four 12m-diameter imaging Cherenkov telescopes. All four telescopes have been deployed at the basecamp of the Whipple Observatory and began full operation in early 2007. This paper describes the operational status of VERITAS, outlines the initial performance parameters of the instrument, and presents the latest results that have been obtained.
