We report on a S/N-limited search for low-ionization gas outflows in the spectra of the 0.11 < z < 0.54 objects in the EGS portion of the DEEP2 survey. Doppler shifts from the host galaxy redshifts are systematically searched for in the Na I 5890,96 doublet (Na D). Although the spectral resolution and S/N limit us to study the interstellar gas kinematics from fitting a single doublet component to each observed Na D profile, the typical outflow often seen in local luminous-infrared galaxies (LIRGs) should be detected at >~ 6 sigma in absorption equivalent width down to the survey limiting S/N (~ 5 per pixel) in the continuum around Na D. The detection rate of LIRG-like outflow clearly shows an increasing trend with star-forming activity and infrared luminosity. However, by virtue of not selecting our sample on star formation, we also find a majority of outflows in galaxies on the red sequence in the rest-frame (U-B, M_B) color-magnitude diagram. Most of these red-sequence outflows are of early-type morphology and show the sign of recent star formation in their UV-optical colors; some show enhanced Balmer H-beta absorption lines indicative of poststarburst as well as high dust extinction. These findings demonstrate that outflows outlive starbursts and suggest that galactic-scale outflows play a role in quenching star formation in the host galaxies on their way to the red sequence. The fate of relic winds, as well as the observational constraints on gaseous feedback models, may be studied in galaxies during their poststarburst phase. We also note the presence of inflow candidates in red, early-type galaxies, some with signs of AGNs/LINERs but little evidence for star formation.
