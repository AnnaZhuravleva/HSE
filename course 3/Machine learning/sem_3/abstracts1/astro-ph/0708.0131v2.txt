In the present work we apply a quantum hadrodynamic effective model in the mean-field approximation to the description of neutron stars. We consider an adjustable derivative-coupling model and study the parameter influence on the dynamics of the system by analyzing the full range of values they can take. We establish a set of parameters which define a specific model that is able to describe phenomenological properties such as the effective nucleon mass at saturation as well as global static properties of neutron stars (mass and radius). If one uses observational data to fix the maximum mass for neutron stars by a specific model, we are able to predict the compression modulus of nuclear matter K = 257,2MeV.
