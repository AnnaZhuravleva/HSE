We present a table of redshifts for 2907 galaxies and stars in the 145 square arcmin HST ACS GOODS-North, making this the most spectroscopically complete redshift sample obtained to date in a field of this size. We also include the redshifts, where available, in a table containing just under 7000 galaxies from the ACS area with K_s(AB)<24.5 measured from a deep K_s image obtained with WIRCam on the CFHT, as well as in a table containing 1016 sources with NUV(AB)<25 and 478 sources with FUV(AB)<25.5 (there is considerable overlap) measured from the deep GALEX images in the ACS area. Finally, we include the redshifts, where available, in a table containing the 1199 24 micron sources to 80 uJy measured from the wider-area Spitzer GOODS-North. The redshift identifications are greater than 90% complete to magnitudes of F435W(AB)=24.5, F850LP(AB)=23.3, and K_s(AB)=21.5 and to 24 micron fluxes of 250 uJy. An extensive analysis of these data will appear in a parallel paper, but here we determine how efficient color-selection techniques are at identifying high-redshift galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei. We also examine the feasibility of doing tomography of the intergalactic medium with a 30 m telescope.
