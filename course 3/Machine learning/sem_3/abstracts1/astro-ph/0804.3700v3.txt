We show three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of core collapse supernova in which the progenitor has magnetic fields inclined to the rotation axis. The simulations employed a simple empirical equation of state in which the pressure of degenerate gas is approximated by piecewise polytropes for simplicity. Neither energy loss due to neutrino is taken into account for simplicity. The simulations start from the stage of dynamical collapse of an iron core. The dynamical collapse halts at $ t $ = 189 ms by the pressure of high density gas and a proto-neutron star (PNS) forms. The evolution of PNS was followed about 40 milli-seconds in typical models. When the initial rotation is mildly fast and the initial magnetic fields are mildly strong, bipolar jets are launched from an upper atmosphere ($ r \sim 60 {\rm km} $) of the PNS. The jets are accelerated to $ \sim 3 \times 10 ^4 $ km s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the escape velocity at the foot point. The jets are parallel to the initial rotation axis. Before the launch of the jets, magnetic fields are twisted by rotation of the PNS. The twisted magnetic fields form torus-shape multi-layers in which the azimuthal component changes alternately. The formation of magnetic multi-layers is due to the initial condition in which the magnetic fields are inclined with respect to the rotation axis. The energy of the jet depends only weakly on the initial magnetic field assumed. When the initial magnetic fields are weaker, the time lag is longer between the PNS formation and jet ejection. It is also shown that the time lag is related to the Alfv\'en transit time. Although the nearly spherical prompt shock propagates outward in our simulations, it is ...
