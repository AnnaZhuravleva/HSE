Using grid refinement, we have simulated solar granulation in 2D. The refined region measures 1.97*2.58 Mm (vertical*horizontal). Grid spacing there is 1.82*2.84 km. The downflows exhibit strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. Below the photosphere, acoustic pulses are generated. They proceed laterally (in some cases distances of at least the size of our refined domain) and may be enhanced when transversing downflows) as well as upwards where, in the photosphere they contribute significantly to 'turbulence' (velocity gradients, etc.) The acoustic pulses are ubiquitous in that at any time several of them are seen in our high-resolution domain. Their possible contributions to p-mode excitation or heating of the chromosphere needs to be investigated.
