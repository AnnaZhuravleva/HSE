We present the BRAIN Experiment, a project of B-mode experiment using a novel technology, bolometric interferometry. This technique is a promising alternative to direct imaging experiments since it combines the advantages of interferometry in terms of systematic effects handling and those of bolometry in terms of sensitivity. We briefly introduce some of the bolometric interferometry key concepts and difficulties. We then give the specifications of the BRAIN future detector. A first module of the final instrument is planned to be installed at Dome C in 2010. We hope to constrain a tensor to scalar modes ratio of 0.01 with nine modules and one effective year of data. BRAIN is a collaboration between France, Italy and United Kingdom.
