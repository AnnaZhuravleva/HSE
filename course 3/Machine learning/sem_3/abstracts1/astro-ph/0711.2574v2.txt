The nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco with its high mass to light ratio is one of the most auspicious targets for indirect dark matter searches. Annihilation of hypothetical DM particles can result in high-energy gamma-rays, e.g. from neutralino annihilation in the supersymmetric framework. With the MAGIC telescope a search for a possible DM signal originating from Draco was performed during 2007. The analysis of the data results in a flux upper limit of 1.1x10^-11 photons cm^-2 sec^-1 for photon energies above 140 GeV, assuming a point like source. Furthermore, a comparison with predictions from supersymmetric models is given. While our results do not constrain the mSUGRA phase parameter space, a very high flux enhancement can be ruled out.
