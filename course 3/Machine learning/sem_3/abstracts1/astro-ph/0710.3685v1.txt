Relic neutralinos produced after the Big Bang are favoured candidates for Dark Matter. They can accumulate at the centre of massive celestial objects like our Sun. Their annihilation can result in a high-energy neutrino flux that could be detectable as a localised emission with earth-based neutrino telescopes like ANTARES. In this paper a brief overview of the prospects of the indirect search for Dark Matter particles with the ANTARES detector will be given. The analysis method and expected performance for the detection of the expected neutrinos will be discussed.
