We present the results of a spectroscopic investigation of 108 nearby field B-stars. We derive their key stellar parameters, $V \sin i$, $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, and $\log g_{\rm polar}$, using the same methods that we used in our previous cluster B-star survey. By comparing the results of the field and the cluster samples, we find that the main reason for the overall slower rotation of the field sample is that it contains a larger fraction of older stars than found in the (mainly young) cluster sample.
