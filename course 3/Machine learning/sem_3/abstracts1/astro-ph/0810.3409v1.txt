We report on the first results obtained with the IceTop air shower array on the cosmic ray energy spectrum and mass composition in the range of 1 PeV to 80 PeV. IceTop is the surface detector of the IceCube neutrino telescope currently under construction at the South Pole. A high sensitivity to the primary mass composition was observed by reconstructing showers at different zenith angles. Assuming only protons or iron nuclei as primary particles yields significantly different energy spectra for different zenith angle ranges, while only models with mixed composition, like the poly-gonato model, lead to the expected isotropic flux. The prospects of composition measurements with different, alternative methods using the full IceCube detector are also discussed.
