When a star collapses to form a black hole, its entropy increases considerably, for a solar mass black hole, there is a factor of 1019 increase in entropy. This corresponds to a tremendous loss of information as only the total mass, angular momentum or electric charge (if any) of the matter going inside the horizon can be measured by an outside observer. Information about all other characteristics of the matter becomes irrelevant.
