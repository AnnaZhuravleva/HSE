Observations of eclipses of the radio pulsar B1259-63 by the disk of its Be-star companion SS 2883 provide an excellent opportunity to study the winds of stars of this type. The eclipses lead to variations in the radio flux (due to variations in the free-free absorption), dispersion measure, rotation measure, and linear polarization of the pulsar. We have carried out numerical modeling of the parameters of the Be-star wind and compared the results with observations.
