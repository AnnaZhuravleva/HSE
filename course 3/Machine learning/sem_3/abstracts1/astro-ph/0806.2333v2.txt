We explore the ability of measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum during reionization to enable the simultaneous reconstruction of the reionization history and the properties of the ionizing sources. For various sets of simulated 21-cm measurements, we perform maximum likelihood fits in order to constrain the reionization and galaxy formation histories. We employ a flexible six-parameter model that parametrizes the uncertainties in the properties of high-redshift galaxies. The computational speed needed is attained through the use of an analytical model that is in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations of reionization. We find that one-year observations with the MWA array should measure the cosmic ionized fraction to ~ 1% accuracy at the very end of reionization, and a few percent accuracy around the mid-point of reionization. The mean halo mass of the ionizing sources should be measureble to 10% accuracy when reionization is 2/3 of the way through, and to 20% accuracy throughout the central stage of reionization, if this mass is anywhere in the range 1/3 to 100 billion solar masses.
