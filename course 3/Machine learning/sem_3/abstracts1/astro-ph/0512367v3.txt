The effects of mass-varying neutrinos on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and large scale structures (LSS) are studied. In these models, dark energy and neutrinos are coupled such that the neutrino masses are functions of the scalar field playing the role of dark energy. We begin by describing the cosmological background evolution of such a system. It is pointed out that, similar to models with a dark matter/dark energy interaction, the apparent equation of state measured with SNIa can be smaller than -1. We then discuss the effect of mass-varying neutrinos on the CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum. A suppression of power in the CMB power spectrum at large angular scales is usually observed. We give an explanation for this behaviour and discuss different couplings and quintessence potentials to show the generality of the results obtained. We perform a likelihood analysis using wide-ranging SNIa, CMB and LSS observations to assess whether such theories are viable. Treating the neutrino mass as a free parameter we find that the constraints on the coupling are weak, since CMB and LSS surveys give only upper bounds on the neutrino mass. However, fixing a priori the neutrino masses, we find that there is some evidence that the existence of such a coupling is actually preferred by current cosmological data over the standard LambdaCDM cosmology.
