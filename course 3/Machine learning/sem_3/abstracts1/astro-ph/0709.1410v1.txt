In February 2007 the MAGIC Air Cherenkov Telescope for gamma-ray astronomy was fully upgraded with an ultra fast 2 GSamples/s digitization system. Since the Cherenkov light flashes are very short, a fast readout can minimize the influence of the background from the light of the night sky. Also, the time structure of the event is an additional parameter to reduce the background from unwanted hadronic showers. An overview of the performance of the new system and its impact on the sensitivity of the MAGIC instrument will be presented.
