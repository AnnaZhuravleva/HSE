We analyse whether hierarchical formation models based on Lambda cold dark matter cosmology can produce enough massive red galaxies to match observations. For this purpose, we compare with observations the predictions from two published models for the abundance and redshift distribution of Extremely Red Objects (EROs), which are red, massive galaxies observed at z >= 1. One of the models invokes a "superwind" to regulate star formation in massive haloes and the other suppresses cooling through "radio-mode" AGN feedback. The first one underestimates the number counts of EROs by an order of magnitude, whereas the radio-mode AGN feedback model gives excellent agreement with the number counts of EROs and redshift distribution of K-selected galaxies. This study highlights the need to consider AGN feedback in order to understand the formation and evolution of massive galaxies at z >= 1.
