We review knowledge of galaxy structures obtained by their emitted light and in the local universe where they can be studied in great detail. We discuss the shapes of, and stellar motions within, galaxies, compositional clues derived from their spectra, and what luminous matter implies about their dark matter content. Implications on the current theory of hierarchical galaxy formation are explored.
