We model the high-energy emission that results from the interaction of relativistic particles with photons and matter in the cluster of galaxies Abell 3376. The presence of relativistic particles is inferred from the recently found radio relics in this cluster, being one of the most prominent examples of double opposite, giant ringlike radio structures. Assuming that diffusive shock acceleration takes place in the cluster regions where radio relics are observed, we calculate the spectral energy distribution resulting from the most relevant non-thermal processes, which are synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, and inelastic proton-proton collisions. In the context of our model, the major radiative component at high energies is inverse Compton scattering, which could reach luminosities L ~ 9x10^{41} erg/s in the energy range between ~ 1 MeV and 10 TeV. Hadronic interactions would yield a minor contribution to the overall non-thermal emission, but would dominate at ultra-high energies. The cluster Abell 3376 might be detectable at gamma-rays by HESS, GLAST satellite and future planned Cherenkov arrays.
