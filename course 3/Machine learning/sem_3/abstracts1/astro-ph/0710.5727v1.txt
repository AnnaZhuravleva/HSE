We communicate the detection of soft (20--200 keV) gamma-rays from the pulsar and pulsar wind nebula of PSR J1846-0258 and aim to identify the component of the system which is responsible for the gamma-ray emission. To pinpoint the source of gamma-ray emission we combine spectral information from the INTEGRAL gamma-ray mission with archival data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Our analysis shows that the soft gamma-rays detected from PSR J1846-0258 include emission from both the pulsar and the pulsar wind nebula, but the measured spectral shape is dominated by the pulsar wind nebula. We further discuss PSR J1846-0258 in the context of rotation-powered pulsars with high magnetic field strengths and review the anomalously high fraction of spin-down luminosity converted into X- and gamma-ray emission in light of a possible overestimate of the distance to this pulsar.
