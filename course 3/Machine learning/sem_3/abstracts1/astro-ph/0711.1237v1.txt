With a non local shell model of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence we investigate numerically the turbulent dynamo action for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers ($Pm$). The results obtained in the kinematic regime and along the way to dynamo saturation are understood in terms of a phenomenological approach based on the local ($Pm\ll 1$) or non local ($Pm\gg 1$) nature of the energy transfers. In both cases the magnetic energy grows at small scale and saturates as an inverse `` cascade ''.
