The power spectrum of number density perturbations of free electrons is obtained for the epoch of cosmological recombination of hydrogen. It is shown that amplitude of the electron perturbations power spectrum of scales larger than acoustic horizon exceeds by factor of 17 the amplitude of baryon matter density ones (atoms and ions of hydrogen and helium). In the range of the first and second acoustic peaks such relation is 18, in the range of the third one 16. The dependence of such relations on cosmological parameters is analysed too.
