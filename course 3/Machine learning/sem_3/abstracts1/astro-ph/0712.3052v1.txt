As the Chandra X-ray Observatory mission matures, increasing numbers of nearby galaxies are being observed multiple times, sampling the variability of extragalactic X-ray binaries on timescales extending from seconds to years. We present results on luminous low-mass X-ray binaries from several early-type galaxies. We show that instantaneous LMXB luminosity functions of early-type galaxies do not significantly change between observations; a relatively low fraction of sources are strongly variable on <~ 5 yr timescales. We discuss the implications that a relatively small number of transient LMXBs are being discovered in early-type galaxies.
