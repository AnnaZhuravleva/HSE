In this work we study the cosmological evolution of a dark energy model with two scalar fields, i.e. the tachyon and the phantom tachyon. This model enables the equation of state $w$ to change from $w>-1$ to $w<-1$ in the evolution of the universe. The phase-space analysis for such a system with inverse square potentials shows that there exists a unique stable critical point, which has power-law solutions. In this paper, we also study another form of tachyon-quintom model with two fields, which voluntarily involves the interactions between both fields.
