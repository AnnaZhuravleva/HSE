The variable star DZ Cru was thought to be a nova when it was discovered in eruption in 2003 August. This explanation was later challenged, however, when the first spectra of the object were reported. We present near infrared spectroscopy of DZ Cru obtained at the New Technology Telescope on 3 occasions, starting 1.5 years after outburst, with the aim of establishing the nature of the object. The spectra display H I, O I, [N I] emission lines, together with He I P Cygni lines superposed on a dust continuum. These observations suggest the "peculiar variable in Crux'' is a classical nova.
