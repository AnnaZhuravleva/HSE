We present infrared JHK time series photometry of the variable star RR Lyr, that allow us to construct the first complete and accurate infrared light curves for this star. The derived mean magnitudes are <J>=6.74 +/- 0.02, <H>=6.60 +/- 0.03 and <K>=6.50 +/- 0.02. The <K> magnitude is used to estimate the reddening, the mass, the mean luminosity and temperature of this variable star. The use of these RR Lyr data provide a more accurate absolute calibration of the P-L_K-[Fe/H] relation, and a distance modulus (m-M)_0=18.48 +/- 0.11 to the globular cluster Reticulum in the LMC.
