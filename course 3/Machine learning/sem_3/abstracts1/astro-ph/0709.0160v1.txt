The lunar Cherenkov technique, which aims to detect the coherent Cherenkov radiation produced when UHE particles interact in the lunar regolith, was first attempted with the Parkes radio-telescope in 1995, though the theory was not sufficiently developed at this time to calculate a limit on the UHE neutrino flux from the non-observation. Since then, the technique has evolved to include experiments utilising lower frequencies, wider bandwidths, and entire arrays of antenna. We develop a simulation to analyse the full range of experiments, and calculate the UHE neutrino flux limit from the Parkes experiment, including the directional dependence. Our results suggest a methodology for planning future observations, and demonstrate how to utilise all available information on the nature of radio pulses from the Moon for the detection of UHE particles.
