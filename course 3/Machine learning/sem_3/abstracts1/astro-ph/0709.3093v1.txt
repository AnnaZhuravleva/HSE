We analyze 205 ks of imaging data of the active binary, Capella, obtained with the Chandra High Resolution Camera Imager (HRC-I) to determine whether Capella shows any variability at timescales < 50 ks. We find that a clear signal for variability is present for timescales < 20 ks, and that the light curves show evidence for excess fluctuation over that expected from a purely Poisson process. This overdispersion is consistent with variability at the 2-7% level, and suggests that the coronae on the binary components of Capella are composed of low-density plasma and low-lying loops.
