I investigate multi-field inflationary models with fields that decay during inflation, leading to staggered inflation. This feature is natural in many models motivated by string theory, for instance if inflatons are related to interbrane distances and the branes start to annihilate during inflation. A short exposition to an analytic framework is provided, enabling the computation of leading order corrections to observables, i.e. the scalar spectral index.
