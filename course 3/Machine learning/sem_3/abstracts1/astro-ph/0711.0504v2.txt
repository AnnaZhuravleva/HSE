In this paper it is given a brief review of the current limits on the magnitude of CPT and Lorentz Invariance violations, currently predicted in connection with quantum gravity and string/M-theory, that can be derived from astrophysical and cosmological data. Even if not completely unambiguous, these observational tests of fundamental physics are complementary to the ones obtained by accelerator experiments and by ground or space based direct experiments, because potentially can access very high energies and large distances.
