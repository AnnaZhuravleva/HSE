The theoretical discription of a hot star interior is obtained. It explains the distribution of stars over their masses, mass-radius-temperature and mass-luminosity dependencies. The theory of the apsidal rotation of binary stars and the spectrum of solar oscillation is considered. All obrained theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the known measurement data, which confirms the validity of this consideration.
