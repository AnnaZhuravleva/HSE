The long-slit spectra obtained along the minor axis, offset major axis and diagonal axis are presented for 12 E and S0 galaxies of the Coma cluster drawn from a magnitude-limited sample studied before. The rotation curves, velocity dispersion profiles and the H_3 and H_4 coefficients of the Hermite decomposition of the line of sight velocity distribution are derived. The radial profiles of the Hbeta, Mg, and Fe line strength indices are measured too. In addition, the surface photometry of the central regions of a subsample of 4 galaxies recently obtained with Hubble Space Telescope is presented. The data will be used to construct dynamical models of the galaxies and study their stellar populations.
