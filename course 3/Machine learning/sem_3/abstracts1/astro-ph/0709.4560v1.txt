To study the mass distribution of galaxy clusters up to their Virial radius, CL0016+16 seems to be a good candidate,since it is a bright massive cluster, previously considered as being dynamically relaxed. Using XMM-Newton observations of CL0016+16, we performed a careful X-ray background analysis, and we detected convincingly its X-ray emission up to $R_{200}$. We then studied its dynamical state with a detailed 2D temperature and surface brightness analysis of the inner part of the cluster. Using the assumption of both spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) we can determine the main cluster parameters: total mass, temperature profile, surface brightness profile and $\beta$-parameter. We also build a temperature map which clearly exhibits departure from spherical symmetry in the centre. To estimate the influence of these perturbations onto our total mass estimate, we also compute the total mass in the framework of the HE approach, but this time with various temperature profiles obtained in different directions. These various total mass estimates are consistent with each other. The temperature perturbations are clear signatures of ongoing merger activity. We also find significant residuals after subtracting the emissivity map by a 2D $\beta$-model fit. We conclude that, although CL0016+16 shows clear signs of merger activity and departure from spherical symmetry in the centre, its X-ray emissivity can be detected up to $R_{200}$ and the corresponding mass $M_{200}$ can be computed directly. It is therefore a good candidate to study cosmological scaling laws as predicted by the theory.
