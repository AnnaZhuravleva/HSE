We present a method that allows us to estimate the distance from the continuum source located in the center of AGN to the highly ionized gas called warm absorber. We compute a set of constant total pressure photoionization models compatible with the warm absorber conditions, where a metal-rich gas is irradiated by a continuum in the form of a double power-law. The first power-law is hard up to 100 keV and represents a radiation from an X-ray source, while the second power-law extends downwards from several eVs and illustrates a radiation from an accretion disk. When the ionized continuum is dominated by the soft component, the warm absorber is heated by free-free absorption, instead of Comptonization, and the transmitted spectra show different absorption line characteristics for different values of the hydrogen number density at the cloud illuminated surface. This fact results in the possibility of deriving the number density at the cloud illuminated side from observations and hence the distance to the warm absorber.
