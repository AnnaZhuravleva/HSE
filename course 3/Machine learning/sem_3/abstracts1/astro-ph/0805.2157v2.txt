In this paper a set of analytic formulae are presented with which the partial derivatives of the flux obscuration function can be evaluated -- for planetary transits and eclipsing binaries -- under the assumption of quadratic limb darkening. The knowledge of these partial derivatives is crucial for many of the data modeling algorithms and estimates of the light curve variations directly from the changes in the orbital elements. These derivatives can also be utilized to speed up some of the fitting methods. A gain of ~8 in computing time can be achieved in the implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, relative to using numerical derivatives.
