We study the X-ray morphology and dynamics of the galaxy cluster Abell 514. Also, the relation between the X-ray properties and Faraday Rotation measures of this cluster are investigated in order to study the connection of magnetic fields and the intra-cluster medium. We use two combined XMM - Newton pointings that are split into three distinct observations. The data allow us to evaluate the overall cluster properties like temperature and metallicity with high accuracy. Additionally, a temperature map and the metallicity distribution are computed, which are used to study the dynamical state of the cluster in detail. Abell 514 represents an interesting merger cluster with many substructures visible in the X-ray image and in the temperature and abundance distributions. The new XMM - Newton data of Abell 514 confirm the relation between the X-ray brightness and the sigma of the Rotation Measure (S_X - sigma_RM relation) proposed by Dolag et al. (2001).
