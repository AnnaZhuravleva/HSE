We present the results obtained from an objective search for stellar clusters, both in the currently active nuclear starburst region, and in the post-starburst disk of M82. Images obtained with the HST/ACS in F435W(B), F555W(V), and F814W(I) filters were used in the search for the clusters. We detected 653 clusters of which 393 are located outside the central 450 pc in the post-starburst disk of M82. The luminosity function of the detected clusters show an apparent turnover at B=22 mag (M_B=-5.8), which we interpret from Monte Carlo simulations as due to incompleteness in the detection of faint clusters, rather than an intrinsic log-normal distribution. We derived a photometric mass of every detected cluster from models of simple stellar populations assuming a mean age of either an 8 (nuclear clusters) or 100 (disk clusters) million years old. The mass functions of the disk (older) and the nuclear (younger) clusters follow power-laws, the former being marginally flatter (alpha=1.5+/-0.1) than the latter (alpha=1.8+/-0.1). The distribution of sizes (Full Width at Half Maximum) of clusters brighter than the apparent turn-over magnitude (mass>2E+4 Mo) can be described by a log-normal function. This function peaks at 10 pc for clusters more massive than 1E+5 Mo, whereas for lower masses, the peak is marginally shifted to larger values for the younger, and smaller values for the older clusters. The observed trend towards flattening of the mass function with age, together with an over-abundance of older compact clusters, imply that cluster disruption in M82 is both dependent on the mass and size of the clusters.
