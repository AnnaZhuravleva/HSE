We extend our published work on the neutral hydrogen content of early-type galaxies in the Virgo cluster using the catalogue of detected sources from the ALFALFA survey, by showing the 21cm spectra of all the detected galaxies and discussing a deeper analysis of the ALFALFA datacubes, searching for lower S/N sources. A view of the multiphase interstellar medium of M86 is also presented, by comparing images of the cold, warm and hot phases.
