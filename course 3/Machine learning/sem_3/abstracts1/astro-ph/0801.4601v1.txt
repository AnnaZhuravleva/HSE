We analyse the point-symmetric planetary nebula NGC 6309 in terms of its three-dimensional structure and of internal variations of the physical conditions to deduce the physical processes involved in its formation. We used VLA-D 3.6-cm continuum, ground-based, and HST-archive imaging as well as long slit high- and low-dispersion spectroscopy. The low-dispersion spectra indicate a high excitation nebula, with low to medium variations of its internal physical conditions. In the optical images, the point-symmetric knots show a lack of [NII] emission as compared with similar features previously known in other PNe. A rich internal structure of the central region is seen in the HST images, resembling a deformed torus. Long slit high-dispersion spectra reveal a complex kinematics in the central region. The spectral line profiles from the external regions of NGC 6309 indicate expanding lobes (~40 km/s) as those generally found in bipolar nebulae. Finally, we have found evidence for the presence of a faint halo, possibly related to the envelope of the AGB-star progenitor. Our data indicate that NGC 6309 is a quadrupolar nebula with two pairs of bipolar lobes whose axes are oriented PA=40 and PA=76. Equatorial and polar velocities for these two pairs of lobes are 29 and 86 km/s for the bipolar system at PA=40 and 25 and 75 km/s for the bipolar system at PA=76. There is also a central torus that is expanding at 25 km/s. Kinematical age for all these structures is around 3700 to 4000 yr. We conclude that NGC 6309 was formed by a set of well-collimated bipolar outflows (jets), which were ejected in the initial stages of its formation as a planetary nebula. These jets carved the bipolar lobes in the previous AGB wind and their remnants are now observed as the point-symmetric knots tracing the edges of the lobes.
