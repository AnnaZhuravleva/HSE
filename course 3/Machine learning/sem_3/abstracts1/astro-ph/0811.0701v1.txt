We report trigonometric parallaxes for G59.7+0.1 and W 51 IRS2, corresponding to distances of 2.16^{+0.10}_{-0.09} kpc and 5.1^{+2.9}_{-1.4} kpc, respectively. The distance to G59.7+0.1 is smaller than its near kinematic distance and places it between the Carina-Sagittarius and Perseus spiral arms, probably in the Local (Orion) spur. The distance to W 51 IRS2, while subject to significant uncertainty, is close to its kinematic distance and places it near the tangent point of the Carina-Sagittarius arm. It also agrees well with a recent estimate based on O-type star spectro/photometry. Combining the distances and proper motions with observed radial velocities gives the full space motions of the star forming regions. We find modest deviations of 5 to 10 km/s from circular Galactic orbits for these sources, both counter to Galactic rotation and toward the Galactic center.
