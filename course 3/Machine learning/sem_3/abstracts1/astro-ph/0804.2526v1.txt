We present a theoretical model that explains the high energy phenomenology of the neighborhood of SNR IC 443, as observed with the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope and the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET). We interpret MAGIC J0616+225 as delayed TeV emission of cosmic-rays diffusing from IC 443 and interacting with a known cloud located at a distance of about 20 pc in the foreground of the remnant. This scenario naturally explains the displacement between EGRET and MAGIC sources, their fluxes, and their spectra. We compare this model with others recently presented, and discuss how it can be tested with observations by the Gamma-ray Large Area Telescope (GLAST).
