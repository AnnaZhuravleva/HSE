We present the spectra of 36 Supernovae (SNe) of various types, obtained by the European Supernova Collaboration. Because of the spectral classification and the phase determination at their discovery the SNe did not warrant further study, and the spectra we present are the only available for the respective objects. In this paper we present and discuss this material using a new software for the automated classification of SNe spectra.   As a validation of the software, we verify the classification and phase estimate reported for these objects in their discovery / classification circulars. For the comparison, the software uses the library of template spectra of Padova-Asiago Supernova Archive (ASA).   For each spectrum of our sample we present a brief, individual discussion, highlighting the main characteristics and possible peculiarities. The comparison with ASA spectra confirms the previous classification of all objects and refines the age estimates. For our software we determine numerical limits of "safe" spectral classification and the uncertainties of the phase determination.
