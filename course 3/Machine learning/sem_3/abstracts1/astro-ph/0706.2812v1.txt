The highest energy cosmic rays could be produced by drifts in magnetized, cylindrically collimated, sheared jets of powerful active galaxies (i.e. FR II radiogalaxies; radio loud quasars and high power BL Lacs). We show that in such scenarios proton synchrotron radiation can give rise to detectable photon fluxes at energies ranging from hundreds of keV to tens of MeV.
