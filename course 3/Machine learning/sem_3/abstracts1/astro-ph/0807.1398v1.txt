We present a first entire-sky catalog of isolated galaxies obtained via systematic automated and visual inspections of extended sources from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Based on the Karachentseva's (1973) isolation criteria, we have extracted a sample of 2100 2MIG galaxies consisting a 4% fraction among galaxies brighter than K = 12m. Being the objects with probably no major perturbations in some last billion years, the 2MIG galaxies may be considered as a reference sample to study environment effects in galaxy structure and evolution. The 2MIG catalog may also be useful to explore the existence of dark galaxy population within a volume of z=0.02.
