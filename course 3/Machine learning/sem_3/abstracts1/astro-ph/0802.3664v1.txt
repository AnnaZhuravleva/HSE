GRAVITAS is a self-published DVD that presents a visual and musical celebration of the beauty in a dynamic universe driven by gravity. Animations from supercomputer simulations of forming galaxies, star clusters, galaxy clusters, and galaxy interactions are presented as moving portraits of cosmic evolution. Billions of years of complex gravitational choreography are presented in 9 animations - each one interpreted with an original musical composition inspired by the exquisite movements of gravity. The result is an emotive and spiritually uplifting synthesis of science and art. The GRAVITAS DVD has been out for two years now but I am now making the DVD disk image freely available for personal and educational use through a bittorrent download. Download and burn at your leisure. The animations are also downloadable in various video formats.
