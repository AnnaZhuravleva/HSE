We report imaging observations of the symbotic long-period Mira variable R Aquarii (R Aqr) at near-infrared and radio wavelengths. The near-infrared observations were made with the IOTA imaging interferometer in three narrow-band filters centered at 1.51, 1.64, and 1.78 $\mu$m, which sample mainly water, continuum, and water features, respectively. Our near-infrared fringe visibility and closure phase data are analyzed using three models. (a) A uniform disk model with wavelength-dependent sizes fails to fit the visibility data, and is inconsistent with the closure phase data. (b) A three- component model, comprising a Mira star, water shell, and an off-axis point source, provide a good fit to all data. (c) A model generated by a constrained image reconstruction analysis provides more insight, suggesting that the water shell is highly non-uniform, i.e., clumpy. The VLBA observations of SiO masers in the outer molecular envelope show evidence of turbulence, with jet-like features containing velocity gradients.
