In this work we investigate the stellar population, metallicity distribution and ionized gas in the elliptical galaxy NGC 5044, using long-slit spectroscopy and a stellar population synthesis method. We found differences in the slope of metal-line profiles along the galaxy which suggests an enhancement of alpha elements, particularly towards the central region. The presence of a non-thermal ionization source, such as a low-luminosity AGN and/or shock ionization, is implied by the large values of the ratio (N II])Ha observed in all sampled regions. However, the emission lines observed in the external regions indicate the presence of an additional ionization source, probably hot, post-AGB stars.
