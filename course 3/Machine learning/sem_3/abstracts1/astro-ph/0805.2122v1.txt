This paper provides an evaluation of SGI RASCTM RC100 technology from a computational science software developer's perspective. A brute force implementation of a two-point angular correlation function is used as a test case application. The computational kernel of this test case algorithm is ported to the Mitrion-C programming language and compiled, targeting the RC100 hardware. We explore several code optimization techniques and report performance results for different designs. We conclude the paper with an analysis of this system based on our observations while implementing the test case. Overall, the hardware platform and software development tools were found to be satisfactory for accelerating computationally intensive applications, however, several system improvements are desirable.
