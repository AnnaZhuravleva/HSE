We present the complete on-line catalogue of gamma-ray bursts observed by the two Wide Field Cameras on board \sax in the period 1996-2002. Our aim is to provide the community with the largest published data set of GRB's prompt emission X-ray light curves and other useful data. This catalogue (BS-GRBWFCcat) contains data on 77 bursts and a collection of the X-ray light curves of 56 GRB discovered or noticed shortly after the event and of other additional bursts detected in subsequent searches. Light curves are given in the three X-ray energy bands (2-5, 5-10, 10-26 keV). The catalogue can be accessed from the home web page of the ASI Science Data Center-ASDC (http://www.asdc.asi.it)
