We present the clustering properties of 151 Lyman alpha emitting galaxies at z ~ 4.5 selected from the Large Area Lyman Alpha (LALA) survey. Our catalog covers an area of 36' x 36' observed with five narrowband filters. We assume that the angular correlation function w(theta) is well represented by a power law A_w = Theta^(-beta) with slope beta = 0.8, and we find A_w = 6.73 +/- 1.80. We then calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-point correlation function xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-1.8) from A_w through the Limber transformation, assuming a flat, Lambda-dominated universe. Neglecting contamination, we find r_0 = 3.20 +/- 0.42 Mpc/h. Taking into account a possible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61 +/- 0.6 Mpc/h. We compare these results with the expectations for the clustering of dark matter halos at this redshift in a Cold Dark Matter model, and find that the measured clustering strength can be reproduced if these objects reside in halos with a minimum mass of 1-2 times 10^11 Solar masses/h. Our estimated correlation length implies a bias of b ~ 3.7, similar to that of Lyman-break galaxies (LBG) at z ~ 3.8-4.9. However, Lyman alpha emitters are a factor of ~ 2-16 rarer than LBGs with a similar bias value and implied host halo mass. Therefore, one plausible scenario seems to be that Lyman alpha emitters occupy host halos of roughly the same mass as LBGs, but shine with a relatively low duty cycle of 6-50%.
