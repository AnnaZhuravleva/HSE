Oscillations occur in stars of most masses and essentially all stages of evolution. Asteroseismology is the study of the frequencies and other properties of stellar oscillations, from which we can extract fundamental parameters such as density, mass, radius, age and rotation period. We present an overview of asteroseismic analysis methods, focusing on how this technique may be used as a tool to measure stellar properties relevant to planet transit studies. We also discuss details of the Kepler Asteroseismic Investigation -- the use of asteroseismology on the Kepler mission in order to measure basic stellar parameters. We estimate that applying asteroseismology to stars observed by Kepler will allow the determination of stellar mean densities to an accuracy of 1%, radii to 2-3%, masses to 5%, and ages to 5-10% of the main-sequence lifetime. For rotating stars, the angle of inclination can also be determined.
