A paradox associated with the astrophysical Poynting-Robertson effect is presented. The paradox arises when relativity theory and Mie's solution of Maxwell's equations are confronted with the statements on the Poynting-Robertson effect. Although the relevant physics has been known already for a century (Poynting 1903, Einstein 1905, Mie 1908), nobody has been aware of the inconsistency between the theories.
