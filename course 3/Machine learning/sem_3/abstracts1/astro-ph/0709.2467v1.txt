The amplification of disk oscillations resulting from nonlinear resonant couplings between the oscillations and a disk deformation is examined. The disk is geometrically thin and general relativistic with a non-rotating central source. A Lagrangian formulation is adopted. The author examined the same problem a few years ago, but here we derive a general stability criterion in a more perspective way. Another distinct point from the previous work is that in addition to the case where the deformation is a warp, the case where the deformation is a one-armed pattern symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane is considered. The results obtained show that in addition to the previous results that the inertial-acoustic mode and g-mode oscillations are amplified by horizontal resonance in warped disks, they also amplified by horizontal resonance in disks deformed by one-armed pattern symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. If we consider local oscillations that are localized around boundaries of their propagation region, the resonance occurs at $4r_{\rm g}$, where $r_{\rm g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. If nonlocal oscillations are considered, frequency ranges of oscillations where oscillations are resonantly amplified are specified.
