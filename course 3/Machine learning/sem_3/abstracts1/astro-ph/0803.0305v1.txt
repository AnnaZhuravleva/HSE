Using high signal-to-noise ratio VLT/FORS2 long-slit spectroscopy, we have studied the properties of the central stellar populations and dynamics of a sample of S0 galaxies in the Fornax Cluster. The central absorption-line indices in these galaxies correlate well with the central velocity dispersions (Sigma0) in accordance with what previous studies found for elliptical galaxies. However, contrary to what it is usually assumed for cluster ellipticals, the observed correlations seem to be driven by systematic age and alpha-element abundance variations, and not changes in overall metallicity. We also found that the observed scatter in the Index-Sigma0 relations can be partially explained by the rotationally-supported nature of these systems. Indeed, even tighter correlations exist between the line indices and the maximum circular velocity of the galaxies. This study suggests that the dynamical mass is the physical property driving these correlations, and for S0 galaxies such masses have to be estimated assuming a large degree of rotational support. The observed trends imply that the most massive S0s have the shortest star-formation timescales and the oldest stellar populations.
