The properties of the relativistically broadened Fe K alpha line emitted in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are still debated among the AGN community. Recent works seem to exclude that the broad Fe line is a common feature of AGN. The analysis of a large sample composed by 157 XMM-Newton archival observations of radio quiet AGN is presented here. This ongoing project is a development of the work reported in Guainazzi et al. 2006.
