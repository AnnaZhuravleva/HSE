It has long been known how to analytically relate the clustering properties of the collapsed structures (halos) to those of the underlying dark matter distribution for Gaussian initial conditions. Here we apply the same approach to physically motivated non-Gaussian models. The techniques we use were developed in the 1980s to deal with the clustering of peaks of non-Gaussian density fields. The description of the clustering of halos for non-Gaussian initial conditions has recently received renewed interest, motivated by the forthcoming large galaxy and cluster surveys. For inflationary-motivated non-Gaussianites, we find an analytic expression for the halo bias as a function of scale, mass and redshift, employing only the approximations of high-peaks and large separations.
