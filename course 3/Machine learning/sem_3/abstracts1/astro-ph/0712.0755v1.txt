We present color-magnitude diagrams of the open cluster NGC 2420, obtained from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) ultraviolet images in FUV and NUV bands and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) u,g,r,i,z photometry. Our goal is to search for and characterize hot evolved stars and peculiar objects in this open cluster, as part of a larger project aimed to study a number of open clusters in the Milky Way with GALEX and ground-based data.
