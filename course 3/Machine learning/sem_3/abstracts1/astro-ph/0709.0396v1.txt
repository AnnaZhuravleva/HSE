Observations of transition region emission in solar active regions represent a powerful tool for determining the properties of hot coronal loops. In this Letter we present the analysis of new observations of active region moss taken with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on the \textit{Hinode} mission. We find that the intensities predicted by steady, uniformly heated loop models are too intense relative to the observations, consistent with previous work. To bring the model into agreement with the observations a filling factor of about 16% is required. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the filling factor in the moss is nonuniform and varies inversely with the loop pressure.
