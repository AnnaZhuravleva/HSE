Solar wind fluctuations, such as magnetic field or velocity, show power law power spectra suggestive both of an inertial range of intermittent turbulence (with $\sim -5/3$ exponent) and at lower frequencies, of fluctuations of coronal origin (with $\sim -1$ exponent). The ULYSSES spacecraft spent many months in the quiet fast solar wind above the Sun's polar coronal holes in a highly ordered magnetic field. We use statistical analysis methods such as the generalized structure function (GSF) and extended self-similarity (ESS) to quantify the scaling of the moments of the probability density function of fluctuations in the magnetic field. The GSFs give power law scaling in the ``$f^{-1}$'' range of the form $<| y(t+\tau)-y(t)|^{m}>\sim\tau^{\zeta(m)}$, but ESS is required to reveal scaling in the inertial range, which is of the form $<| y(t+\tau)-y(t)|^{m}>\sim [g(\tau)]^{\zeta(m)}$. We find that $g(\tau)$ is independent of spacecraft position and $g(\tau)\sim\tau^{-log_{10}(\tilde{\lambda}\tau)}$. The ``$f^{-1}$'' scaling fluctuates with radial spacecraft position. This confirms that, whereas the ``$f^{-1}$'' fluctuations are directly influenced by the corona, the inertial range fluctuations are consistent with locally evolving turbulence, but with an ``envelope'' $g(\tau)$, which captures the formation of the quiet fast solar wind.
