In the standard model of cosmology, dark matter and dark energy are presently the two main contributors to the total energy in the Universe. However, these two dark components are still of unknown nature, and many alternative explanations are possible. We consider here the so-called unifying dark fluid models, which replace dark energy and dark matter by a unique dark fluid with specific properties. We will analyze in this context recent observational data from supernovae of type Ia, large scale structures and cosmic microwave background, as well as theoretical results of big-bang nucleosynthesis, in order to derive constraints on the dark fluid parameters. We will also consider constraints from local scales, and conclude with a brief study of a scalar field dark fluid model.
