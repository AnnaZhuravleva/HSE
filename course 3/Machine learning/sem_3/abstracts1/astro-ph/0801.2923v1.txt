The sources of nuclear uncertainties in nova nucleosynthesis have been identified using hydrodynamical nova models. Experimental efforts have followed and significantly reduced those uncertainties. This is important for the evaluation of nova contribution to galactic chemical evolution, gamma--ray astronomy and possibly presolar grain studies. In particular, estimations of expected gamma-ray fluxes are essential for the planning of observations with existing or future satellites.
