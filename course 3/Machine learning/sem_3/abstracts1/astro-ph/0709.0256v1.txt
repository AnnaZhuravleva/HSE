We present the largest sample of high-mass star-forming regions observed using submillimetre imaging polarimetry. The data were taken using SCUBA in conjunction with the polarimeter on the JCMT in Hawaii. In total, 16 star forming regions were observed, although some of these contain multiple cores. The polarimetry implies a variety of magnetic field morphologies, with some very ordered fields. We see a decrease in polarisation percentage for 7 of the cores. The magnetic field strengths estimated for 14 of the cores, using the corrected CF method, range from <0.1 mG to almost 6 mG. These magnetic fields are weaker on these large scales when compared to previous Zeeman measurements from maser emission, implying the role of the magnetic field in star formation increases in importance on smaller scales. Analysis of the alignment of the mean field direction and the outflow directions reveal no relation for the whole sample, although direct comparison of the polarimetry maps suggests good alignment (to at least one outflow direction per source) in 7 out of the 15 sources with outflows.
