We analyse Keck spectra of 24 candidate globular clusters (GCs) associated with the spiral galaxy NGC 2683. We identify 19 bona fide GCs based on their recession velocities, of which 15 were suitable for stellar population analysis. Age and metallicity determinations reveal old ages in 14 out of 15 GCs. These old GCs exhibit age and metallicity distributions similar to that of the Milky Way GC system. One GC in NGC 2683 was found to exhibit an age of ~3 Gyr. The age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance of this centrally located GC are remarkably similar to the values found for the galactic centre itself, providing further evidence for a recent star formation event in NGC 2683.
