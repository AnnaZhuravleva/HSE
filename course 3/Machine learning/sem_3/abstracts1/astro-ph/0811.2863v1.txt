We investigate the three-dimensional structure of the pulsar magnetosphere through time-dependent numerical simulations of a magnetic dipole that is set in rotation. We developed our own Eulerian finite difference time domain numerical solver of force-free electrodynamics and implemented the technique of non-reflecting and absorbing outer boundaries. This allows us to run our simulations for many stellar rotations, and thus claim with confidence that we have reached a steady state. A quasi-stationary corotating pattern is established, in agreement with previous numerical solutions. We discuss the prospects of our code for future high-resolution investigations of dissipation, particle acceleration, and temporal variability.
