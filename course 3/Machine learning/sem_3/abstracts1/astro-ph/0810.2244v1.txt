We describe two new OGLE-III real time data analysis systems: XROM and RCOM. The XROM system has been designed to provide continuous real time photometric monitoring of the optical counterparts of X-ray sources while RCOM system provides real time photometry of R Coronae Borealis variable stars located in the OGLE-III fields. Both systems can be used for triggering follow-up observations in crucial phases of variability episodes of monitored objects.
