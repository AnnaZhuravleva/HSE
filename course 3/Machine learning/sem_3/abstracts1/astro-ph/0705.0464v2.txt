We review recent results from the X-ray timing of accreting millisecond pulsars in Low Mass X-ray Binaries. This is the first time a timing analysis is performed on accreting millisecond pulsars, and for the first time we can obtain information on the behavior of a very fast pulsar subject to accretion torques. We find both spin-up and spin-down behaviors, from which, using available models for the accretion torques, we derive information on the mass accretion rate and magnetic field of the neutron star in these systems. We also find that the phase delays behavior as a function of time in these sources is sometimes quite complex and difficult to interpret, since phase shifts, most probably driven by variations of the X-ray flux, are sometimes present.
