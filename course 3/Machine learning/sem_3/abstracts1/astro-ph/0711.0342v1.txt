We use PostgreSQL DBMS for storing XML metadata, described by the IVOA Characterisation Data Model. Initial XML type support in the PostgreSQL has recently been implemented. We make heavy use of this feature in order to provide comprehensive search over Characterisation metadata tree. We built a prototype of the Characterisation metadata query service, implementing two access methods: (1) HTTP-GET/POST based interface implements almost direct translation of the query parameter name into XPath of the data model element in the XML serialisation; (2) Web-Service based interface to receive XQuery which is also directly translated into XPath. This service will be used in the ASPID-SR archive, containing science-ready data obtained with the Russian 6-m telescope.
