The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will consist of up to 64 state-of-the-art sub-mm telescopes, subject to stringent performance specifications which will push the boundaries of the technology, and makes testing of antenna performance a likewise challenging task. Two antenna prototypes were evaluated at the ALMA Test Facility at the Very Large Array site in New Mexico, USA. The dynamic behaviour of the antennas under operational conditions was investigated with the help of an accelerometer system capable of measuring rigid body motion of the elevation structure of the antenna, as well as a few low-order deformation modes, resulting in dynamic performance numbers for pointing stability, reflector surface stability, path length stability, and structure flexure. Special emphasis was given to wind effects, one of the major factors affecting performance on timescales of seconds to tens of minutes. This paper describes the accelerometer system, its capabilities and limitations, and presents the dynamic performance results of the two prototype antennas investigated.
