We investigate the infrared / radio correlation using the technique of source stacking, in order to probe the average properties of radio sources that are too faint to be detected individually. We compare the two methods used in the literature to stack sources, and demonstrate that the creation of stacked images leads to a loss of information. We stack infrared sources in the Spitzer extragalactic First Look Survey (xFLS) field, and the three northern Spitzer Wide-area Infrared Extragalactic survey (SWIRE) fields, using radio surveys created at 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz, and find a variation in the absolute strength of the correlation between the xFLS and SWIRE regions, but no evidence for significant evolution in the correlation over the 24-um flux density range 150 uJy - 2 mJy. We carry out the first radio source stacking experiment using 70-um-selected galaxies, and find no evidence for significant evolution over the 70-um flux density range 10 mJy - 100 mJy.
