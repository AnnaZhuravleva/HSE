Using infrared photometric data extracted from the 2MASS, IRAS and MSX databases, 142 suspected young stellar objects (YSOs) are selected from about 2 million stars in the Camelopardalis segment of the Milky Way limited by Galactic longitude 132-158 deg, latitude pm 12 deg. According to radial velocities of the associated CO clouds, the objects are attributed to three molecular and dust cloud layers at 150--300 pc, 900 pc and 2.2 kpc distances from the Sun. These objects concentrate into dust and molecular clouds and exhibit extremely large reddenings (A_V up to 25 mag) which can be caused by the dust in foreground clouds and circumstellar envelopes or disks. In the J-H vs. H-K diagram these objects lie above the intrinsic line of T Tauri variables, roughly along the black-body line. Among the identified objects, some already known YSOs are present, including the well investigated massive object GL 490. The spectral energy distributions between 700 nm and 100 mum suggest that the objects may be YSOs of classes I, II and III. However, we do not exclude the possibility that a small fraction of the objects, especially those without IRAS and MSX photometry, may be unrecognized heavily reddened OB-stars, late-type AGB stars or even galaxies.
