Spectral energy distributions for models of arbitrarily rotating stars are computed using two dimensional rotating stellar models, NLTE plane parallel model atmospheres, and a code to integrate the appropriately weighted intensities over the visible surface of the stellar disk. The spectral energy distributions depend on the inclination angle between the observer and the rotation axis of the model. We use these curves to deduce what one would infer the model's luminosity and effective temperature to be assuming the object was nonrotating.
