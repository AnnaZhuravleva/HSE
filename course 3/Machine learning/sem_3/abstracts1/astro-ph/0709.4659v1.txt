We investigate the star formation history of the central regions of four Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs). LCBGs are blue (B-V<0.6), compact (MU_B<21.5 mag arcsec^-2) galaxies with absolute magnitudes M_B brighter than -17.5. The LCBGs analyzed here are located at 0.436<z<0.525. They are among the most luminous (M_B < -20.5), blue (B-V < 0.4) and high surface brightness (MU_B < 19.0 mag arcsec^-2) of this population. The observational data used were obtained with the HST/STIS spectrograph, the HST/WF/PC-2 camera and the HST/NICMOS first camera. We find evidence for multiple stellar populations. One of them is identified as the ionizing population, and the other one corresponds to the underlying stellar generation.   The estimated masses of the inferred populations are compatible with the dynamical masses, which are typically 2--10x 10^9 M_sun. Our models also indicate that the first episodes of star formation the presented LCBGs underwent happened between 5 and 7 Gyr ago.   We compare the stellar populations found in LCBGs with the stellar populations present in bright, local HII galaxies, nearby spheroidal systems and Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxies. It turns out that the underlying stellar populations of LCBGs are similar yet bluer to those of local HII galaxies. It is also the case that the passive color evolution of the LCBGs could convert them into local Spheroidal galaxies if no further episode of star formation takes place. Our results help to impose constraints on evolutionary scenarios for the population of LCBGs found commonly at intermediate redshifts.
