The deeper and more extended survey of the central parts of the Galactic Plane by H.E.S.S. during 2005-2007 has revealed a number of new point-like, as well as, extended sources. Two point-like sources can be associated to two remarkable objects around "Crab-like" young and energetic pulsars in our Galaxy: G21.5-0.9 and Kes 75. The characteristics of each of the sources are presented and possible interpretations are briefly discussed.
