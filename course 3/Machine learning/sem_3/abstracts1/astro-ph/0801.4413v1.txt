We investigate the tidal interaction between a low-mass planet and a self-gravitating protoplanetary disk, by means of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We first show that considering a planet freely migrating in a disk without self-gravity leads to a significant overestimate of the migration rate. The overestimate can reach a factor of two for a disk having three times the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula. Unbiased drift rates may be obtained only by considering a planet and a disk orbiting within the same gravitational potential. In a second part, the disk self-gravity is taken into account. We confirm that the disk gravity enhances the differential Lindblad torque with respect to the situation where neither the planet nor the disk feels the disk gravity. This enhancement only depends on the Toomre parameter at the planet location. It is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the spurious one induced by assuming a planet migrating in a disk without self-gravity. We confirm that the torque enhancement due to the disk gravity can be entirely accounted for by a shift of Lindblad resonances, and can be reproduced by the use of an anisotropic pressure tensor. We do not find any significant impact of the disk gravity on the corotation torque.
