We study the gravitationally confined detonation (GCD) model of Type Ia supernovae through the detonation phase and into homologous expansion. In the GCD model, a detonation is triggered by the surface flow due to single point, off-center flame ignition in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The simulations are unique in terms of the degree to which non-idealized physics is used to treat the reactive flow, including weak reaction rates and a time dependent treatment of material in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). Careful attention is paid to accurately calculating the final composition of material which is burned to NSE and frozen out in the rapid expansion following the passage of a detonation wave over the high density core of the white dwarf; and an efficient method for nucleosynthesis post-processing is developed which obviates the need for costly network calculations along tracer particle thermodynamic trajectories. Observational diagnostics are presented for the explosion models, including abundance stratifications and integrated yields. We find that for all of the ignition conditions studied here, a self regulating process comprised of neutronization and stellar expansion results in final \iso{Ni}{56} masses of $\sim$1.1\msun. But, more energetic models result in larger total NSE and stable Fe peak yields. The total yield of intermediate mass elements is $\sim0.1$\msun and the explosion energies are all around 1.5$\times10^{51}$ ergs. The explosion models are briefly compared to the inferred properties of recent Type Ia supernova observations. The potential for surface detonation models to produce lower luminosity (lower \iso{Ni}{56} mass) supernovae is discussed.
