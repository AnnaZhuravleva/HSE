High resolution spectra of Comet 8P/Tuttle were obtained in the frequency range 3440.6-3462.6 cm-1 on 3 January 2008 UT using CGS4 with echelle grating on UKIRT. In addition to recording strong solar pumped fluorescent (SPF) lines of H2O, the long integration time (152 miutes on target) enabled eight weaker H2O features to be assigned, most of which had not previously been identified in cometary spectra. These transitions, which are from higher energy upper states, are similar in character to the so-called 'SH' lines recorded in the post Deep Impact spectrum of comet Tempel 1 (Barber et al., 2007). We have identified certain characteristics that these lines have in common, and which in addition to helping to define this new class of cometary line, give some clues to the physical processes involved in their production. Finally, we derive an H2O rotational temperature of 62+/- K and a water production rate of (1.4+/-0.3)E28 molecules/s.
