The low-mass end of the supermassive black hole mass function is unknown and difficult to determine. Here we discuss our successful program to find active nuclei of late type "normal" galaxies using X-ray detections and multiwavelength identifications. We conclude that most of the Chandra detected nuclear X-ray sources are AGNs. We then outline methods of black hole mass determination when broad emission lines are unobservable.
