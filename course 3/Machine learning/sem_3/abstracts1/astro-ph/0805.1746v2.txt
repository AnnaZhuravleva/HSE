We examine the anisotropy of the arrival directions of twenty seven ultra high energy cosmic rays detected by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. We confirm the anisotropy of the arrival directions of these events and find a significant correlation with the updated definition of the supergalactic plane at distances up to 70 Mpc, A Monte Carlo calculation of isotropic source distribution suggests a chance probability for isotropic event arrival direction distribution of 2-6$\times10^{-4}$.
