When two stars collide and merge they form a new star that can stand out against the background population in a starcluster as a blue straggler. In so called collision runaways many stars can merge and may form a very massive star that eventually forms an intermediate mass blackhole. We have performed detailed evolution calculations of merger remnants from collisions between main sequence stars, both for lower mass stars and higher mass stars. These stars can be significantly brighter than ordinary stars of the same mass due to their increased helium abundance. Simplified treatments ignoring this effect give incorrect predictions for the collision product lifetime and evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
