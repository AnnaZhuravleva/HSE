After presenting three ways of defining a bulge component in disc galaxies, we introduce the various types of bulges, namely the classical bulges, the boxy/peanut bulges and the disc-like bulges. We then discuss three specific topics linked to bulge formation and evolution, namely the coupled time evolution of the bar, buckling and peanut strengths; the effect of velocity anisotropy on peanut formation; and bulge formation via bar destruction.
