The Spitzer Space Telescope, NASA's Great Observatory for infrared astronomy, has made available new tools for the investigation of the infrared properties of planetary nebulae. The three instruments onboard, including the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), and the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), provide imaging capability from 3.6 to 160 microns, and low and moderate resolution spectroscopy from 5.2 to 38 microns. In this paper I review recent Spitzer results concerning planetary nebulae and their asymmetrical structures.
