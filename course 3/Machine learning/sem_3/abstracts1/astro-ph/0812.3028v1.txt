Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses of hundreds to thousands of solar masses, will be unique sources of gravitational waves for LISA. Here we discuss their context as well as specific characteristics of IMBH-IMBH and IMBH-supermassive black hole mergers and how these would allow sensitive tests of the predictions of general relativity in strong gravity.
