We describe a Windows compatible version of the evolutionary synthesis code Starburst99. Starburst99 for Windows was developed from the public UNIX based version at STScI. We converted the original Fortran77 source code into a version for a Win32 environment with an Absoft Fortran Pro x86 compiler. Extensive testing showed no significant numerical differences in comparison with the previous UNIX version. The software application consists of the source code, executable, and a number of auxiliary files. The package installs on any PC running Windows 2000, XP, or Vista and can be obtained as freeware at http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst/PCStarburst99.html. We give an overview of the different running modes and provide instructions for getting started with the initial set-up.
