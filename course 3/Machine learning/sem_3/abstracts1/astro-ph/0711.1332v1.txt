We propose a new concept of pupil motion sensor for astronomical adaptive optics systems and present experimental results obtained during the first laboratory validation of this concept. Pupil motion is an important issue in the case of extreme adaptive optics, high contrast systems, such as the proposed Planet Finder instruments for the ESO and Gemini 8-meter telescopes. Such high contrast imaging instruments will definitively require pupil stabilization to minimize the effect of quasi-static aberrations. The concept for pupil stabilization we propose uses the flux information from the AO system wave-front sensor to drive in closed loop a pupil tip-tilt mirror located in a focal plane. A laboratory experiment validates this concept and demonstrates its interest for high contrast imaging instrument.
