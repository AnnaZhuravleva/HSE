A new time-dependent, scale-independent parameter, \varpi, is employed in a phenomenological model of the deviation from General Relativity in which the Newtonian and longitudinal gravitational potentials slip apart on cosmological scales as dark energy, assumed to be arising from a new theory of gravitation, appears to dominate the universe. A comparison is presented between \varpi and other parameterized post-Friedmannian models in the literature. The effect of \varpi on the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum, the growth of large scale structure, the galaxy weak-lensing correlation function, and cross-correlations of cosmic microwave background anisotropy with galaxy clustering are illustrated. Cosmological models with conventional maximum likelihood parameters are shown to find agreement with a narrow range of gravitational slip.
