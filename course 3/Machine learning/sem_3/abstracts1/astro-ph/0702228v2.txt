We analyze the gravitational wave (GW) emission from our recently published set of relativistic neutron star (NS) merger simulations and determine characteristic signal features that allow one to link GW measurements to the properties of the merging binary stars. We find that the distinct peak in the GW energy spectrum that is associated with the formation of a hypermassive merger remnant has a frequency that depends strongly on the properties of the nuclear equation of state (EoS) and on the total mass of the binary system, whereas the mass ratio and the NS spins have a weak influence. If the total mass can be determined from the inspiral chirp signal, the peak frequency of the postmerger signal is a sensitive indicator of the EoS.
