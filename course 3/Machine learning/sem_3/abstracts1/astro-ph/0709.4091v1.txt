We show observations obtained with the integral field spectrometer OASIS for the central regions of a sample of barred galaxies. The high spatial resolution of the instrument allows to distinguish various structures within these regions as defined by stellar populations of different ages and metallicities. From these data we obtain important clues about the star formation history. But we advise that, in order to obtain adequately the evolutionary sequence, a combination of chemical and synthesis models may be necessary.
