The gamma-rays from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be produced by internal shocks driven by small timescale, ~1 ms, variation in the GRB outflows, and a pair-production spectral cutoff is generally expected around the GeV range. However, the observed optical flashes accompanying GRBs suggest that the delayed residual collisions due to large timescale variation continue to accelerate electrons. We show here that the inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of the prompt gamma-rays by these residual internal shock electrons leads to a high energy emission beyond the previously thought spectral cutoff, in agreement with the previous detections of GeV photons by EGRET in several GRBs in conjunction with MeV emission. We expect a spectral break due to the transition from the primary to residual internal shock emission at the previously thought spectral cutoff, and expect systematic time delays of high energy photons relative to MeV emission, the discovery of which would provide stringent constraint on the outflow properties, but requires large enough collection of high energy photons by, e.g., Fermi and AGILE satellites.   The recent Fermi-detected bright GRB 080916c unambiguously shows the shifting of the prompt emission toward later times as the photon energy increases, as predicted in the residual collision model. The detected prompt, highest energy photon (about 70 GeV in the rest frame of the GRB) may not be produced by primary internal shocks but by IC emission in residual collisions. With the method involving time delays of high energy emission, the bulk Lorentz factor of GRB 080916c is determined to be \Gamma ~ 300.
