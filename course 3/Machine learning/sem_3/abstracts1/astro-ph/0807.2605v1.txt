The mass reinserted by young stars of an emerging massive compact cluster shows a bimodal hydrodynamic behaviour. In the inner part of the cluster, it is thermally unstable, while in its outer parts it forms an out-blowing wind. The chemical homogeneity/inhomogeneity of low/high mass clusters demonstrates the relevance of this solution to the presence of single/multiple stellar populations. We show the consequences that the thermal instability of the reinserted mass has to the galactic super-winds.
