Modified $f(R)$ gravity in the Palatini approach has been presently applied to Cosmology as a realistic alternative to dark energy. In this concern, a number of authors have searched for observational constraints on several $f(R)$ gravity functional forms using mainly data of type Ia supenovae (SNe Ia), Cosmic Microwave Background ({\rm CMB}) radiation and Large Scale Structure ({\rm LSS}). In this paper, by considering a homogeneous and isotropic flat universe, we use determinations of the Hubble function $H(z)$, which are based on differential age method, to place bounds on the free parameters of the $f(R) = R - \beta/R^{n}$ functional form. We also combine the $H(z)$ data with constraints from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations ({\rm BAO}) and {\rm CMB} measurements, obtaining ranges of values for $n$ and $\beta$ in agreement with other independent analyses. We find that, for some intervals of $n$ and $\beta$, models based on $f(R) = R - \beta/R^{n}$ gravity in the Palatini approach, unlike the metric formalism, can produce the sequence of radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and accelerating periods without need of dark energy.
