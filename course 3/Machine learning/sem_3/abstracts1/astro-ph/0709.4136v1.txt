In the era of Chandra and XMM-Newton, the detection (or nondetection) of diffuse and/or point-like X-ray sources within planetary nebulae (PNe) yields important, unique insight into PN shaping processes. Diffuse X-ray sources, whether due to ``hot bubbles'' or to collimated outflows or jets, allow us to probe the energetic shocks within PN wind interaction regions. Meanwhile, X-ray point sources provide potential diagnostics of magnetic fields, accretion disks, and/or binary companions at PN cores. Here, I highlight recent X-ray observational results and trends that have the potential to shed new light on the origin and evolution of the structure of PNe.
