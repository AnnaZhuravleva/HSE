We investigate the connection between dark energy and fourth order gravity by analyzing the behavior of scalar perturbations around a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. The evolution equations for scalar perturbation are derived using the covariant and gauge invariant approach and applied to two widely studied $f(R)$ gravity models. The structure of the general fourth order perturbation equations and the analysis of scalar perturbations lead to the discovery of a characteristic signature of fourth order gravity in the matter power spectrum, the details of which have not seen before in other works in this area. This could provide a crucial test for fourth order gravity on cosmological scales.
