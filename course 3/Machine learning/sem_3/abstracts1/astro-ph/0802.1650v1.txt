Gamma Ray Bursts are being searched in many ground based experiments detecting the high energy component (GeV $\div$ TeV energy range) of the photon bursts. In this paper, Fluorescence Detectors are considered as possible candidate devices for these searches. It is shown that the GRB photons induce fluorescence emission of UV photons on a wide range of their spectrum. The induced fluorescence flux is dominated by GRB photons from 0.1 to about 100 MeV and, once the extinction through the atmosphere is taken into account, it is distributed over a wide angular region. This flux can be detected through a monitor of the diffuse photon flux, provided that its maximum value exceeds a threshold value, that is primarily determined by the sky brightness above the detector. The feasibility of this search and the expected rates are discussed on the basis of the current GRB observations and the existing fluorescence detectors.
