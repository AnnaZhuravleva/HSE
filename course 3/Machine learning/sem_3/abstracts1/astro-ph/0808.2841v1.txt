Data obtained in the very high energy gamma-ray band with the new generation of imaging telescopes, in particular through the galactic plane survey undertaken by H.E.S.S., low threshold observations with MAGIC and more recently by operation of VERITAS, have revealed dozens of galactic and extragalactic sources, providing a wealth of information on a variety of high energy acceleration sites in our universe. Also, the water Cherenkov instrument Milagro has provided several extended sources after seven years of data integration. An overview of these results with focus on some of the most recent highlights is given.
