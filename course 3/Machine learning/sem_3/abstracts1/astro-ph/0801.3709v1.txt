We outline the steps needed in order to incorporate the evolution of single and binary stars into a particular Monte Carlo code for the dynamical evolution of a star cluster. We calibrate the results against N-body simulations, and present models for the evolution of the old open cluster M67 (which has been studied thoroughly in the literature with N-body techniques). The calibration is done by choosing appropriate free code parameters. We describe in particular the evolution of the binary, white dwarf and blue straggler populations, though not all channels for blue straggler formation are represented yet in our simulations. Calibrated Monte Carlo runs show good agreement with results of N-body simulations not only for global cluster parameters, but also for e.g. binary fraction, luminosity function and surface brightness. Comparison of Monte Carlo simulations with observational data for M67 shows that is possible to get reasonably good agreement between them. Unfortunately, because of the large statistical fluctuations of the numerical data and uncertainties in the observational data the inferred conclusions about the cluster initial conditions are not firm.
