Using results from structural analysis of a sample of nearly 1000 local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we estimate how the mass in central black holes is distributed amongst elliptical galaxies, classical bulges and pseudo-bulges, and investigate the relation between their stellar masses and central stellar velocity dispersion sigma. Assuming a single relation between elliptical galaxy/bulge mass, M_Bulge, and central black hole mass, M_BH, we find that 55^{+8}_{-4} per cent of the mass in black holes in the local universe is in the centres of elliptical galaxies, 41^{+4}_{-2} per cent in classical bulges and 4^{+0.9}_{-0.4} per cent in pseudo-bulges. We find that ellipticals, classical bulges and pseudo-bulges follow different relations between their stellar masses and sigma, and the most significant offset occurs for pseudo-bulges in barred galaxies. This structural dissimilarity leads to discrepant black hole masses if single M_BH-M_Bulge and M_BH-sigma relations are used. Adopting relations from the literature, we find that the M_BH-sigma relation yields an estimate of the total mass density in black holes that is roughly 55 per cent larger than if the M_BH-M_Bulge relation is used.
