We presented here the orbital parameters for five visual binary stars calculated by using the new method which we named Sector Grid Search. Orbital parameters were obtained for the following stars: WDS 00152+2722 = ADS 195, WDS 02202+2949 = ADS 1780, WDS 11550$-$5606 = HIP 58106, WDS 16256$-$2327 = ADS 10049 and WDS 16256$-$2327 = ADS 10045. In addition, their masses, dynamical parallaxes and ephemerides were calculated as well.
