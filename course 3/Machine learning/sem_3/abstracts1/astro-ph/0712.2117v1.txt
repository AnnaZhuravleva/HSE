We present the results of a long-term photometric monitoring project carried out at Catania Astrophysical Observatory and aimed at studying magnetic activity in close binary systems. We present the complete observations dataset (38,000 photoelectric observations in UBV) and new results of an investigation on the origin of brightness and color variations observed in the close binary stars: AR Psc, VY Ari, UX Ari, V711 Tau, EI Eri, V1149 Ori, DH Leo, HU Vir, RS CVn, V775 Her, AR Lac, SZ Psc, II Peg and BY Dra. Correlation and regression analyses are carried out. We find the existence of two different patterns of color variations. Eight stars in our sample: BY Dra, VY Ari, V775 Her, II Peg, V1149 Ori, HU Vir, EI Eri and DH Leo become redder when they get fainter. The other six stars show the opposite behaviour, i.e. they become bluer when they get fainter. For V711 Tau this behaviour could be explained by the increased relative U- and B- flux contribution by the earlier-type component of the binary system when the cooler component gets fainter. On the other hand, for AR Psc, UX Ari, RS CVn, SZ Psc and AR Lac the existence of hot photospheric faculae must be necessarily invoked. We also found that in single-lined and double-lined binary stars in which the fainter component is inactive or much less active the V magnitude is correlated to B-V and U-B color variations in more than 60% of observation seasons. The correlation is found in less than 40% of observation seasons when the fainter component has a non-negligible level of activity and/or hot faculae are present but they are either spatially or temporally uncorrelated to spots.
