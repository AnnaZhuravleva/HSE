In the study of the process of cosmic structure formation numerical simulations are crucial tools to interface observational data to theoretical models and to investigate issues otherwise unexplored. Enormous advances have been achieved in the last years thanks to the availability of sophisticated codes, now allowing to tackle the problem of cosmic structure formation and subsequent evolution by covering larger and larger dynamical ranges. Moreover, computational cosmology is the ideal interpretative framework for the overwhelming amount of new data from extragalactic surveys and from large sample of individual objects. The Workshop Novicosmo 2008 "The Impact of Simulations in Cosmology and Galaxy Formation' held in SISSA was aimed at providing the state-of-the-art on the latest numerical simulations in Cosmology and in Galaxy Formation. Particular emphasis was given to the implementation of new physical processes in simulation codes, to the comparison between different codes and numerical schemes and how to use best supercomputing facilities of the next generation. Finally, the impact on our knowledge on the Physics of the Universe brought by this new channel of investigation has also been focused. The Workshop was divided in three sections corresponding (roughly) to three main areas of study: Reionization and Intergalactic medium; Dark and Luminous matter in galaxies; Clusters of galaxies and Large scale Structures. This paper will provide i) a short resume' of the scientific results of the Workshop ii) the complete list of the talks and the instructions on how to retrieve the .pdf of the related (powerpoint) presentations iii) a brief presentation of the associated Exhibition "Space Art"
