The static pressure of the hot gas that fills clusters and groups of galaxies can affect significantly the volume density and thickness of the gas disks in galaxies. In combination with the dynamic pressure, the static pressure allows several observed peculiarities of spiral galaxies surrounded by a hot medium to be explained.
