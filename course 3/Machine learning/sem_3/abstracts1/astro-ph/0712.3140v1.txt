With LOFAR beginning operation in 2008 there is huge potential for studying pulsars with high signal to noise at low frequencies. We present results of observations made with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to revisit, with modern technology, this frequency range. Coherently dedispersed profiles of millisecond pulsars obtained simultaneously between 115-175 MHz are presented. We consider the detections and non-detections of 14 MSPs in light of previous observations and the fluxes, dispersion measures and spectral indices of these pulsars. The excellent prospects for LOFAR finding new MSPs and studying the existing systems are then discussed in light of these results.
