Evolutionary tracks are of key importance for the understanding of star formation. Unfortunately, tracks published by various groups differ so that it is fundamental to have observational tests. In order to do this, we intend to measure the masses of the two components of the Pre-Main Sequence binary HD113449 by combining radial velocity measurements taken with HARPS, with infrared interferometric data using AMBER on the VLTI. The spectroscopic orbit that has already been determined, combined with the first AMBER measurement, allows us to obtain a very first estimation of the inclination of the binary system and from this the masses of the two stars. More AMBER measurements of HD 113449 are needed to improve the precision on the masses: in the ESO period P82 two new measurements are scheduled.
