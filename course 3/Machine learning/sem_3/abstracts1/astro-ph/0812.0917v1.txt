We present observations of the Lynds' dark nebula LDN 1111 made at microwave frequencies between 14.6 and 17.2 GHz with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI). We find emission in this frequency band in excess of a thermal free--free spectrum extrapolated from data at 1.4 GHz with matched uv-coverage. This excess is > 15 sigma above the predicted emission. We fit the measured spectrum using the spinning dust model of Drain & Lazarian (1998a) and find the best fitting model parameters agree well with those derived from Scuba data for this object by Visser et al. (2001).
