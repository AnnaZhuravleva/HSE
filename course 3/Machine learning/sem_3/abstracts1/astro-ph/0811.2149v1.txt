The Standard Model of cosmology states a surprising composition of the Universe, in which ordinary matter accounts for less than 5%. The remaining 95% are composed of ~70% Dark Energy and ~25% Dark Matter. However, those two components have never been identified and remain a challenging problem to modern cosmology. One alternative to the concordance model could be the symmetric Milne universe, composed of matter and antimatter (supposed to have negative mass) in equal quantities. We will present the effects of these hypothesis on classical cosmological tests such as primordial nucleosynthesis, CMB, or Type Ia supernovae and show that this model is in remarkably good agreement with observations.
