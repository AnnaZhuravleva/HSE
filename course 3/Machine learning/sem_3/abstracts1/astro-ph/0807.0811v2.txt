We present a radio continuum study of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) DA 495 (G65.7+1.2), including images of total intensity and linear polarization from 408 to 10550 MHz based on the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and observations with the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope. Removal of flux density contributions from a superimposed \ion{H}{2} region and from compact extragalactic sources reveals a break in the spectrum of DA 495 at 1.3 GHz, with a spectral index ${\alpha}={-0.45 \pm 0.20}$ below the break and ${\alpha}={-0.87 \pm 0.10}$ above it (${S}_\nu \propto{\nu^{\alpha}}$). The spectral break is more than three times lower in frequency than the lowest break detected in any other PWN. The break in the spectrum is likely the result of synchrotron cooling, and DA 495, at an age of $\sim$20,000 yr, may have evolved from an object similar to the Vela X nebula, with a similarly energetic pulsar. We find a magnetic field of $\sim$1.3 mG inside the nebula. After correcting for the resulting high internal rotation measure, the magnetic field structure is quite simple, resembling the inner part of a dipole field projected onto the plane of the sky, although a toroidal component is likely also present. The dipole field axis, which should be parallel to the spin axis of the putative pulsar, lies at an angle of ${\sim}50\degr$ east of the North Celestial Pole and is pointing away from us towards the south-west. The upper limit for the radio surface brightness of any shell-type supernova remnant emission around DA 495 is $\Sigma_{1 GHz} \sim 5.4 \times 10^{-23}$ OAWatt m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ (assuming a radio spectral index of $\alpha = -0.5$), lower than the faintest shell-type remnant known to date.
