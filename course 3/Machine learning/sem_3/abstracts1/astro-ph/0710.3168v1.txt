This Supplementary Information provides details about the spectral extraction (crowding issues and the removal of nebular lines), a discussion about the distance to M33, a model for the O-star wind and the measurement of the true photospheric X-ray eclipse width Theta, and details about ellipsoidal modelling. It also contains five related figures, one related table, and additional references.
