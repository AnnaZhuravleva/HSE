Numerous investigations on the fundamental properties of low-mass stars using eclipsing binaries indicate a strong discrepancy between theory and observations that is still awaiting explanation. Current models seem to predict radii for stars less massive than the Sun that are some 10% smaller than observed, while their effective temperatures are some 5% larger. Here we discuss recent new observational data that are relevant to this issue and review the progress made in understanding the origin of the important differences with theoretical calculations. Notably, we provide evidence that stellar activity may be responsible for the mismatch between observations and theory through two different channels: inhibition of convection or effects of a significant starspot coverage. The activity hypothesis is put to a test with observational diagnostics and some of the consequences of the large starspot coverage are evaluated. We conclude that stellar activity likely plays a key role in defining the properties of active low-mass stars and that this should be properly taken into account when investigating young, active stars in clusters or star-forming regions.
