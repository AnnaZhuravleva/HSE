Recently, ground-based very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy achieved a remarkable advancement in the development of the observational technique for the registration and study of gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV. Construction of telescopes of substantially larger sizes than the currently used 12 m class telescopes can drastically improve the sensitivity of ground-based detectors to gamma rays of energy from 10 GeV to 100 GeV. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we have studied the response of an array of three large area imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACT) as a prototype for a future large-scale low energy ground-based experiment. The sensitivity of a three-telescope array as a function of optical reflector size was investigated here in detail.
