Near-infrared (hereafter NIR) data may provide complementary information to the traditional optical population synthesis analysis of unresolved stellar populations because the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies in the 1-2.5\mum range is dominated by different types of stars than at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, NIR data are subjected to less absorption and hence could constrain the stellar populations in dust-obscured galaxies. We want to develop observational constraints on the stellar populations of unresolved stellar systems in the NIR. To achieve this goal we need a benchmark sample of NIR spectra of ``simple'' early-type galaxies, to be used for testing and calibrating the outputs of population synthesis models. We obtained low-resolution (R~1000) long-slit spectra between 1.5 and 2.4\mum for 14 nearby early-type galaxies using SofI at NTT and higher resolution (R~3000) long-slit spectra, centered at the MgI at ~1.51\mum for a heterogeneous sample of 5 nearby galaxies observed with ISAAC at VLT. We defined spectral indices for CO, NaI, CaI and MgI features and measured the strengths of these features in the sample galaxies. We defined a new global NIR metallicity index, suitable for abundance measurements in low-resolution spectra. Finally, we present an average NIR spectrum of an early-type galaxy, built from a homogenized subset of our sample. The NIR spectra of the sample galaxies show great similarity and the strength of some features does correlate with the iron abundance [Fe/H] and optical metal features of the galaxies. The data suggest that the NIR metal features, in combination with a hydrogen absorption feature may be able to break the age-metallicity degeneracy just like the Mg and Fe features in the optical wavelength range.
