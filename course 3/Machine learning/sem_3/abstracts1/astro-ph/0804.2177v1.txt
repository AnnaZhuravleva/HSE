I report on recent results from observations of stars with metallicities [Fe/H] <= -2.0. These include a substantial new sample of objects with high-resolution observations obtained as part of a follow-up of the HK Survey, The Hamburg/ESO Survey, and the ongoing survey SEGUE: Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. Perspectives on the next directions are also provided.
