Gravitational waves are tiny disturbances in space-time and are a fundamental, although not yet directly confirmed, prediction of General Relativity. Rapidly rotating neutron stars are one of the possible sources of gravitational radiation dependent upon pulsar's rotational frequency, details of the equation of state of stellar matter, and distance to detector. Applying an equation of state with symmetry energy constrained by recent nuclear laboratory data, we set an upper limit on the strain-amplitude of gravitational waves emitted by rapidly rotating neutron stars.
