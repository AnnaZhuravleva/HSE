The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full coverage EAS-array installed at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, P.R. China). We present the results on the angular resolution measured with different methods with the full central carpet. The comparison of experimental results with MC simulations is discussed.
