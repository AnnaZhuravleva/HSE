Black hole binaries with extreme ($\gtrsim 10^4:1$) or intermediate ($\sim 10^2-10^4:1$) mass ratios are among the most interesting gravitational wave sources that are expected to be detected by the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. These sources have the potential to tell us much about astrophysics, but are also of unique importance for testing aspects of the general theory of relativity in the strong field regime. Here we discuss these sources from the perspectives of astrophysics, data analysis, and applications to testing general relativity, providing both a description of the current state of knowledge and an outline of some of the outstanding questions that still need to be addressed. This review grew out of discussions at a workshop in September 2006 hosted by the Albert Einstein Institute in Golm, Germany.
