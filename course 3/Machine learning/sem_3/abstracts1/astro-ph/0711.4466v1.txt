We studied the bulge and the disk kinematic of the giant Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxy ESO 323-G064 in order to investigate its dynamics and its Dark Matter (DM) content. We observed the galaxy with the integral field spectroscopy (VLT/VIMOS, in IFU configuration). Results for the gaseous kinematics (bulge and disk) and stellar kinematics (bulge) are presented, together with a Jeans model for the stellar bulge kinematics.
