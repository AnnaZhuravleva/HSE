We use the usual method of Schwarzschild to construct self-consistent solutions for the triaxial de Zeeuw & Carollo (1996) models with central density cusps. ZC96 models are triaxial generalisations of spherical $\gamma$-models of Dehnen whose densities vary as $r^{-\gamma}$ near the center and $r^{-4}$ at large radii and hence, possess a central density core for $\gamma=0$ and cusps for $\gamma > 0$. We consider four triaxial models from ZC96, two prolate triaxials: $(p, q) = (0.65, 0.60)$ with $\gamma = 1.0$ and 1.5, and two oblate triaxials: $(p, q) = (0.95, 0.60)$ with $\gamma = 1.0$ and 1.5. We compute 4500 orbits in each model for time periods of $10^{5} T_{D}$. We find that a large fraction of the orbits in each model are stochastic by means of their nonzero Liapunov exponents. The stochastic orbits in each model can sustain regular shapes for $\sim 10^{3} T_{D}$ or longer, which suggests that they diffuse slowly through their allowed phase-space. Except for the oblate triaxial models with $\gamma =1.0$, our attempts to construct self-consistent solutions employing only the regular orbits fail for the remaining three models. However, the self-consistent solutions are found to exist for all models when the stochastic and regular orbits are treated in the same way because the mixing-time, $\sim10^{4} T_{D}$, is shorter than the integration time, $10^{5} T_{D}$. Moreover, the ``fully-mixed'' solutions can also be constructed for all models when the stochastic orbits are fully mixed at 15 lowest energy shells. Thus, we conclude that the self-consistent solutions exist for our selected prolate and oblate triaxial models with $\gamma = 1.0$ and 1.5.
