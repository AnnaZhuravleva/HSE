The detailed spiral structure in the outer Galactic disk is still poorly known, and for several Galactic directions we rely on model extrapolations. One of these regions is the fourth Galactic quadrant, in the sector comprised between Vela and Carina (270 <l< 300) where no spiral arms have been detected so far in the optical beyond 270. By means of deep UBVI photometry, we search for spiral features in known low absorption windows.U photometry, although demanding, constitutes a powerful tool to detect and characterize distant aggregates, and allows to derive firmer distance estimates. We studied a direction close to the tangent (l=290) to the Carina arm, in an attempt to detect optical spiral tracers beyond the Carina branch, where radio observations and models predictions indicate the presence of the extension of the Perseus and Norma-Cygnus spiral arms in the fourth quadrant.Along this line of sight, we detect three distinct groups of young stars. Two of them, at 2.5 and 6.0 kpc, belong to the Carina spiral arm (which is crossed twice in this particular direction).The latter is here detected for the first time. The third group, at a distance of 12.7 kpc, is part of the Perseus arm which lies beyond the Carina arm, and constitutes the first optical detection of this arm in the fourth Galactic quadrant. The position of this feature is compatible with HI observations and model predictions. We furthermore present evidence that this extremely distant group, formerly thought to be a star cluster (Shorlin 1), is in fact a diffuse young population. In addition, our data-set does not support the possible presence of the Monoceros Ring toward this direction. This study highlights how multicolor optical studies can be effective to probe the spiral structure in the outer Galactic disk.
