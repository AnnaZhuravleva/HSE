We show how hydrostatic equilibrium in galaxy clusters can be quantitatively probed combining X-ray, SZ, and gravitational-lensing data. Our previously published method for recovering three-dimensional cluster gas distributions avoids the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. Independent reconstructions of cumulative total-mass profiles can then be obtained from the gas distribution, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, and from gravitational lensing, neglecting it. Hydrostatic equilibrium can then be quantified comparing the two. We describe this procedure in detail and show that it performs well on progressively realistic synthetic data. An application to a cluster merger demonstrates how hydrostatic equilibrium is violated and restored as the merger proceeds.
