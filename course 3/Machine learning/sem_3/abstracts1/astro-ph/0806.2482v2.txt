We present results from an extensive set of simulations of gravitational fragmentation in the presence of magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion. The average fragmentation spacing in the nonlinear phase of evolution is in excellent agreement with the prediction of linear perturbation theory. The time scale for nonlinear growth and runaway of the first core is $\approx 10$ times the calculated growth time $\taugm$ of the eigenmode with minimum growth time, when starting from a uniform background state with small-amplitude white-noise perturbations. Subcritical and transcritical models typically evolve on a significantly longer time scale than the supercritical models. Infall motions in the nonlinear fully-developed contracting cores are subsonic on the core scale in subcritical and transcritical clouds, but are somewhat supersonic in supercritical clouds. Core mass distributions are sharply peaked with a steep decline to large masses, consistent with the existence of a preferred mass scale for each unique set of dimensionless free parameters. However, a sum total of results for various initial mass-to-flux ratios yields a broad distribution reminiscent of observed core mass distributions. Based on our results, we conclude that fragmentation spacings, magnitude of infall motions, core shapes, and, especially, the curvature of magnetic field morphology, may serve as indirect observational means of determining a cloud's ambient mass-to-flux ratio.
