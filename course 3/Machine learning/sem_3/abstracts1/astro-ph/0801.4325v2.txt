We analyze the hitherto available space-based X-ray data as well as ground-based optical data of the X-ray transient 080109/SN2008D. From the data we suggest that (i) The initial transient (\lesssim 800 sec) is attributed to the reverse shock emission of a mildly relativistic (\Gamma \sim a few) outflow stalled by the dense stellar wind. (ii) The subsequent X-ray afterglow (\lesssim 2\times 10^4 sec) can be ascribed to the forward shock emission of the outflow, with a kinetic energy \sim 10^{46} erg, when sweeping up the stellar wind medium. (iii) The late X-ray flattening (\gtrsim 2\times 10^4$ sec) is powered by the fastest non-decelerated component of SN2008D's ejecta. (iv) The local event rate of X-ray transient has a lower limit of \sim 1.6\times 10^4 yr^{-1} Gpc^{-3}, indicating a vast majority of X-ray transients have a wide opening angle of \gtrsim 100 degree. The off-axis viewing model is less likely. (v) Transient 080109/SN2008D may lead to a continuum from GRB-SN to under-luminous GRB-/XRF-SN to X-ray transient-SN and to ordinary Ibc SN (if not every Ibc SN has a relativistic jet), as shown in Figure 2 of this Letter.
