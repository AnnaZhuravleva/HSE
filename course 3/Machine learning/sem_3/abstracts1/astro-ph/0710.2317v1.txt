The goal of this research is to investigate how well various turbulence models can describe physical properties of the upper convective boundary layer of the Sun. An accurate modeling of the turbulence motions is necessary for understanding the excitation mechanisms of solar oscillation modes. We have carried out realistic numerical simulations using several different physical Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models (Hyperviscosity approach, Smagorinsky, and dynamic models) to investigate how the differences in turbulence modeling affect the damping and excitation of the oscillations and their spectral properties and compare with observations. We have first calculated the oscillation power spectra of radial and non-radial modes supported by the computational box with the different turbulence models. Then we have calculated the work integral input to the modes to estimate the influence of the turbulence model on the depth and strength of the oscillation sources. We have compared these results with previous studies and with the observed properties of solar oscillations. We find that the dynamic turbulence model provides the best agreement with the helioseismic observations.
