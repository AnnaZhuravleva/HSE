The results of spectroscopic observations of long-periodic eclipsing binary Epsilon Aur are reported. The observations were carried out during 2 nights in 2007 at 2-meter telescope located at the peak Terskol, Northern Caucasus (Russia). Here we present series of Epsilon Aur spectra together with EW measurements of the most prominent absorption lines.
