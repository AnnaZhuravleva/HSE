Far-side images of solar active regions have become one of the routine products of helioseismic observations, and are of importance for space weather forecasting by allowing the detection of sunspot regions before they become visible on the Earth side of the Sun. An accurate assessment of the quality of the far-side maps is difficult, because there are no direct observations of the solar far side to verify the detections. In this paper we assess far-side imaging based on the time-distance helioseismology method, by using numerical simulations of solar oscillations in a spherical solar model. Localized variations in the speed of sound in the surface and subsurface layers are used to model the perturbations associated with sunspots and active regions. We examine how the accuracy of the resulting far-side maps of acoustic travel times depends on the size and location of active regions. We investigate potential artifacts in the far-side imaging procedure, such as those caused by the presence of active regions on the solar near side, and suggest how these artifacts can be identified in the real Sun far-side images obtained from SOHO/MDI and GONG data.
