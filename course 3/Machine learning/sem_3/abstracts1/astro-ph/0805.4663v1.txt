We carried out a homogeneous abundance study for various elements, including $\alpha$-elements, iron peak elements and $n$-capture elements for 35 metal-poor stars with a wide metallicity range ($-3.0\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim-0.5$). High-resolution ($R\simeq30$k), high signal-to-noise($S/N\geq110$) spectra with a wavelength range of 3800 to 10500 \AA using the Bohyunsan Optical Echelle Spectrograph (BOES). Equivalent widths were measured by means of the Gaussian-fitting method for numerous isolated weak lines of elements. Atmospheric parameters were determined by a self-consistent LTE analysis technique using Fe I and Fe II lines. In this study, we present the EWs of lines and atmospheric parameters for 35 metal-poor stars.
