We present results from a large 86GHz global VLBI survey of compact radio sources. The main goal of the survey is to increase by factors of 3--5 the total number of objects accessible for future 3-mm VLBI imaging. The survey observations reach the baseline sensitivity of 0.1Jy and image sensitivity of better than 10 mJy/beam. The total of 127 compact radio sources have been observed. The observations have yielded images for 109 sources, extending the database of the sources imaged at 86GHz with VLBI observation by a factor of 5, and only 6 sources have not been detected. The remaining 12 objects have been detected but could not be imaged due to insufficient closure phase information. Radio galaxies are less compact than quasars and BL Lacs on sub-milliarcsecond scale. Flux densities and sizes of core and jet components of all imaged sources have been estimated using Gaussian model fitting. From these measurements, brightness temperatures have been calculated, taking into account resolution limits of the data. The cores of 70% of the imaged sources are resolved. The core brightness temperatures of the sources peak at $\sim 10^{11}$ K and only 1% have brightness temperatures higher than $10^{12}$ K. Cores of Intraday Variable (IDV) sources are smaller in angular size than non-IDV sources, and so yield higher brightness temperatures.
