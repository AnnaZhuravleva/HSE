In this paper we present radio and high energy observations of the INTEGRAL source IGR J21247+5058, a broad line emitting galaxy obscured by the Galactic plane. Archival VLA radio data indicate that IGR J21247+5058 can be classified as an FRII Broad Line Radio Galaxy. The spectrum between 610 MHz and 15 GHz is typical of synchrotron self-absorbed radiation with a peak at 8 GHz and a low energy turnover; the core fraction is 0.1 suggestive of a moderate Doppler boosting of the base of the jet. The high energy broad-band spectrum was obtained by combining XMM-Newton and Swift/XRT observation with INTEGRAL/IBIS data. The 0.4-100 keV spectrum is well described by a power law, with slope $\Gamma$=1.5, characterised by complex absorption due to two layers of material partially covering the source and a high energy cut-off around 70-80 keV. Features such as a narrow iron line and a Compton reflection component, if present, are weak, suggesting that reprocessing of the power law photons in the accretion disk plays a negligible role in the source.
