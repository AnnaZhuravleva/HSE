We present a full set of model atmosphere equations for the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole irradiated by hard X-ray lamp of power-law spectral distribution. Model equations allow for multiple Compton scattering of radiation on free electrons, and for large relative photon-electron energy exchange at the time of scattering. We present spectra in specific intensities integrated over the disk surface. Theoretical outgoing intensity spectra show soft X-ray excess below 1 keV, and distinct K_alpha and K_beta fluorescent lines of iron. We demonstrate the existence of the Compton Shoulder and claim that it can contribute to the asymmetry and equivalent widths of some observed Fe K_alpha lines in AGN. Our models exhibit the effect of limb-brightening in reflected X-rays.
