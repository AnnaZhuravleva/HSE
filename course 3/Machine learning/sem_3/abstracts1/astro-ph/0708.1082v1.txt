Assuming a two-component quasar structure model consisting of a central compact source and an extended outer feature, we produce microlensing simulations for a population of star-like objects in the lens galaxy. Such a model is a simplified version of that adopted to explain the brightness variations observed in Q0957 (Schild & Vakulik 2003). The microlensing light curves generated for a range of source parameters were compared to the light curves obtained in the framework of the OGLE program. With a large number of trials we built, in the domain of the source structure parameters, probability distributions to find "good" realizations of light curves. The values of the source parameters which provide the maximum of the joint probability distribution calculated for all the image components, have been accepted as estimates for the source structure parameters. The results favour the two-component model of the quasar brightness structure over a single compact central source model, and in general the simulations confirm the Schild-Vakulik model that previously described successfully the microlensing and other properties of Q0957. Adopting 3300 km/s for the transverse velocity of the source, the effective size of the central source was determined to be about 2x10^15 cm, and Epsilon =2 was obtained for the ratio of the integral luminosity of the outer feature to that of the central source.
