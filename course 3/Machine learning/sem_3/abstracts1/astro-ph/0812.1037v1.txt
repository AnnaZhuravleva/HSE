Linear theory provides a reasonable description of the velocity correlations of biased tracers both perpendicular and parallel to the line of separation, provided one accounts for the fact that the measurement is almost always made using pair-weighted statistics. This introduces an additional term which, for sufficiently biased tracers, may be large. Previous work suggesting that linear theory was grossly in error for the components parallel to the line of separation ignored this term.
