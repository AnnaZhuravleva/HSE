We present $N$-body cosmlogical simulations in the framework of the Newtonian limit of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. The scalar field is described by a modified Helmholtz equation with a source that is coupled to the standard Poisson equation of Newtonian gravity. The effective gravitational force is given by two contributions: the standard Newtonian potential plus a Yukawa potential stemming from massive scalar fields. In particular, we consider simulations of $\Lambda$CDM models and compute the density and velocity profiles of the most massive groups found at z=0.
