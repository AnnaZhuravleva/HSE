We present deep and accurate optical photometry of the Local Group starburst galaxy IC10. The photometry is based on two sets of images collected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys and with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We provide new estimates of the Red Giant Branch tip (TRGB) magnitude, m_{F814W}^{TRGB}=21.90+-0.03, and of the reddening, E(B-V)=0.78+-0.06, using field stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as a reference. Adopting the SMC and two globulars, Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae, as references we estimate the distance modulus to IC10: independent calibrations give weighted average distances of mu=24.51+-0.08 (TRGB) and mu=24.56+-0.08 (RR Lyrae). We also provide a new theoretical calibration for the TRGB luminosity, and using these predictions we find a very similar distance to IC10 (mu~24.60+-0.15). These results suggest that IC10 is a likely member of the M31 subgroup.
