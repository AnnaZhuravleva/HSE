Spectroscopic observations of distant cosmological sources continue to exhibit a surprising result; that the chemical abundance of the universe seems to be approximately solar for the observed sources at redshifts of 5, 6, and even 7, even though very few galaxies should have existed at these epochs and the principal star formation and heavy element production event should have been at the more local z = 1 - 2.
