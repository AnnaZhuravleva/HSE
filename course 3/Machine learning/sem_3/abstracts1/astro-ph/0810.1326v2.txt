We present the Northern HIPASS Optical/InfraRed CATalogue (NOIRCAT), an optical/near-infrared counterpart to the Northern HIPASS catalogue (NHICAT). Of the 1002 sources in NHICAT, 655 (66%) have optical counterparts with matching optical velocities. A further 85 (8%) sources have optical counterparts with matching velocities from previous radio emission-line surveys. We find a correlation between the gas and stellar content of the NOIRCAT sources. Our HI-selected sample of isolated galaxies also present a wider range in near-infrared (NIR) colours than previous optically-selected studies of regular, isolated galaxies. All HI detections in optically unobscured fields could be matched with either a NED optical counterpart, or a galaxy visible in POSSII or DSS images. However, as over 200 of these matched galaxies have no velocity information, further follow-up observations are needed to confirm the matches, and hence confirm or deny the existence of dark galaxies in this dataset.
