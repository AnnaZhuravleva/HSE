The formation of the massive young stars surrounding SgrA* is still an open question. In this paper, we simulate the infall of an isothermal, turbulent molecular cloud towards the Galactic Centre (GC). As it spirals towards the GC, the molecular cloud forms a small and dense disc around SgrA*. Efficient star formation (SF) is expected to take place in such a dense disc. We model SF by means of sink particles. At ~6x10^5 yr, ~6000 solar masses of stars have formed, and are confined within a thin disc with inner and outer radius of 0.06 and 0.5 pc, respectively. Thus, this preliminary study shows that the infall of a molecular cloud is a viable scenario for the formation of massive stars around SgrA*. Further studies with more realistic radiation physics and SF will be required to better constrain this intriguing scenario.
