Here the effect of rotation up to third order in the angular velocity of a star on the p, f and g modes is investigated. To do this, the third-order perturbation formalism presented by Soufi et al. (1998) and revised by Karami (2008), was used. I quantify by numerical calculations the effect of rotation on the oscillation frequencies of a uniformly rotating $\beta$-Cephei star with 12 $M_\odot$. For an equatorial velocity of 90 $\rm km s^{-1}$, it is found that the second- and third-order corrections for $(l,m)=(5,-4)$, for instance, are of order of 0.07% of the frequency for radial order $n=-3$ and reaches up to 0.6% for $n=-20$.
