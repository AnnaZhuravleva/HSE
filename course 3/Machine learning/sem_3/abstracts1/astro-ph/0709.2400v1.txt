M87 is the first extragalactic source detected at the TeV that is not a blazar. To account for the recent observations of M87 made by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) telescope array, we developed a new multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton model.   In the framework of this model, we present here the predictions for the very high energy emission of three active galactic nuclei with extended optical or X-ray jets which could be misaligned blazars, namely Cen A, PKS 0521-36 and 3C 273.
