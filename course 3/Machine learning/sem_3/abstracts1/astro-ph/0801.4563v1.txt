Galaxies are seen from different viewing angles and their observed properties change as a function of viewing angle. In many circumstances we would rather know the intrinsic properties of galaxies - those properties that do not depend on viewing angle. For a large sample of galaxies it is possible to recover the intrinsic properties of galaxies, statistically, by looking for correlations with galaxy inclination, and then applying a correction to remove those dependencies. Studying the intrinsic properties of galaxies can give a different impression of the galaxy population and help avoid the mistake of connecting observed properties to quantities that don't depend on inclination like halo mass.
