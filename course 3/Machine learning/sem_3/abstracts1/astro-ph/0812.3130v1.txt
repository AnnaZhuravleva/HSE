Recently, it was argued that the log(z)-m_{v} plot of 106,000 AGN galaxies could be interpreted as an evolutionary path followed by local AGN galaxies as they age. It was suggested that these objects are born as quasars with a high intrinsic redshift component that decreases with time. When the intrinsic component is large it causes them to be pushed above the standard candle line for brightest radio galaxies on a log(z)-m_{v} plot. In the jets of radio loud AGN galaxies, Beta_(app) is the apparent transverse velocity of the ejected material relative to the speed of light. In the cosmological redshift (CR) model the Beta_(app) vs z distribution has a peculiar shape, and there have been several attempts to explain it. In agreement with the model proposed to explain the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it is shown here that the peculiar shape of the Beta_(app)-z distribution in the CR model is exactly what is expected if the sources are local but their large intrinsic redshifts are assumed to be cosmological in the calculation of Beta_(app). This result not only supports our previous interpretation of the log(z)-m_{v} plot, it further implies that if a large component of the redshift is intrinsic a similar effect should be visible when other parameters are plotted vs z. Examining this it is also found that the results are consistent with the local model.
