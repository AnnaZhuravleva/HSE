We repeat the directional spherical real Morlet wavelet analysis, used to detect non-Gaussianity in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 1-year and 3-year data (McEwen et al. 2005, 2006a), on the WMAP 5-year data. The non-Gaussian signal detected previously is present in the 5-year data at a slightly increased statistical significance of approximately 99%. Localised regions that contribute most strongly to the non-Gaussian signal are found to be very similar to those detected in the previous releases of the WMAP data. When the localised regions detected in the 5-year data are excluded from the analysis the non-Gaussian signal is eliminated.
