Photometries of B, V, Rc, Ic, y, J, and Ks bands and low dispersion optical spectroscopic observations of Nova V1280 Sco, started soon after the outburst, are reported. We show that V1280 Sco is an Fe II nova and it is going through the historically slowest spectroscopic evolution. The rapid decline observed in the early phase was caused by formation of a dust shell. We estimate the abundances of CNO using the absorption lines on a spectrum at pre-maximum, and find over-abundances by [C/Fe] ~ 1.4, [N/Fe] > 2.0 and [O/Fe] ~ 1.1.
