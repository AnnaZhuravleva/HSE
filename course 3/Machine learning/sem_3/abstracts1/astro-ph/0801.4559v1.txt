We present a survey of bright optical dropout sources in two deep, multiwavelength surveys comprising eleven widely-separated fields, aimed at constraining the galaxy luminosity function at z~7 for sources at 5-10L*(z=6). Our combined survey area is 225 arcmin^2 to a depth of J=24.2 (AB, 3 sigma) and 135 arcmin^2 to J=25.3 (AB, 4 sigma). We find that infrared data longwards of 2 microns is essential for classifying optical dropout sources, and in particular for identifying cool Galactic star contaminants. Our limits on the number density of high redshift sources are consistent with current estimates of the Lyman break galaxy luminosity function at z=6.
