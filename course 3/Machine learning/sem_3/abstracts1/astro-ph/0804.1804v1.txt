We used the CSO 10.4 meter telescope to image the 350 micron and 450 micron continuum and CO J=6-5 line emission of the IRAS 20126+4104 clump. The continuum and line observations show that the clump is isolated over a 4 pc region and has a radius of ~ 0.5 pc. Our analysis shows that the clump has a radial density profile propto r ^{-1.2} for r <~ 0.1 pc and has propto r^{-2.3} for r >~ 0.1 pc which suggests the inner region is infalling, while the infall wave has not yet reached the outer region. Assuming temperature gradient of r^{-0.35}, the power law indices become propto r ^{-0.9} for r < ~0.1 pc and propto r^{-2.0} for r >~ 0.1 pc. Based on a map of the flux ratio of 350micron/450micron, we identify three distinct regions: a bipolar feature that coincides with the large scale CO bipolar outflow; a cocoon-like region that encases the bipolar feature and has a warm surface; and a cold layer outside of the cocoon region. The complex patterns of the flux ratio map indicates that the clump is no longer uniform in terms of temperature as well as dust properties. The CO emission near the systemic velocity traces the dense clump and the outer layer of the clump shows narrow line widths (< ~3 km/s). The clump has a velocity gradient of ~ 2 km/s pc^{-1}, which we interpret as due to rotation of the clump, as the equilibrium mass (~ 200 Msun) is comparable to the LTE mass obtained from the CO line. Over a scale of ~ 1 pc, the clump rotates in the opposite sense with respect to the >~ 0.03 pc disk associated with the (proto)star. This is one of four objects in high-mass and low-mass star forming regions for which a discrepancy between the rotation sense of the envelope and the core has been found, suggesting that such a complex kinematics may not be unusual in star forming regions.
