Evolution of Population I stars with initial masses from 70M_\odot to 130M_\odot is considered under various assumptions on the mass loss rate \dot M. The mass-luminosity relation of W-R stars is shown to be most sensitive to the mass loss rate during the helium burning phase \dot M_{3\alpha}. Together with the mass-luminosity relation obtained for all evolutionary sequences several more exact relations are determined for the constant ratio f_{3\alpha}=\dot M/\dot M_{3\alpha} with 0.5 \le f_{3\alpha} \le 3. Evolutionary models of W-R stars were used as initial conditions in hydrodynamic computations of radial nonlinear stellar oscillations. The oscillation amplitude is larger in W-R stars with smaller initial mass or with lower mass loss rate due to higher surface abundances of carbon and oxygen. In the evolving W-R star the oscillation amplitude decreases with decreasing stellar mass M and for M < 10M_\odot the sufficiently small nonlinear effects allow us to calculate the integral of the mechanical work W done over the pulsation cycle in each mass zone of the hydrodynamical model. The only positive maximum on the radial dependence of W is in the layers with temperature of T\sim 2e5K where oscillations are excited by the iron Z--bump kappa-mechanism. Radial oscillations of W-R stars with mass of M > 10M_\odot are shown to be also excited by the kappa-mechanism but the instability driving zone is at the bottom of the envelope and pulsation motions exist in the form of nonlinear running waves propagating outward from the inner layers of the envelope.
