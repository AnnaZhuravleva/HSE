We describe here the reduction methods that we developed to study the faintest red dwarfs and white dwarfs in an outer field of NGC6397, which was observed by \hst for 126 orbits in 2005. The particular challenge of this data set is that the faintest stars are not readily visible in individual exposures, so special care must be taken to combine the information in all the exposures in order to identify and measure them. Unfortunately, it is hard to find the faintest stars without also finding a large number of faint galaxies, so we developed specialized tools to distinguish between the point-like stars and the barely resolved galaxies. We found that artificial-star tests, while obviously necessary for completeness determination, can also play an important role in helping us optimize our finding and measuring algorithms. Although this paper focuses on this data set specifically, many of the techniques are new and might find application in other work, particularly when a large number of images is available for a single field.
