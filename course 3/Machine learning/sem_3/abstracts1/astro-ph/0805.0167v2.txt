We investigated the evolution of interacting disk galaxies using high-resolution $N$-body/SPH simulations, taking into account the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium (ISM). In our high-resolution simulations, a large-scale starburst occurred naturally at the collision interface between two gas disks at the first encounter, resulting in the formation of star clusters. This is consistent with observations of interacting galaxies. The probability distribution function (PDF) of gas density showed clear change during the galaxy-galaxy encounter. The compression of gas at the collision interface between the gas disks first appears as an excess at $n_{\rm H} \sim 10{\rm cm^{-3}}$ in the PDF, and then the excess moves to higher densities ($n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 100{\rm cm^{-3}}$) in a few times $10^7$ years where starburst takes place. After the starburst, the PDF goes back to the quasi-steady state. These results give a simple picture of starburst phenomena in galaxy-galaxy encounters.
