Strong observational evidence indicates that all extragalactic jets associated with AGNs move at relativistic speed up to 100 pc - 1 kpc scales from the nucleus. At larger distances, reflecting the Fanaroff-Riley radio source classification, we observe an abrupt deceleration in FR-I jets while relativistic motions persist up to Mpc scale in FR-II. Moreover, VLBI observations of some object like B2 1144+35, Mrk501 and M87 show limb brightening of the jet radio emission at the parsec scale. This effect is interpreted kinematically as due to the presence of a deboosted central spine at high Lorentz factor and of a weakly relativistic external layer. In this paper we investigate whether these effects can be interpreted by a breaking of the collimated flow by external medium entrainment favored by shear instabilities, namely Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. We examine in details the physical conditions under which significant deceleration of a relativistic flow is produced. We investigate the phenomenon by means of high-resolution three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code for computational astrophysics. We find that the parameter of utmost importance in determining the instability evolution and the entrainment properties is the ambient/jet density contrast. We show that lighter jets suffer stronger slowing down in the external layer than in the central part and conserve a central spine at high Lorentz factor. Our model is verified by constructing synthetic emission maps from the numerical simulations that compare reasonably well with VLBI observations of the inner part of FR-I sources.
