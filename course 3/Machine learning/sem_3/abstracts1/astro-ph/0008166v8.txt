There are multiple examples of gravitational losses in neutron stars and black holes. Protons and neutrons have been found to have enormous repulsive pressures that highly squeezed collapsing matter cannot overcome. The case against singularities follows. Galactic black hole gravitational losses can supply the missing dark energy. With highly squeezed nucleons, the big bang could begin as a hot core and a cold dark matter shell. The 21 cm. radiation data has identified baryon sized particles as cold dark matter. Highly squeezed nucleons will not decompose to produce antimatter. The flatness of the Universe is due to a baryonic bounce. The highly correlated galaxies originated from primordial black holes capturing hot core gasses.There is evidence that galaxies have not grown nor merged significantly since formation.
