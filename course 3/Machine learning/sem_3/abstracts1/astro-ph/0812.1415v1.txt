It is generally believed that pulsars dissipate their rotational energy through powerful winds of relativistic particles. Confinement of these winds leads to the formation of luminous pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) seen across the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. Recently, many new detections have been produced at the highest energies by Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations identifying PWNe as among the most common sources of galactic VHE gamma -ray emission. We report here on the preliminary results of a search for VHE gamma-ray emission towards a selection of energetic and/or close pulsars in the Norther hemisphere in the first years of operations of the full VERITAS array.
