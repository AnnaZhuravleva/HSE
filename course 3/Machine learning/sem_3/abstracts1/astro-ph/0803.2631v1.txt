The stability of spiral galaxies is compared in modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Newtonian dynamics with dark matter (DM). We extend our previous simulations that involved pure stellar discs without gas, to deal with the effects of gas dissipation and star formation. We also vary the interpolating function between the MOND and Newtonian regime. Bar formation is compared in both dynamics, from initial conditions identical in visible component. One first result is that the MOND galaxy evolution is not affected by the choice of the mu-function, it develops bars with the same frequency and strength. The choice of the mu-function significantly changes the equivalent DM models, in changing the dark matter to visible mass ratio and, therefore, changing the stability. The introduction of gas shortens the timescale for bar formation in the DM model, but is not significantly shortened in the MOND model. As a consequence, with gas, the MOND and DM bar frequency histograms are now more similar than without gas. The thickening of the plane occurs through vertical resonance with the bar and peanut formation, and even more quickly with gas. Since the mass gets more concentrated with gas, the radius of the peanut is smaller, and the appearance of the pseudo-bulge is more boxy. The bar strength difference is moderated by saturation, and feedback effects, like the bar weakening or destruction by gas inflow due to gravity torques. Averaged over a series of models representing the Hubble sequence, the MOND models have still more bars, and stronger bars, than the equivalent DM models, better fitting the observations. Gas inflows driven by bars produce accumulations at Lindblad resonances, and MOND models can reproduce observed morphologies quite well, as was found before in the Newtonian dynamics.
