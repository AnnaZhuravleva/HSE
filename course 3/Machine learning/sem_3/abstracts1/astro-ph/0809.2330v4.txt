Theory and observations reveal fatal flaws in the standard LambdaCDM model. The cold dark matter hierarchical clustering paradigm predicts a gradual bottom-up growth of gravitational structures assuming linear, collisionless, ideal flows and unrealistic CDM condensations and mergers. Collisional fluid mechanics with viscosity, turbulence, and diffusion predicts a turbulent big bang and top-down viscous-gravitational fragmentation from supercluster to galaxy scales in the plasma epoch, as observed from 0.3 Gpc void sizes, 1.5 Gpc spins and Kolmogorov-fingerprint-turbulence-signatures in the CMB. Turbulence produced at expanding gravitational void boundaries causes a linear morphology of 3 Kpc fragmenting plasma-protogalaxies along vortex lines, as observed in deep HST images. After decoupling, gas-protogalaxies fragment into primordial-density, million-solar-mass clumps of earth-mass planets forming 0.3 Mpc galactic-dark-matter. White-dwarf-heated planet-atmospheres give dimmed SNe Ia events and false gamma-ray-burst luminosity distances, not dark-energy-Lambda. Quasar microlensing observations rule out no-hair black hole models and require galaxy-dark-matter to be planets-in-clumps.
