Many stormy events in astrophysics occur due to the sudden magnetic energy release. This is possible if a magnetic configuration abruptly changes its topology, an event usually referred to as magnetic reconnection. It is known that pure Ohmic decay is inefficient, occurring during cosmological times (due to the huge characteristic scales $L$). It is recognized that the presence of current sheets speeds up the process, but still insufficiently$^{1,2,3,4,5}$. We show that, in highly compressible and substantially gravitational media, the reconnection is fast enough to account for stormy events. Thus, highly compressible situations offer exiting opportunities in explanations of violent events, although full-scale compressible and gravitational simulations proved to be quite challenging.
