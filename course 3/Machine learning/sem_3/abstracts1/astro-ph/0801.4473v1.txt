We consider the influence of microlensing on different spectral bands of lensed QSOs. We assumed that the emitting X-ray, UV and optical regions are different in size, but that the continuum emission in these spectral bands is originating from an accretion disc. Estimations of the time scales for microlensing and flux amplification in different bands are given. We found that the microlensing duration should be shorter in the X-ray (several months) than in UV/optical emitting region (several years). This result indicates that monitoring of the X-ray variations in lensed QSOs that show a 'flux anomaly' can clarify the source of this anomaly.
