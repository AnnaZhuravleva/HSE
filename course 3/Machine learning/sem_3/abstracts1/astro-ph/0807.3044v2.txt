We present observations of the nuclear star cluster in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4244 using the Gemini Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) with laser guide star adaptive optics. From a previous study of edge-on galaxies, this nuclear star cluster was found to be one of a sample of clusters that appear flattened along the plane of their host galaxies disks. Such clusters show evidence for multiple morphological components, with younger/bluer disk components and older/redder spheroidal components. Our new observations of NGC 4244 show clear rotation of 30 km/sec within the central 10 pc (0.5") of the cluster. The central velocity dispersion is found to be 28+/-2 km/sec. The multiple stellar populations inferred from the optical colors and spectra are seen as variations in the CO line strength in the NIFS spectra. The rotation is clearly detected even in the older, more spheroidal stellar component. We discuss evidence for similar structures and kinematics in the nuclear star clusters of other galaxies including M33 and the Milky Way. Our observations support two possible formation mechanisms: (1) episodic accretion of gas from the disk directly onto the nuclear star cluster, or (2) episodic accretion of young star clusters formed in the central part of the galaxy due to dynamical friction.
