Magnetic field is playing an important role at all stages of star evolution from star formation to the endpoints. The main effects are briefly reviewed. We also show that O-type stars have large convective envelopes, where convective dynamo could work. There, fields in magnetostatic balance have intensities of the order of 100 G. A few OB stars with strong polar fields (Henrichs et al. 2003a) show large N-enhancements indicating a strong internal mixing. We suggest that the meridional circulation enhanced by an internal rotation law close to uniform in these magnetic stars is responsible for the observed mixing. Thus, it is not the magnetic field itself which makes the mixing, but the strong thermal instability associated to solid body rotation. A critical question for evolution is whether a dynamo is at work in radiative zones of rotating stars. The Tayler-Spruit (TS) dynamo is the best candidate. We derive some basic relations for dynamos in radiative layers. Evolutionary models with TS dynamo show important effects: internal rotation coupling and enhanced mixing, all model outputs being affected.
