In the first three papers of this series, about 200 objects in Camelopardalis and the nearby areas of Cassiopeia, Perseus and Auriga were suspected of being pre-main-sequence stars in different stages of evolution. To confirm the evolutionary status of the 15 brightest objects, their far-red range (600--950 nm) spectra were obtained. Almost all these objects are young stars with emissions in H alpha, OI, CaII and P9 lines. The equivalent widths of emission lines and approximate spectral classes of the objects are determined.
