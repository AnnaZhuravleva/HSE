Deconvolution algorithms have been used successfully for optimization/restoration/deblurring of astronomical images in a variety of wavelengths, especially in the optical band (e.g., for HST). We present here an iterative Richardson-Lucy type method designed for treatment of images obtained with the H.E.S.S. array of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. Its application to shell-type supernova remnant images yields refined details relevant for the study of correlations with other wavelengths, and hence for interpretation in terms either of hadronic or leptonic origin of the observed VHE gamma-ray emission.
