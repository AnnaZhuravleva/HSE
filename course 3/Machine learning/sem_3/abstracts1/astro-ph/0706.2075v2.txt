We derive the CMB radiative transfer equation in the form of a multipole hierarchy in the nearly-Friedmann-Robertson-Walker limit of homogeneous, but anisotropic, universes classified via their Bianchi type. Compared with previous calculations, this allows a more sophisticated treatment of recombination, produces predictions for the polarization of the radiation, and allows for reionization. Our derivation is independent of any assumptions about the dynamical behaviour of the field equations, except that it requires anisotropies to be small back to recombination; this is already demanded by observations.   We calculate the polarization signal in the Bianchi VIIh case, with the parameters recently advocated to mimic the several large-angle anomalous features observed in the CMB. We find that the peak polarization signal is ~ 1.2 micro K for the best-fit model to the temperature anisotropies, and is mostly confined to multipoles l<10. Remarkably, the predicted large-angle EE and TE power spectra in the Bianchi model are consistent with WMAP observations that are usually interpreted as evidence of early reionization. However, the power in B-mode polarisation is predicted to be similar to the E-mode power and parity-violating correlations are also predicted by the model; the WMAP non-detection of either of these signals casts further strong doubts on the veracity of attempts to explain the large-angle anomalies with global anisotropy. On the other hand, given that there exist further dynamical degrees of freedom in the VIIh universes that are yet to be compared with CMB observations, we cannot at this time definitively reject the anisotropy explanation.
