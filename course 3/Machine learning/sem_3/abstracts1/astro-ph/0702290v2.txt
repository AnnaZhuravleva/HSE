This is a speculative attempt to connect string theory with cosmological observation. Inspired by an exactly solvable model in string theory, and based on the assumption that all matter is made of strings, individual stars will couple universally to this string gauge field and execute Landau orbits, much like electrons in an external magnetic field. This three-parameter phenomenological model can adequately fit the galaxy rotation curves. The extra centripetal acceleration provided by the background field can hence account for the "missing mass" needed to sustain the high rotation speed beyond the bulk of the stellar mass. The rotation speed of the stars on the outskirts of a galaxy is predicted to be linearly rising with distance.
