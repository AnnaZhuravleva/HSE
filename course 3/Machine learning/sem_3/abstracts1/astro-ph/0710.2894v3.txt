In the ongoing HATNet survey we have detected a giant planet, with radius 1.33 +/- 0.06 RJup and mass 1.06 +/- 0.12 MJup, transiting the bright (V = 10.5) star GSC 03239-00992. The planet is in a circular orbit with period 3.852985 +/- 0.000005 days and mid-transit epoch 2,454,035.67575 +/- 0.00028 (HJD). The parent star is a late F star with mass 1.29 +/- 0.06 Msun, radius 1.46 +/- 0.06 Rsun, Teff ~ 6570 +/- 80 K, [Fe=H] = -0.13 +/- 0.08 and age ~ 2.3+/-^{0.5}_{0.7}Gy. With this radius and mass, HAT-P-6b has somewhat larger radius than theoretically expected. We describe the observations and their analysis to determine physical properties of the HAT-P-6 system, and briefly discuss some implications of this finding.
