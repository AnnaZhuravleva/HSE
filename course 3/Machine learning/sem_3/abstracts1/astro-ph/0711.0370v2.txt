Aims: In view of the substantial uncertainties regarding the possible dynamics of the dark energy, we aim at constraining the expansion rate of the universe without reference to a specific Friedmann model and its parameters. Methods: We show that cosmological observables integrating over the cosmic expansion rate can be converted into a Volterra integral equation which is known to have a unique solution in terms of a Neumann series. Expanding observables such as the luminosity distances to type-Ia supernovae into a series of orthonormal functions, the integral equation can be solved and the cosmic expansion rate recovered within the limits allowed by the accuracy of the data. Results: We demonstrate the performance of the method applying it to synthetic data sets of increasing complexity, and to the first-year SNLS data. In particular, we show that the method is capable of reproducing a hypothetical expansion function containing a sudden transition.
