The relatively nearby (distance=24.1 Mpc) elliptical galaxy NGC821 hosts an extreme example of a quiescent central massive black hole, for which deep Chandra observations revealed a nuclear source for the first time (with L(2-10 keV)/L_Edd ~ 3.6X10^{-8}). We present here a multiwavelength study of this nucleus, including VLA observations that detect a radio counterpart to the Chandra nuclear source at 1.4 GHz, with a flux density of 127 $\mu$m and possibly a flat spectral shape; we also consider new Spitzer IRAC observations and archival HST images. With these data we discuss possible scenarios for the accretion modalities of the sole material that is available for fuelling, i.e., the stellar mass losses steadily replenishing the circumnuclear region. The final stages of accretion could be radiatively inefficient and coupled to a compact nuclear jet/outfow. The stellar mass losses could instead end up in a standard disc only if a Compton-thick AGN is present. Two extended sources detected by Chandra close to the nucleus could be due to several unresolved knots in a jet. If a jet is present, though, its kinetic energy would be only a very small fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of the material being accreted. Starformation close to the nucleus is not shown by the available data. Deeper NICMOS, radio and far-IR observations should further constrain the accretion process.
