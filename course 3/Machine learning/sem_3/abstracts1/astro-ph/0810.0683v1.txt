This is a report on the findings of the Galactic compact objects working group for the white paper on the status and future of TeV gamma-ray astronomy. The white paper is an APS commissioned document, and the full version has also been released and can be found on astro-ph. This section of the white paper discusses the potential of future ground-based gamma-ray experiments to advance our understanding of the physics of Galactic compact objects including pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, and X-ray binaries.
