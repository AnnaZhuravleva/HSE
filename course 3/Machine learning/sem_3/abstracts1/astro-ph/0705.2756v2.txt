The motion of a black hole about the centre of gravity of its host galaxy induces a strong response from the surrounding stellar population. We treat the case of a harmonic potential analytically and show that half of the stars on circular orbits in that potential shift to an orbit of lower energy, while the other half receive a positive boost and recede to a larger radius. The black hole itself remains on an orbit of fixed amplitude and merely acts as a catalyst for the evolution of the stellar energy distribution function f(E). We show that this effect is operative out to a radius of approx 3 to 4 times the hole's influence radius, R_bh. We use numerical integration to explore more fully the response of a stellar distribution to black hole motion. We consider orbits in a logarithmic potential and compare the response of stars on circular orbits, to the situation of a `warm' and `hot' (isotropic) stellar velocity field. While features seen in density maps are now wiped out, the kinematic signature of black hole motion still imprints the stellar line-of-sight mean velocity to a magnitude ~18% the local root mean-square velocity dispersion sigma.
