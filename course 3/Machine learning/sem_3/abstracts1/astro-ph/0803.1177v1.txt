We discuss selection of QSO candidates from the combined SDSS and GALEX catalogues. We discuss properties of QSOs within the combined sample, and note uncertainties in number counts and completeness, compared with other SDSS-based samples. We discuss colour and other properties with redshift within the sample and the SEDs for subsets. We estimate the numbers of faint QSOs that are classified as extended objects in the SDSS, and consequent uncertainties that follow.
