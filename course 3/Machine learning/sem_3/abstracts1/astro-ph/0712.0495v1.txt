In the "fireshell" model we define a "canonical GRB" light curve with two sharply different components: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted when the optically thick fireshell of electron-positron plasma originating the phenomenon reaches transparency, and the afterglow, emitted due to the collision between the remaining optically thin fireshell and the CircumBurst Medium (CBM). We outline our "canonical GRB" scenario, originating from the gravitational collapse to a black hole, with a special emphasis on the discrimination between "genuine" and "fake" short GRBs.
