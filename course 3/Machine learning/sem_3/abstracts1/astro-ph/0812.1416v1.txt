We present the result of near-infrared and optical observations of the BL Lac object S5 0716$ + $714 carried out by the KANATA telescope. S5 0716$ + $714 has both a long term high-amplitude variability and a short-term variability within a night. The shortest variability (microvariability) time-scale is important for understanding the geometry of jets and magnetic field, because it provides a possible minimum size of variation sources. Here, we report the detection of 15-min variability in S5 0716$ + $714, which is one of the shortest time-scales in optical and near-infrared variations observed in blazars. The detected microvariation had an amplitude of $0.061{\pm}0.005$ mag in $V$ band and a blue color of $\Delta(V-J)=-0.025{\pm}0.011$. Furthermore, we successfully detected an unprecedented, short time-scale polarimetric variation which correlated with the brightness change. We revealed that the microvariation had a specific polarization component. The polarization degree of the variation component was higher than that of the total flux. These results suggest that the microvariability originated from a small and local region where the magnetic field is aligned.
