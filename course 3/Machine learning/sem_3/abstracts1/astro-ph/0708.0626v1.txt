The nature of the synchrotron superbubble in the IC 10 galaxy is discussed using the results of our investigation of its ionized gas structure, kinematics, and emission spectrum from observations made with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and based on our analysis of the radio emission of the region. The hypernova explosion is shown to be a more plausible mechanism of the formation of the synchrotron superbubble compared with the earlier proposed model of multiple supernova explosions. A compact remnant of this hypernova may be identified with the well known X-ray binary X-1 -- an accreting black hole.
