The pointing directions of extensive air showers observed at the Pierre Auger Observatory were fitted within 3.1 degree with positions of the nearby active galactic nuclei from the Veron-Cetty and P. Veron catalog. The cosmic ray luminosity of the active galactic nuclei which happened to be a source of the particular cosmic ray event constitutes a fraction ~0.0001 of the optical one if only cosmic ray particles with energies above 60 EeV are produced. If produced cosmic ray particles have a spectrum dE/E^3 up to ~100 GeV then the cosmic ray luminosity would be much higher than the optical one of the active galactic nuclei.
