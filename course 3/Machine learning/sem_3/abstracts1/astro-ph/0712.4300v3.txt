Since Witten's seminal 1984 paper on the subject, searches for evidence of strange quark nuggets (SQNs) have proven unsuccessful. In the absence of experimental evidence ruling out SQNs, the validity of theories introducing mechanisms that increase their stability should continue to be tested. To stimulate electromagnetic SQN searches, particularly space searches, we estimate the net charge that would develop on an SQN in space exposed to various radiation baths (and showers) capable of liberating their less strongly bound electrons, taking into account recombination with ambient electrons. We consider, in particular, the cosmic background radiation, radiation from the sun, and diffuse galactic and extragalactic $\gamma $-ray backgrounds. A possible dramatic signal of SQNs in explosive astrophysical events is noted.
