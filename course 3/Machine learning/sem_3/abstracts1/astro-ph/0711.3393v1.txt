We investigate when the energy that pins a superfluid vortex to the lattice of nuclei in the inner crust of neutron stars can be approximated by the energy that binds the vortex to a single nucleus. Indeed, although the pinning energy is the quantity relevant to the theory of pulsar glitches, so far full quantum calculations have been possible only for the binding energy. Physically, the presence of nearby nuclei can be neglected if the lattice is dilute, namely with nuclei sufficiently distant from each other. We find that the dilute limit is reached only for quite large Wigner-Seitz cells, with radii > 55 fm; these are found only in the outermost low-density regions of the inner crust. We conclude that present quantum calculations do not correspond to the pinning energies in almost the entire inner crust and thus their results are not predictive for the theory of glitches.
