We review the literature concerning how the cosmic magnetic fields pervading nearly all galaxies actually got started. some observational evidence involves the chemical abundance of the light elements Be and B, while another one is based on strong magnetic fields seen in high red shift galaxies. Seed fields, whose strength is of order 10^{-20} gauss, easily sprung up in the era preceding galaxy formation. Several mechanisms are proposed to amplify these seed fields to microgauss strengths. The standard mechanism is the Alpha-Omega dynamo theory. It has a major difficulty that makes unlikely to provide the sole origin. The difficulty is rooted in the fact that the total flux is constant. This implies that flux must be removed from the galactic discs. This requires that the field and flux be separated, for otherwise interstellar mass must be removed from the deep galactic gravitational and then their strength increased by the alpha omega theory.
