We report {\it Hubble Space Telescope} imaging obtained 155 days and 449 days after the 2006 outburst of RS Ophiuchi. Both epochs show evidence of extended emission, consistent with that seen in earlier radio observations, and a maximum expansion rate of $3200\pm300$ km s$^{-1}$ (in the plane of the sky). The extended structure is consistent with the remnant having a bipolar morphology with an inclination similar to that determined for the binary.
