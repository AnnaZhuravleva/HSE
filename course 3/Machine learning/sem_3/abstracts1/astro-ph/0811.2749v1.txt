We have investigated the effects of uniform rotation and a specific model for differential rotation on the pulsation frequencies of 10 \Msun\ stellar models. Uniform rotation decreases the frequencies for all modes. Differential rotation does not appear to have a significant effect on the frequencies, except for the most extreme differentially rotating models. In all cases, the large and small separations show the effects of rotation at lower velocities than do the individual frequencies. Unfortunately, to a certain extent, differential rotation mimics the effects o f more rapid rotation, and only the presence of some specific observed frequencies with well identified modes will be able to uniquely constrain the internal rotation of pulsating stars.
