The non-thermal 3.6 cm radio continuum emission from the naked T Tauri stars Hubble 4 and HDE 283572 in Taurus has been observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 6 epochs between September 2004 and December 2005 with a typical separation between successive observations of 3 months. Thanks to the remarkably accurate astrometry delivered by the VLBA, the trajectory described by both stars on the plane of the sky could be traced very precisely, and modeled as the superposition of their trigonometric parallax and uniform proper motion. The best fits yield distances to Hubble 4 and HDE 283572 of 132.8 +/- 0.5 and 128.5 +/- 0.6 pc, respectively. Combining these results with the other two existing VLBI distance determinations in Taurus, we estimate the mean distance to the Taurus association to be 137 pc with a dispersion (most probably reflecting the depth of the complex) of about 20 pc.
