The IceCube Observatory is a km^3 neutrino telescope currently under construction at the geographic South Pole. It will comprise 4800 optical sensors deployed on 80 vertical strings between 1450 and 2450 meters under the ice surface. Currently IceCube is operational and recording data with 40 strings (i.e. 2400 optical sensors). The IceCube Observatory will collect an unprecedented number of high energy neutrinos that will allow us to pursue studies of the atmospheric neutrino flux, and to search for extraterrestrial sources of neutrinos, whether point-like or unresolved. IceCube results will have an important impact on neutrino astrophysics, especially if combined with observations done with other cosmic messengers, such as gamma rays or ultra high energy cosmic rays. They may also reveal clues on the origin of cosmic rays at ultra high energies. Here we report results from AMANDA and the most recent results from the first 22 strings of IceCube.
