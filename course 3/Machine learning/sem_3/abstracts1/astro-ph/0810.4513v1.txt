AMANDA is a first-generation high energy neutrino telescope, which has taken data at the South Pole in its final configuration since 2000. Results from seven years of operation are presented here, including observation of the atmopheric neutrino flux and searches for astrophysical neutrinos from cosmic ray accelerators, gamma ray bursts, and dark matter annihilations. In 2007, AMANDA was incorporated into the IceCube neutrino telescope, where its higher density of instrumentation improves the low energy response. In the near future, AMANDA will be replaced by the IceCube Deep Core, a purpose-built low energy extension of IceCube.
