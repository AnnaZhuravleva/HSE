We review the history and structure of star formation in the Taurus-Auriga dark clouds. Our discussion includes a summary of the macroscopic cloud properties, the population of single and binary pre-main sequence stars, the properties of jets and outflows, and detailed summaries of selected individual objects. We include comprehensive tables of dark clouds, young stars, and jets in the clouds.
