We consider gravitational wave production due to parametric resonance at the end of inflation, or ``preheating''. This leads to large inhomogeneities which source a stochastic background of gravitational waves at scales inside the comoving Hubble horizon at the end of inflation. We confirm that the present amplitude of these gravitational waves need not depend on the inflationary energy scale. We analyze an explicit model where the inflationary energy scale is ~10^9 GeV, yielding a signal close to the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and BBO. This signal highlights the possibility of a new observational ``window'' into inflationary physics, and provides significant motivation for searches for stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves in the Hz to GHz range, with an amplitude on the order of \Omega_{gw}(k)h^2 ~ 10^-11. Finally, the strategy used in our numerical computations is applicable to the gravitational waves generated by many inhomogeneous processes in the early universe.
