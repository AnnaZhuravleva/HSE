Quillen et al.(2007) presented an imaging survey with the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} of 62 brightest cluster galaxies with optical line emission located in the cores of X-ray luminous clusters. They found that at least half of these sources have signs of excess infrared emission. Here we discuss the nature of the IR emission and its implications for cool core clusters. The strength of the mid-IR excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the optical emission lines. Excluding the four systems dominated by an AGN, the excess mid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likely related to star formation. The mass of molecular gas (estimated from CO observations) is correlated with the IR luminosity as found for normal star forming galaxies. The gas depletion time scale is about 1 Gyr. The physical extent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emission line nebulae. This supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs in molecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence that the emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. We find a correlation between mass deposition rates (${\dot M}_X$) estimated from the X-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infrared luminosity. The star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass deposition rates suggesting that the re-heating of the ICM is generally very effective in reducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating it completely.
