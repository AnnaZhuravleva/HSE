Four mosaics of deep, continuum-subtracted, CCD images have been obtained over the extensive galactic radio continuum shell, W 50, which surrounds the remarkable stellar system SS 433. Two of these mosaics in the Halpha+[N II] and [O III] 5007 A emission lines respectively cover a field of ~2.3 x 2.5 degr^2 which contains all of W 50 but at a low angular resolution of 5 arcsec. The third and fourth mosaics cover the eastern (in [O III] 5007 A) and western (in Halpha+[N II]) filamentary nebulosity respectively but at an angular resolution of 1 arcsec. These observations are supplemented by new low dispersion spectra and longslit, spatially resolved echelle spectra. The [O III] 5007 A images show for the first time the distribution of this emission in both the eastern and western filaments while new Halpha+[N II] emission features are also found in both of these regions. Approaching flows of faintly emitting material from the bright eastern filaments of up 100 km/s in radial velocity are detected. The present observations also suggest that the heliocentric systemic radial velocity of the whole system is 56+-2 km/s. Furthermore, very deep imagery and high resolution spectroscopy of a small part of the northern radio ridge of W 50 has revealed for the first time the very faint optical nebulosity associated with this edge. It is suggested that patchy foreground dust along the ~5 kpc sightline is inhibiting the detection of all of the optical nebulosity associated with W 50. The interaction of the microquasar jets of SS 433 with the W 50 shell is discussed.
