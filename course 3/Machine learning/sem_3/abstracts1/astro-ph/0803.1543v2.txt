The orbit and physical parameters of the previously unsolved SB2 EB V570 Per are derived using high resolution Asiago Echelle spectroscopy and B, V photo-electric photometry. The metallicity from chi^2 analysis is [M/H]=+0.02 +/- 0.03, and reddening from interstellar NaI and KI absorption lines is E(B-V) =0.023 +/- 0.007. The two components have masses of 1.449 +/- 0.006 and 1.350 +/- 0.006 Msun and spectral types F3 and F5, respectively. They are both still within the Main Sequence band (T_1 =6842 +/- 25 K, T_2 =6562 +/- 25 K from chi^2 analysis, R_1 =1.523 +/- 0.030, R_2 =1.388 +/- 0.019 Rsun) and are dynamically relaxed to co-rotation with the orbital motion (Vrot sin i_{1,2} =40 and 36 (+/-1) km/sec). The distance to V570 Per obtained from the orbital solution is 123 +/- 2 pc, in excellent agreement with the revised Hipparcos distance of 123 +/- 11 pc. The observed properties of V570 Per components are compared to BaSTI models computed on purpose for exactly the observed masses and varied chemical compositions. This system is interesting since both components have their masses in the range where the efficiency of convective core overshooting has to decrease with the total mass as a consequence of the decreasing size of the convective core during the central H-burning stage. Our numerical simulations show that, a small but not null overshooting is required, with efficiencies lambda_{OV} =0.14 and 0.11 for the 1.449 and 1.350 Msun components, respectively. This confirms the finding of Paper II on the similar system V505 Per. At the approx 0.8 Gyr age of the system, the element diffusion has reduced the surface metallicity of the models from the initial [M/H]=+0.17 to [M/H]=+0.02, in perfect agreement with the spectroscopically derived [M/H]=+0.02 +/- 0.03 value.
