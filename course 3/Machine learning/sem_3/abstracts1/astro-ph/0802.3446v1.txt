Jets from X-ray binaries are continuously injecting matter and energy into the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). However, there exist to date relatively few cases where jet-ISM interactions have been directly observed. We review the current examples, and go on to present new data on the proposed hotspots of GRS1915+105, finding no concrete evidence for any association between the hotspots and the central source, in agreement with previous findings in the literature. We also present preliminary results on radio and H-alpha searches for jet-ISM interactions around known X-ray binaries, and discuss strategies for future searches.
