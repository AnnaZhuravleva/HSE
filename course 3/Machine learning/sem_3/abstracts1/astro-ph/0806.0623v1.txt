We study a model where two scalar fields, that are subdominant during inflation, decay into radiation some time after inflation has ended but before primordial nucleosynthesis. Perturbations of these two curvaton fields can be responsible for the primordial curvature perturbation. We write down the full non-linear equations that relate the primordial perturbation to the curvaton perturbations on large scales, and solve them in a sudden-decay approximation. We calculate the power spectrum of the primordial perturbation, and finally go to second order to find the non-linearity parameter, fNL.   Not surprisingly, we find large positive values of fNL if the energy densities of the curvatons are sub-dominant when they decay, as in the single curvaton case. But we also find a novel effect, which can be present only in multi-curvaton models: fNL becomes large even if the curvatons dominate the total energy density in the case when the inhomogeneous radiation produced by the first curvaton decay is diluted by the decay of a second nearly homogeneous curvaton. The minimum value min(fNL)=-5/4 which we find is the same as in the single-curvaton case.   Using (non-)Gaussianity observations, Planck can be able to distinguish between single-field inflation and curvaton model. Hence it is important to derive theoretical predictions for curvaton model. From particle physics point of view it is more natural to assume multiple scalar fields (rather than just one ``curvaton'' in addition to inflaton). Our work updates the theoretical predictions of curvaton model to this case.
