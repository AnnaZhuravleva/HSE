The high mass loss rates of stars in their asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage of evolution is one of the most important pathways for mass return from stars to the ISM. In the planetary nebulae (PNe) phase, the ejected material is illuminated and can be altered by the UV radiation from the central star. PNe therefore play a significant role in the ISM recycling process and in changing the environment around them. We show some highlights of the results of observations that have been carried out using the Spitzer instruments to study the gas and dust emission from PNe in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. Spitzer is especially sensitive to the cool dust and molecules in the PNe shell and halos. We present new results from our program on Galactic PNe, including IRAC and IRS observations of NGC 6720 in the ring and halo of that nebula.
