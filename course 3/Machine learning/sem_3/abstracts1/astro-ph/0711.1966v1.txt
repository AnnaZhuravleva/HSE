Photometric analysis of $BVR_C$ light curves of newly discovered eclipsing binary GSC 0008-00901 is presented. The orbital period is improved to 0.28948(11) days. Photometric parameters are determined, as well. The analysis yielded to conclusion that system is an over-contact binary of W UMa type with components not in thermal contact. The light curves from 2005 show the presence of a spot on the surface of one of the components, while light curves from 2006 are not affected by maculation.
