The observed distribution of periods and mass ratios of Algols with a B type primary at birth was updated. Conservative evolution fails to produce the large fraction with a high mass ratio: i.e. q in [0.4-0.6]. Interacting binaries thus have to lose mass before or during Algolism. During RLOF mass is transferred continuously from donor to gainer. The gainer spins up; sometimes up to critical velocity. Equatorial material on the gainer is therefore less bound to the system. The material coming from the donor through the first Langrangian point impinges violently on the surface of the gainer or the edge of the accretion disc, creating a hot spot in the area of impact. The sum of rotational energy (fast rotation) and radiative energy (hot spot) depends on the mass-loss rate. The sum of both energies on a test mass located in the impact area equals exactly its binding energy at some critical value. As long as the mass transfer rate is smaller than this value the gainer accepts all the mass coming from the donor: RLOF happens conservatively. But as soon as the critical rate is exceeded the gainer will acquire no more than the critical value and RLOF runs into its liberal era. Low mass binaries never achieve mass-loss rates larger than the critical value. Intermediate mass binaries evolve mainly conservatively but mass will be blown away from the system during the short era of rapid mass transfer soon after RLOF-ignition. Binaries with 9+5.4 solar masses (P in [2-4] d) evolve almost always conservatively. Only during some 20,000 years the gainer is not capable of grasping all the material that comes from the donor. During this short lapse of time a significant fraction of the mass of the system is blown into interstellar space. The mass ratio bin [0.4-0.6] is now much better represented.
