We present radio observations of the optically bright Type IIn supernova SN 1995N. We observed the SN at radio wavelengths with the Very Large Array (VLA) for 11 years. We also observed it at low radio frequencies with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at various epochs within $6.5-10$ years since explosion. Although there are indications of an early optically thick phase, most of the data are in the optically thin regime so it is difficult to distinguish between synchrotron self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) mechanisms. However, the information from other wavelengths indicates that the FFA is the dominant absorption process. Model fits of radio emission with the FFA give reasonable physical parameters. Making use of X-ray and optical observations, we derive the physical conditions of the shocked ejecta and the shocked CSM.
