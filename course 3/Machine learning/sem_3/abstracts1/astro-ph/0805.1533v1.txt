We present interferometric observations with resolution of ~3 arcsecs of the isolated, low-mass protostellar double cores CG30 and BHR71 in the N2$H+(1-0) line and at 3mm dust continuum, using the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The results are complemented by infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. In CG30, the 3mm dust continuum images resolve two compact sources with a separation of ~21.7 arcsecs (~8700 AU). In BHR71, strong dust continuum emission is detected at the position of the mid-infrared source IRS1, while only weak emission is detected from the secondary mid-infrared source IRS2. Assuming optically thin 3mm dust continuum emission, we derive hydrogen gas masses of 0.05--2.1 $M_\odot$ for the four sub-cores. N2H+(1-0) line emission is detected in both CG30 and BHR71, and is spatially associated with the thermal dust continuum emission. We derive the velocity fields and find symmetric velocity gradients in both sources. Assuming that these gradients are due to core rotation, we estimate the specific angular momenta and ratios of rotational energy to gravitational energy for all cores. We also find that the N2H+ emission is strongly affected by the outflows, both in terms of entrainment and molecule destruction. $Spitzer$ images show the mid-infrared emission from all four sub-cores. All four sources appear to drive their own outflows. Based on the ATCA and $Spitzer$ observations, we construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and derive temperatures and luminosities for all cores. Based on the morphology and velocity structure, we suggest that the sub-cores in CG30 were formed by initial fragmentation of a filamentary prestellar core, while those in BHR71 could originate from rotational fragmentation of a single collapsing protostellar core.
