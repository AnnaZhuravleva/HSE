Observing Delta Scuti stars is most important as their multi-frequency spectrum of radial pulsations provide strong constraints on the physics of the stars interior; so any new detection and observation of these stars is a valuable contribution to asteroseismology. While performing uvby-beta photoelectric photometry of some RR Lyrae stars acquired in 2005 at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional, Mexico, we also observed several standard stars, HD115520 among them. After the reduction this star showed indications of variability. In view of this, a new observing run was carried out in 2006 during which we were able to demonstrate its variability and its nature as a Delta Scuti star. New observations in 2007 permitted us to determine its periodic content with more accuracy. This, along with the uvby-beta photoelectric photometry allowed us to deduce its physical characteristics and pulsational modes.
