(abridged) The Pierre Auger Collaboration has reported 27 Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs) with energies above 56 EeV and well determined arrival directions as of 2007 August 31. They find that the arrival directions are not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby AGNs. Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their arrival directions with more comprehensive source catalogs.   Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy >56EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory have arrival directions within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of the extended (>180kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BLLac with extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six) of all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of a UHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower exposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a subset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9% level. This is the first direct observational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. For the remaining ~20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high significance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27 UHECRs and AGNs in the Veron-Cetty & Veron catalog at D < 71Mpc has a much lower significance when one considers only the ~20 UHECRs not `matched' to nearby extended radiogalaxies. No correlation is seen between UHECRs and supernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters of galaxies. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre Auger Observatory and previous experiments may thus be that the Southern Hemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby extended radiogalaxies.
