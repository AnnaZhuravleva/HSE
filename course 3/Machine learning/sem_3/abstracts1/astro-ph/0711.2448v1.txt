A standard disk around an accreting black hole may become effectively optically-thin and scattering dominated in the inner region, for high accretion rates (as already predicted by the Shakura-Sunyaev model). Radiative emission from that region is less efficient than blackbody emission, leading to an increase of the colour temperature in the inner region, by an order of magnitude above the effective temperature. We show that the integrated spectrum has a power-law-like shape in the ~ 1-5 keV band, with a soft excess at lower energies and a downward curvature or break at higher energies, in agreement with the observed spectra of many ultraluminous X-ray sources.
