Strong magnetization makes the disks surrounding young stellar objects rotate at rates that are too sub-Keplerian to enable the thermal launching of disk winds from their surfaces unless the rate of gas diffusion across field lines is dynamically fast. This under-appreciated implication of disk magnetization poses a considerable challenge for disk-wind theory.
