We study systematically which features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) probe various inhomogeneous properties of the dark sectors (including neutrinos, dark matter, and dark energy). We stress, and quantify by simple formulas, that the primary CMB anisotropies are very susceptible to the gravitational potentials during horizon entry, less at recombination. The CMB thus allows us to scan \Phi+\Psi and the underlying dark kinetics for all redshifts z~1-10^5. LSS, on the other hand, responds strongest to \Phi at low redshifts. Dark perturbations are often parameterized by the anisotropic stress and effective sound speed (stiffness). We find that the dark anisotropic stress and stiffness influence the visible species at the correspondingly early and late stages of horizon entry, and affect stronger respectively the CMB and LSS. The CMB yet remains essential to probing the stiff perturbations of light neutrinos and dark energy, detectable only during horizon entry. The clustering of dark species and large propagation speed of their inhomogeneities also map to distinctive features in the CMB and LSS. -Any parameterization of the signatures of dark kinetics that assumes general relativity can effectively accommodate any modified gravity (MG) that retains the equivalence principle for the visible sectors. This implies that formally the nonstandard structure growth or \Phi/\Psi ratio, while indicative, are not definitive MG signatures. The definitive signatures of MG may include the strong dependence of the apparent dark dynamics on visible species, its superluminality, and the nonstandard phenomenology of gravitational waves.
