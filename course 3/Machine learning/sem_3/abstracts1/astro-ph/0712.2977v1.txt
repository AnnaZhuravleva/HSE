Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations are accumulating evidence for massive, high velocity outflows in Seyfert galaxies and quasars, most likely originating very close to the central supermassive black hole. These results are offering new potential to probe the launching regions of relativistic jets/outflows, and to quantify their feedback impact on the host galaxy and/or cluster of galaxies. The most important signature of these phenomena is the detection of blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized iron at energies usually greater than ~7 keV. The lack of sensitivity of present day X-ray observatories at these energies gives rise to bias against the detection of more ``extreme'' outflows, with highest velocity and ionization, which would be blueshifted at energies >10 keV. Thus, simulations with Simbol-X were carried out to test its capability of detecting absorption lines/edges between 5-20 keV, in order to probe the dynamics (i.e. measurement of velocity variations) of the absorbing gas, as well as the highest (up to relativistic speeds) velocity and ionization components. We found that the unprecedented sensitivity of Simbol-X between 5-30 keV is a great opportunity to obtain important improvements in this research field.
