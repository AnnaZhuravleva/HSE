We calculate the rate of in-fall of stellar matter on an accretion disk during the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star, and estimate the luminosity of the relativistic jet that results from accretion on to the central black hole. We find that the jet luminosity remains high for about 100 seconds, at a level comparable to the typical luminosity observed in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The luminosity then decreases rapidly with time for about 10^3 seconds, roughly as ~ t^-3; the duration depends on the size and rotation speed of the stellar core. The rapid decrease of the jet power explains the steeply declining X-ray flux observed at the end of most long duration GRBs. A X-ray plateau is also produced by continued fall-back of matter -- either from an extended stellar envelope or from material that failed to escape with the supernova ejecta. In a few GRBs, the X-ray light curve is observed to drop suddenly at the end of the plateau phase, while in others the decline is ~ t^-1 - t ^-2. These features arise naturally in the accretion model depending on the radius and mean specific angular momentum of the stellar envelope. The accretion model thus provides a coherent explanation for the diverse and puzzling features observed in the early X-ray light curves of GRBs. (Abridged)
