We show that at wavelengths comparable to the length of the shower produced by an Ultra-High Energy cosmic ray or neutrino, radio signals are an extremely efficient way to detect these particles. First results are presented of an analysis of 20 hours of observation data for NuMoon project using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to search for short radio pulses from the Moon. A limit on the neutrino flux is set that is a factor four better than the current one (based on FORTE).
