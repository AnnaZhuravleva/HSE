In this paper, we use the Type Ia supernova data as well as the CMB and LSS data to constrain the agegraphic dark energy model recently proposed by Cai. Due to its peculiar nature, the parameter $n$ of this model cannot be well constrained by the SNIa data, while the other parameter $\Omega_{m0}$ can be constrained to be $0.34\pm0.04$. When combined with CMB and LSS data, the range of $1\sigma$ confidence level for $n$ is greatly narrowed, albeit still very large. The best fit result is $\Omega_{m0}=0.28\pm0.02$, which is consistent with most observations like WMAP and SDSS, and $n=3.4$, of which a meaningful range of confidence level can not be obtained due to the fact that the contours are not closed. Despite of this result, we conclude that for $n>1$ this model is consistent with SNIa, CMB and LSS observations. Furthermore, the fitting results indicate a generalized definition for the agegraphic dark energy.
