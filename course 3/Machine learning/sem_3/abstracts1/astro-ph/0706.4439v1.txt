MAGIC currently is the largest imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescope world-wide. Since 2004, gamma-ray emission from several active galactic nuclei in the GeV/TeV energy range has been detected, some of which were newly discovered as very-high energy gamma-ray sources. The gamma-rays are assumed to originate from particle acceleration processes in the AGN jets. We give an overview of the AGN observed and detected by MAGIC, discuss spectral and temporal properties of these and show physics implications of some selected observations.
