Although the giant radiogalaxy M 87 harbors many distinct regions of broad-band nonthermal emission, the recently reported fast variability of TeV gamma rays from M 87 on a timescale of days strongly constrains the range of speculations concerning the possible sites and scenarios of particle acceleration responsible for the observed TeV emission. A natural production site of this radiation is the immediate vicinity of the central supermassive mass black hole (BH). Because of the low bolometric luminosity, the nucleus of M 87 is effectively transparent for gamma rays up to energy of 10 TeV, which makes this source an ideal laboratory for study of particle acceleration processes close to the BH event horizon. We critically analyse different possible radiation mechanisms in this region, and argue that the observed very high-energy gamma ray emission can be explained by the inverse Compton emission of ultrarelativistic electron-positron pairs produced through the development of an electromagnetic cascade in the BH magnetosphere. We demonstrate, through detailed numerical calculations of acceleration and radiation of electrons in the magnetospheric vacuum gap, that this ``pulsar magnetosphere like'' scenario can satisfactorily explain the main properties of TeV gamma-ray emission of M 87.
