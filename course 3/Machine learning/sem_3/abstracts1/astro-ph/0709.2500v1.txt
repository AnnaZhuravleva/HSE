While the completion of the Pierre Auger Observatory (or simply ``Auger'') is still underway, the 5165 km^2.sr.yr integrated acceptance accumulated since the January 1st, 2004 is now significantly larger than what was gathered by the previous experiments dedicated to the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We report on the development status of Auger and present some results related to the cosmic-ray energy spectrum, composition and anisotropies, and the photon fraction at ultra-high energy. We briefly discuss the importance of the ankle region to understand the overall phenomenology of cosmic-rays, and mention future enhancements of Auger focusing on this energy range.
