We consider Vela Jr. as being the old Supernova Remnant (SNR) at the beginning of the transition from adiabatic to radiative stage of evolution. According to our model, Vela Jr. is situated outside Vela SNR at the distance of 600 pc and its age is 17500 yr. We model the high energy fluxes from Vela Jr. and its broadband spectrum. We find our results compatible with experimental data in radio waves, X- and gamma-rays. Our hydrodynamical model of Vela Jr. explains the observed TeV gamma-ray flux by hadronic mechanism. The proposed model does not contradict to the low density environment of the SNR and does not need extreme fraction of the explosion energy to be transferred to Cosmic Rays.
