We discuss the latest constraints on a Taylor-expanded scalar inflaton potential, obtained focusing on its observable part only. This is in contrast with other works in which an extrapolation of the potential is applied using the slow-roll hierarchy. We find significant differences. The results discussed here apply to a broader range of models, since no assumption about the invisible e-folds of inflation has to be made, thereby remaining conservative.
