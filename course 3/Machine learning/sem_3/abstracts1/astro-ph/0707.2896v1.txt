We present the GALEX far FUV and near NUV ultraviolet imaging of three nearby shell galaxies, namely NGC 2865, NGC 5018 and NGC 7135. The system of shells and fine structures visible in the optical is detected in the NUV image of NGC 2865 and in both NUV and FUV images of NGC 7135. The NUV image of NGC 5018 does not present shell structures. We detect absorption features in the nuclear region of all three galaxies. NGC 2865 has a nearly flat colour profile with (FUV-NUV)~2 throughout the whole galaxy. NGC 7135 is blue in the center (FUV-NUV)~0 and as red as (FUV-NUV)~1.5 in the outskirts, including the faint shell-like feature. We investigate the ability of the nuclear GALEX (FUV-NUV) colour to provide information about rejuvenation phenomena in the stellar populations of the shell galaxies. To this aim, we derive from theory the relationship between the Mg2, Hbeta, HgammaA, HdeltaA Lick line-strength indices and the (FUV-NUV) colour. We extend the study to a sample of early-type galaxies with emission lines in their optical spectra (Annibali et al. 2007). In the index vs.(FUV-NUV) colour diagrams, most of the galaxies are well explained by passively evolving SSPs. On the average, ages and metallicities of the galaxies in our sample estimated from optical line-strength indices are consistent with those inferred from the (FUV-NUV) colour. In general, all the colours but for (FUV-NUV) and (FUV-V), become nearly age insensitive when 1-2 Gyr have elapsed from the last star forming event. Considering composite stellar population models with a recent burst of star formation, we suggest that the position of the NGC 7135 and NGC 2865 nuclei in the (FUV-NUV)-Hbeta plane could be explained in term of a recent rejuvenation episode.
