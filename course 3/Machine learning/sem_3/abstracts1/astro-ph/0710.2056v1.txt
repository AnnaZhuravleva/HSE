Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are a new class of neutron stars discovered through the emission of radio bursts. Eleven sources are known up to now, but population studies predict these objects to be more numerous than the normal radio pulsar population. Multiwavelength observations of these peculiar objects are in progress to disentangle their spectral energy distribution, and then study in detail their nature. In this review I report on the current state of the art on these objects, and in particular on the results of new X-ray observations.
