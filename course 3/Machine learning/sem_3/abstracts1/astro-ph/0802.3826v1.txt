We present numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and emission simulations aimed to study the role played by the magnetic field in the dynamics and emission of relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei. We focus our analysis on the study of the emission from recollimation shocks since they may provide an interpretation for the stationary components seen at parsec-scales in multiple sources. We show that the relative brightness of the knots associated with the recollimation shocks decreases with increasing jet magnetization, suggesting that jets presenting stationary components may have a relatively weak magnetization, with magnetic fields of the order of equipartition or below.
