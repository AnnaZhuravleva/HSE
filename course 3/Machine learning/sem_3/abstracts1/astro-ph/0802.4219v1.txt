VLBI is the only technology that will allow sub-milliarcsecond resolution imaging in the near future. As such, it is the only way to image expanding supernovae in nearby galaxies. Such images potentially allow us to study the early evolution of neutron stars or black holes left behind by core-collapse supernovae, the circumstellar wind history of the supernova progenitor stars, the shock acceleration of cosmic-ray particles in supernovae as well as the evolutionary process by which supernova shells merge into, and enrich, the ISM. I will discuss the results of the on-going VLBI imaging campaigns on supernovae 1986J and 1993J. I will also discuss the impact on supernova VLBI of the proposed South-African Karoo Array Telescope and Australian ASKAP arrays, as well as the SKA itself, as these telescopes will greatly increase the sensitivity of the global VLBI network.
