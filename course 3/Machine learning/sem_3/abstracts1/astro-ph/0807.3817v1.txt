We have measured the projected rotational velocities (vsini) in a number of symbiotic stars and M giants using high resolution spectroscopic observations. On the basis of our measurements and data from the literature, we compare the rotation of mass-donors in symbiotics with vsini of field giants and find that:   (1) the K giants in S-type symbiotics rotate at vsini>4.5 km/s, which is 2-4 times faster than the field K giants;   (2) the M giants in S-type symbiotics rotate on average 1.5 times faster than the field M giants. Statistical tests show that these differences are highly significant: p-value < 0.001 in the spectral type bins K2III-K5III, M0III-M6III, and M2III-M5III;   (3) our new observations of D'-type symbiotics also confirm that they are fast rotators.   As a result of the rapid rotation, the cool giants in symbiotics should have 3-30 times larger mass loss rates. Our results suggest also that bipolar ejections in symbiotics seem to happen in objects where the mass donors rotate faster than the orbital period.
