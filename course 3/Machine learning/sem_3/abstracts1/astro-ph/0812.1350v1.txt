Intermittent accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars are an exciting new type of sources. Their pulsations appear and disappear either on timescales of hundreds of seconds or on timescales of days. The study of these sources add new observational constraints to present models that explain the presence or not of pulsations in neutron star LMXBs. In this paper we present preliminary results on spectral and aperiodic variability studies of all intermittent AMSPs, with a particular focus on the comparison between pulsating and non pulsating periods.
