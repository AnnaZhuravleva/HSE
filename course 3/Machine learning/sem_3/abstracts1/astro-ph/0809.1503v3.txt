We reconstruct the interaction rate between the dark matter and the holographic dark energy with the parameterized equation of states and the future event horizon as the infrared cut-off length. It is shown that the observational constraints from the 192 SNIa and BAO measurement permit the negative interaction in the wide region. Moreover, the usual phenomenological descriptions can not describe the reconstructed interaction well for many cases. The other possible interaction is also discussed.
