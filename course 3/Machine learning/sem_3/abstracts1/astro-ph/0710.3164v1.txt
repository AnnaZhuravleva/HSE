In the current paradigm, red sequence galaxies are believed to have formed as blue disk galaxies that subsequently had their star formation quenched. Since red-sequence galaxies typically have an early-type morphology, the transition from the blue to the red sequence also involves a morphological transformation. In this paper we study the impact of transformation mechanisms that operate only on satellite galaxies, such as strangulation, ram-pressure stripping and galaxy harassment. Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the SDSS, we compare the colors and concentrations of satellites galaxies to those of central galaxies of the same stellar mass, adopting the hypothesis that the latter are the progenitors of the former. On average, satellites are redder and more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass. Central-satellite pairs that are matched in both stellar mass and color, however, show no average concentration difference, indicating that the transformation mechanisms affect color more than morphology. The color and concentration differences of matched central-satellite pairs are completely independent of the halo mass of the satellite galaxy, indicating that satellite-specific transformation mechanisms are equally efficient in haloes of all masses. This strongly favors strangulation as the main quenching mechanism for satellite galaxies. Finally, we determine the relative importance of satellite quenching for the build-up of the red sequence. We find that roughly 70 percent of red sequence satellite galaxies with a stellar mass of 10^9 Msun had their star formation quenched as satellites. This drops rapidly to zero with increasing stellar mass, indicating that a significant fraction of red satellites were already quenched before they became a satellite.
