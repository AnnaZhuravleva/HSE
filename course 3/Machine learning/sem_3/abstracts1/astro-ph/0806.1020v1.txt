We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient ISM in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of PAHs; a mid-IR continuum characterising the emission from hot grains; and a component of warm grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature. Our model can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using UV, optical and IR observations. We illustrate this by deriving median-likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses, and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star- forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). From this analysis, we conclude that the mid- and far-IR colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret UV, optical and IR spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample. [abridged]
