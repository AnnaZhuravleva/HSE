A comparison of AGN detected at gamma ray energies by EGRET with flat-spectrum radio sources observed in surveys for intraday variability reveals that a remarkably high fraction of EGRET blazars show significant interstellar scintillation at centimetre wavelengths. Scintillating AGN will therefore be targets of interest for GLAST, scheduled for launch in early 2008. We suggest that the variable, scintillating flat-spectrum radio source PMN J1326-5256 is associated with the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1316-5244. We describe the properties of PMN J1326-5256 and present recent results of monitoring with the ATCA and Ceduna radio telescopes.
