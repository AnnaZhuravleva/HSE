Our aim is to search for atmospheric g-mode oscillations in UV network, UV bright points and Uv background regions. We have analysed a 6-hours of time sequence of ultraviolet (uv) images obtained on May 24, 2003 in 1600A continuum under high spatial and temporal resolution from Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). We have selected an isolated 15 uv bright points, 15 uv network elements and 15 uv background regions in a quiet region from the images for the detailed analysis. We derived the cumulative intensity values of these features. The light curves of all the features have been derived for the total duration of observations and done the power spectrum analysis using the time series data. We found that the uv bright points, the uv network and uv background regions will exhibit a longer period of intensity oscillations namely, 5.5 hours, 4.6 hours and 3.4 hours respectively, in addition to the more familiar small scale intensity fluctuations. We suggest that the longer periods of oscillation may be related to solar atmospheric g-modes.
