We discuss prospects for detecting a spectral break in gamma-ray spectra of blazars due to the extragalactic background light (EBL) density falling off between the near and mid-IR. A measurable spectral change in the TeV spectra at 1 TeV could arise from a rapid or slow drop in the EBL density above ~1 micron. This effect is mediated by the ratio of the near to mid-IR density of EBL. A detection of such a spectral feature could become a clear signature of EBL absorption. A non-detection would give a strong observational constraint to the shape of the EBL spectrum. We present calculations estimating the sensitivity of TeV telescopes for detecting such a break for blazar observations at different redshifts.
