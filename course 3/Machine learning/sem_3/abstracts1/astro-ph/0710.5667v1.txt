We present a review of the standard paradigm for giant planet formation, the core accretion theory. After an overview of the basic concepts of this model, results of the original implementation are discussed. Then, recent improvements and extensions, like the inclusion of planetary migration and the resulting effects are discussed. It is shown that these improvement solve the timescale problem. Finally, it is shown that by means of generating synthetic populations of (extrasolar) planets, core accretion models are able to reproduce in a statistically significant way the actually observed planetary population.
