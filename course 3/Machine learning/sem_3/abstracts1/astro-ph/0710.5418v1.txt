By applying recent results for the slab correlation time scale onto cosmic ray scattering theory, we compute cosmic ray parallel mean free paths within the quasilinear limit. By employing these results onto charged particle transport in the solar system, we demonstrate that much larger parallel mean free paths can be obtained in comparison to previous results. A comparison with solar wind observations is also presented to show that the new theoretical results are much closer to the observations than the previous results.
