Cosmic gamma-ray bursts with primary-photon energies > 10 GeV are sought in the data from the Andyrchy array obtained in the mode of detection of a single cosmic-ray component during a net observation period of 2005.4 d. The distribution of fluctuations of the detector counting rate agrees with the expected cosmic-ray background, the only exception being an event with a deviation of 7.9 sigma. Constraints on the number density of evaporating primordial black holes in a local region of the Galaxy are obtained for the chromospheric evaporation models.
