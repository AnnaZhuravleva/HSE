Recently a mechanism was proposed whereby the primordial density perturbations are generated at the end of inflation. We continue the analysis of the proposed model of this mechanism and calculate the maximum extent to which the density perturbations produced via this model can dominate over those of the standard inflationary paradigm. In addition, we provide a straightforward variation of this model which allows for greater amplification of the density perturbations. Finally, we show that a variation in the implementation of the original model results in significant non-gaussianities in the resulting spectrum of density perturbations. The level of non-gaussianities can be made to saturate the current observational bound.
