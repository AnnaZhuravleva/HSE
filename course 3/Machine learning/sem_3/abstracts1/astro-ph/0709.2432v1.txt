The source HESS J1809-193 was discovered in 2006 in data of the Galactic Plane survey, followed by several re-observations. It shows a hard gamma-ray spectrum and the emission is clearly extended. Its vicinity to PSR J1809-1917, a high spin-down luminosity pulsar powerful enough to drive the observed gamma-ray emission, makes it a plausible candidate for a TeV Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN). On the other hand, in this region of the sky a number of faint, radio-emitting supernova remnants can be found, making a firm conclusion on the source type difficult.   Here we present a detailed morphological study of recent H.E.S.S. data and compare the result with X-ray measurements taken with Chandra and radio data. The association with a PWN is likely, but contributions from supernova remnants cannot be ruled out.
