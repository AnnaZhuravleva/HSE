We present color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters for models with self-enrichment and pre-enrichment. The models with self-enrichment turn out to have two or more main sequence turnoff points in the color-magnitude diagram if the fraction of mass lost by the globular cluster under supernova explosions does not exceed 95-97%. The models with pre-enrichment can have only one main sequence turnoff point. We argue that the cluster wCen evolved according to a self-enrichment scenario.
