Bayesian Inference is a powerful approach to data analysis that is based almost entirely on probability theory. In this approach, probabilities model {\it uncertainty} rather than randomness or variability. This thesis is composed of a series of papers that have been published in various astronomical journals during the years 2005-2008. The unifying thread running through the papers is the use of Bayesian Inference to solve underdetermined inverse problems in astrophysics. Firstly, a methodology is developed to solve a question in gravitational lens inversion - using the observed images of gravitational lens systems to reconstruct the undistorted source profile and the mass profile of the lensing galaxy. A similar technique is also applied to the task of inferring the number and frequency of modes of oscillation of a star from the time series observations that are used in the field of asteroseismology. For these complex problems, many of the required calculations cannot be done analytically, and so Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms have been used. Finally, probabilistic reasoning is applied to a controversial question in astrobiology: does the fact that life formed quite soon after the Earth constitute evidence that the formation of life is quite probable, given the right macroscopic conditions?
