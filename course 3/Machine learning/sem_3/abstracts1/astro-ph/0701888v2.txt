The consistence of the distributions of pulsar's kick velocities from the model of GRB and from the pulsar observations is tested based on the supernova-GRB ($\gamma$-ray burst) association and under the assumption that the GRB asymmetric explosions produce pulsars. The deduced distribution of kick velocity from the model of GRB and the observed kick distribution of radio pulsars are checked by K-S test. These two distributions are found to come from a same parent population. This result may indicate that GRBs could be really related to supernova, and that the asymmetry of GRB associated with supernova would cause the kick of pulsars.
