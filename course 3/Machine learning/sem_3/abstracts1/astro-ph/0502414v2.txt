This thesis embraces several aspects of theoretical stellar dynamics in clusters, both analytically and numerically. We try to elucidate the phenomena currently observed in all types of galaxies, including AGNs and quasars, some of the most powerful objects in the universe. The interactions between the stellar system and the central black hole give rise to a lot of interesting phenomena. The scheme we employ enables a study of clean-cut aspects without any noise that particle methods suffer from. We study the most important physical processes that are readily available in the evolution of a spherical cluster, like self-gravity, two-body relaxation etc, the interaction with a central black hole and the role of a mass spectrum. Not only embark we upon this subject, but we set about an analysis on super-massive stars. How these stars could power the quasar activity by star accretion and energy flows is one of the questions that arises. We undertake other questions, such as the uncertain evolution of such an object and its interaction with the surrounding stellar system. This is of crucial importance in astrophysics, for these objects could be regarded as super-massive black holes progenitors.
