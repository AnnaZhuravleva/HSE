We derive the Klein--Gordon equation for a single scalar field coupled to gravity at second order in perturbation theory and leading order in slow-roll. This is done in two ways: we derive the Klein--Gordon equation first using the Einstein field equations, and then directly from the action after integrating out the constraint equations. We also point out an unexpected result regarding the treatment of the field equations.
