In this contribution we study integrated properties of dynamically segregated star clusters. The observed core radii of segregated clusters can be 50% smaller than the ``true'' core radius. In addition, the measured radius in the red filters is smaller than those measured in blue filters. However, these difference are small ($\lesssim10%$), making it observationally challenging to detect mass segregation in extra-galactic clusters based on such a comparison. Our results follow naturally from the fact that in nearly all filters most of the light comes from the most massive stars. Therefore, the observed surface brightness profile is dominated by stars of similar mass, which are centrally concentrated and have a similar spatial distribution.
