Warm inflation dynamics is fundamentally based on a system-reservoir configuration in which the dynamics is dictated by a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Recent work by Cerioni et. al. (arXiv:0804.0163) examined dissipative dynamics with no associated fluctuation component. Their results, which are heavily dependent on initial conditions, are at odds with results in the warm inflation literature, especially the spectral indices. The inconsistency of their formalism is outlined here and it is shown how this would lead to their erroneous conclusions. It is then shown how, following the correct dynamical equations of warm inflation, the results in the literature are correct.
