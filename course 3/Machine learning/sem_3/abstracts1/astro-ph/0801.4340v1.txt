The operational conditions found by $BeppoSAX$ in observing nearby (z$\leq$0.1) Seyferts were reproduced for $Simbol$-$X$ in order to simulate a realistic final database of the mission. The results indicate that, even in the worst conditions, the $Simbol$-$X$ archive of pointings will allow to fully characterize the high-energy spectrum of nearby Seyferts and, most importantly, to obtain solid results on R and Ec (fundamental to model the cosmic X-Ray background, CXB). The measurement of the inclination angle of the accretion disk will be possible for $\sim$15 objects allowing to directly test the unified models for AGN. Finally, the time-dependent characteristics of the reflected component will be studied in at least $\sim$25 objects.
