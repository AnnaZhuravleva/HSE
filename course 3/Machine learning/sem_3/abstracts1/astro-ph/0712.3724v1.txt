We describe HST imaging of recent star formation complexes located in the extended UV disk (XUV-disk) component of NGC 5236 (M 83), NGC 5055 (M 63), and NGC 2090. Photometry in four FUV--visible bands permits us to constrain the type of resolved stars and effective age of clusters, in addition to extinction. The preliminary results given herein focus on CMD analysis and clustering properties in this unique star-forming environment.
