The question whether the dark matter halo density in the centers of galaxies could be changed through interactions with a rotating bar in the baryonic disk is of considerable current interest. While N-body simulations have been used to address this question, it has also been claimed that results from such simulations cannot be trusted. Based on a perturbative treatment of resonant exchanges between orbits and a rotating perturbation, Weinberg & Katz contend that N-body simulations of this process will not reveal the continuum result unless many more than the usual numbers of particles are employed. Here I report a study designed to examine their contention, finding results that show no dependence on the number of particles over the range usually employed up to that advocated by these authors. I show that my results are independent of all numerical parameters, and that field methods perform equally with grid methods in this respect. I also identify the reasons that the required particle number suggested by Weinberg & Katz is excessive.
