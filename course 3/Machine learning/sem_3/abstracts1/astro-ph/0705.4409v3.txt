Taking into account that Sandage-Loeb test is unique in its coverage of the redshift desert and available in the near future, we explore the cosmic time evolution behavior of the source redshift for holographic dark energy model, an important competing cosmological model. As a result, we find that Sandage-Loeb test can provide a extremely strong bound on $\Omega^0_m$, while its constraint on another dimensionless parameter $\lambda$ is weak. In addition, it is proposed here for the first time that we can also constrain various cosmological model by measuring the value of $z_{max}$ at which the peak of redshift velocity occurs. Combining this new proposed method with the traditional Sandage-Loeb test, we should be able to provide a better constraint on $\lambda$, at least from the theoretical perspective.
