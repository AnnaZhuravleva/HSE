Aims: Our aim was to measure and characterize the short-wavelength radio emission from young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster and the BN/KL star-forming region. Methods: We used the NRAO Very Large Array at a wavelength of 1.3 cm and we studied archival X-ray, infrared, and radio data. Results: During our observation, a strong outburst (flux increasing >10 fold) occurred in one of the 16 sources detected at a wavelength of 1.3cm, while the others remained (nearly) constant. This source does not have an infrared counterpart, but has subsequently been observed to flare in X-rays. Curiously, a very weak variable double radio source was found at other epochs near this position, one of whose components is coincident with it. A very high extinction derived from modeling the X-ray emission and the absence of an infrared counterpart both suggest that this source is very deeply embedded.
