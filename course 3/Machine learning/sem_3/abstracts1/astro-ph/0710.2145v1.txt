Recent HST/ACS images of M82 covering the entire galaxy have been used to detect star clusters. The galaxy is known to contain a young population (age < 10 Myr) in its starburst nucleus, surrounded by a post-starburst disk of age < 1 Gyr. We detect more than 650 star clusters in this galaxy, nearly 400 of them in the post-starburst disk. These data have been used to derive the luminosity, mass and size functions separately for the young nuclear, and intermediate-age disk clusters. In this contribution, we discuss the evolutionary status of these clusters, especially, on the chances of some of these clusters surviving to become old globular clusters.
