We apply the V/Vm test to a subsample of compact steep-spectrum sources from a complete sample of radio sources selected at 2.7 GHz. We find that the <V/Vm> has a value intermediate between those found for samples of extended steep-spectrum sources and those of compact flat-spectrum sources. If the sample is split into two further classes of sources having more steep and less steep spectra, the <V/Vm> values for these then tally roughly with those found for the extended steep-spectrum and compact flat-spectrum classes of sources. Implications of this result are discussed.
