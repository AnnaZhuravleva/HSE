We present a catalog of 535 planetary nebulae discovered in the flattened elliptical galaxy NGC 4697, using the FORS1 Cassegrain spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal, Chile. The catalog provides positions (x, y coordinates relative to the center of light of NGC 4697, as well as RA, Dec.), and, for almost all PNs, the magnitude m(5007) and the heliocentric radial velocity in km/s.
