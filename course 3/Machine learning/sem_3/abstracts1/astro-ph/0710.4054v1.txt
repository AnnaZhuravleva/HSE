Boxy/peanut bulges in disk galaxies have been associated to stellar bars. In this talk, we discuss the different properties of such bulges and their relation with the corresponding bar, using a very large sample of a few hundred numerical N-body simulations. We present and inter-compare various methods of measuring the boxy/peanut bulge properties, namely its strength, shape and possible asymmetry. Some of these methods can be applied to both simulations and observations. Our final goal is to get correlations that will allow us to obtain information on the boxy/peanut bulge for a galaxy viewed face-on as well as information on the bars of galaxies viewed edge-on.
