We investigate structural, kinematical, and chemical properties of stars and gas in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) interacting with the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Galaxy based on a series of self-consistent chemodynamical simulations. We adopt a new "dwarf spheroidal model" in which the SMC initially has both old stars with a spherical spatial distribution and an extended HI gas disk. We mainly investigate SMC's evolution for the last 3 Gyr within which the Magellanic stream (MS) and the Magellanic bridge (MB) can be formed as a result of the LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction. Our principal results, which can be tested against observations, are as follows. The final spatial distribution of the old stars projected onto the sky is spherical even after the strong LMC-SMC-Galaxy interaction, whereas that of the new ones is significantly flattened and appears to form a bar structure. Old stars have the line-of-sight velocity dispersion (sigma) of ~ 30 km/s and slow rotation with the maximum rotational velocity (V) of less than slow rotation with the maximum rotational velocity (V) of less than 20 km/s and show asymmetry in the radial profiles. New stars have a smaller sigma than old ones and a significant amount of rotation (V/sigma >1). HI gas shows velocity dispersions of sigma = 10-40 km/s a high maximum rotational velocity (V ~ 50 km/s), and the spatial distribution similar to that of new stars. The new stars with ages younger than 3 Gyr show a negative metallicity gradient in the sense that more metal-rich stars are located in the inner regions of the SMC.
