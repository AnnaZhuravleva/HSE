We present the analysis of the high energy emission of the Galactic black hole GRO J1655-40 at the beginning of its 2005 outburst. The data from 458 ks of INTEGRAL observations, spread over 4 weeks, are analyzed, along with the existing simultaneous RXTE and Swift data. The high energy data allow us to detect the presence of a high energy cut-off and to study its evolution during the outburst rise. This high energy feature is generally related to thermal mechanisms in the framework of Comptonization models from which we can estimate the plasma parameters. We found an electron temperature of about 30-40 keV and an optical depth around 1.8-2.1. The high energy cut-off decreased along with the radio flux, and disappeared as the jet turned off.
