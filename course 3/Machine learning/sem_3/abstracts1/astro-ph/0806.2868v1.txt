The mean absolute brightness temperature of the diffuse radio background was measured as a function of frequency in a continuous band between 100 and 200 MHz over an effective solid angle of ~pi str at high Galactic latitude. A spectral brightness temperature index of beta = 2.5 +/- 0.1 (alpha_s = 0.5) was derived from the observations, where the error limits are 3-sigma and include estimates of the instrumental systematics. Zenith drift scans with central declinations of -26.5 degrees and spanning right ascensions 0 to 10 hours yielded little variation in the mean spectral index. The mean absolute brightness temperature at 150 MHz was found to reach a minimum of T = 237 +/- 10 K at a right ascension of 2.5 hours. Combining these measurements with those of Haslam et al. 1982 yields a spectral index of beta = 2.52 +/- 0.04 between 150 and 408 MHz.
