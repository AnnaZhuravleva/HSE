We will introduce a new method to derive the orbital elements of the spectroscopic binary stars. Fitting the adopted radial velocity curves on the measured experimental data, the corresponding radial acceleration data are obtained. The orbital parameters are estimated by the nonlinear least squares of the radial velocity-acceleration curves. This method is implemented for the three double line spectroscopic binary systems RZ CAS, CC Cas and V1130 Tau. Numerical calculations show that the result are in good agreement with the those obtained by others using the method of Lehmann-Filh\'{e}s.
