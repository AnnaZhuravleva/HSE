In our analysis of {\it Spitzer}/IRS archival data on the stellar and sub-stellar members of the TW Hydrae Association (TWA), we have discovered two new brown dwarf disks: a flat optically thick disk around SSSPM J1102-3431 (SSSPM 1102), and a transition disk around 2MASS J1139511-315921 (2M1139). The disk structure for SSSPM 1102 is found to be very similar to the known brown dwarf disk 2MASSW J1207334-393254 (2M1207), with excess emission observed at wavelengths as short as 5 $\micron$. 2M1139 shows no excess emission shortward of $\sim$20 $\micron$, but flares up at longer wavelengths, and is the first transition disk detected among the sub-stellar members of TWA. We also report on the {\it Spitzer}/70 $\micron$ observations, and the presence of a weak {\it absorption} 10 $\micron$ silicate feature for 2M1207. The absorption can be attributed to a close to edge-on disk at a 75$\degr$ inclination. The 10 $\micron$ spectrum for 2M1207 shows crystalline forsterite features, with a peak in absorption near 11.3 $\micron$. No silicate absorption/emission is observed towards SSSPM 1102. While only 6 out of 25 stellar members show excess emission at these mid-infrared wavelengths, {\it all} of the TWA brown dwarfs that have been observed so far with {\it Spitzer} show signs of disks around them, resulting in a disk fraction of at least 60%. This is a considerable fraction at a relatively older age of $\sim$10 Myr. A comparison with younger clusters indicates that by the age of the TWA ($\sim$10 Myr), the disk fraction for brown dwarfs has not decreased, whereas it drops by a factor of $\sim$2 for the higher mass stars. This suggests longer disk decay time scales for brown dwarfs compared to higher mass stars.
