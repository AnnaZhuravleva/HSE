We consider a technique of calculating deflection of the light passing through wormholes (from one universe to another). We find fundamental and characteristic features of electromagnetic radiation passing through the wormholes. Making use of this, we propose new methods of observing distinctive differences between wormholes and other objects as well as methods of determining characteristic parameters for different wormhole models.
