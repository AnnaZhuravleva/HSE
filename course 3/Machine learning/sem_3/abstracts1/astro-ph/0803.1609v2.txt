Very-high-energy (>100 GeV) gamma-ray astronomy is emerging as an important discipline in both high energy astrophysics and astro-particle physics. This field is currently dominated by Imaging Atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and arrays of these telescopes. Such arrays have achieved the best angular resolution and energy flux sensitivity in the gamma-ray domain and are still far from the fundamental limits of the technique. Here I will summarise some key aspects of this technique and go on to review the current status of the major instruments and to highlight selected recent results.
