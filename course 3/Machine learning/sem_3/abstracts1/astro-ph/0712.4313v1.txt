We investigated the correlation between nuclear/circumnuclear starbursts around the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the AGN activities for 43 Seyfert galaxies in the CfA and 12 micron samples. We found that circumnuclear starburst luminosity as well as nuclear starburst luminosity are positively correlated with AGN luminosity. Moreover, nuclear starburst luminosity is more strongly correlated with the AGN luminosity normalized with AGN Eddington luminosity than is circumnuclear starburst luminosity. This implies that starbursts nearer the AGN could have a greater effect on AGN mass accretion. We also discuss these results from the viewpoint of the radiation effects from starbursts and sequential starbursts.
