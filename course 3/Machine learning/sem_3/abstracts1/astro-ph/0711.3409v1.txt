We present here the VO access to the results of an analysis of the spectra of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies performed with the STARLIGHT code by Cid Fernandes et al. (2005). The results include for each galaxy the original SDSS spectrum, the best-fit synthetic spectrum, the star formation history, the pure emission line spectrum corrected from underlying stellar population (in SDSS emission line galaxies) and the intensity of several emission/absorption lines. The database will be accessible from the PGos3 at the end of summer 2007.
