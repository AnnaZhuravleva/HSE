The mass varying neutrino scenario is a model that successfully explains the origin of dark energy while at the same time solves the coincidence problem. The model is, however, heavily constrained by its stability towards the formation of neutrino bound states when the neutrinos become nonrelativistic. We discuss these constraints and find that natural, adiabatic, stable models with the right amount of dark energy today do not exist. Secondly, we explain why using the lightest neutrino, which is still relativistic, as an explanation for dark energy does not work because of a feedback mechanism from the heavier neutrinos.
