BD-6^o1178 identified with the infrared source IRAS05238-0626 is shown for the first time to be a spectroscopic binary (SB2) by analyzing the high-resolution spectra taken with the NES echelle spectrograph of the 6-m telescope. The components of the binary have close spectral types and luminosity classes: F5IV-III and F3V. The heliocentric radial velocities are measured for both components at four observing moments in 2004-2005. Both stars have close rotation velocities, which are equal to 24 and 19km/s. We do not confirm the classification of BD-6^o1178 as a supergiant in the transition stage of becoming a planetary nebula. BD-6^o1178 probably is a young pre-MS stars. It is possibly a member of the 1c subgroup of the OriOB1 association.
