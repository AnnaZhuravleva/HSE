We present the first study of early dark energy cosmologies using N-body simulations to investigate the formation of non-linear structure. In contrast to expectations from semi-analytic approaches, we find that early dark energy does not imprint a unique signature on the statistics of non-linear structures. Investigating the non-linear power spectra and halo mass functions, we show that universal mass functions hold for early dark energy, making its presence difficult to distinguish from $\Lambda$CDM. Since early dark energy biases the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, the lack of discriminating power is problematic.
