Usually, a loose stellar distribution can be classified as an OB stellar group, an association, or a young open cluster. We make use of comparisons with the typical OB association Vul OB1. In the present paper we discuss the nature of Bochum 1, a typical example of an object affected by the above classification problem.The field-decontaminated CMD of Bochum 1 presents main sequence (MS) and pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. We report two new small angular-size, compact young clusters and one embedded cluster in the area of Bochum 1. Vul OB1 harbours the young open cluster NGC 6823 and the very compact embedded cluster Cr 404. The Vul OB1 association includes the H II region Sh2-86, and its stellar content is younger ($\approx3$ Myr) than that of Bochum 1 ($\approx9$ Myr), which shows no gas emission. Bochum 1 harbours one of the newly found compact clusters as its core. The RDP of Bochum 1 is irregular and cannot be fitted by a King-like profile, which suggests important erosion or dispersion of stars from a primordial cluster. Similarly to Bochum 1, the decontaminated CMD of NGC 6823 presents conspicuous MS and PMS sequences. Taken separately, RDPs of MS and PMS stars follow a King-like profile. The core shows an important excess density of MS stars that mimics the profile of a post-core collapse cluster. At such young age, it can be explained by an excess of stars formed in the prominent core. The present study suggests that Bochum 1 is a star cluster fossil remain that might be dynamically evolving into an OB association. Bochum 1 can be a missing link connecting early star cluster dissolution with the formation of low-mass OB associations.
