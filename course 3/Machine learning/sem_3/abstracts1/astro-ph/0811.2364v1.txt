Observations are inconsistent with a homogeneous and isotropic universe with ordinary matter and gravity. The universe is far from exact homogeneity and isotropy at late times, and the effect of the non-linear structures has to be quantified before concluding that new physics is needed. We explain how structure formation can lead to accelerated expansion, and discuss a semi-realistic model where the timescale of the change in the expansion rate emerges from the physics of structure formation.
