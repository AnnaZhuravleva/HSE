In this paper, we revisit the parameterizations of the equation of state of dark energy and point out that comparing merely the $\chi^2$ of different fittings may not be optimal for choosing the "best" parametrization. Another figure of merit for evaluating different parametrizations based on the area of the $w(z) - z$ band is proposed. In light of the analysis of some two-parameter parameterizations and models based on available SNIa data, the area of $w(z)-z$ band seems to be a good figure of merit, especially in the situation that the value of $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ for different parametrizations are very close. Therefore, we argue that both the area of the $w(z)-z$ band and $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ should be synthetically considered for choosing a better parametrization of dark energy in the future experiments.
