We present sensitive 7 mm observations of the H53$\alpha$ recombination line and adjacent continuum, made toward the Orion BN/KL region. In the continuum we detect the BN object, the radio source I (GMR I) and the radio counterpart of the infrared source n (Orion-n). Comparing with observations made at similar angular resolutions but lower frequency, we discuss the spectral indices and angular sizes of these sources. In the H53$\alpha$ line we only detect the BN object. This is the first time that radio recombination lines are detected from this source. The LSR radial velocity of BN from the H53$\alpha$ line, $v_{LSR} = 20.1 \pm 2.1$ km s$^{-1}$, is consistent with that found from previous studies in near-infared lines. While the continuum emission is expected to have considerable optical depth at 7 mm, the observed H53$\alpha$ line emission is consistent with an optically-thin nature and we discuss possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy. There is evidence of a velocity gradient, with the NE part of BN being redshifted by $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the SW part. This is consistent with the suggestion of Jiang et al. that BN may be driving an ionized outflow along that direction.
