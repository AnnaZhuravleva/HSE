Magnetars (SGRs and AXPs) are one of the most evolutionary paths of a neutron star. These objects have an ultra-strong magnetic field $B \sim 10^{15}$ G at their surface and show persistent X-ray pulsations and transient bursts. Till date there are 14 magnetars known: 5 SGRs (4 confirmed, 1 candidate) and 9 AXPs (7 confirmed, 2 candidates). It is an open puzzle that all these objects are isolated and none have been found in binaries. We discuss the formation scenario which can lead to such a situation.
