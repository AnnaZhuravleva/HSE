The Edelweiss programme is dedicated to the direct search for Dark Matter as massive weakly interacting particles (WIMPs) with Germanium cryogenic detectors operated in the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in the French Alps at a depth of 4800 mwe. After the initial phase Edelweiss I, which involved a total mass of 1 kg, the second step of the programme, Edelweiss II, currently operates 9 kg of detectors and an active shielding of 100 m^2 muon veto detectors and is now in its commissioning phase. The current status and performance of the Edelweiss II set-up in terms of backgrounds will be given, the underground muon flux measured with the muon veto system will be presented.
