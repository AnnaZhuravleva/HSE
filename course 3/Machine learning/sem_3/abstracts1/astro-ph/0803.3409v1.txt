We study the correlations of the flux of the broad-line emission ($F_{BLR}$) with the X-ray emission flux, optical emission flux at 5500 \AA and radio emission flux at 5 GHz, respectively, for a large sample of 50 Blazars (39 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 11 BL Lac objects). Our main results are as follows. There are very strong correlations between $F_{BLR}$ and $F_{X}$ and between $L_{BLR}$ and $L_{X}$ in both states for 39 FSRQs and the slopes of the linear regression equations are almost equal to 1. There are weak correlations between $F_{BLR}$ and $F_{X}$ and between $L_{BLR}$ and $L_{X}$ for 11 BL Lac objects in both states, and the slopes of the linear regression equations are close to 1. There are significant correlations between $F_{BLR}$ and $F_{X}$ and between $L_{BLR}$ and $L_{X}$ for 50 blazars in both states, the slopes of both the linear regression equations are also close to 1. These results support a close link between relativistic jets and accretion on to the central Kerr black hole. On the other hand, we find that BL Lac objects have low accretion efficiency $\eta$, whereas FSRQs have high accretion efficiency $\eta$. The unified model of FSRQs and BL Lac objects is also discussed.
