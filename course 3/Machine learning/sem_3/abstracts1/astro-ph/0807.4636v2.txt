We intend to show that it is possible to derive the physical parameters of galaxies from their broad-band spectral energy distribution out to a redshift of 1.2. This method has the potential to yield the physical parameters of all galaxies in a single field in a homogeneous way. We use an extensive dataset, assembled in the context of the VVDS survey, which reaches from the UV to the IR and covers a sample of 84073 galaxies over an area of 0.89 deg$^2$. We also use a library of 100000 model galaxies with a large variety of star formation histories (in particular including late bursts of star formation). We find that we can determine the physical parameters stellar mass, age and star formation rate with good confidence. We validate the star formation rate determinations in particular by comparing it to a sample of spectroscopically observed galaxies with an emission line measurement. We use our sample to build the number density function of galaxies as a function of stellar mass, specific star formation rate and redshift. We then study whether the stellar mass function at a later time can be predicted from the stellar mass function and star formation rate distribution at an earlier time. We find that the predicted growth in stellar mass from star formation agrees with the observed one. However, the predicted stellar mass density for massive galaxies is lower than observed, while the mass density of intermediate mass galaxies is overpredicted. When comparing with a direct measurement of the major merger rate from the VVDS survey we find that major mergers are sufficient to explain about a third of the mass build-up at the massive end, while the rest is likely contributed through minor mergers.
