The footprint of inflation in the polarization pattern of the CMB is expected at more than an order of magnitude below the limits of current polarization measurements. Large receiver arrays are mandatory for achieving the required sensitivity. We describe here the approach of the Q/U Imaging ExperimenT (QUIET) which will use coherent detector arrays. Pseudo-correlation receivers have been produced at 40 (90) GHz in small massproducable chip packages. Deployment of the first arrays with 19 (91) receivers is taking place in 2008 in the Atacama Desert in Chile and an expansion to $\sim$1000 receivers is foreseen for the future. The two frequencies and the selection of observing regions with minimal foreground and good overlap with other upcoming experiments will enable the detection of tensor to scalar ratios $r\sim10^{-2}$.
