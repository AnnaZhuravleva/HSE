The dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Local Group have long been thought to be simple spheroids of stars embedded within extended dark matter halos. Recently, however, evidence for the presence of spatially and kinematically distinct stellar populations has been accumulating. Here, we examine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxies embedded in cold dark matter halos. We begin by constructing a model of Andromeda II, a dSph satellite of M31 which shows evidence for spatially distinct stellar components. We find that the two-component model predicts an overall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at $\sim 10 - 11$ km s$^{-1}$ out to $\sim 1$ kpc from the center; this is despite wide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components. The presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in the velocity dispersion profiles of other dSphs; we show that velocity dispersion profiles which appear to rise from the center outwards before leveling off--such as those of Leo I, Draco, and Fornax--can result from the gradual transition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter, and more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo. Dwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurtic line-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a double Maxwellian. Interestingly, we find that multiple equilibrium components could also provide a potential alternative origin for ``extra-tidal'' stars (normally ascribed to tidal effects) in situations where corroborating evidence for tides may be lacking.
