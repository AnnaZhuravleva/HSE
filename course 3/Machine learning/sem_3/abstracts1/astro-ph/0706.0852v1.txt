The Large Area Telescope (LAT), one of two instruments on the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) mission, scheduled for launch by NASA in 2007, is an imaging, wide field-of-view, high-energy gamma-ray telescope, covering the approximate energy range from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. Annihilation of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP), predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, may give rise to a signal in gamma-ray spectra from many cosmic sources. In this contribution we give an overview of the searches for WIMP Dark Matter performed by the GLAST-LAT collaboration.
