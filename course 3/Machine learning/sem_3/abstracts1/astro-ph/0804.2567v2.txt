The main astrophysical properties of 11 previously unstudied open star clusters are probed with JHK Near-IR (2MASS) photometry of Cutri et al. [Cutri, R., et al., 2003. The IRSA 2MASS All-sky Point Source Catalog, NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive] and proper motions (NOMAD) astrometry of Zacharias et al. [Zacharias, N., Monet, D., Levine, S., Urban, S., Gaume, R., Wycoff, G., 2004. American Astro. Soc. Meeting 36, 1418]. The fundamental parameters have been derived for IC (1434, 2156); King (17, 18, 20, 23, 26)}; and Dias (2, 3, 4, 7, 8)}, for which no prior parameters are available in the literature. The clusters' centers coordinates and angular diameters are re-determined, while ages, distances, and color excesses for these clusters are estimated here for the first time.
