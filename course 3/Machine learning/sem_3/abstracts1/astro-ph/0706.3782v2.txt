After a review of the frequency - dependent angular pattern of interferometers in the TT gauge for scalar gravitational waves (SGWs), which has been recently analysed by Capozziello and Corda, in this letter the result is used to study the cross correlation between the Virgo interferometer and the MiniGRAIL resonant sphere. It is shown that the overlap reduction function for the cross correlation bewteen Virgo and the monopole mode of MiniGRAIL is very small, but a maximum is also found in the correlation at about 2710Hz, in the range of the MiniGRAIL sensitivity
