A model of the Lu-Hamilton kind is applied to the study of critical behavior of the magnetized solar atmosphere. The main novelty is that its driving is done via sources undergoing a diffusion. This mimics the effect of a virtual turbulent substrate forcing the system. The system exhibits power-law statistics not only in the size of the flares, but also in the distribution of the waiting times.
