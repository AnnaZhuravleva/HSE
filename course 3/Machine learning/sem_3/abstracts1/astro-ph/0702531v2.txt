We compute the corrections to the cosmological hydrogen recombination history due to delayed feedback of Lyman-series photons and the escape in the Lyman-continuum. The former process is expected to slightly delay recombination, while the latter should allow the medium to recombine a bit faster. It is shown that the subsequent feedback of released Lyman-n photons on the lower lying Lyman-(n-1) transitions yields a maximal correction of DN_e/N_e 0.22% at z~ 1050. Including only Lyman-\beta feedback onto the Lyman-\alpha transition, accounts for most of the effect. We find corrections to the cosmic microwave background TT and EE power spectra \change{with typical peak to peak amplitude |DC^{TT}_l/C^{TT}_l|~0.15% and |\Delta C^{EE}_l/C^{EE}_l|~0.36% at l<~3000. The escape in the Lyman-continuum and feedback of Lyman-\alpha photons on the photoionization rate of the second shell lead to modifications of the ionization history which are very small (less than |DN_e/N_e|~few x 10^{-6}).
