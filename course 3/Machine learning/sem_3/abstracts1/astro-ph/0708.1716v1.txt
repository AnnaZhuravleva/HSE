We built modelled spectra of stellar population at high resolution and with variable alpha-elements enhancements. Analysing spectra of Galactic globular clusters we show that it is possible to derive reliably and efficiently [Mg/Fe] using spectra integrated along the line-of-sight. These detailed measurements open perspectives for investigating the enrichment process on galaxies and star clusters.
