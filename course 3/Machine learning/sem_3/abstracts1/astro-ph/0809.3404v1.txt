We study non-linear structure formation in high-resolution simulations of Early Dark Energy (EDE) cosmologies and compare their evolution with the standard LCDM model. Extensions of the spherical top-hat collapse model predict that the virial overdensity and linear threshold density for collapse should be modified in EDE model, yielding significant modifications in the expected halo mass function. Here we present numerical simulations that directly test these expectations. Interestingly, we find that the Sheth & Tormen formalism for estimating the abundance of dark matter halos continues to work very well in its standard form for the Early Dark Energy cosmologies, contrary to analytic predictions. The residuals are even slightly smaller than for LCDM. We also study the virial relationship between mass and dark matter velocity dispersion in different dark energy cosmologies, finding excellent agreement with the normalization for Lambda as calibrated by Evrard et al.(2008). The earlier growth of structure in EDE models relative to LCDM produces large differences in the mass functions at high redshift. This could be measured directly by counting groups as a function of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion, skirting the ambiguous problem of assigning a mass to the halo. Using dark matter substructures as a proxy for member galaxies, we demonstrate that even with 3-5 members sufficiently accurate measurements of the halo velocity dispersion function are possible. Finally, we determine the concentration-mass relationship for our EDE cosmologies. Consistent with the earlier formation time, the EDE halos show higher concentrations at a given halo mass. We find that the magnitude of the difference in concentration is well described by the prescription of Eke et al.(2001) for estimating halo concentrations.
