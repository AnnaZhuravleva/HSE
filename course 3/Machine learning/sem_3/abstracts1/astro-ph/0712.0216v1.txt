We propose a solution to the `cuspy-core' problem by extending the geodesic equations of motion using the Dark Energy length scale $\lambda_{DE}=c/(\Lambda_{DE} G)^{1/2}$. This extension does not affect the motion of photons; gravitational lensing is unchanged. A cosmological check of the theory is made, and $\sigma_8$ is calculated to be $0.68_{\pm0.11}$, compared to $0.761_{-0.048}^{+0.049}$ for WMAP. We estimate the fractional density of matter that cannot be determined through gravity at $0.197_{\pm 0.017}$, compared to $0.196^{+0.025}_{-0.026}$, the fractional density of nonbaryonic matter. The fractional density of matter that can be determined through gravity is estimated at $0.041_{-0.031}^{+0.030}$, compared to $0.0416_{-0.0039}^{+0.0038}$ for $\Omega_B$.
