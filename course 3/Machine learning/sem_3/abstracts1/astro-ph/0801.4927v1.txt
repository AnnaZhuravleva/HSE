The concordance Cold Dark Matter model for the formation of structure in the Universe, while remarkably successful at describing observations on large scales, has a number of problems on galaxy scales. The Milky Way and its satellite system provide a key laboratory for exploring dark matter (DM) in this regime, but some of the most definitive tests of local DM await microarcsecond astrometry, such as will be delivered by the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM Planetquest). I discuss several tests of Galactic DM enabled by future microarcsecond astrometry.
