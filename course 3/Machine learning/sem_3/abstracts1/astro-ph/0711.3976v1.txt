Utilizing spatially resolved VLT/FORS spectroscopy and HST/ACS imaging, we constructed a sample of over 200 field spiral galaxies at redshifts 0.1<z<1.0. We find that the ratio between stellar and total mass remains roughly constant over the observed epochs, in compliance with the framework of hierarchical structure growth. However, the stellar mass-to-light ratios evolve more strongly in low-mass spirals than in high--mass spirals, indicating an anti-hierarchical evolution of their stellar populations (aka "down-sizing").
