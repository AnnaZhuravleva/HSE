(1270) Datura is the largest member of a very young asteroid cluster that was thought to be broken-up 0.45 Myr ago. The light-curve and the rotation-resolved reflectance spectra (0.6 um - 1.0 um) were observed in order to find "fresh" surface. Our data show no significant spectral variation along the rotation phase. The depth of the 0.95 um absorption band, which indicates the degree of space weathering, was similar to that of an old S-type asteroid. This suggests that the reflectance spectrum in this wavelength range changes rapidly and saturates the depth of the 0.95 um absorption in less than 0.45 Myr in the main belt environment.
