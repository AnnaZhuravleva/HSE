I discuss current theoretical expectations of how primordial, Pop III.1 stars form. Lack of direct observational constraints makes this a challenging task. In particular predicting the mass of these stars requires solving a series of problems, which all affect, perhaps drastically, the final outcome. While there is general agreement on the initial conditions, H_2-cooled gas at the center of dark matter minihalos, the subsequent evolution is more uncertain. In particular, I describe the potential effects of dark matter annihilation heating, fragmentation within the minihalo, magnetic field amplification, and protostellar ionizing feedback. After these considerations, one expects that the first stars are massive >~100Msun, with dark matter annihilation heating having the potential to raise this scale by large factors. Higher accretion rates in later-forming minihalos may cause the Pop III.1 initial mass function to evolve to higher masses.
