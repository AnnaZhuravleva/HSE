Most cosmological parameters are expected to change significantly only on cosmological time scales, but given the large amount of information contained within the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) sky, we can expect that changes in the CMB should be observable on much shorter time scales. Here we quantify this expectation, examining the detectability of the dominant effects on short time scales. We find that an ideal future experiment with currently achievable sensitivity could detect the changing dipole due to our galactic motion in about 10 years, but that it would take around 4000 years to detect a change in the higher order multipoles.
