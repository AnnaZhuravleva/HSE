Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) are candidates to seed the Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs), and some could still wander in the Galaxy. In the context of annihilating dark matter (DM), they are expected to drive huge annihilation rates, and could therefore significantly enhance the primary cosmic rays (CRs) expected from annihilation of the DM of the Galactic halo. In this proceeding (the original paper is Brun et al. 2007), we briefly explain the method to derive estimates of such exotic contributions to the anti-proton and positron CR spectra, and the associated statistical uncertainties connected to the properties of IMBHs. We find boost factors of order $10^4$ to the exotic fluxes, but associated with very large statistical uncertainties.
