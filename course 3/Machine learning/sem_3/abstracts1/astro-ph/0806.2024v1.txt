We analyzed the eclipse light curve of the nova-like star RW Tri in its low luminosity state. During approximately 150 days, RW Tri was about one magnitude fainter than in its usual state. Our eclipse map shows that the brightness temperature in the disc ranges from 19000 K near the white dwarf to 8700 at the disc edge. For the inner parts of accretion disc, the radial temperature distribution is flatter than that predicted from the steady state models, and for the outer parts, it is close to the R^(-3/4) law. Fitting of the temperature distribution with one for the steady state disc model gives a mean accretion rate of (3.85+-0.19) 10^{-9} M year^(-1). The hotspot in the disc is placed at a distance of 0.17a from the white dwarf, where a is the orbital separation.
