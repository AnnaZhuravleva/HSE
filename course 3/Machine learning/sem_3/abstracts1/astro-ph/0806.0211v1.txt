The basic intent of this paper is to model 70 Ophiuchi A using the latest asteroseismic observations as complementary constraints and to determine the fundamental parameters of the star. Additionally, we propose a new quantity to lift the degeneracy between the initial chemical composition and stellar age. Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC7), we construct a series of stellar evolutionary tracks for the mass range $M$ = 0.85 -- 0.93 $M_{\odot}$ with different composition $Y_{i}$ (0.26 -- 0.30) and $Z_{i}$ (0.017 -- 0.023). Along these tracks, we select a grid of stellar model candidates that fall within the error box in the HR diagram to calculate the theoretical frequencies, the large- and small- frequency separations using the Guenther's stellar pulsation code. Following the asymptotic formula of stellar $p$-modes, we define a quantity $r_{01}$ which is correlated with stellar age. Also, we test it by theoretical adiabatic frequencies of many models. Many detailed models of 70 Ophiuchi A have been listed in Table 3. By combining all non-asteroseismic observations available for 70 Ophiuchi A with these seismological data, we think that Model 60, Model 125 and Model 126, listed in Table 3, are the optimum models presently. Meanwhile, we predict that the radius of this star is about 0.860 -- 0.865 $R_{\odot}$ and the age is about 6.8 -- 7.0 Gyr with mass 0.89 -- 0.90 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, we prove that the new quantity $r_{01}$ can be a useful indicator of stellar age.
