We present ground-based optical and Spitzer Space Telescope infrared imaging observations of the ecliptic (Jupiter-family) comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, the parent body of the Draconid meteor stream, during its 2005 apparition. Onset of nucleus activity occurred at a pre-perihelion heliocentric distance, < 3.80 AU, while post-perihelion 21P was dusty (peak Afrho = 131 cm^{-1}) and active out to heliocentric distances > 3.3 AU following a logarithmic slope with heliocentric distance -2.04. Coma colors, (V-R) = 0.524 +/- 0.003, (R-I) = 0.487 +/- 0.004 are redder than solar, yet comparable to colors derived for other Jupiter-family comets. A nucleus radius of 1.82 +/- 0.05 km is derived from photometry at quiescence. Spitzer images post-perihelion exhibit an extensive coma with a prominent dust tail, where excess emission (over the dust continuum) in the 4.5 micron IRAC image arises from volatile gaseous CO and/or CO2. No dust trail was detected (3-sigma surface brightness upper-limit of 0.3 MJy/sr/pixel) along the projected velocity vector of comet 21P in the MIPS 24 micron image suggesting that the number density of trail particles is < 7 x 10^{-11} m^{-3}. The bolometric albedo of 21P derived from the contemporaneous optical and Spitzer observations is A(theta = 22 degr.) = 0.11, slightly lower than values derived for other comets at the same phase angle.
