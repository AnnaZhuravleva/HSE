Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are naturally produced by convection in stellar envelopes, and they could be an important mechanism for transporting angular momentum in the radiative interiors of stars. Prior work has established that they could operate over a short enough time scale to explain the internal solar rotation as a function of depth. We demonstrate that the natural action of IGWs is to produce large scale oscillations in the solar rotation as a function of depth, which is in marked contrast to the nearly uniform rotation in the outer radiative envelope of the Sun. An additional angular momentum transport mechanism is therefore required, and neither molecular nor shear-induced turbulent viscosity is sufficient to smooth out the profile. Magnetic processes, such as the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, could flatten the rotation profile. We therefore conclude that IGWs must operate in conjunction with magnetic angular momentum transport processes if they operate at all. Furthermore, both classes of mechanisms must be inhibited to some degree by mean molecular weight gradients in order to explain the recent evidence for a rapidly rotating embedded core in the Sun.
