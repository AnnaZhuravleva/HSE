This review discusses some of the observational constraints on what we know about the mass loss experienced by stars in the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase of evolution. Mass loss affects the maximum mass attained by the core of an AGB star and hence its fate as a white dwarf or potentially a supernova. The way mass loss depends on stellar initial parameters and time affects the yield from AGB stars, in terms of elemental abundances and types of dust. The role of pulsation, dust formation, chromospheres and other mechanisms which may contribute to mass loss are assessed against observational evidence, and suggestions are made for observations which could force significant new progress in this field in the first decades of the 21st century. A better understanding of AGB mass loss may be gained from a combination with studies of first ascent red giant branch (RGB) stars and red supergiants, through population studies and in different environments.
