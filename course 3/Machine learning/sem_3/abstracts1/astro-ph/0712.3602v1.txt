Power-law cosmologies, in which the cosmological scale factor evolves as a power law in the age, $a \propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \ga 1$, regardless of the matter content or cosmological epoch, is comfortably concordant with a host of cosmological observations.} {In this article, we use recent measurements of the X-ray gas mass fractions in clusters of galaxies to constrain the $\alpha$ parameter with curvature $k = \pm1, 0$. We find that the best fit happens for an open scenario with the power index $\alpha = 1.14 \pm 0.05$, though the flat and closed model can not be rule out at very high confidence level.} {Our results are in agreement with other recent analyses and show that the X-ray gas mass fraction measurements in clusters of galaxies provide a complementary test to the power law cosmology.
