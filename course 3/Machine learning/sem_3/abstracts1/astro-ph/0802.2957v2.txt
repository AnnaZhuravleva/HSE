We construct partially ionized hydrogen atmosphere models for magnetized neutron stars in radiative equilibrium with fixed surface fields between B=10^12 and 2x10^13 G and effective temperatures logT_eff=5.5-6.8, as well as with surface B and T_eff distributions around these values. The models are based on the latest equation of state and opacity results for magnetized, partially ionized hydrogen plasmas. The atmospheres directly determine the characteristics of thermal emission from the surface of neutron stars. We also incorporate these model spectra into XSPEC, under the model name NSMAX, thus allowing them to be used by the community to fit X-ray observations of neutron stars.
