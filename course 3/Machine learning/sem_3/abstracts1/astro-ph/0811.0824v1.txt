We present the redshift catalogs for the X-ray sources detected in the Chandra Deep Field North (CDF-N), the Chandra Large Area Synoptic X-ray Survey (CLASXS), and the Chandra Lockman Area North Survey (CLANS). The catalogs for the CDF-N and CLASXS fields include redshifts from previous work, while the redshifts for the CLANS field are all new. For fluxes above 10^-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8 keV) we have redshifts for 76% of the sources. We extend the redshift information for the full sample using photometric redshifts. The goal of the OPTX Project is to use these three surveys, which are among the most spectroscopically complete surveys to date, to analyze the effect of spectral type on the shape and evolution of the X-ray luminosity functions and to compare the optical spectral types with the X-ray spectral properties.   We also present the CLANS X-ray catalog. The nine ACIS-I fields cover a solid angle of ~0.6 square degrees and reach fluxes of 7x10^-16 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 (0.5-2 keV) and 3.5x10^-15 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8 keV). We find a total of 761 X-ray point sources. Additionally, we present the optical and infrared photometric catalog for the CLANS X-ray sources, as well as updated optical and infrared photometric catalogs for the X-ray sources in the CLASXS and CDF-N fields.   The CLANS and CLASXS surveys bridge the gap between the ultradeep pencil-beam surveys, such as the CDFs, and the shallower, very large-area surveys. As a result, they probe the X-ray sources that contribute the bulk of the 2-8 keV X-ray background and cover the flux range of the observed break in the logN-logS distribution. We construct differential number counts for each individual field and for the full sample.
