We report the detection of extended low radio frequency continuum emission beyond the optical disk of the spiral galaxy NGC 4254 using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. NGC 4254, which has an almost face-on orientation, is located in the outskirts of the Virgo cluster. Since such extended emission is uncommon in low inclination galaxies, we believe it is a signature of magnetised plasma pushed out of the disk by ram pressure of the intracluster medium as NGC 4254 falls into the Virgo cluster. The detailed spectral index distribution across NGC 4254 shows that the steepest spectrum alpha < -1 (S propto nu^{alpha}) arises in the gas beyond the optical disk. This lends support to the ram pressure scenario by indicating that the extended emission is not from the disk gas but from matter which has been stripped by ram pressure. The steeper spectrum of the extended emission is reminiscent of haloes in edge-on galaxies. The sharp fall in intensity and enhanced polarization in the south of the galaxy, in addition to enhanced star formation reported by others provide evidence towards the efficacy of ram pressure on this galaxy. HI 21cm observations show that the gas in the north lags in rotation and hence is likely the atomic gas which is carried along with the wind. NGC 4254 is a particularly strong radio emitter with a power of 7x10^{22} Watts/Hz at 240 MHz. We find that the integrated spectrum of the galaxy flattens at lower frequencies and is well explained by an injection spectrum with alpha_0=-0.45+-0.12. We end by comparing published simulation results with our data and conclude that ram pressure stripping is likely to be a significant contributor to evolution of galaxies residing in X-ray poor groups and cluster outskirts.
