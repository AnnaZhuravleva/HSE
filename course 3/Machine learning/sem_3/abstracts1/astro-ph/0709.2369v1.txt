Dark matter (DM) in protostellar halos can dramatically alter the current theoretical framework for the formation of the first stars. Heat from supersymmetric DM annihilation can overwhelm any cooling mechanism, consequently impeding the star formation process and possibly leading to a new stellar phase. The first stars to form in the universe may be ``dark stars''; i.e., giant (larger than 1 AU) hydrogen-helium stars powered by DM annihilation instead of nuclear fusion. Possibilities for detecting dark stars are discussed.
