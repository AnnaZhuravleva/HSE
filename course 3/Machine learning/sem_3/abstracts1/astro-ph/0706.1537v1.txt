In this paper we derive semi-empirical Cepheid period-luminosity (P-L) relations in the Sloan ugriz magnitudes by combining the observed BVI mean magnitudes from the Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids (LMC) and theoretical bolometric corrections. We also constructed empirical gr band P-L relations, using the publicly available Johnson-Sloan photometric transformations, to be compared with our semi-empirical P-L relations. These two sets of P-L relations are consistent with each other.
