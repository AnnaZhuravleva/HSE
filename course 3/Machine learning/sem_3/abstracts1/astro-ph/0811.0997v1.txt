The ARGO-YBJ experiment has been in stable data taking since November 2007 at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m a.s.l.). In this paper we report a few selected results in Gamma-Ray Astronomy (Crab Nebula and Mrk421 observations, search for high energy tails of GRBs) and Cosmic Ray Physics (Moon and Sun shadow observations, proton-air cross section and antiproton/proton preliminary measurements).
