Parallaxes of W UMa stars in the Hipparcos catalogue have been analyzed. 31 W UMa stars, which have the most accurate parallaxes ($\sigma_{\pi}/\pi<0.15$) which are neither associated with a photometric tertiary nor with evidence of a visual companion, were selected for re-calibrating the Period--Luminosity--Color (PLC) relation of W UMa stars. Using the Lutz--Kelker (LK) bias corrected (most probable) parallaxes, periods ($0.26< P(day)< 0.87$), and colors (0.04<$(B-V)_{0}$<1.28) of the 31 selected W UMa, the PLC relation have been revised and re-calibrated. The difference between the old (revised but not bias corrected) and the new (LK bias corrected) relations are almost negligible in predicting the distances of W UMa stars up to about 100 parsecs. But, it increases and may become intolerable as distances of stars increase. Additionally, using $(J-H)_{0}$ and $(H-K_{s})_{0}$ colors from 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) data, a PLC relation working with infrared data was derived. It can be used with infrared colors in the range $-0.01<(J-H)_{0}<0.58$, and $-0.10<(H-K_{s})_{0}<0.18$. Despite {\em 2MASS} data are single epoch observations, which are not guaranteed at maximum brightness of the W UMa stars, the established relation has been found surprisingly consistent and reliable in predicting LK corrected distances of W UMa stars.
