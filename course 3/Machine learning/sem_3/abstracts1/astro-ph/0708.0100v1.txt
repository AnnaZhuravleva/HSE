In this contribution we will discuss recent results concerning the intensity and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray and neutrino emissions as should be originated from the hadronic scattering of cosmic rays (CR) with the interstellar medium (ISM). We assumed that CR sources are supernova remnants (SNR) and estimated the spatial distribution of primary nuclei by solving numerically the diffusion equation. For the ISM, we considered recent models for the 3D spatial distributions of molecular hydrogen. Respect to previous results, we find the secondary gamma-ray and neutrino emissions to be more peaked along the galactic equator and in the galactic centre which improves significantly the perspectives of a positive detection. We compare our predictions with the experimental limits/observations by MILAGRO and TIBET (for the gamma-rays) and by AMANDA-II (for the neutrinos) and discuss the detection perspectives for a km3 neutrino telescope to be built in the North hemisphere.
