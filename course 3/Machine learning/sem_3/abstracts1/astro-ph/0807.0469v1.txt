SuperLupus is a deep transit survey monitoring a Galactic Plane field in the Southern hemisphere. The project is building on the successful Lupus Survey, and will double the number of images of the field from 1700 to 3400, making it one of the longest duration deep transit surveys. The immediate motivation for this expansion is to search for longer period transiting planets (5-8 days) and smaller radii planets. It will also provide near complete recovery for the shorter period planets (1-3 days). In March, April, and May 2008 we obtained the new images and work is currently in progress reducing these new data.
