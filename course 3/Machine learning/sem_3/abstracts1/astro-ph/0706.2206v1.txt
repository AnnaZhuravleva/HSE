This article synthesizes observational data from an extensive program aimed toward a comprehensive understanding of star formation in a low-mass star-forming molecular cloud. New observations and published data spanning from the centimeter wave band to the near infrared reveal the high and low density molecular gas, dust, and pre-main sequence stars in L1551.
