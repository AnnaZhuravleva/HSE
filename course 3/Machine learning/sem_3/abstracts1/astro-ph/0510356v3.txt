In this paper, we study the possibility of building Yang-Mills(YM) field dark energy models with equation of state (EoS) crossing -1, and find that it can not be realized by the single YM field models, no matter what kind of lagrangian or initial condition. But the states of $-1<\omega<0$ and $\omega<-1$ all can be naturally got in this kind of models. The former is like a quintessence field, and the latter is like a phantom field. This makes that one can build a model with two YM fields, in which one with the initial state of $-1<\omega<0$, and the other with $\omega<-1$. We give an example model of this kind, and find that its EoS is larger than -1 in the past and less than -1 at the present time. We also find that this change must be from $\omega>-1$ to $<-1$, and it will go to the critical state of $\omega=-1$ with the expansion of the Universe, which character is same with the single YM field models, and the Big Rip is naturally avoided.
