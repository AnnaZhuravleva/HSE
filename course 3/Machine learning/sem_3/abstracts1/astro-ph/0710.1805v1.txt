It is shown that the height scale for accretion disks is a constant whenever hydrostatic equilibrium and sub-sonic turbulence regime hold in the disk. In order to have a variable height scale, processes that do contribute with an extra term to the continuity equation are needed. This makes the viscosity parameter much greater in the outer region and much smaller in the inner region. Under these circumstances, turbulence is a presumable source of viscosity in the disk.
