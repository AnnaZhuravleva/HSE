Based on a deep imaging survey, we present the first homogeneous star formation history (SFH) of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy. We have obtained two-filter photometry to a depth of B ~ 23 over the entire surface of Fornax, the brightest dSph associated with the Milky Way, and derived its SFH using a CMD-fitting technique. We show that Fornax has produced the most complex star formation and chemical enrichment histories of all the Milky Way dSphs. This system has supported multiple epochs of star formation. A significant number of stars were formed in the early Universe, however the most dominant population are the intermediate age stars. This includes a strong burst of star formation approximately 3 to 4 Gyr ago. Significant population gradients are also evident. Similar to other dSphs, we have found that recent star formation was concentrated towards the centre of the system. Furthermore, we show that the central region harboured a faster rate of chemical enrichment than the outer parts of Fornax. At the centre, the ancient stars (age > 10 Gyr) display a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.4, with evidence for three peaks in the metallicity distribution. Overall, enrichment in Fornax has been highly efficient: the most recent star formation burst has produced stars with close to solar metallicity. Our results support a scenario in which Fornax experienced an early phase of rapid chemical enrichment producing a wide range of abundances. Star formation gradually decreased until ~4 Gyr ago, when Fornax experienced a sudden burst of strong star formation activity accompanied by substantial chemical enrichment. Weaker star forming events followed, and we have found tentative evidence for stars with ages less than 100 Myr.
