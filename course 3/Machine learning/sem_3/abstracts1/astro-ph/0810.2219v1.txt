Impact of supernova explosion on the neutron star magnetosphere in a massive binary system is considered. The supernova shock striking the NS magnetosphere filled with plasma can lead to the formation of a magnetospheric tail with significant magnetic energy. The magnetic field reconnection in the current sheet formed can convert the magnetic energy stored in the tail into kinetic energy of accelerated charged particles. Plasma instabilities excited by beams of relativistic particles can lead to the formation of a short pulse of coherent radio emission with parameters similar to those of the observed bright extragalactic millisecond radio burst (Lorimer et al. 2007).
