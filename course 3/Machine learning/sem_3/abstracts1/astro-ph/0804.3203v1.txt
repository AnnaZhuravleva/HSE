Observations reveal that mature spiral galaxies consist of stars, gases and plasma approximately distributed in a thin disk of circular shape, usually with a central bulge. The rotation velocities quickly increase from the galactic center and then achieve a constant velocity from the core to the periphery. The basic dynamic behavior of a mature spiral galaxy, such as the Milky Way, is well described by simple models balancing Newtonian gravitational forces against the centrifugal forces associated with a rotating thin axisymmetric disk. In this research, we investigate the effects of adding central bulges to thin disk gravitational models. Even with the addition of substantial central bulges, all the critical essential features of our thin disk gravitational models are preserved. (1) Balancing Newtonian gravitational and centrifugal forces at every point within the disk yields computed radial mass distributions that describe the measured rotation velocity profiles of mature spiral galaxies successfully. (2) There is no need for gravity deviations or ``massive peripheral spherical halos of mysterious Dark Matter''. (3) The calculated total galactic masses are in good agreement with star count data. (4) The addition of central bulges increases the calculated total galactic masses, possibly more consistent with the presence of galactic gases, dust, grains, lumps, planets and plasma in addition to stars. (5) Compared with the light distribution, our mass distributions within the disk are larger out toward the galactic periphery which is cooler with lower opactiy/emissivity (and thus darker). This is apparent from edge-on views of galaxies which display a dark disk-line against a much brighter galactic halo.
