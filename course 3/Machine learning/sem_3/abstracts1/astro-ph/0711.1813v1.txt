For purposes of designing targeted cataclysmic variable (CV) detection surveys and interpreting results of other projects with many CV detections such as the ChaMPlane Survey, we have created a model of the CV distribution in the Galaxy. It is modeled as a warped, flared exponential disk with a gaussian vertical distribution. Extinction is based on a detailed Galactic dust and gas model. A luminosity function for CVs is also incorporated, based on a smoothed version of published data. We calculate predicted field detection rates as a function of the limiting magnitude expected for the detecting system (i.e. WIYN/Hydra or NOAO 4m/Mosaic). Monte-Carlo techniques are used to assess statistical fluctuations in these rates. We have created maps of the expected CV distribution for the full non-bulge Galactic plane (20<l<340, |b|<15) for use in both the ChaMPlane Survey and future CV surveys. Assuming a CV distribution with a scale height of 160 pc, the ChaMPlane observational result of 5 CVs in 13 northern fields is best fit by a CV local space density of 0.9^{+1.5}_{-0.5}*10^-5 pc^-3, with the range representing the 95% confidence interval.
