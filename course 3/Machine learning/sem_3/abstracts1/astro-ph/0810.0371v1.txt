We investigate the clustering of afterglow light curves observed at X-ray and optical wavelengths. We have constructed a sample of 61 bursts with known distance and X-ray afterglow. GRB sources can be divided in three classes, namely optical and X-ray bright afterglows, optical and X-ray dim one s, and optically bright -X-ray dim ones. We argue that this clustering is related to the fireball total energy, the external medium density, the fraction of fireball energy going in relativistic electrons and magnetic fields. We propose a method for the estimation of the GRB source redshift based on the observe d X-ray flux one day after the burst and optical properties. We tested this method on three recently detected SWIFT GRBs with known redshift, and found it i n good agreement with the reported distance from optical spectroscopy.
