The advent of the new class 8 meters telescopes allows for the first time the detailed study of numerous stars of galaxies other than our own. The Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the most interesting targets due to its proximity and its relatively face-on disk, permitting to separate populations pertaining to the different structures of the galaxy. We have used FLAMES (the Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph) at the VLT-UT2 telescope to obtain spectra of a large sample of stars from the Inner Disk of the LMC, $\sim$2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. We investigate the chemical abundances of iron-peak elements, heavy and light $s$-process elements, Cu, Na, Sc and $\alpha$-elements for a sample of red giant stars. Metallicities for the sample stars range from [Fe/H] = $-$1.76 to $-$0.02. LMC inner disk stars show a definitely different chemical pattern when compared to galactic stars of the same metallicity.
