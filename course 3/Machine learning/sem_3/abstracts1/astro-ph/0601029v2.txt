We have studied ~2100 early-type galaxies in the SDSS DR3 which have been detected by the GALEX Medium Imaging Survey (MIS), in the redshift range 0 < z < 0.11. Combining GALEX UV photometry with corollary optical data from the SDSS, we find that, at a 95 percent confidence level, at least ~30 percent of galaxies in this sample have UV to optical colours consistent with some recent star formation within the last Gyr. In particular, galaxies with a NUV - r colour less than 5.5 are very likely to have experienced such recent star formation, taking into account the possibility of a contribution to NUV flux from the UV upturn phenomenon. We find quantitative agreement between the observations and the predictions of a semi-analytical LCDM hierarchical merger model and deduce that early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0 < z < 0.11 have ~1 to 3 percent of their stellar mass in stars less than 1 Gyr old. The average age of this recently formed population is ~300 to 500 Myrs. We also find that monolithically evolving galaxies, where recent star formation can be driven solely by recycled gas from stellar mass loss, cannot exhibit the blue colours (NUV - r < 5.5) seen in a significant fraction (~30 percent) of our observed sample.
