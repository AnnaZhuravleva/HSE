Since April 2005 a regularly updated stellar neutron cross section compilation is available online at http://nuclear-astrophysics.fzk.de/kadonis. This online-database is called the "Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars" project and is based on the previous Bao et al. compilation from the year 2000. The present version \textsc{KADoNiS} v0.2 (January 2007) includes recommended cross sections for 280 isotopes between $^{1}$H and $^{210}$Po and 75 semi-empirical estimates for isotopes without experimental information. Concerning stellar $(n,\gamma)$ cross sections of the 32 stable, proton-rich isotopes produced by the $p$ process experimental information is only available for 20 isotopes, but 9 of them have rather large uncertainties of $\geq$9%. The first part of a systematic study of stellar $(n,\gamma)$ cross sections of the $p$-process isotopes $^{74}$Se, $^{84}$Sr, $^{102}$Pd, $^{120}$Te, $^{130}$Ba, $^{132}$Ba, $^{156}$Dy, and $^{174}$Hf is presented. In another application \textsc{KADoNiS} v0.2 was used for an modification of a reaction library of Basel university. With this modified library $p$-process network calculations were carried out and compared to previous results.
