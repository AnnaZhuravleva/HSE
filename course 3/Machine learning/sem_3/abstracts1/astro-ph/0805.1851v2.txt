We analyze the generation of primordial magnetic fields during de Sitter inflation in a Lorentz-violating theory of Electrodynamics containing a Chern-Simons term which couples the photon to an external four-vector. We find that, for appropriate magnitude of the four-vector, the generated field is maximally helical and, through an inverse cascade caused by turbulence of primeval plasma, reaches at the time of protogalactic collapse an intensity and correlation length such as to directly explain galactic magnetism.
