The solar corona has been revealed in the past decade to be a highly dynamic nonequilibrium plasma environment. Both the loop-filled coronal base and the extended acceleration region of the solar wind appear to be strongly turbulent, but direct observational evidence for a cascade of fluctuation energy from large to small scales is lacking. In this paper I will review the observations of wavelike motions in the corona over a wide range of scales, as well as the macroscopic effects of wave-particle interactions such as preferential ion heating. I will also present a summary of recent theoretical modeling efforts that seem to explain the time-steady properties of the corona (and the fast and slow solar wind) in terms of an anisotropic MHD cascade driven by the partial reflection of low-frequency Alfven waves propagating along the superradially expanding solar magnetic field. Complete theoretical models are difficult to construct, though, because many of the proposed physical processes act on a multiplicity of spatial scales (from centimeters to solar radii) with feedback effects not yet well understood. This paper is thus a progress report on various attempts to couple these disparate scales.
