We present high resolution, Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA), $\lambda$=1mm observations of several molecular species toward Orion-KL. These are the highest spatial and spectral resolution 1mm observations of these molecules to date. Our observations show that ethyl cyanide [C$_2$H$_5$CN] and vinyl cyanide [C$_2$H$_3$CN] originate from multiple cores near the Orion hot core and IRc7. Additionally we show that dimethyl ether [(CH$_3$)$_2$O] and methyl formate [HCOOCH$_3$] originate from IRc5 and IRc6 and that acetone [(CH$_3$)$_2$CO] originates only from areas where both N-bearing and O-bearing species are present.
