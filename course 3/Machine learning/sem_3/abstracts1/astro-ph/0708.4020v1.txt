In order to understand the composition of planetary nebulae we first need to study the nucleosynthesis occurring in the progenitor star during the thermally-pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. I present an overview of single AGB evolution, with an emphasis on the mixing processes that alter the envelope composition, followed by a discussion of the stellar yields available from single AGB stellar models.
