High spatial resolution spectro-polarimetric observation of a decaying spot was observed with the Diffraction Limited Spectro-Polarimeter. The spatial resolution achieved was close to the diffraction limit (0."18) of the Dunn Solar Telescope. The fine scales present inside the decaying active region as well as surrounding areas were studied. Two interesting phenomenon observed are: (i) Canopy like structures are likely to be present in the umbral dots as well as in the light bridges providing evidence for field-free intrusion, (ii) There are opposite polarity loops present outside of the spot and some of them connects to the main spot and the surrounding magnetic features.
