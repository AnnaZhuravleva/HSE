We present a mosaic image of the 1.4GHz radio continuum emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Parkes Telescope. The mosaic covers 10.8 x 12.3 square degrees with an angular resolution of 40", corresponding to a spatial scale of 10pc in the LMC. The final image is suitable for studying emission on all scales between 40" and the surveyed area. In this paper, we discuss i) the characteristics of the LMC's diffuse and compact radio continuum emission, ii) the fraction of the emission produced by thermal processes and the implied star formation rate in the LMC, and iii) variations in the radio spectral index across the LMC. Two non-standard reduction techniques that we used to process the ATCA visibility data may be of interest for future wide-field radio continuum surveys. The data are open to the astronomical community and should be a rich resource for studies of individual objects such as supernova remnants, HII regions and planetary nebulae, as well as extended features such as the diffuse emission from synchrotron radiation.
