We have performed a deep optical imaging of 3C 58 SNR with the NOT in the B and V bands to detect the optical counterpart of the associated pulsar J0295+6449 and its torus-like wind nebula visible in X-rays. We analyzed our data together with the archival data obtained with the Chandra in X-rays and with the Spitzer in the mid-IR. We detect a faint extended elliptical object with B=24.06 and V=23.11 whose peak brightness and center position are consistent at the sub-arcsecond level with the position of the pulsar. Its morphology and orientation are in excellent agreement with the torus-like pulsar nebula, seen almost edge on in X-rays although its extension is only about a half of that in X-rays. In the optical we likely see only the brightest central part of the torus with the pulsar. The object is identical to the counterpart of the torus recently detected in the mid-IR. The estimated pulsar contribution to the optical flux is less than 10%. Combinig the optical/mid-IR fluxes and X-ray power-law spectrum extracted from the spatial region constrained by the optical/IR source extent we compile a tentative multi-wavelength spectrum of the central part of the nebula. Within uncertainties of the interstellar extinction it is reminiscent of either the Crab or B0540-69 pulsar wind nebula spectra. The properties of the object strongly suggest it to be the optical counterpart of the 3C 58 pulsar + its wind nebula system, making 3C 58 the third member of such a class of the torus-like systems identified in the optical and mid-IR.
