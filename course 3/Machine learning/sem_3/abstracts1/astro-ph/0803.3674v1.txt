This paper proposes a method for constructing an experimental power beam pattern (PB) of RATAN-600 based on the sample of NVSS sources observed in the process of a deep sky survey near local zenith. The data obtained from observations of radio sources at wave 7.6 cm in nine bands of the survey (the 2002 and 2003 sets) are used to construct vertical PB of the telescope at rather large offsets from the central horizontal section of the PB (+/-36'). The experimental PBs obtained using different methods are compared and the root-mean-square deviations of the experimental PB from the corresponding computed PB are determined. The stability of the power beam pattern in its central part (+/-6') during the RATAN-600 Zenith Field (RZF) survey (1998-2003) and the accuracies of the fluxes of the sources observed within the framework of this survey and included into the RZF catalog are estimated.
