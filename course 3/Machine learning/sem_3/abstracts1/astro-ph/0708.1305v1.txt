We present an analysis of the X-ray spectra of a sample of 37 observations of 26 Seyfert galaxies observed by XMM-Newton in order to characterize their iron K emission. All objects show evidence for iron line emission in the 6-7 keV band. A narrow core at 6.4 keV is seen almost universally in the spectra, and we model this using a neutral Compton reflection component, assumed to be associated with distant, optically thick material such as the molecular torus. Once this, and absorption by a zone of ionized gas in the line-of-sight is accounted for, less than half of the sample observations show an acceptable fit. Approximately 2/3 of the sample shows evidence for further, broadened emission in the iron K-band. When modeled with a Gaussian, the inferred energy is close to that expected for neutral iron, with a slight redshift, with an average velocity width of ~0.1c. The mean parameters are consistent with previous ASCA results and support the idea that the broad components can be associated with the accretion disk. Before proceeding to that conclusion, we test an alternative model comprising a blend of 3-4 narrow, unshifted emission lines (including the 6.4 keV core), together with 1-2 zones of highly ionized gas in the line-of-sight. Around 1/3 of the objects are not adequately fit by this model, and in general better fits are obtained with a relativistic disk line model, which has fewer free parameters. Nonetheless we find that absorption by ionized gas affects the spectrum above 2.5 keV in approximately half the sample. There is evidence for multiple ionized zones in at least 3 objects, but in all those cases a blurred reflector is required in addition to the complex absorption. (truncated)
