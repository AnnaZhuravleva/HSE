ALMA will be able to detect a broad spectrum of molecular lines in galaxies. Current aperture synthesis observations indicate that the molecular line emission from galaxies is remarkably variable, even on kpc scales. Imaging spectroscopy at resolutions of an arcsecond or better will reduce the chemical complexity by allowing regions of physical conditions to be defined and classified.
