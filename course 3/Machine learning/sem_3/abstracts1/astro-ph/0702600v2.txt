At redshifts z >~ 30 neutral hydrogen gas absorbs CMB radiation at the 21cm spin-flip frequency. In principle this is observable and a high-precision probe of cosmology. We calculate the linear-theory angular power spectrum of this signal and cross-correlation between redshifts on scales much larger than the line width. In addition to the well known redshift-distortion and density perturbation sources a full linear analysis gives additional contributions to the power spectrum. On small scales there is a percent-level linear effect due to perturbations in the 21cm optical depth, and perturbed recombination modifies the gas temperature perturbation evolution (and hence spin temperature and 21cm power spectrum). On large scales there are several post-Newtonian and velocity effects; although negligible on small scales, these additional terms can be significant at l <~ 100 and can be non-zero even when there is no background signal. We also discuss the linear effect of reionization re-scattering, which damps the entire spectrum and gives a very small polarization signal on large scales. On small scales we also model the significant non-linear effects of evolution and gravitational lensing. We include full results for numerical calculation and also various approximate analytic results for the power spectrum and evolution of small scale perturbations.
