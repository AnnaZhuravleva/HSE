We study the possibility of evading astrophysical bound on light pseudoscalars. We argue that the solar bounds can be evaded if we have a sufficiently strong self-coupling of the pseudoscalars. The required coupling does not conflict with any known experimental bounds. We also show that it is possible to find a coupling range such that the recent PVLAS experiment is not in conflict with any astrophysical bounds.
