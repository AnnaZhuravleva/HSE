We measure the rest-frame B-band luminosity function of red-sequence galaxies (RSLF) of five intermediate-redshift (0.5 < z < 0.9), high-mass (sigma > 950 km/s) clusters. Cluster galaxies are identified through photometric redshifts based on imaging in seven bands (five broad, and two narrow) using the WIYN 3.5m telescope. The luminosity functions are well-fit down to M_B^*+3 for all of the clusters out to a radius of R_200. For comparison, the luminosity functions for a sample of 59 low redshift clusters selected from the SDSS are measured as well. There is a brightening trend (M_B^* increases by 0.7 mags by z=0.75) with redshift comparable to what is seen in the field for similarly defined galaxies, although there is a hint that the cluster red-sequence brightening is more rapid in the past (z>0.5), and relatively shallow at more recent times. Contrary to other claims, we find little evidence for evolution of the faint end slope. Previous indications of evolution may be due to limitations in measurement technique, bias in the sample selection, and cluster to cluster variation. As seen in both the low and high redshift sample, a significant amount of variation in luminosity functions parameters alpha and M^* exists between individual clusters.
