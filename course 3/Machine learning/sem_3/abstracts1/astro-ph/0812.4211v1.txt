We discuss the present performance and the future perspectives of VLBI in the 3 mm to 0.85 mm observing bands (so called mm-VLBI). The availability of new telescopes and the recent technical development towards larger observing bandwidth and higher data-rates now allow to image with 3mm-VLBI hundreds of sources with high dynamic range. As an example we show new images of the jets of Cygnus A. At 1.3 mm, pilot VLBI studies have proven detectability of the brightest AGN, and the existence of ultra-compact regions therein. In the next few years global VLBI imaging will be established also at 1.3 mm and 0.85 mm wavelength. With an angular resolution in the 10-20 micro-arcsecond range, future 1.3 mm- and 0.8 mm VLBI will be an extraordinarily powerful astronomical observing method, allowing to image the enigmatic `central engines' and the foot-points of AGN-jets in greater detail than ever possible before. A sufficiently large number of telescopes is a prerequisite for global aperture synthesis imaging. Therefore a strong effort is needed to make more telescopes available for VLBI at short millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. In this context, the further VLBI upgrade of both IRAM telescopes and the outfit of the APEX telescope in Chile, in preparation for later mm-/sub-mm VLBI with ALMA, is of high scientific importance. With a sufficiently large mm-VLBI network, the micro-arcsecond scale imaging of the post-Newtonian emission zone around the event horizon/ergosphere of nearby super-massive Black Holes (such as e.g. Sgr A*, M87, ...) should become possible within the next few years.
