Herbig-Haro jets often show some degree of curvature along their path, in many cases produced by the ram pressure of a side-wind. We present simulations of both laboratory and astrophysical curved jets and experimental results from laboratory experiments. We discuss the properties and similarities of the laboratory and astrophysical flow, which show the formation of internal shocks and working surfaces. In particular the results illustrate how the break-up of the bow-shock and clumps in the flow are produced without invoking jet variability; we also discuss how jet rotation reduces the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in curved jets.
