While the importance of phase space constraints for gravitational clustering of neutrinos (which are fermions) is well recognized, the explicit use of such constraints to limit neutrino emission from ultra energetic sources has not been stressed. Special and general relativistic phase space constraints are shown to limit neutrino luminosities in compact sources in various situations.
