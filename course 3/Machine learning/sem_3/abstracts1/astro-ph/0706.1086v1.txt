The discovery of many objects with unprecedented, amazing observational characteristics caused the last decade to be the most prolific period for the supernova research. Many of these new supernovae are transitional objects between existing classes, others well enter within the defined classes, but still show unique properties. This makes the traditional classification scheme inadequate to take into account the overall SN variety and, consequently, requires the introduction of new subclasses.
