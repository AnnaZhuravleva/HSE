I study stellar structures $i.e.$ the mass, the radius, the moment of inertia and the oblateness parameter at different spin frequencies for strange stars and neutron stars in a comparative manner. I also calculate the values of the radii of the marginally stable orbits and Keplerian orbital frequencies. By equating kHz QPO frequencies to Keplerian orbital frequencies, I find corresponding orbital radii. Knowledge about these parameters might be useful in further modeling of the observed features from LMXBs with advanced and improved future techniques for observations and data analysis.
