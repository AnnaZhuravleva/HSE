XMM-Newton and Chandra have greatly deepened our knowledge of stellar coronae giving access to a variety of new diagnostics such that nowadays a review of stellar X-ray astronomy necessarily must focus on a few selected topics. Attempting to provide a limited but representative overview of recent discoveries I discuss three subjects: the solar-stellar connection, the nature of coronae in limiting regimes of stellar dynamos, and "hot topics" on X-ray emission from pre-main sequence stars.
