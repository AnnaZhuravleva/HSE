We present infrared observations of 66 starburst galaxies over a wide range of oxygen abundances, to measure how metallicity affects their dust properties. The data include imaging and spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope, supplemented by groundbased near-infrared imaging. We confirm a strong correlation of aromatic emission with metallicity, with a threshold at a metallicity [12+log(O/H)]~8. The large scatter in both the metallicity and radiation hardness dependence of this behavior implies that it is not due to a single effect, but to some combination. We show that the far-infrared color temperature of the large dust grains increases towards lower metallicity, peaking at a metallicity of 8 before turning over. We compute dust masses and compare them to HI masses from the literature to derive the gas to dust ratio, which increases by nearly 3 orders of magnitude between solar metallicity and a metallicity of 8, below which it flattens out. The abrupt change in aromatic emission at mid-infrared wavelengths thus appears to be reflected in the far-infrared properties, indicating that metallicity changes affect the composition of the full range of dust grain sizes that dominate the infrared emission. In addition, we find that the ratio L(8 micron)/L(TIR), important for calibrating 24 micron measurements of high redshift galaxies, increases slightly as the metallicity decreases from ~solar to ~50% of solar, and then decreases by an order of magnitude with further decreases in metallicity. Although the great majority of galaxies show similar patterns of behavior as described above, there are three exceptions, SBS 0335-052E, Haro 11, and SHOC 391. Their infrared SEDs are dominated energetically by the mid-IR near 24 micron rather than by the 60 - 200 micron region. (Abridged)
