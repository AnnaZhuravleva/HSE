We establish a simple model for the distribution of cold gas around L* galaxies using a large set of observational constraints on the properties of strong MgII absorber systems. Our analysis suggests that the halos of L* galaxies are filled with cool gaseous clouds having sizes of order 1kpc and densities of ~10^{-2} cm^{-3}. We then investigate the physical effects of cloud irradiation by a quasar and study the resulting spectral signatures. We show that quasar activity gives rise to (i) extended narrow-line emission on ~100kpc scales and (ii) an anisotropy in the properties of the absorbing gas arising from the geometry of the quasar radiation field. Provided that quasars reside in halos several times more massive than those of L* galaxies, our model predictions appear to be in agreement with observations of narrow emission-line nebulae around quasars and the recent detections of ~100kpc cold gaseous envelopes around those objects, suggesting a common origin for these phenomena. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding absorption systems, probing quasar environments at high redshifts, and testing the quasar unification scheme.
