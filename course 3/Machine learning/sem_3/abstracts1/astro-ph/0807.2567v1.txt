Sources of gravitational waves (GW) and emitters of high energy (HE) neutrinos both involve compact objects and matter moving at relativistic speeds. Coincidences between Virgo and Antares would give a unique insight on the physics of the most powerful objects in the Universe. The feasibility of such GW/HE neutrino coincidences is analysed.
