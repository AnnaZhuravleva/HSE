We present the modeling of partial frequency redistribution (PRD) effects for the fluorescent emission lines of molecular hydrogen, the general computational approximations, and the applications to planetary atmospheres, as well as interstellar medium. Our model is applied to FUSE observations of Jupiter, Saturn, and reflection nebulae, allowing an independent confirmation of the H2 abundance and the structure of planetary atmospheres.
