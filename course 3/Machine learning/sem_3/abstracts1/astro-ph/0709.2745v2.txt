The thermodynamical properties of dark energy are usually investigated with the equation of state $\omega =\omega_{0}+\omega_{1}z$. Recent observations show that our universe is accelerating, and the apparent horizon and the event horizon vary with redshift $z$. When definitions of the temperature and entropy of a black hole are used to the two horizons of the universe, we examine the thermodynamical properties of the universe which is enveloped by the apparent horizon and the event horizon respectively. We show that the first and the second laws of thermodynamics inside the apparent horizon in any redshift are satisfied, while they are broken down inside the event horizon in some redshift. Therefore, the apparent horizon for the universe may be the boundary of thermodynamical equilibrium for the universe like the event horizon for a black hole.
