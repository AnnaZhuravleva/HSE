Observations of the pair of galaxies VV 330 with the SCORPIO multimode instrument on the 6-m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope are presented. Large-scale velocity fields of the ionized gas in H-alfa and brightness distributions in continuum and H-alfa have been constructed for both galaxies with the help of a scanning Fabry Perot interferometer. Long-slit spectroscopy is used to study the stellar kinematics. Analysis of the data obtained has revealed a complex structure in each of the pair components. Three kinematic subsystems have been identified in UGC 5600: a stellar disk, an inner gas ring turned with respect to the disk through ~80degrees, and an outer gas disk. The stellar and outer gas disks are noncoplanar. Possible scenarios for the formation of the observed multicomponent kinematic galactic structure are considered, including the case where the large-scale velocity field of the gas is represented by the kinematic model of a disk with a warp. The velocity field in the second galaxy of the pair, UGC 5609, is more regular. A joint analysis of the data on the photometric structure and the velocity field has shown that this is probably a late-type spiral galaxy whose shape is distorted by the gravitational interaction, possibly, with UGC 5600.
