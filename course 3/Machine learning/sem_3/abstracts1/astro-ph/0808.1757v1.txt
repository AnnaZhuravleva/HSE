We discuss possible mechanisms of acceleration of particles in solar flares and show that turbulence plays an important role in all the mechanism. It is also argued that stochastic particle acceleration by turbulent plasma waves is the most likely mechanism for production of the high energy electrons and ions responsible for observed radiative signatures of solar flares and for solar energetic particle or SEPs, and that the predictions of this model agrees well with many past and recent high spectral and temporal observations of solar flares. It is shown that, in addition, the model explains many features of SEPs that accompany flares. In particular we show that it can successfully explain the observed extreme enhancement, relative to photospheric values, of $^3$He ions and the relative spectra of $^3$He and $^4$He. It has also the potential of explaining the relative abundances of most ions including the increasing enhancements of heavy ions with ion mass or mass-to-charge ratio.
