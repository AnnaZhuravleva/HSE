I discuss a prospect for mode identification from two-passband photometry of forthcoming BRITE space mission. Examples of photometric diagnostic diagrams are shown for three types of main sequence pulsating variables: $\beta$ Cephei, Slowly Pulsating B-type and $\delta$ Scuti stars. I consider also taking into account the radial velocity data from simultaneous spectroscopy, which can be carried out from the ground. With such observations, much better discrimination of the spherical harmonic degree, $\ell$, can be accomplished and more constraints on stellar parameters and input physics can be derived.
