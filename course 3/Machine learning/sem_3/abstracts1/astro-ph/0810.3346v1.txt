The existence of old dispersed stellar groups within the Milky Way disk is still controversial. Are they the debris of ancient star-forming aggregates, or short-lived artifacts of dynamical origin? With detailed elemental abundance measurements from high quality spectroscopic data, we show that at least one such old dispersed stellar group is a true relic of an earlier phase of star formation. The identification of other such relic structures will provide essential information for probing the evolutionary history of the Milky Way disk.
