The frequency difference between a model used only two-point interpolation of opacity and a model used piecewise linear interpolation of opacity is of the order of several microHertz at a certain stage, which is almost 10 times worse than the observational precision of p-modes of solar-like stars. Therefore, the two-point interpolation of opacity is unsuitable in modelling of solar-like stars with element diffusion.
