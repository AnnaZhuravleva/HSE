Using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at the ESO 2.2m telescope at La Silla and the CPAPIR camera at the CTIO 1.5m telescope at Cerro Tololo, we have performed an extensive, multiband photometric survey of the open cluster IC2391 (D~146pc, age~50Myr, solar metallicity). Here we present the results from our photometric survey and from a spectroscopic follow-up of the central part of the survey.
