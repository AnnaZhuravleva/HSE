We present an updated catalog of 1300 objects in the field of M31, including 670 likely star clusters of various types. Archival images were inspected to confirm cluster classifications where possible, but most of the classifications were based on spectra taken of ~1000 objects with the Hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5m MMT. The spectra and images of young clusters are analyzed in detail in this paper. Ages, reddenings and masses of 140 young clusters are derived by comparing the observed spectra and photometry with model spectra. We find these to have masses as great as 10^5 with a median of 10^4 M_sun, and a median age of 0.25 Gyr. Thus these clusters are similar in mass to the LMC young massive clusters, and are in between Milky Way open clusters and the globulars of M31 and the Milky Way. Most of the M31 young clusters have the low concentration typical of Milky Way open clusters, and we expect that most of these will be disrupted in the next Gyr, but a few have high concentrations and will likely survive longer. The spatial distribution of the young clusters is well correlated with the star-forming regions as mapped out by mid-IR emission. A kinematic analysis likewise confirms the spatial association of the young clusters with the young disk in M31.
