In hierarchical models, the time derivative of the halo mass function may be thought of as the difference of two terms - a creation term, which describes the increase in the number of haloes of mass m from mergers of less massive objects, and a destruction term, which describes the decrease in the number of m-haloes as these merge with other haloes, creating more massive haloes as a result. In models where haloes form from a spherical collapse, the distribution of halo creation times can be estimated from the same formalism which is used to estimate halo abundances: the constant-barrier excursion-set approach. In the excursion set approach, moving, rather than constant-barriers, are necessary for estimating halo abundances when the collapse is triaxial. We show how the corresponding estimates are modified by providing analytic estimates of the creation rate for a wide range of halo masses. We then show that these moving-barrier based predictions are in better agreement with measurements in numerical simulations than are the corresponding predictions of the spherical collapse model. These results should be useful for studies of merger-driven star-formation rates and AGN activity. We also present a similar study of creation of haloes conditioned on belonging to an object of a certain mass today, and reach similar conclusions - the moving barrier based estimates are in substantially better agreement with the simulations. This part of the study may be useful for understanding the tendency for the oldest stars to exist in the most massive objects.
