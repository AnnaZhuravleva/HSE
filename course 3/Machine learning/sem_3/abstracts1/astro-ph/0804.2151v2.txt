We present our multicolour photometric data of the primary and secondary eclipses of OW Gem that took place in 1995, 2002, and 2006, as well as the new radial-velocity data collected since 1993 by R. F. Griffin and A. Duquennoy. The Wilson-Devinney code was used for the simultaneous solution of both photometric and spectroscopic data. A complete set of orbital and physical parameters of the components was obtained. The pair of values, eccentricity e=0.5286 and argument of periastron omega=140.73 degree, give better compatibility of the moment of the secondary minimum with the observations compared to previous estimates.
