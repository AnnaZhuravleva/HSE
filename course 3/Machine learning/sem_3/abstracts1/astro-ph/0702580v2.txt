The radial distribution of luminous L_X>10^{36} erg/s X-ray point sources in the bulge of M31 is investigated using archival Chandra observations. We find a significant increase of the specific frequency of X-ray sources, per unit stellar mass, within 1 arcmin from the centre of the galaxy. The radial distribution of surplus sources in this region follows the density squared law, suggesting that they are low-mass X-ray binaries formed dynamically in the dense inner bulge. We investigate dynamical formation of LMXBs, paying particular attention to the high velocity regime characteristic for galactic bulges, which has not been explored previously. Our calculations suggest that the majority of the surplus sources are formed in tidal captures of black holes by main sequence stars of low mass, M<0.3-0.4 M_sol, with some contribution of NS systems of same type. Due to the small size of the accretion discs a fraction of such systems may be persistent X-ray sources. Some of sources may be ultra-compact X-ray binaries with helium star/white dwarf companions. We also predict a large number of faint transients, both NS and BH systems, within 1 arcmin from the M31 galactic centre. Finally, we consider the population of dynamically formed binaries in Galactic globular clusters, emphasizing the differences between these two types of stellar environments
