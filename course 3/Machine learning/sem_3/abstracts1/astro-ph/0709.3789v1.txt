While waiting for new gamma-ray burst detections, the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift covers each day ~50% of the sky in the hard X-ray band (``Survey data''). The large field of view (FOV), high sensitivity and good angular resolution make BAT a potentially powerful all-sky hard X-ray monitor, provided that mask--related systematics can be properly accounted for. We have developed and tested a complete procedure entirely based on public Swift/BAT software tools to analyse BAT Survey data, aimed at assessing the flux and spectral variability of bright sources in the 15-150 keV energy range. Detailed tests of the capabilities of our procedure were performed focusing, in particular, on the reliability of spectral measurements over the entire BAT FOV. First, we analyzed a large set of Crab observations, spread over ~7 months. Next, we studied the case of GRO J1655-40, a strongly variable source, which experienced a 9-month long outburst, beginning on February 2005. Such an outburst was systematically monitored with the well-calibrated PCA and HEXTE instruments on board the RXTE mission. Thanks to the good BAT temporal coverage of the source, we have been able to cross-check BAT light-curves with simultaneous HEXTE ones. The Crab tests have shown that our procedure recovers both the flux and the source spectral shape over the whole FOV of the BAT instrument. Moreover, by cross-checking GRO J1655-40 light-curves obtained by BAT and HEXTE, we found the spectral and flux evolution of the outburst to be in very good agreement. Using our procedure, BAT reproduces HEXTE fluxes within a 10-15% uncertainty with a 3sigma sensitivity of ~20 mCrab for an on-axis source, thus establishing its capability to monitor the evolution of relatively bright hard X-rays sources.
