In this work a satisfactory, simple theoretical prediction of the data corresponding to observationally (by fine tuning condition) estimated value of the cosmological constant is given. It is supposed (in conceptually analogy with holographic principle) that cosmological constant, like classical surface tension coefficient by a liquid drop, does not correspond to a volume (bulk) vacuum mass (energy) density distribution but that it corresponds to a surface vacuum mass (energy) density distribution. Then form of given surface mass distribution and fine tuning condition imply observed growing (for $\sim$ 61 magnitude order) of the scale factor (from initial, corresponding to Planck length, to recent, at the beginning of the cosmic acceleration, corresponding to 10 Glyr length).
