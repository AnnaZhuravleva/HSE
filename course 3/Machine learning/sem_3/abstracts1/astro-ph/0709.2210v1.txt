The emission of relativistic electrons moving in the random and small-scale magnetic field is presented by diffusive synchrotron radiation (DSR). In this Letter, we revisit the perturbative treatment of DSR. We propose that random and small-scale magnetic field might be generated by the turbulence. As an example, multi-band radiation of the knot in Cen A comes from the electrons with energy $\gamma_e\sim 10^3-10^4$ in the magnetic field of $10^{-3}G$. The multi-band spectrum of DSR is well determined by the feature of stochastic magnetic field. These results put strong constraint to the models of particle acceleration.
