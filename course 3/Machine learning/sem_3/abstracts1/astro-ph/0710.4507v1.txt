We study the evolution of scalar perturbations in the radiation-dominated era of Randall-Sundrum braneworld cosmology by numerically solving the coupled bulk and brane master wave equations. We find that density perturbations with wavelengths less than a critical value (set by the bulk curvature length) are amplified during horizon re-entry. Conversely, we explicitly confirm from simulations that the spectrum is identical to GR on large scales. Although this magnification is not relevant for the cosmic microwave background or measurements of large scale structure, it may have some bearing on the formation of primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum models.
