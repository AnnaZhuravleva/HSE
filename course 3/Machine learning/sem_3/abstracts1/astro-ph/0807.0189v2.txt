Using the GALEX ultraviolet imagers we have observed a region of nebulosity first identified as starlight scattered by interstellar dust by Sandage (1976). Apart from airglow and zodiacal emission, we have found a diffuse UV background of between 500 and 800 \phunit in both the \galex FUV (1350 -- 1750 \AA) and NUV (1750 -- 2850 \AA). Of this emission, up to 250 \phunit is due to \htwo fluorescent emission in the FUV band; the remainder is consistent with scattering from interstellar dust. We have estimated the optical constants to be $a = 0.3; g = 0.7$ in the FUV and $a = 0.5; g = 0.7$ in the NUV, implying highly forward scattering grains, plus an extragalactic contribution of as much as 150 \phunit. These are the highest spatial resolution observations of the diffuse UV background to date and show an intrinsic scatter beyond that expected from instrumental noise alone. Further modeling is required to understand the nature of this scatter and its implications for the ISM.
