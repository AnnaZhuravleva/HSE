We present high angular resolution observations of the HC$_3$N J=5--4 line from the Egg nebula, which is the archetype of protoplanetary nebulae. We find that the HC$_{\rm 3}$N emission in the approaching and receding portion of the envelope traces a clumpy hollow shell, similar to that seen in normal carbon rich envelopes. Near the systemic velocity, the hollow shell is fragmented into several large blobs or arcs with missing portions correspond spatially to locations of previously reported high--velocity outlows in the Egg nebula. This provides direct evidence for the disruption of the slowly--expanding envelope ejected during the AGB phase by the collimated fast outflows initiated during the transition to the protoplanetary nebula phase. We also find that the intersection of fast molecular outflows previously suggested as the location of the central post-AGB star is significantly offset from the center of the hollow shell. From modelling the HC$_3$N distribution we could reproduce qualitatively the spatial kinematics of the HC$_3$N J=5--4 emission using a HC$_3$N shell with two pairs of cavities cleared by the collimated high velocity outflows along the polar direction and in the equatorial plane. We infer a relatively high abundance of HC$_3$N/H$_2$ $\sim$3x10$^{-6}$ for an estimated mass--loss rate of 3x10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in the HC$_3$N shell. The high abundance of HC$_3$N and the presence of some weaker J=5--4 emission in the vicinity of the central post-AGB star suggest an unusually efficient formation of this molecule in the Egg nebula.
