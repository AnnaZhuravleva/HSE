We constructed the magnetic field oscillation model (hereafter the MO model) by analogizing the periodically reversing phenomenon of the solar magnetic field to pulsars. Almost all kinds of pulsar radiation phenomena are best explained using the MO model, especially polarization characteristics, glitch, generation rate, the geodetic precession of pulsars and the configuration of pulsar-wind nebula of the Crab. The MO model also provides satisfactory explanation for other characteristics of pulsars, e.g., interpulse, spin-down, pulse nulling, beat and pulse drift, the loss rate of the rotating energy, and the accuracy of frequency. We present eight verification methods for the MO model. In addition to pulsars, our MO model can also be used to explain the pulse emission from non-compact stars such as the ultracool dwarf TVLM 513-46546 and the magnetic chemically peculiar star CU Virginis.
