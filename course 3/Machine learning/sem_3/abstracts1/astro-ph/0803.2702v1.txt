The eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary 4U is the prototypical accretion disk corona (ADC) system. We have obtained new time-resolved UV spectrograms of 4U with the Hubble Space Telescope and new V- and J-band light curves with the 1.3-m SMARTS telescope at CTIO. We present an updated ephemeris for the times of the optical/UV eclipses. Model light curves do not give acceptable fits to the UV eclipses unless the models include an optically-thick ADC.
