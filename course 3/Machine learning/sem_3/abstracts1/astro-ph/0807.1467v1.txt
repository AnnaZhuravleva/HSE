We searched for the presence of extended emission-line regions (EELRs) around low-redshift QSOs. We observed a sample of 20 mainly radio-quiet low-redshift quasars (z<0.3) by means of integral field spectroscopy. After decomposing the extended and nuclear emission components, we constructed [OIII] 5007 narrow-band images of the EELR to measure the total flux. From the same data we obtained high S/N (>50) nuclear spectra to measure properties such as [OIII]/Hbeta flux ratios, FeII equivalent widths and Hbeta line widths. A significant fraction of the quasars (8/20) show a luminous EELR, with detected linear sizes of several kpc. Whether or not a QSO has a luminous EELR is strongly related with nuclear properties, in the sense that an EELR was detected in objects with low FeII equivalent width and large Hbeta FWHM. The EELRs were detected preferentially in QSOs with larger black hole masses. There is no discernible relation, however, between EELR detection and QSO luminosity and Eddington ratio.
