Exact stationary axially symmetric solutions of the 4D Einstein equations with corotating pressureless perfect fluid sources are studied. A particular solution with approximately flat rotation curve is discussed in some detail. We find that simple Newtonian arguments overestimate the amount of matter needed to explain these curves by more than 30%. The crucial insight gained by this model is that the Newtonian approximation breaks down globally, even though it is valid locally everywhere. No conflict with solar system tests arises.
