We present the results of the analysis of the first 9 months of data of the Swift BAT survey of AGN in the 14-195 keV band. Using archival X-ray data or follow-up Swift XRT observations, we have identified 129 (103 AGN) of 130 objects detected at |b|> 15 deg and with significance >4.8 sigma. One source remains unidentified. These same X-ray data have allowed measurement of the X-ray properties of the objects. We fit a power law to the log N - log S distribution, and find the slope to be 1.42+/-0.14. Characterizing the differential luminosity function data as a broken power law, we find a break luminosity log L_*(erg/s) = 43.85+/-0.26, a low luminosity power law slope a=0.84^{+0.16}_{-0.22}, and a high luminosity power law slope b=2.55^{+0.43}_{-0.30}, similar to the values that have been reported based on INTEGRAL data. We obtain a mean photon index 1.98 in the 14-195 keV band, with an rms spread of 0.27. Integration of our luminosity function gives a local volume density of AGN above 10^{41} erg/s of 2.4x10^{-3}/Mpc^3, which is about 10% of the total luminous local galaxy density above M_*=-19.75. We have obtained X-ray spectra from the literature and from Swift XRT follow-up observations. These show that the distribution of log n_H is essentially flat from n_H=10^{20}/cm^{2} to 10^{24}/cm^2, with 50% of the objects having column densities of less than 10^{22}/cm^{2}. BAT Seyfert galaxies have a median redshift of 0.03, a maximum log luminosity of 45.1, and approximately half have log n_H > 22.
