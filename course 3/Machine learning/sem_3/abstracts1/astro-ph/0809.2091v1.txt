To investigate the role of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in driving the evolution of their host galaxies, we have carried out a study of the environments and optical properties of galaxies harboring X-ray luminous AGN in the Cl1604 supercluster at z~0.9. Making use of Chandra, HST/ACS and Keck/DEIMOS observations, we examine the integrated colors, morphologies and spectral properties of nine moderate-luminosity (L_x ~ 10^43 erg s^-1) type 2 Seyferts detected in the Cl1604 complex. We find that the AGN are predominantly hosted by luminous spheroids and/or bulge dominated galaxies which have colors that place them in the valley between the blue cloud and red sequence in color-magnitude space, consistent with predictions that AGN hosts should constitute a transition population. Half of the hosts have bluer overall colors as a result of blue resolved cores in otherwise red spheroids and a majority show signs of recent or pending interactions. We also find a substantial number exhibit strong Balmer absorption features indicative of post-starburst galaxies, despite the fact that we detect narrow [OII] emission lines in all of the host spectra. If the [OII] lines are due in part to AGN emission, as we suspect, then this result implies that a significant fraction of these galaxies (44%) have experienced an enhanced level of star formation within the last ~1 Gyr which was rapidly suppressed. Overall we find that the properties of the nine host galaxies are generally consistent with a scenario in which recent interactions have triggered both increased levels of nuclear activity and an enhancement of centrally concentrated star formation, followed by a rapid truncation of the latter, possibly as a result of feedback from the AGN itself.
