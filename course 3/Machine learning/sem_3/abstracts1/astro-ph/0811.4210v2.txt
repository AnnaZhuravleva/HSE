We present MASSCLEAN, a new, sophisticated and robust stellar cluster image and photometry simulation package. This visualization tool is able to create color-magnitude diagrams and standard FITS images in any of the traditional optical and near-infrared bands based on cluster characteristics input by the user, including but not limited to distance, age, mass, radius and extinction. At the limit of very distant, unresolved clusters, we have checked the integrated colors created in MASSCLEAN against those from other simple stellar population models with consistent results. We have also tested models which provide a reasonable estimate of the field star contamination in images and color-magnitude diagrams. We demonstrate the package by simulating images and color-magnitude diagrams of well known massive Milky Way clusters and compare their appearance to real data. Because the algorithm populates the cluster with a discrete number of tenable stars, it can be used as part of a Monte Carlo Method to derive the pr obabilistic range of characteristics (integrated colors, for example) consistent with a given cluster mass and age. Our simulation package is available for download and will run on any standard desktop running UNIX/Linux. Full documentation on installation and its use is also available. Finally, a web-based version of MASSCLEAN which can be immediately used and is sufficiently adaptable for most applications is available through a web interface.
