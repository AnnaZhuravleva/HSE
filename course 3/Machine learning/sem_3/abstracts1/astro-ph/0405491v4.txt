Elliptical galaxies are modelled with a a 4-component model: Sersic stars, LCDM dark matter (DM), hot gas and central black hole. DM is negligible in the inner regions, which are dominated by stars and the central black hole. This prevents any kinematical estimate (using a Jeans analysis) of the inner slope of the DM density profile. The gas fraction rises, but the baryon fraction decreases with radius, at least out to 10 effective radii (R_e). Even with line-of-sight velocity dispersion (VD) measurements at 4 to 6 R_e with 20 km/s accuracy and perfectly known velocity anisotropy, the total mass within the virial radius (r_v) is uncertain by a factor over 3. The DM distributions found in LCDM simulations are consistent with the stellar VD profiles, but appear inconsistent with the low VDs measured by Romanowsky et al. (2003) of planetary nebulae between 2 and 5 R_e, which imply such low M/Ls that the baryon fraction within r_v must be greater than the universal value. Replacing the NFW DM model by the new model of Navarro et al. (2004) decreases slightly the VD at a given radius. So, given the observed VD measured at 5 R_e, the inferred M/L within r_v is 40% larger than predicted with the NFW model. Folding in the slight (strong) radial anisotropy found in LCDM (merger) simulations, which is well modelled (much better than with the Osipkov-Merritt formula) with beta(r) = 1/2 r/(r+a), the inferred M/L within r_v is another 1.6 (2.4) times higher than for the isotropic NFW model. Thus, the DM model and radial anisotropy can partly explain the low PN VDs, but not in full. In an appendix, single integral expressions are derived for the VDs in terms of the tracer density and total mass profiles, for 3 anisotropic models: radial, Osipkov-Merritt, and the model above, for general radial profiles of luminosity density and mass.
