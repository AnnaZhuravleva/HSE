Interacting quintessence models have been proposed to explain or, at least, alleviate the coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration. In this paper we are concerned with two aspects of these kind of models: (i) the dynamical evolution of the model of Chimento et al. [L.P. Chimento, A.S. Jakubi, D. Pavon, and W. Zimdahl, Phys. Rev. D 67, 083513 (2003).], i.e., whether its cosmological evolution gives rise to a right sequence of radiation, dark matter and dark energy dominated eras, and (ii) whether the dark matter dark energy ratio asymptotically evolves towards a non-zero constant. After showing that the model correctly reproduces these eras, we correlate three data sets that constrain the interaction at three redshift epochs: $z\le 10^{4}$, $z=10^{3}$, and $z=1$. We discuss the model selection and argue that even if the model under consideration fulfills both requirements, it is heavily constrained by observation. The prospects that the coincidence problem can be explained by the coupling of dark matter to dark energy are not clearly favored by the data.
