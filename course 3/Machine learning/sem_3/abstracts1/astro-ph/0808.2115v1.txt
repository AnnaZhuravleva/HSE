Models of galactic chemical evolution (CEMs) show that the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and other assumptions regarding star formation affect the resultant abundance gradients in models of late-type galaxies. Furthermore, intermediate mass (IM) stars undeniably play an important role in the buildup of nitrogen abundances in galaxies. Here I specifically discuss the nitrogen contribution from IM/AGB stars and how it affects the N/O-gradient. For this purpose I have modelled the chemical evolution of a few nearby disc galaxies using different IMFs and star formation prescriptions. It is demonstrated that N/O-gradients may be used to constrain the nitrogen contribution from IM/AGB-stars.
