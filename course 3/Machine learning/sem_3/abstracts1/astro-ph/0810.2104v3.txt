We use the radial baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of Gaztanaga et al. (2008) to constrain parameters of dark energy models. These constraints are comparable with constraints from other "non-radial" BAO data. The radial BAO data are consistent with the time-independent cosmological constant model but do not rule out time-varying dark energy. When we combine radial BAO and the Kowalski et al. (2008) Union type Ia supernova data we get very tight constraints on dark energy.
