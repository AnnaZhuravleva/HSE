In this paper we discuss the physical conditions of clumpy nature in the IC 348 molecular cloud.   We combine new observations of fully sampled maps in [C I] at 492 GHz and 12CO 4--3, taken with the KOSMA 3 m telescope at about 1' resolution, with FCRAO data of 12CO 1--0, 13CO 1--0 and far-infrared continuum data observed by HIRES/IRAS. To derive the physical parameters of the region we analyze the three different line ratios. A first rough estimate of abundance is obtained from an LTE analysis. To understand the [C I] and CO emission from the PDRs in IC 348, we use a clumpy PDR model. With an ensemble of identical clumps, we constrain the total mass from the observed absolute intensities. Then we apply a more realistic clump distribution model with a power law index of 1.8 for clump-mass spectrum and a power law index of 2.3 for mass-size relation.   We provide detailed fits to observations at seven representative positions in the cloud, revealing clump densities between 4 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 4 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and C/CO column density ratios between 0.02 and 0.26. The derived FUV flux from the model fit is consistent with the field calculated from FIR continuum data, varying between 2 and 100 Draine units across the cloud. We find that both an ensemble of identical clumps and an ensemble with a power law clump mass distribution produce line intensities which are in good agreement (within a factor ~ 2) with the observed intensities. The models confirm the anti-correlation between the C/CO abundance ratio and the hydrogen column density found in many regions.
