We present the results of Monte Carlo simulation studies of the capability of the proposed NEMO km$^3$ telescope to detect TeV muon neutrinos from Galactic microquasars. In particular we determined the detector sensitivity to each known microquasar, optimizing the event selection in order to reject the atmospheric background. We also determined the expected number of source and background events surviving the selection.
