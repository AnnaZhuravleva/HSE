(ABRIDGED) - HD 110432 is the first proposed, and best studied, member of a growing group of Be stars with X-ray properties similar to gamma Cas. These stars exhibit hard-thermal X-ray emissions (kT ~> 7 keV) that are variable on all measurable timescales. In this work we present X-ray spectral and timing properties of HD 110432 from three XMM-Newton observations in addition to new optical spectroscopic observations. Its X-ray spectrum, complex and timing dependent, is well described in each observation by three thermal plasmas with temperatures ranging between 0.4-0.7, 3-6, and 21-37 keV. Thus, HD 110432 has the hottest thermal plasma of any known Be star. A sub-solar iron abundance (~ 0.3-0.5 x ZFe_sun) is derived for the hottest plasma. The star has a moderate 0.2-12 keV luminosity of ~ 5 x 10^32 erg/s. Recurrent flare-like events on time scales as short as ~ 10 seconds are superimposed over a slowly ~ 5-10 x 10^3 seconds varying basal flux, followed by similarly rapid hardness variabilities. There is no evidence for coherent oscillations, and an upper limit of ~ 2.5% is derived on the pulsed fraction for short pulsations from 0.005 to 2.5 Hz. In the optical region the strong and quasi-symmetrical profile of the Halpha line (EW \~ -60 Angs.) as well as the detection of several metallic lines in emission strongly suggest a dense and/or large circumstellar disk. HD 110432 has several properties reminiscence of the cataclysmic variables such as a very hot X-ray temperature and its detailed spectral features. This suggests that it might be a Be star harbouring an accreting white dwarf. On the other hand, accumulating evidence of magnetic activities in the literature supports the surface-disk of the star as being the X-ray site.
