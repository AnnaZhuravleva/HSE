We discuss integral field spectroscopy of proplyds in M42 using the FLAMES Argus unit and report the first detection of recombination lines of C II and O II from the archetypical Laques-Vidal-2 object. These lines can provide important new diagnostics of the physical conditions in proplyds. We also draw attention to the future capabilities of the MUSE spectrograph in relation to similar studies.
