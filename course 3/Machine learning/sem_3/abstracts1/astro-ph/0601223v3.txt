We present deep HST/ACS observations in g,r,i,z towards the z=4.1 radio galaxy TN J1338-1942 and its overdensity of >30 spectroscopically confirmed Lya emitters (LAEs). We select 66 g-band dropouts to z=27, 6 of which are also a LAE. Although our color-color selection results in a relatively broad redshift range centered on z=4.1, the field of TN J1338-1942 is richer than the average field at the >5 sigma significance, based on a comparison with GOODS. The angular distribution is filamentary with about half of the objects clustered near the radio galaxy, and a small, excess signal (2 sigma) in the projected pair counts at separations of <10" is interpreted as being due to physical pairs. The LAEs are young (a few x 10^7 yr), small (<r_50> = 0.13") galaxies, and we derive a mean stellar mass of ~10^8-9 Msun based on a stacked K-band image. We determine star formation rates, sizes, morphologies, and color-magnitude relations of the g-dropouts and find no evidence for a difference between galaxies near TN J1338-1942 and in the field. We conclude that environmental trends as observed in clusters at much lower redshift are either not yet present, or are washed out by the relatively broad selection in redshift. The large galaxy overdensity, its corresponding mass overdensity and the sub-clustering at the approximate redshift of TN J1338-1942 suggest the assemblage of a >10^14 Msun structure, confirming that it is possible to find and study cluster progenitors in the linear regime at z>4.
