Outflows from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) seem to be common and are thought to be important from a variety of perspectives: as an agent of chemical enhancement of the interstellar and intergalactic media, as an agent of angular momentum removal from the accreting central engine, and as an agent limiting star formation in starbursting systems by blowing out gas and dust from the host galaxy. To understand these processes, we must determine what fraction of AGNs feature outflows and understand what forms they take. We examine recent surveys of quasar absorption lines, reviewing the best means to determine if systems are intrinsic and result from outflowing material, and the limitations of approaches taken to date. The surveys reveal that, while the fraction of specific forms of outflows depends on AGN properties, the overall fraction displaying outflows is fairly constant, approximately 60%, over many orders of magnitude in luminosity. We emphasize some issues concerning classification of outflows driven by data type rather than necessarily the physical nature of outflows, and illustrate how understanding outflows probably requires more a comprehensive approach than has usually been taken in the past.
