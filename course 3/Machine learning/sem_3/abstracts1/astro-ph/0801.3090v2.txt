A new mechanism of adjustment of vacuum energy down to the observed value from an initially huge one is considered. The mechanism is based on a very strong variation of the gravitational coupling constant in very early universe. The model predicts that the non--compensated remnant of vacuum energy changes very slowly at late stages of the cosmological evolution and is naturally close to the observed one. Asymptotically the effective vacuum energy tends to a negative value, so the cosmological expansion should stop and turn into contraction. There remains the problem of introduction of the usual matter into the model and therefore realising realistic cosmology.
