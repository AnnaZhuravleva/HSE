Neutrinos interacting with the quintessence field can trigger the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In such models with a growing neutrino mass the homogeneous cosmological solution is often unstable to perturbations. We present static, spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations in the same models. They describe astophysical objects composed of neutrinos, held together by gravity and the attractive force mediated by the quintessence field. We discuss their characteristics as a function of the present neutrino mass. We suggest that these objects are the likely outcome of the growth of cosmological perturbations.
