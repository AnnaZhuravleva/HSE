We have derived R-band host galaxy fluxes of 20 TeV candidate BL Lacertae objects as a function of aperture radius and FWHM. The results are given as correction tables, that list the fluxes (in mJy) of all ``contaminating'' sources (host galaxy + significant nearby objects) as a function of aperture radius and FWHM. We found that the derived fluxes depend strongly on aperture radius, but the FWHM has only a minor effect (a few percent). We also discuss the implications of our findings to optical monitoring programs and potential sources of error in our derived fluxes. During this work we have also constructed new calibration star sequences for 9 objects and present the finding charts and calibrated magnitudes.
