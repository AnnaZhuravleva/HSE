I construct a simple model of the convective burning layer during a type I X-ray burst to investigate the effects convection has on the stability of the layer to nonradial oscillations. A linear perturbation analysis demonstrates that the region is stable to nonradial oscillations when energy transport is convection-dominated, but it is unstable when energy transport is radiation-dominated. Thus, efficient convection always dampens oscillations. These results may explain the nondetection of oscillations during the peak of some X-ray bursts.
