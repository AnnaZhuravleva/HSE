We present the second Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Ultraviolet Variability (GUVV-2) Catalog that contains information on 410 newly discovered time-variable sources gained through simultaneous near (NUV 1750-2750A) and far (FUV 1350-1750A) ultraviolet photometric observations. Source variability was determined by comparing the NUV and/or FUV fluxes derived from orbital exposures recorded during a series of multiple observational visits to 169 GALEX fields on the sky. These sources, which were contained within a sky-area of 161 square deg, varied on average by amplitudes of NUV = 0.6 mag and FUV = 0.9 mag during these observations. Of the 114 variable sources in the catalog with previously known identifications, 67 can be categorized as being active galaxies (QSO's, Seyfert 1 or BL Lac objects). The next largest groups of UV variables are RR Lyrae stars, X-ray sources and novae.   By using a combination of UV and visible color-color plots we have been able to tentatively identify 36 possible RR Lyrae and/or Delta Scuti type stars, as well as 35 probable AGN's, many of which may be previously unidentified QSO's or blazars. Finally, we show data for 3 particular variable objects: the contact binary system of SDSS J141818.97+525006.7, the eclipsing dwarf nova system of IY UMa and the highly variable unidentified source SDSS J104325.06+563258.1.
