We computed the chemical evolution of spiral bulges hosting Seyfert nuclei, based on updated chemical and spectro-photometrical evolution models for the bulge of our Galaxy, made predictions about other quantities measured in Seyferts, and modeled the photometry of local bulges. The chemical evolution model contains detailed calculations of the Galactic potential and of the feedback from the central supermassive black hole, and the spectro-photometric model covers a wide range of stellar ages and metallicities. We followed the evolution of bulges in the mass range 10^9 - 10^{11} Msun by scaling the star formation efficiency and the bulge scalelength as in the inverse-wind scenario for elliptical galaxies, and considering an Eddington limited accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. We successfully reproduced the observed black hole-host bulge mass relation. The observed nuclear bolometric luminosity is reproduced only at high redshift or for the most massive bulges; in the other cases, at z = 0 a rejuvenation mechanism is necessary. The black hole feedback is in most cases not significant in triggering the galactic wind. The observed high star formation rates and metal overabundances are easily achieved, as well as the constancy of chemical abundances with redshift and the bulge present-day colours. Those results are not affected if we vary the index of the stellar IMF from x=0.95 to x=1.35; a steeper IMF is instead required in order to reproduce the colour-magnitude relation and the present K-band luminosity of the bulge.
