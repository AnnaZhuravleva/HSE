In the neutron-rich internal shocks model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the Lorentz factors (LFs) of ion shells are variable, and so are the LFs of accompanying neutron shells. For slow neutron shells with a typical LF of approximate tens, the typical $\beta$-decay radius is $\sim 10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm. As GRBs last long enough [$T_{90}>14(1+z)$ s], one earlier but slower ejected neutron shell will be swept successively by later ejected ion shells in the range $\sim10^{13}-10^{15}$ cm, where slow neutrons have decayed significantly. Part of the thermal energy released in the interaction will be given to the electrons. These accelerated electrons will be mainly cooled by the prompt soft $\gamma-$rays and give rise to GeV emission. This kind of GeV emission is particularly important for some very long GRBs and is detectable for the upcoming satellite {\it Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope} (GLAST).
