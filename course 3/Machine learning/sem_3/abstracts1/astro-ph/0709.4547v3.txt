The interior of neutron stars contains nuclear matter at very high density for numerous subatomic particles compete with each other. Therefore, confirming the components and properties there is our significant task. Here we summarize the possible methods especial the way of r-mode instability to probe into the neutron star and show our some results. The KHz pulsar in XTE J1739-285 may give a significant implication
