In this this paper the stochastic background of gravitational waves (SBGWs) is analyzed with the auxilium of the WMAP data. We emphasize that, in general, in previous works in the literature about the SBGWs, old COBE data were used. After this, we want to face the problem of how the SBGWs and f(R) gravity can be related, showing, vice versa, that a revealed SBGWs could be a powerly probe for a given theory of gravity. In this way, it will also be shown that the conformal treatment of SBGWs can be used to parametrize in a natural way f(R) theories.
