The gamma Doradus stars are a recent class of variable main sequence F-type stars located on the red edge of the Cepheid instability strip. They pulsate in gravity modes, and this makes them particularly interesting for detailed asteroseismic analysis, which can provide fundamental knowledge of properties near the convective cores of intermediate-mass main sequence stars. To improve current understanding of gamma Dor stars through theoretical modelling, additional constraints are needed. Our aim is to estimate the fundamental atmospheric parameters and determine the chemical composition of these stars. Detailed analyses of single stars have previously suggested links to Am and lambda Bootis stars, so we wish to explore this interesting connection between chemical peculiarity and pulsation. We have analysed a sample of gamma Dor stars for the first time, including nine bona fide and three candidate members of the class. We determined the fundamental atmospheric parameters and compared the abundance pattern with other A-type stars. We used the semi-automatic software package VWA for the analysis. This code relies on the calculation of synthetic spectra and thus takes line-blending into account. This is important because of the fast rotation in some of the sample stars, and we made a thorough analysis of how VWA performs when increasing vsini. We obtained good results in agreement with previously derived fundamental parameters and abundances in a few selected reference stars with properties similar to the gamma Dor stars. We find that the abundance pattern in the gamma Dor stars is not distinct from the constant A- and F-type stars we analysed.
