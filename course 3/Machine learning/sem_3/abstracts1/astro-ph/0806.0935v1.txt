We discuss here various methodologies and an optimal strategy of the temperature and emission measure diagnostics based on Hinode X-Ray Telescope data. As an example of our results we present determination of the temperature distribution of the X-rays emitting plasma using filters ratio method and three various methods of the calculation of the differential emission measure (DEM). We have found that all these methods give results similar to the two filters ratio method. Additionally, all methods of the DEM calculation gave similar solutions. We can state that the majority of the pairs of the Hinode filters allows one to derive the temperature and emission measure in the isothermal plasma approximation using standard diagnostic based on two filters ratio method. In cases of strong flares one can also expect well conformity of the results obtained using a Withbroe - Sylwester, genetic algorithm and least-square methods of the DEM evaluation.
