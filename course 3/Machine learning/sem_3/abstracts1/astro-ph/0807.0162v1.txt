In a continuing survey of active galactic nuclei observed by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, we provide a deeper analysis of intrinsic absorption features found in 35 objects. Our survey is for low-redshift and moderate-luminosity objects, mostly Seyfert galaxies. We find a strong correlation between maximum radial velocity and luminosity. We also examine the relationships between equivalent width (EW), full width at half maximum, velocity: and continuum flux. The correlation between velocity and luminosity has been explored previously by Laor & Brandt, but at a significantly higher redshift and heavily weighted by broad absorption line quasars. We also have examined each object with multiple observations for variability in each of the aforementioned quantities, and have characterized the variation of EW with the continuum flux. In our survey, we find that variability of O VI lambda1032, lambda1038 is less common than of the UV doublets of CIV and N V seen at longer wavelengths, because the O VI absorption is usually saturated. Lyman beta absorption variability is more frequent. In a target-by-target examination we find that broad absorption line absorption and narrow absorption line absorbers are related in terms of maximum outflow velocity and luminosity, and both can be exhibited in similar luminosity objects. We also find one object that shows radial velocity change, seven objects that show equivalent width variability, and two objects that show either transverse velocity changes or a change in ionization.
