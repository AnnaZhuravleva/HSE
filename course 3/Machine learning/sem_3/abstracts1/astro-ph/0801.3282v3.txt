We compare the results of the mark correlation analysis of galaxies in a sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and from two galaxy catalogs obtained by semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the Millennium Simulation. We use the MOPED method to retrieve the star formation history of observed galaxies and use star formation parameters as weights to the mark correlations. We find an excellent match between models and observations when the mark correlations use stellar mass and luminosity as weights. The most remarkable result is related to the mark correlations associated to the evolution of mass assembly through star formation in galaxies, where we find that semi-analytical models are able to reproduce the main trends seen in the observational data. In addition, we find a good agreement between the redshift evolution of the mean total mass formed by star formation predicted by the models and that measured by MOPED. Our results show that close galaxy pairs today formed more stellar mass ~10 Gyr ago than the average, while more recently this trend is the opposite, with close pairs showing low levels of star formation activity. We also show a strong correlation in simulations between the shape and time evolution of the star formation marks and the number of major mergers experienced by galaxies, which drive the environmental dependence in galaxy formation by regulating the star formation process.
