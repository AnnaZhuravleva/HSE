Photo-heating associated with reionisation and kinetic feedback from core-collapse supernovae have previously been shown to suppress the high-redshift cosmic star formation rate. Here we investigate the interplay between photo-heating and supernova feedback using a set of cosmological, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We show that photo-heating and supernova feedback mutually amplify each other's ability to suppress the star formation rate. Our results demonstrate the importance of the simultaneous, non-independent inclusion of these two processes in models of galaxy formation to estimate the strength of the total negative feedback they exert. They may therefore be of particular relevance to semi-analytic models in which the effects of photo-heating and supernova feedback are implicitly assumed to act independently of each other.
