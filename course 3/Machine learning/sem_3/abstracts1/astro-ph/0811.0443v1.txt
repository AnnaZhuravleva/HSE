Lac OB1 is a nearby OB association in its final stage of star formation. While the member stars suggest an expansion time scale of tens of Myr, the latest star formation episode, as manifested by the existence of massive and pre-main sequence stars, took place no more than a few Myr ago. The remnant molecular clouds in the region provide evidence of starbirth triggered by massive stars.
