A-type stars have a complex internal structure with the possibility of multiple convection zones. If not sufficiently separated, such zones will interact through the convectively stable regions that lie between them. It is therefore of interest to ask whether the typical conditions that exist within such stars are such that these convections zones can ever be considered as disjoint.   In this paper we present results from numerical simulations that help in understanding how increasing the distance between the convectively unstable regions are likely to interact through the stable region that separates them. This has profound implications for mixing and transport within these stars.
