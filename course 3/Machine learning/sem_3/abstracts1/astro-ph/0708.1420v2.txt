We compute the effects of a compact flat universe on the angular correlation function, the angular power spectrum, the circles-in-the-sky signature, and the covariance matrix of the spherical harmonics coefficients of the cosmic microwave background radiation using the full Boltzmann physics. Our analysis shows that the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) three-year data are well compatible with the possibility that we live in a flat 3-torus with volume ~5x10^3 Gpc^3.
