We present the results of a high sensitivity survey for 6.7 GHz methanol masers towards 22 GHz water maser using the 100 m Efflesberg telescope. A total of 89 sources were observed and 10 new methanol masers were detected. The new detections are relatively faint with peak flux densities between 0.5 and 4.0 Jy. A nil detection rate from low-mass star forming regions enhances the conclusion that the masers are only associated with massive star formation. Even the faintest methanol maser in our survey, with a luminosity of 1.1 $10^{-9} L_\odot$ is associated with massive stars as inferred from its infrared luminosity.
