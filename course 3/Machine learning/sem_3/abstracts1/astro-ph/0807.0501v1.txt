MicroLux is a GPS-based high precision and high speed timing add-on to the Calar Alto Lucky Imaging camera AstraLux. It allows timestamping of individual CCD exposures at frame rates of more than 1 kHz with an accuracy better than one microsecond with respect to the UTC timeframe. The system was successfully used for high speed observations of the optical pulse profile of the Crab pulsar in January and November 2007. I present the technical design concept of MicroLux as well as first results from these observations, in particular the reconstructed pulse profile of the pulsar.
