The blazar Mrk421 was observed independently, but contemporaneously, in 2005 at TeV energies by MAGIC, the Whipple 10m telescope, and by a single VERITAS telescope during the construction phase of operations. A comparison of the time averaged spectra, in what was a relatively quiescent state, demonstrates the level of agreement between instruments. In addition, the increased sensitivity of the new generation instruments, and ever decreasing energy thresholds, questions how best to compare new observational data with archival results.
