Based on a new survey of AGN activity in Compact Groups of Galaxies, we report a remarkable deficiency of Broad Line AGNs as compared to Narrow Line AGNs. The cause of such deficiency could be related to the average low luminosity of AGNs in CGs: $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This result may imply lower accretion rates in CG AGNs, making Broad Line Regions (BLR) undetectable, or may indicate a genuine absence of BLRs. Both phenomena are consistent with gas stripping through tidal interaction and dry mergers.
