Solar oscillations consist of a rich spectrum of internal acoustic waves and surface gravity waves, stochastically excited by turbulent convection. They have been monitored almost continuously over the last ten years with high-precision Doppler images of the solar surface. The purpose of helioseismology is to retrieve information about the structure and the dynamics of the solar interior from the frequencies, phases, and amplitudes of solar waves. Methods of analysis are being developed to make three-dimensional images of subsurface motions and temperature inhomogeneities in order to study convective structures and regions of magnetic activity, like sunspots.
