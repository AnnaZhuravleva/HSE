CODEX is a high resolution spectrograph for the European ELT. CODEX is conceived to reach the highest precision and stability, allowing the execution of programs spanning many years. Several innovative technical concepts need to be introduced to reach those excellent characteristics. Thus, the CODEX consortium has foreseen the realization of a CODEX precursor at the VLT: the ESPRESSO spectrograph. INAF is strongly committed in the ESPRESSO concept study both in terms of financial and human resources.
