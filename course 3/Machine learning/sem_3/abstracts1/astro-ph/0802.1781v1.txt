In this letter we present several new three and four-planet solutions based on the most current available radial velocity data for HD160691 ($\mu$Ara). These solutions are optimised using the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP) which is programmed and executed in MATLAB. POFP is based on a full integration of the system's multiple-body Newtonian equations of motion and on a multi level optimisation utilizing a variety of algorithms. The POFP solutions are presented in the context of the Keplerian-based solutions already appearing in the literature which we have reproduced here for comparison. The different solutions and their properties are compared over all data sets separately and combined. The new solutions do not seem to exhibit instabilities and are both co-planar and three-dimensional. We also provide a comparative prediction of the published and new solutions showing their diversion in the near future. In the short term, this projection will allow to choose between the variety of solutions as further observations are made.
