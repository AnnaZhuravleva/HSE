The use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is a key to solving the mystery of dark energy. Improving the calibration of SNe Ia increases their power as cosmological standard candles. We find tentative evidence for a correlation between the late-time lightcurve slope and the peak luminosity of SNe Ia in the B band; brighter SNe Ia seem to have shallower lightcurve slopes between 100 and 150 days from maximum light. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis in calibrating SNe Ia, we are able to simultaneously take into consideration the effect of dust extinction, the luminosity and lightcurve width correlation (parametrized by \Delta m_{15}), and the luminosity and late-time lightcurve slope correlation. For the available sample of 11 SNe Ia with well-measured late-time lightcurves, we find that correcting for the correlation between luminosity and late-time lightcurve slope of the SNe Ia leads to an intrinsic dispersion of 0.12 mag in the Hubble diagram. Our results have significant implications for future supernova surveys aimed to illuminate the nature of dark energy.
