The new generation of 8 to 10m class telescope is providing us with high-quality spectral information on the rest-frame ultraviolet region of star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances. The data can be used to address questions such as, e.g., the star-formation histories, the stellar initial mass function, the dust properties, and the energetics and chemistry of the interstellar medium. We can tackle these issues from a different angle by comparing the spectral properties of high-redshift galaxies to those of their counterparts in the local universe. I give a review of recent developments related to observations and empirical modeling of the ultraviolet spectra of local galaxies with recent star formation. The emphasis is on the youngest stellar populations with ages less than 100 Myr. Current uncertainties will be discussed, and areas where progress is needed in the future are highlighted.
