We find that deviation from the virial equilibrium of the Abell Cluster A586 yields evidence of the interaction between dark matter and dark energy. We argue that this interaction might imply a violation of the Equivalence Principle. Our analysis show that evidence is found in the context of two different models of dark energy-dark matter interaction.
