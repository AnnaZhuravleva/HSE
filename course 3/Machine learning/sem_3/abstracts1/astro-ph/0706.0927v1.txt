We present far ultraviolet (FUV: 912 - 1750AA) spectral imaging observations recorded with the SPEAR satellite of the interstellar OVI (1032AA), CIV (1550AA), SiIV (1394AA), SiII* (1533AA) and AlII (1671AA) emission lines originating in a 60 x 30 degree rectangular region lying close to the North Galactic Pole. These data represent the first large area, moderate spatial resolution maps of the distribution of UV spectral-line emission originating the both the highly ionized medium (HIM) and the warm ionized medium (WIM) recorded at high galactic latitudes.
