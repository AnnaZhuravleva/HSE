The coronal structure of main sequence stars continues to puzzle us. While the solar corona is relatively well understood, it has become clear that even stars of the same mass as the Sun can display very non-solar coronal behaviour, particularly if they are rapid rotators or in a binary system. At masses greater than and also less than that of the Sun, the non-solar internal structure appears to affect both the geometry and dynamics of the stellar corona and the nature of the X-ray and radio emission. In this talk I will describe some recent advances in our understanding of the structure of the coronae of some of the most active (and interesting) main sequence stars.
