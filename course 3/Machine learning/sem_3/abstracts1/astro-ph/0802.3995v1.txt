The period histograms of eclipsing binaries generated with ASAS data cannot only be interpreted by orbital evolution. The eclipse probabilities, selection effects and space distributions in the solar neighborhood should be considered before any interpretations are made. Depending upon physical dimensions (total mass and period) of the progenitor stars and the efficiency of angular momentum loss (AML) mechanism, a newly formed W UMa type binary can be at any age up to several Gyr, and evolution in the contact stage is controlled not only by angular momentum and mass loss but also by mass transfer between the component stars. Thus, mean life of contact stages should be about 1.6 Gyr. A different time scale would cause inconsistencies.
