I summarize the current spectroscopic sky surveys and some of the scientific results, emphasizing the largest sky survey to-date, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Techniques used commonly in spectral analyses are discussed, followed by the present needs and challenges for solving some of the unknown problems. I discuss how the Virtual Observatory (VO) can help astronomers in carrying out related research.
