We present Suzaku X-ray observations of the recurrent nova T CrB in quiescence. T CrB is the first recurrent nova to be detected in the hard-X-ray band (E ~ 40.0 keV) during quiescence. The X-ray spectrum is consistent with cooling-flow emission emanating from an optically thin region in the boundary layer of an accretion disk around the white dwarf. The detection of strong stochastic flux variations in the light curve supports the interpretation of the hard X-ray emission as emanating from a boundary layer.
