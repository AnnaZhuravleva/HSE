We generalize tensor-scalar theories of gravitation by the introduction of an abnormally weighting type of energy. This theory of tensor-scalar anomalous gravity is based on a relaxation of the weak equivalence principle that is now restricted to ordinary visible matter only. As a consequence, the convergence mechanism toward general relativity is modified and produces naturally cosmic acceleration as an inescapable gravitational feedback induced by the mass-variation of some invisible sector. The cosmological implications of this new theoretical framework are studied. From the Hubble diagram cosmological test \textit{alone}, this theory provides an estimation of the amount of baryons and dark matter in the Universe that is consistent with the independent cosmological tests of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Cosmic coincidence is naturally achieved from a equally natural assumption on the amplitude of the scalar coupling strength. Finally, from the adequacy to supernovae data, we derive a new intriguing relation between the space-time dependences of the gravitational coupling and the dark matter mass, providing an example of crucial constraint on microphysics from cosmology. This glimpses at an enticing new symmetry between the visible and invisible sectors, namely that the scalar charges of visible and invisible matter are exactly opposite.
