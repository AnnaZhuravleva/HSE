The radio loud galaxy NGC 1052 is being studied in an intensive multi-band campaign including X-ray brigthness monitoring and spectroscopic observations, single-dish radio brightness monitoring at centimetre wavelengths, and a high-frequency very-long-baseline interferometry monitoring program. Here we present a progress report on our studies from this program. The final goal of our observations is to relate the findings from the high-resolution radio images with the observed variations in the X-ray regime, to address the accretion processes and their relationship with the radio jet activity.
