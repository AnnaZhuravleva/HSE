We collected the parameters (position, absorption, spin, orbital period, etc..), when known, of all Galactic sources detected by INTEGRAL during its four first years of activity. We use these parameters to test theoretical predictions. For example, it is clear that HMXBs tend to be found mostly in the tangential direction of the Galactic arms, while LMXBs tend to be clustered in the Galactic bulge. We then focus on HMXBs and present two possible new tools, in addition to the well-known ``Corbet-diagram'', to distinguish between Be-HMXBs and Sg-HMXBs
