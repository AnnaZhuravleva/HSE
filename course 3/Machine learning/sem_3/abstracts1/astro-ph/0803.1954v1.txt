[ABRIDGED] The unconditional mass function (UMF) of dark matter haloes has been determined accurately in the literature, showing excellent agreement with high resolution numerical simulations. However, this is not the case for the conditional mass function (CMF). We propose a simple analytical procedure to derive the CMF by rescaling the UMF to the constrained environment using the appropriate mean and variance of the density field at the constrained point. This method introduces two major modifications with respect to the standard re-scaling procedure. First of all, rather than using in the scaling procedure the properties of the environment averaged over all the conditioning region, we implement the re-scaling locally. We show that for high masses this modification may lead to substantially different results. Secondly, we modify the (local) standard re-scaling procedure in such a manner as to force normalisation, in the sense that when one integrates the CMF over all possible values of the constraint multiplied by their corresponding probability distribution, the UMF is recovered. In practise, we do this by replacing in the standard procedure the value delta_c (the linear density contrast for collapse) by certain adjustable effective parameter delta_eff. In order to test the method, we compare our prescription with the results obtained from numerical simulations in voids (Gottlober et al. 2003), finding a very good agreement. Based on these results, we finally present a very accurate analytical fit to the (accumulated) conditional mass function obtained with our procedure, which may be useful for any theoretical treatment of the large scale structure.
