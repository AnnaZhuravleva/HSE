Young massive clusters are perfect astrophysical laboratories for study of massive stars. Clusters with Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are of special importance, since this enables us to study a coeval WR population at a uniform metallicity and known age. GLIMPSE30 (G30) is one of them. The cluster is situated near the Galactic plane (l=298.756deg, b=-0.408deg) and we aimed to determine its physical parameters and to investigate its high-mass stellar content and especially WR stars. Our analysis is based on SOFI/NTT JsHKs imaging and low resolution (R~2000) spectroscopy of the brightest cluster members in the K atmospheric window. For the age determination we applied isochrone fits for MS and Pre-MS stars. We derived stellar parameters of the WR stars candidates using a full nonLTE modeling of the observed spectra. Using a variety of techniques we found that G30 is very young cluster, with age t~4Myr. The cluster is located in Carina spiral arm, it is deeply embedded in dust and suffers reddening of Av~10.5+-1.1mag. The distance to the object is d=7.2+-0.9kpc. The mass of the cluster members down to 2.35Msol is ~1600Msol. Cluster's MF for the mass range of 5.6 to 31.6Msol shows a slope of Gamma=-1.01+-0.03. The total mass of the cluster obtained by this MF down to 1Msol is about 3x10^3Msol. The spectral analysis and the models allow us to conclude that in G30 are at least one Ofpe/WN and two WR stars. The WR stars are of WN6-7 hydrogen rich type with progenitor masses more than 60Msol. G30 is a new member of the exquisite family of young Galactic clusters, hosting WR stars. It is a factor of two to three less massive than some of the youngest super-massive star clusters like Arches, Quintuplet and Central cluster and is their smaller analog.
