We detect the correlated peculiar velocities of nearby type Ia supernovae (SNe), while highlighting an error in some of the literature. We find sigma_8=0.79 +/- 0.22 from SNe, and examine the potential of this method to constrain cosmological parameters in the future. We demonstrate that a survey of 300 low-z SNe (such as the nearby SNfactory) will underestimate the errors on w by about 35% if the coherent peculiar velocities are not included.
