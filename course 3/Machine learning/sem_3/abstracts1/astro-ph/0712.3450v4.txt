The thawing quintessence model with a nearly flat potential provides a natural mechanism to produce an equation of state parameter, w, close to -1 today. We examine the behavior of such models for the case in which the potential satisfies the slow roll conditions: [(1/V)(dV/dphi)]^2 << 1 and (1/V)(d^2 V/dphi^2) << 1, and we derive the analog of the slow-roll approximation for the case in which both matter and a scalar field contribute to the density. We show that in this limit, all such models converge to a unique relation between 1+w, Omega_phi, and the initial value of (1/V)(dV/dphi). We derive this relation, and use it to determine the corresponding expression for w(a), which depends only on the present-day values for w and Omega_phi. For a variety of potentials, our limiting expression for w(a) is typically accurate to within delta w < 0.005 for w<-0.9. For redshift z < 1, w(a) is well-fit by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization, in which w(a) is a linear function of a.
