To set useful limits on the abundance of small-scale dark matter halos (subhalos) in a galaxy scale, we have carried out mid-infrared imaging and integral-field spectroscopy for a sample of quadruple lens systems showing anomalous flux ratios. These observations using Subaru have been successful for distinguishing millilensing by subhalos from microlensing by stars. Current status for our lensing analysis of dark matter substructure is reported.
