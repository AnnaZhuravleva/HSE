GAW proposes a new approach for the detection and measurement of the Cherenkov light produced by GeV/TeV gamma rays traversing the Earth atmosphere which imposes specific requirements on the electronics design. The focal surface of the GAW telescope consists of a matrix of multi-anode photomultipliers. The large number of active channels (of the order of 10^5) makes it basically a large UV sensitive digital camera with high resolution imaging capability. The limited amount of space available, due to the large number of channels, requires a compact design with minimal distance between the elements of the focal surface. The front-end electronics uses the single photoelectron counting technique to capture the Cherenkov light. The data acquisition is based on free-running data taking method. Self-triggering capability for each telescope is assured by detecting an excess of active pixels, in a 10ns time frame, inside overlapping trigger areas covering the whole focal surface. In this paper we describe the GAW electronics, as well as the trigger concept and implementation.
