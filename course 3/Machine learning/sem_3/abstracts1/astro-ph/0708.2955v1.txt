Massive stars form in dense and massive molecular cores. The exact formation mechanism is unclear, but it is possible that some massive stars are formed by processes similar to those that produce the low-mass stars, with accretion/ejection phenomena occurring at some point of the evolution of the protostar. This picture seems to be supported by the detection of a collimated stellar wind emanating from the massive protostar IRAS 16547-4247. A triple radio source is associated with the protostar: a compact core and two radio lobes. The emission of the southern lobe is clearly non-thermal. Such emission is interpreted as synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic electrons locally accelerated at the termination point of a thermal jet. Since the ambient medium is determined by the properties of the molecular cloud in which the whole system is embedded, we can expect high densities of particles and infrared photons. Because of the confirmed presence of relativistic electrons, inverse Compton and relativistic Bremsstrahlung interactions are unavoidable. Proton-proton collision should also occur, producing an injection of neutral pions. In this paper we aim at making quantitative predictions of the spectral energy distribution of the non-thermal spots generated by massive young stellar objects, with emphasis on the particular case of IRAS 16547-4247. We present spectral energy distributions for the southern lobe of this source, for a variety of conditions. We show that high-energy emission might be detectable from this object in the gamma-ray domain (MeV to TeV). The source may also be detectable at X-rays through long exposures with current X-ray instruments.
