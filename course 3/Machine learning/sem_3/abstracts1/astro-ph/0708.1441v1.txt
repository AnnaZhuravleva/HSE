The lecture notes describe the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator for Cosmic Web analysis. The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to the local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related quantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay tessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering density and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry preserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its hierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and structure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and background of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural Neighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques. This is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on spatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its performance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological applications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body simulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's performance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of the velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its promise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder (Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter (Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of filaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields. We also mention SimpleX, a related random lattice radiative transfer formalism (Ritzerveld & Icke 2006).
