Whereas penumbral models during the last 15 years have been successful in explaining Evershed flows and magnetic field inclination variations in terms of flux tubes, the lack of contact between these models and a convective process needed to explain the penumbral radiative heat flux has been disturbing. We report on recent observational and theoretical evidence that challenge flux tube interpretations and conclude that the origin of penumbral filamentary structure is overturning convection.
