We present the results of Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting analysis for Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at $z\sim5$ in the GOODS-N and its flanking fields. From the SED fitting for $\sim100$ objects, we found that the stellar masses range from $10^{8}$ to $10^{11}M_{\odot}$ with a median value of $4\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$. By using the large sample of galaxies at $z\sim5$, we construct the stellar mass function (SMF) with incompleteness corrections. By integrating down to $10^{8}M_{\odot}$, the cosmic stellar mass density at $z\sim5$ is calculated to be $7\times10^{6}M_{\odot}\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}$.
