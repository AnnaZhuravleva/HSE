The solar-age open cluster M67 (C0847+120, NGC2682) is a touchstone in studies of the old Galactic disk. Despite its outstanding role, the census of cluster membership for M67 at fainter magnitudes and their properties are not well-established. Using the proprietary and archival ESO data, we have obtained astrometric, photometric, and radial velocities of stars in a 34'x 33' field centered on the old open cluster M67. The two-epoch archival observations separated by 4 years and acquired with the Wide Field Imager at the 2.2m MPG/ESO telescope have been reduced with our new astrometric techniques, as described in the first paper of this series. The same observations served to derive calibrated BVI photometry in M67. Radial velocities were measured using the archival and new spectroscopic data obtained at VLT. We have determined relative proper motions and membership probabilities for ~2,400 stars. The precision of proper motions for optimally exposed stars is ~2 mas/yr, gradually degrading down to ~5 mas/yr at V= 20. Our relatively precise proper motions at V>16 are first obtained in this magnitude range for M67. Radial velocities are measured for 211 stars in the same field. We also present a detailed comparison with recent theoretical isochrones from several independent groups. For M67 area we provide positions, calibrated BVI photometry, relative proper motions, membership probabilities, and radial velocities. We demonstrate that the ground-based CCD mosaic observations just a few years apart are producing proper motions, allowing a reliable membership determination. We produced a catalogue that is made electronically available to the astronomical community.
