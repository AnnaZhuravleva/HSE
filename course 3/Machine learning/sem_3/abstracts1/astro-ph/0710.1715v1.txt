AA Dor is an eclipsing, close, post common-envelope binary (PCEB). We present a detailed spectral analysis of its sdOB primary star based on observations obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Due to a strong contamination by interstellar absorption, we had to model both, the stellar spectrum as well as the interstellar line absorption in order to reproduce the FUV observation well and to determine the photospheric parameters precisely.
