The energy dependence of such characteristics as a ratio of the total number of charged particles to the total flux of EAS Cherenkov radiation, a ratio of E(thr)>=1GeV muon flux density at the distance of 600m from a shower core to charged particle flux density, a ratio of the energy transferred to the electromagnetic component of EAS to the primary particle energy is presented. Their comparison with two-component mass composition of cosmic rays (p-Fe) in the framework of calculations by a QGSJET model is given.
