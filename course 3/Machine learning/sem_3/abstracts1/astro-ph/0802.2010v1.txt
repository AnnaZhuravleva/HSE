CCD BVRI photometry is presented for type II Supernovae 2004A and 2004ek. SN 2004A is found to be a typical SN II-P, with the shape of the light and color curves and maximum luminosity closely matching those for SN 1999em. SN 2004ek shows unusual light curves with long flat plateau in the B band, two peaks in the V and prominent brightening in the R and I bands, starting about 45 days past outburst. The brightness decline after the plateau stage is probably quite slow. The plateau luminosity is about 1.5 mag brighter than average for SN II-P.
