We present the X-ray properties of a massive cluster of galaxies (RXCJ2228.6+2036 at $z=0.421$) using {\it XMM-Newton} data. The X-ray mass modeling is based on the temperature and density distributions of the intracluster medium derived using a deprojection method. We found that RXCJ2228.6+2036 is a hot cluster ($T_{500}=8.92^{+1.78}_{-1.32}$ keV) showing a cooling flow rate of $12.0^{+56.0}_{-12.0}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ based on spectral fitting within the cooling flow radius ($r_{cool}=147\pm10$ kpc). The total cluster mass is $M_{500}=(1.19\pm0.35)\times10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$ and the mean gas mass fraction is $f_{gas}=0.165\pm0.045$ at $r_{500}=1.61\pm0.16$ Mpc. We discussed the PSF-correction effect on the spectral analysis and found that for the annular width we chose the PSF-corrected temperatures are consistent with those without PSF-correction. We observed a remarkable agreement between X-ray and SZ results, which is of prime importance for the future SZ survey. RXCJ2228.6+2036 obeys the empirical scaling relations found in general massive galaxy clusters (e.g. $S$--$T$, $M$--$T$, $L$--$T$ and $M$--$Y$) after accounting for self-similar evolution.
