RV UMa is one of the most extensively studied RR Lyrae stars showing Blazhko modulation. Its photometric observations cover more than 90 years. The published photoelectric observations of RV UMa obtained at the Konkoly Observatory (Kanyo, 1976) were re-considered and completed with previously unpublished data. During the time interval of the observations the periods of both the pulsation and the modulation varied within the ranges of 0.000007 and 0.9 days, respectively. We have found a definite but not strict inverse relation between the pulsation and modulation periods of RV UMa.
