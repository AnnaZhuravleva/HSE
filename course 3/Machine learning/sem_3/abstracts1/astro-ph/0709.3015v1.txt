A major amendment in recent models of hierarchical galaxy formation is the inclusion of so-called AGN feedback. The energy input from an active central massive black hole is invoked to suppress star formation in early-type galaxies at later epochs. A major problem is that this process is poorly understood, and compelling observational evidence for its mere existence is still missing. In search for signatures of AGN feedback, we have compiled a sample of 16,000 early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.1 from the SDSS database. Key in our approach is the use of a purely morphological selection criterion through visual inspection which produces a sample that is not biased against recent star formation and nuclear activity. The objects with emission (~20 per cent) are offset from the red sequence and form a well-defined pattern in the colour-mass diagram. Star forming early-types inhabit the blue cloud, while early-types with AGN are located considerably closer to and almost on the red sequence. Star formation-AGN composites are found right between these two extremes. We further derive galaxy star formation histories using a novel method that combines multiwavelength photometry from near-UV to near-IR and stellar absorption indices. We find that in those objects deviating from the red sequence star formation occurred several 100 Myr in the past involving 1-10 per cent of the total stellar mass. We identify an evolutionary sequence from star formation via nuclear activity to quiescence. This transition process lasts about 1 Gyr, and the peak AGN phase occurs roughly half a Gyr after the starburst. The most likely interpretation is that star formation is suppressed by nuclear activity in these objects before they settle on the red sequence.
