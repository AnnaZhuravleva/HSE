{Aims.} We introduce our imaging survey of possible young massive globular clusters in M31 performed with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We present here details of the data reduction pipeline that is being applied to all the survey data and describe its application to the brightest among our targets, van den Bergh 0 (VdB0), taken as a test case. {Methods.} The reddening, the age and the metallicity of the cluster are estimated by comparison of the observed Color Magnitude Diagram (CMD) with theoretical isochrones. {Results.} Under the most conservative assumptions the stellar mass of VdB0 is M > 2.4 x 10^4 M_sun, but our best estimates lie in the range ~ 4-9 x 10^4 M_sun. The CMD of VdB0 is best reproduced by models having solar metallicity and age = 25 Myr. Ages smaller than = 12 Myr and larger than = 60 Myr are clearly ruled out by the available data. The cluster has a remarkable number of Red Super Giants (> 18) and a CMD very similar to Large Magellanic Cloud clusters usually classified as young globulars such as NGC 1850, for example. {Conclusions.} VdB0 is significantly brighter (>~ 1 mag) than Galactic open clusters of similar age. Its present-day mass and half-light radius (r_h=7.4 pc) are more typical of faint globular clusters than of open clusters. However, given its position within the disk of M31 it is expected to be destroyed by dynamical effects, in particular by encounters with giant molecular clouds, within the next ~ 4 Gyr.
