High resolution synthetic stellar libraries are of fundamental importance for the preparation of the Gaia Mission. We present new sets of spectral stellar libraries covering two spectral ranges: 300 --1100 nm at 0.1 nm resolution, and 840 -- 890 nm at 0.001 nm resolution. These libraries span a large range in atmospheric parameters, from super-metal-rich to very metal-poor (-5.0 $<$[Fe/H]$<$+1.0), from cool to hot (\teff=3000--50000 K) stars, including peculiar abundance variations. The spectral resolution, spectral type coverage and number of models represent a substantial improvement over previous libraries used in population synthesis models and in atmospheric analysis.
