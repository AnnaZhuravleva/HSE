X-shooter is the first second-generation instrument for the ESO Very Large Telescope and will be installed in 2008. It is intended to become the most powerful optical & near-infrared medium-resolution spectrograph in the world, with a unique spectral coverage from 300 to 2500 nm in one shot. The X-shooter consortium members are from Denmark, France, Italy, The Netherlands and ESO.
