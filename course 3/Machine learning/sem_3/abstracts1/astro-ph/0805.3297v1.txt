We present high resolution (R = 90,000) mid-infrared spectra of M dwarfs. The mid infrared region of the spectra of cool low mass stars contain pure rotational water vapour transitions that may provide us with a new methodology in the determination of the effective temperatures for low mass stars. We identify and assign water transitions in these spectra and determine how sensitive each pure rotational water transition is to small (25 K) changes in effective temperature. We find that, of the 36 confirmed and assigned pure rotational water transitions, at least 10 should be sensitive enough to be used as temperature indicators.
