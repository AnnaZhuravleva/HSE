The starting point of quantum mechanics is the relationship between energy and momentum: energy is proportional to the squared momentum! As a result, energy and momentum have not been treated equally. The wave equation required by quantization is a differential equation which accordingly, does not treat time and space equally. As a result, the Planck constant is not canceled out from the two sides of the equation. Dr. He's gravity is the local bending of background space-time which as suggested by Einstein, can be described by a differential form of second order, and treats time and space equally. Therefore, the Planck constant is completely canceled out in the resulting wave equation. In other words, the quantization of gravity simply does not need the Planck constant!
