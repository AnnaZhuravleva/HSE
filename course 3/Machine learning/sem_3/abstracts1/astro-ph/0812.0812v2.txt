We performed a series of high-resolution (up to 1024^3) direct numerical simulations of hydro and MHD strong turbulence. We found that for simulations with normal viscosity the slopes for spectra of MHD are similar, although slightly more shallower than for hydro simulations. However, for simulations with hyperviscosity the slopes were very different, for instance, the slopes for hydro simulations showed pronounced and well-defined bottleneck effect, while the MHD slopes were relatively much less affected. We believe that this is indicative of MHD strong turbulence being less local than Kolmogorov turbulence. This calls for revision of MHD strong turbulence models that assume local "as-in-hydro case" cascading. Nonlocality of MHD turbulence casts doubt on numerical determination of the slopes with currently available (512^3--1024^3) numerical resolutions, including simulations with normal viscosity. We also measure various so-called alignment effects and discuss their influence on the turbulent cascade.
