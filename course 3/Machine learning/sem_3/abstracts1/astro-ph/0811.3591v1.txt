We present the first results from the analysis of GIRAFFE spectra of more than 1200 red giants stars in 19 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs), to study the chemical composition of second generation stars and their link with global cluster parameters. We confirm that the extension of the Na-O anticorrelation (the most striking signature of polluted, second generation populations) is strictly related to the very blue (and hot) extreme of the Horizontal Branch (HB). Long anticorrelations seem to require large mass and large-sized, eccentric orbits, taking the GCs far away from the central regions of the Galaxy. We can separate three populations in each cluster (primordial, intermediate and extreme) based on the chemical composition. In all GCs we observe a population of primordial composition, similar to field stars of similar metallicity. We find that in all GCs the bulk (from 50 to 70%) of stars belong to the intermediate component. Finally, the extreme, very oxygen-poor component is observed preferentially in massive clusters, but is not present in all massive GCs.
