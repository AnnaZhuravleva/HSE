Among the tools available for the study of the dark energy driving the expansion of the Universe, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and their effects on the matter power spectrum are particularly attractive. It was recently proposed to study these oscillations by mapping the 21cm emission of the neutral hydrogen in the redshift range $0.5<z<3$. We discuss here the precision of such measurements using radio-interferometers consisting of arrays of dishes or north-south oriented cylinders. We then discuss the resulting uncertainties on the BAO scales and the sensitivity to the parameters of the Dark Energy equation of state.
