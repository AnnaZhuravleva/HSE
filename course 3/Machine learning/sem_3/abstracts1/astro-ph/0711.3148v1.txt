We review the consequences of the growth and evolution of Black Holes on the distribution of stars and Dark Matter (DM) around them. We focus in particular on Supermassive and Intermediate Mass Black Holes, and discuss under what circumstances they can lead to significant overdensities in the surrounding distribution of DM, thus effectively acting as DM annihilation boosters.
