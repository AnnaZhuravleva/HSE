The abundance evolution of interstellar dust species originating from stellar sources and from condensation in molecular clouds in the local interstellar medium of the Milky Way is studied and the input of dust material to the Solar System is determined. A one-zone chemical evolution model of the Milky Way for the elemental composition of the disk combined with an evolution model for its interstellar dust component similar to that of Dwek (1998) is developed. The dust model considers dust-mass return from AGB stars as calculated from synthetic AGB models combined with models for dust condensation in stellar outflows. Supernova dust formation is included in a simple parameterized form which is gauged by observed abundances of presolar dust grains with supernova origin. For dust growth in the ISM a simple method is developed for coupling this with disk and dust evolution models. The time evolution of the abundance of the following dust species is followed in the model: silicate, carbon, silicon carbide, and iron dust from AGB stars and from SNe as well as silicate, carbon, and iron dust grown in molecular clouds. It is shown that the interstellar dust population is dominated by dust accreted in molecular clouds; most of the dust material entering the Solar System at its formation does not show isotopic abundance anomalies of the refractory elements, i.e., inconspicuous isotopic abundances do not point to a Solar System origin of dust grains. The observed abundance ratios of presolar dust grains formed in SN ejecta and in AGB star outflows requires that for the ejecta from SNe the fraction of refractory elements condensed into dust is 0.15 for carbon dust and is quite small ($\sim10^{-4}$) for other dust species.
