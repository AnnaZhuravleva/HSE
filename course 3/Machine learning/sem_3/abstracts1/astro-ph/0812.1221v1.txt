We compute chi values for blue emission lines in active M dwarfs. Using flux-calibrated spectra from nearby M dwarfs and spectral M dwarf templates from SDSS, we derive analytic relations that describe how the chi values for the CaII H and K as well as the H-beta, H-gamma, H-delta, H-epsilon and H8 Balmer emission lines vary as a function of spectral type and color. The chi values are useful for numerous M dwarf studies where the intrinsic luminosity of emission lines cannot be estimated due to uncertain distances and/or non-flux-calibrated spectra. We use these results to estimate the mean properties of blue emission lines in active field M dwarfs from SDSS.
