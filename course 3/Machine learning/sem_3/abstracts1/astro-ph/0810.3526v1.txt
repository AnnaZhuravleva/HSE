Some of the first results are reported from RISE - a new fast camera mounted on the Liverpool Telescope primarily designed to obtain high time resolution light curves of transiting extrasolar planets for the purpose of transit timing. A full and partial transit of WASP-3 are presented, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis is used to update the parameters from the discovery paper. This results in a planetary radius of 1.29^{+0.05}_{-0.12} R_J and therefore a density of 0.82^{+0.14}_{-0.09} p_J, consistent with previous results. The inclination is 85.07^{+0.15}_{-0.16} deg, in agreement (but with a significant improvement in the precision) with the previously determined value. Central transit times are found to be consistent with the ephemeris given in the discovery paper. However, a new ephemeris calculated using the longer baseline results in T_c(0) = 2454605.55915 +- 0.00023 HJD and P = 1.846835 +- 0.000002 days.
