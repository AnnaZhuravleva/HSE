From hydro-gravitational-dynamics theory HGD, gravitational structure formation begins 30,000 years after the turbulent big bang by fragmentation into super-cluster-voids and super-clusters. Proto-galaxies in linear and spiral clusters are the smallest fragments to emerge from the plasma epoch at decoupling at 10^13 s with a turbulent morphology determined by the plasma turbulence and the Nomura scale 10^20 m, which is determined by gravity, the fossilized density and rate-of-strain of the 10^12 s time of first structure and the large photon viscosity of the plasma. After decoupling, the gas proto-galaxies fragment into 10^36 kg proto-globular-star-cluster PGC clumps of earth-mass 10^25 kg hot gas clouds that eventually freeze to form primordial-fog-particle PFP dark matter planets. The rotation of galaxies reflects density gradients of big bang turbulent mixing and the sonic expansion of proto-super-cluster-voids. The spin axis appears for low wavenumber spherical harmonic components of CMB temperature anomalies, the Milky Way and galaxies of the local group, and extends to 4.5x10^25 m (1.5 Gpc) in quasar polarization vectors, supporting a big bang turbulence origin. Gas proto-galaxies stick together by frictional processes of the frozen gas planets, just as PGCs have been meta-stable for the 13.7 Gyr age of the universe. Evidence of PGC-friction is inferred from the local group Hubble diagram and from redshift anomalies of Hickson compact galaxy groups such as the Stephan Quintet compared to Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS galaxy observations.
