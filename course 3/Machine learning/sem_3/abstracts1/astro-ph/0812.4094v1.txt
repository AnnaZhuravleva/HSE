We report the detection of a candidate brown dwarf orbiting the metal-rich K dwarf HD 91669, based on radial-velocity data from the McDonald Observatory Planet Search. HD 91669b is a substellar object in an eccentric orbit (e=0.45) at a separation of 1.2 AU. The minimum mass of 30.6 Jupiter masses places this object firmly within the brown dwarf desert for inclinations i>23 degrees. This is the second rare close-in brown dwarf candidate discovered by the McDonald planet search program.
