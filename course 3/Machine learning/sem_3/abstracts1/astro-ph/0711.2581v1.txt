The Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) survey currently operates two installations, designated SuperWASP-N and SuperWASP-S, located in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively. These installations are designed to provide high time-resolution photometry for the purpose of detecting transiting extra-solar planets, asteroids, and transient events. Here we present results from a transit-hunting observing campaign using SuperWASP-N covering a right ascension range of 06hr < RA < 16hr. This paper represents the fifth and final in the series of transit candidates released from the 2004 observing season. In total, 729,335 stars from 33 fields were monitored with 130,566 having sufficient precision to be scanned for transit signatures. Using a robust transit detection algorithm and selection criteria, 6 stars were found to have events consistent with the signature of a transiting extra-solar planet based upon the photometry, including the known transiting planet XO-1b. These transit candidates are presented here along with discussion of follow-up observations and the expected number of candidates in relation to the overall observing strategy.
