The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability of detecting neutrino-induced extensive air showers by searching for very inclined showers with a significant electromagnetic component. In order to study the detector response of the surface array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, Monte Carlo simulations of up-going and down-going neutrino showers for all flavors were performed. A set of relevant observables were determined to discriminate these showers from the background of very inclined hadronic showers and the identification efficiency was studied. The acceptance and the expected event rates, based on the assumption of the incoming neutrino flux, were finally calculated.
