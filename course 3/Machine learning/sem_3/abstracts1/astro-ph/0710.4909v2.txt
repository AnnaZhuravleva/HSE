The origin of galactic cosmic rays is one of the most interesting unsolved problems in astroparticle physics. Experimentally, the problem is attacked by a multi-disciplinary effort, namely by direct measurements of cosmic rays above the atmosphere, by air shower observations, and by the detection of TeV $\gamma$ rays. Recent experimental results are presented and their implications on the contemporary understanding of the origin of galactic cosmic rays are discussed.
