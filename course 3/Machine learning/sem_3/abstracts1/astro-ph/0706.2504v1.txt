If primordial low-mass black holes (PBH) exist in the Universe than many of stars and planetary bodies appear to be infected by them. This is also true in regard to the Sun and likely Jupiter and Saturn. The availability of even the very low-mass inner relativistic reactor may lead to essential changes in evolution scenario of a celestial body on its lifetime scale. Black holes in stellar interior may be found either in consequence of captures process or incorporation during the formation of a star from interstellar clouds. Surprisingly that in the equilibrium state a PBH growth is a long-lived process with e-folding rise time of billion years. One can envision a PBH orbiting inside the Sun. Our considerations showed that the PBH experiences very little friction in passing through the stellar matter. If the BH mass is above 10^{-5}M_{sun} the major contribution to the luminosity comes from the relativistic gravitational reactor. In such a case a star evolves towards the Eddington limit. This should lead to considerable expansion of a star and a global stability loss. Microscopic PBHs can exist in the interior of planetary bodies too. To produce the required excess of thermal energy on Jupiter and Saturn the masses of PBH captured are assumed to be reached of 4 10^{19} and 7 10^{18} g, respectively. These microscopic objects are comparable to the hydrogen atom in size. One can envision even a planet with the PBH acting as the self-sufficient source of heating. Such a planet does not need a sun to maintain animal life on its surface. This may last eons.
