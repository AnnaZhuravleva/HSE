SIDE (Super Ifu Deployable Experiment) will be a second-generation, common-user instrument for the Grantecan (GTC) on La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). It is being proposed as a spectrograph of low and intermediate resolution, highly efficient in multi-object spectroscopy and 3D spectroscopy. SIDE features the unique possibility of performing simultaneous visible and NIR observations for selected ranges. The SIDE project is leaded by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia (IAA-CSIC) in Granada (Spain) and the SIDE Consortium is formed by a total of 10 institutions from Spain, Mexico and USA. The SIDE Feasibility Study has been completed and currently the project is under revision by the GTC Project Office.
