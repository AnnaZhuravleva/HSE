We have investigated the photoneutron cross section of the isotopes $^{148,150}$Nd, $^{154}$Sm, and $^{154,160}$Gd close to the neutron emission threshold in photoactivation experiments at the Darmstadt superconducting electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC. Naturally composed targets were activated with a high-intensity bremsstrahlung beam at various energies and the reaction yields have been determined by measuring the activity of the produced radioactive isotopes with HPGe detectors. The results are compared to two different statistical model calculations.
