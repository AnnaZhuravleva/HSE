We use baryon acoustic peak measurements by Eisenstein et al. (2005) and Percival et al. (2007a) and galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements of Allen et al. (2008) to constrain parameters of three different dark energy models. For time-independent dark energy, the Percival et al. (2007a) constraints, which make use of the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle, most effectively constrain a cosmological parameter close to spatial curvature and favor a close to spatially flat model. In a spatially-flat model the Percival et al. (2007a) data less effectively constrain time-varying dark energy. The joint baryon acoustic peak and galaxy cluster gas mass constraints are consistent with but tighter than those derived from other data. A time-independent cosmological constant in a spatially-flat model provides a good fit to the joint data, but slowly-evolving dark energy can not yet be ruled out.
