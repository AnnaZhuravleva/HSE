The properties of their hosts provide important clues to the progenitors of different classes of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The hosts themselves also constitute a sample of high-redshift star-forming galaxies which, unlike most other methods, is not selected on the luminosities of the galaxies themselves. We discuss what we have learnt from and about GRB host galaxies to date.
