We provide preliminary quantitative evidence that a new solution to averaging the observed inhomogeneous structure of matter in the universe [gr-qc/0702082, arxiv:0709.0732], may lead to an observationally viable cosmology without exotic dark energy. We find parameters which simultaneously satisfy three independent tests: the match to the angular scale of the sound horizon detected in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum; the effective comoving baryon acoustic oscillation scale detected in galaxy clustering statistics; and type Ia supernova luminosity distances. Independently of the supernova data, concordance is obtained for a value of the Hubble constant which agrees with the measurement of the Hubble Key team of Sandage et al [astro-ph/0603647]. Best-fit parameters include a global average Hubble constant H_0 = 61.7 (+1.2/-1.1) km/s/Mpc, a present epoch void volume fraction of f_{v0} = 0.76 (+0.12/-0.09), and an age of the universe of 14.7 (+0.7/-0.5) billion years as measured by observers in galaxies. The mass ratio of non-baryonic dark matter to baryonic matter is 3.1 (+2.5/-2.4), computed with a baryon-to-photon ratio that concords with primordial lithium abundances.
