We study the variability of the nova-like cataclysmic variable TT Ari, on time-scales of between minutes and months. The observations in the filter R were obtained at the 40-cm telescope of the Chungbuk National University (Korea). TT Ari was in the "negative superhump" state after its return from the "positive superhump" state, which lasted 8 years. The ephemeris for 12 best pronounced minima is $T_{min}=BJD 2453747.0700(47)+0.132322(53)E.$ where numbers in digits are errors in units of the last digit. The phases of minima may reach 0.2, indicating non-eclipse nature of these minima. The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) are present with a mean "period" of 21.6 min and mean semi-amplitude of 36 mmag. This value is consistent with the range 15-25 minutes reported for previous "negative superhump" states and does not support the hypothesis of secular decrease of the QPO period.   Either the period, or the semi-amplitude show significant night-to-night variations. According to the position at the two-parameter diagrams, the interval of observations was splitted into 5 parts, showing different characteristics which are discussed in this paper. The system is an excellent laboratory to study processes resulting in variations at time-scales from seconds to decades and needs further monitoring at various states of activity.
