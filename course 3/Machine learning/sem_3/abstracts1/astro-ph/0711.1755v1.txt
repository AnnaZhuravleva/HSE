Kinematics combined with detailed element abundances provide the method of analysis of stellar populations using as much available information as possible, in contrast to other methods. Here we employ this technique on local HBA stars in an ongoing programme to search for omega Centauri debris among these objects, which led us to discover another group of stars with very similar kinematics and abundances, the Cometary Orbit Group (COG). We also comment on the future of this kind of undertaking in the Gaia era.
