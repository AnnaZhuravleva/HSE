Indirect detection signals from dark matter annihilation are studied in the positron channel. We discuss in detail the positron propagation inside the galactic medium: we present novel solutions of the diffusion and propagation equations and we focus on the determination of the astrophysical uncertainties which affect the positron dark matter signal. We find dark matter scenarios and propagation models that nicely fit existing data on the positron fraction. Finally, we present predictions both on the positron fraction and on the flux for already running or planned space experiments, concluding that they have the potential to discriminate a possible signal from the background and, in some cases, to distinguish among different astrophysical propagation models.
