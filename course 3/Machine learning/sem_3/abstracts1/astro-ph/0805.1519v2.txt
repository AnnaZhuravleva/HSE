The effect of a narrow-band isotropic stochastic GW background on pulsar timing and astrometric measurements is studied. Such a background appears in some theories of gravity. We show that the existing millisecond pulsar timing accuracy ($\sim 0.2 \rm{\mu s}$) strongly constrains possible observational consequences of theory of massive gravity with spontaneous Lorentz braking \cite{dtt:2005}, essentially ruling out significant contribution of massive gravitons to the local dark halo density. The present-day accuracy of astrometrical measurements ($\sim 100 \rm{\mu as}$) sets less stringent constraints on this theory.
