Configuration properties of observed galaxy triplets are studied with the use of the method of configuration parameters and Agekian-Anosova configuration diagram. Statistically significant excess of the hierarchical configurations for the galaxy triplets of the Local Supercluster (LS) is established. The samples of the Interacting, Northern and Southern galaxy triplets do not demonstrate the same excess. Our results testify that the model of the dark matter concentrated in the halo of individual galaxies is convenient for dynamically young systems to which the most of LS triplets belong, whereas the model of the dark matter concentrated in the triplet's volume is more convenient for the compact triplets.
