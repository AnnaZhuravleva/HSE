We investigate the nature of a sample of star cluster candidates detected as stellar overdensities towards the Galactic anticentre. Taken from the catalogue of Froebrich, Scholz, and Raftery (FSR), the sample contains 28 star cluster candidates located within $|\Delta\ell|=20^\circ$ of the anticentre. These are all the candidates in that sector classified by FSR with a high probability of being star clusters. Our main goals are to determine the fraction of such candidates that are unknown star clusters, to derive their astrophysical parameters, and to investigate the relationship of cluster parameters with position in the Galaxy. When photometric and radial distribution properties are considered together, an important fraction of the stellar overdensities with a fluctuation level $\ga3\sigma$ are shown to be star clusters. Thus, catalogues of star cluster candidates, coupled to the present kind of study, are an important source for identifying unknown open clusters. Such efforts affect the understanding of the star-formation rate, cluster dynamical evolution, and Galactic structure, among others.
