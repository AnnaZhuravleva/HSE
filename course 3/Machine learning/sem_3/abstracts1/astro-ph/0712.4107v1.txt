We present a unified description of all the three known classes of optically thick accretion disks around black holes, namely Shakura-Sunyaev disks, slim disks, and neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs). It is found that NDAFs have both a maximal and a minimal possible mass accretion rate at their each radius. This may be suggestive of an interpretation for the origin of X-ray flares observed in gamma-ray bursts.
