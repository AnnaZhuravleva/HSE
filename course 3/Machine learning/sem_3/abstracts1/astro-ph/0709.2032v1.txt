The MAGIC telescope has performed long term monitoring observations of the bright TeV Blazars Mrk421, Mrk501 and 1ES1959+650. Up to 40 observations, 30 to 60 minutes each have been performed for each source evenly distributed over the observable period of the year. The sensitivity of MAGIC is sufficient to establish a flux level of 25% of the Crab flux for each measurement. These observations are well suited to trigger multiwavelength ToO observations and the overall collected data allow an unbiased study of the flaring statistics of the observed AGNs.
