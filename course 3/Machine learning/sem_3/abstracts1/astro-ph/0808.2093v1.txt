We assemble a sample of galaxy clusters whose brightest members are dumbbell galaxies and compare them with a control sample in order to investigate if they are the result of recent mergers. We show that the dumbbell sample is no more likely than other clusters to exhibit subclustering. However, they are much more likely to have at least one dumbbell component possessing a significant peculiar velocity with respect to the parent cluster than a non-dumbbell brightest cluster member. We interpret this in the context of seeing the clusters at various stages of post-merger relaxation.
