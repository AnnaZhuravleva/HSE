Large scale structure deflects cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Since large angular scales in the large scale structure contribute significantly to the gravitational lensing effect, a realistic simulation of CMB lensing requires a sufficiently large sky area. We describe simulations that include these effects, and present both effective and multiple plane ray-tracing versions of the algorithm, which employs spherical harmonic space and does not use the flat sky approximation. We simulate lensed CMB maps with an angular resolution of ~0.9 arcmin. The angular power spectrum of the simulated sky agrees well with analytical predictions. Maps generated in this manner are a useful tool for the analysis and interpretation of upcoming CMB experiments such as PLANCK and ACT.
