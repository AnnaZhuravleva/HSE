We investigate numerically the long-time behavior of balanced Alfven wave turbulence forced at intermediate scales. Whereas the usual constant-flux solution is found at the smallest scales, two new scalings are obtained at the forcing scales and at the largest scales of the system. In the latter case we show, in particular, that the spectrum evolves first to a state determined by Loitsyansky invariant and later a state close to the thermodynamic equipartition solution predicted by wave turbulence. The astrophysical implications for galactic magnetic field generation are discussed.
