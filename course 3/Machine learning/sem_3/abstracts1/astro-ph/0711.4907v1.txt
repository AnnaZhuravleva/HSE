The atmospheric structure of chemically peculiar stars deviates from that of normal stars with similar fundamental parameters due to unusual chemistry, abundance inhomogeneities and the presence of strong magnetic field. These effects are not considered in the standard model atmospheres, possibly leading to large errors in the stellar parameter determination and abundance analysis. To tackle this problem we used the state-of-the-art opacity sampling model atmosphere code LLmodels to calculate comprehensive grid of new generation model atmospheres for magnetic CP stars. This grid covers the whole parameter space occupied by SrCrEu and Si-peculiar stars, taking into account characteristic temperature dependence of the chemical abundances. Here we present the first results of our model atmosphere calculations.
