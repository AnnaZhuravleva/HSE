We report on a study of the time sequence for the appearance of high-velocity jets and equatorial tori in the transition of stars from the asymptotic giant branch to the planetary nebulae phase. Jets and tori are prominent features of this evolution, but their origins are uncertain. Using the kinematics of molecular tori and molecular or optical jets, we determine the ejection histories for a sample of well-observed cases. We find that jets and tori develop nearly simultaneously. We also find evidence that jets appear slightly later than tori, with a typical jet-lag of a few hundred years. The reconstructed time-lines of this sequence provide good evidence that jets and tori are physically related, and they set new constraints on jet formation scenarios. Some scenarios are ruled out or rendered implausible, and others are challenged at a quantitative level.
