High resolution imaging observation of a sunspot umbra was done with Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). Filtergrams in wavelengths of blue and green continuum were taken during three consecutive days. The umbra consisted of a dark core region, several diffuse components and numerous umbral dots. We derived basic properties of umbral dots (UDs), especially their temperatures, lifetimes, proper motions, spatial distribution and morphological evolution. Brightness of UDs is confirmed to depend on the brightness of their surrounding background. Several UDs show fission and fusion. Thanks to the stable condition of space observation, we could first follow the temporal behavior of these events. The derived properties of internal structure of the umbra are discussed in viewpoint of magnetoconvection in a strong magnetic field.
