The interpretation of hard X-ray emission from galaxy clusters is still ambiguous and different models proposed can be probed using various observational methods. Here we explore a new method based on Fe line observations.   Spectral line emissivities have usually been calculated for a Maxwellian electron distribution. In this paper a generalized approach to calculate the iron line flux for a modified Maxwellian distribution is considered.   We have calculated the flux ratio of iron lines for the various possible populations of electrons that have been proposed to account for measurements of hard X-ray excess emission from the clusters A2199 and Coma. We found that the influence of the suprathermal electron population on the flux ratio is more prominent in low temperature clusters (as Abell 2199) than in high temperature clusters (as Coma).
