Near-future cosmological observations targeted at investigations of dark energy pose stringent requirements on the accuracy of theoretical predictions for the clustering of matter. Currently, N-body simulations comprise the only viable approach to this problem. In this paper we demonstrate that N-body simulations can indeed be sufficiently controlled to fulfill these requirements for the needs of ongoing and near-future weak lensing surveys. By performing a large suite of cosmological simulation comparison and convergence tests we show that results for the nonlinear matter power spectrum can be obtained at 1% accuracy out to k~1 h/Mpc. The key components of these high accuracy simulations are: precise initial conditions, very large simulation volumes, sufficient mass resolution, and accurate time stepping. This paper is the first in a series of three, with the final aim to provide a high-accuracy prediction scheme for the nonlinear matter power spectrum.
