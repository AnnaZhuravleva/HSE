I discuss two of the possible sources of biases in the determination of the IMF: binning and the existence of unresolved components. The first source is important for clusters with a small number of stars detected in a given mass bin while the second one is relevant for all clusters located beyond the immediate solar neighborhood. For both cases I will present results of numerical simulations and I will discuss strategies to correct for their effects. I also present a brief description of a third unrelated bias source.
