A new type of object called "Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs)" has been discovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope. VeLLOs might be substellar objects forming by accretion. However, some VeLLOs are associated with strong outflows, indicating the previous existence of massive accretion. The thermal history, which significantly affects the chemistry, between substellar objects with a continuous low accretion rate and objects in a quiescent phase after massive accretion (outburst) must be greatly different. In this study, the chemical evolution has been calculated in an episodic accretion model to show that CO and N2H+ have a relation different from starless cores or Class 0/I objects. Furthermore, the CO2 ice feature at 15.2 micron will be a good tracer of the thermal process in VeLLOs.
