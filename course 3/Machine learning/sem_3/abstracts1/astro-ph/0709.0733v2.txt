We report the discovery of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mkn 335 in an extremely low X-ray state. A comparison of Swift observations obtained in May and June/July 2007 with all previous X-ray observations between 1971 to 2006 show the AGN to have diminished in flux by a factor of more than 30, the lowest X-ray flux Mkn 335 has ever been observed in. The Swift observations show an extremely hard X-ray spectrum at energies above 2 keV. Possible interpretations include partial covering absorption or X-ray reflection from the disk. In this letter we consider the partial covering interpretation. The Swift observations can be well fit by a strong partial covering absorber with varying absorption column density N_H= 1-4 x 10^{23} cm-2 and a covering fraction f_c=0.9 - 1. When corrected for intrinsic absorption, the X-ray flux of Mkn 335 varies by only factors of 4-6. In the UV Mkn 335 shows variability in the order of 0.2 mag. We discuss the similarity of Mkn 335 with the highly variable NLS1 WPVS007, and speculate about a possible link between NLS1 galaxies and broad-absorption line quasars.
