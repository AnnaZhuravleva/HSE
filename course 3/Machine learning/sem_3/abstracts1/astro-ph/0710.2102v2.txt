(ABRIDGED) We use hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxies to study relations between star formation and properties of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM). We implement a model for the ISM that includes low-temperature (T<10^4K) cooling, directly ties the star formation rate to the molecular gas density, and accounts for the destruction of H2 by an interstellar radiation field from young stars. We demonstrate that the ISM and star formation model simultaneously produces a spatially-resolved molecular-gas surface density Schmidt-Kennicutt relation of the form Sigma_SFR \propto Sigma_Hmol^n_mol with n_mol~1.4 independent of galaxy mass, and a total gas surface density -- star formation rate relation Sigma_SFR \propto Sigma_gas^n_tot with a power-law index that steepens from n_tot~2 for large galaxies to n_tot>~4 for small dwarf galaxies. We show that deviations from the disk-averaged Sigma_SFR \propto Sigma_gas^1.4 correlation determined by Kennicutt (1998) owe primarily to spatial trends in the molecular fraction f_H2 and may explain observed deviations from the global Schmidt-Kennicutt relation.
