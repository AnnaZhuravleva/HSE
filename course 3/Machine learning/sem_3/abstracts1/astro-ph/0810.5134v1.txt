We detected a major X-ray outburst from M82 with a duration of 79 days, an average flux of 5E-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 2-10 keV band, and strong variability. The X-ray spectrum remained hard throughout the outburst. We obtained a Chandra observation during the outburst that shows that the emission arises from the ultraluminous X-ray source X41.4+60. This source has an unabsorbed flux of (5.4 +/- 0.2)E-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.3-8 keV band, equivalent to an isotropic luminosity of 8.5E40 erg/s. The spectrum is adequately fitted with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.55 +/- 0.05. This photon index is very similar to the value of 1.61 +/- 0.06 measured previously while the flux was (2.64 +/- 0.14)E-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1. Thus, the source appears to remain in the hard state even at the highest flux levels observed. The X-ray spectral and timing data available for X41.4+60 are consistent with the source being in a luminous hard state and a black hole mass in the range of one to a few thousand solar masses.
