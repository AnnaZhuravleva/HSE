The dominant source of electromagnetic energy in the Universe today (over ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths) is starlight. However, quantifying the amount of starlight produced has proven difficult due to interstellar dust grains which attenuate some unknown fraction of the light. Combining a recently calibrated galactic dust model with observations of 10,000 nearby galaxies we find that (integrated over all galaxy types and orientations) only (11 +/- 2)% of the 0.1 micron photons escape their host galaxies; this value rises linearly (with log(lambda)) to (87 +/- 3)% at 2.1 micron. We deduce that the energy output from stars in the nearby Universe is (1.6+/-0.2) x 10^{35} W Mpc^{-3} of which (0.9+/-0.1) x 10^{35} W Mpc^{-3} escapes directly into the inter-galactic medium. Some further ramifications of dust attenuation are discussed, and equations that correct individual galaxy flux measurements for its effect are provided.
