To study galactic motions on the largest available scales, we require bulk flow moments whose window functions have as narrow a peak as possible and having as small an amplitude as possible outside the peak. Typically the moments found using the maximum likelihood estimate weights do not meet these criteria. We present a new method for calculating weights for moments that essentially allow us to "design" the moment's window function, subject, of course, to the distribution and uncertainties of the available data.
