We simulate anisotropic outflows of AGN, and investigate the large-scale impact of the cosmological population of AGN outflows over the Hubble time by performing N-body LambdaCDM simulations. Using the observed quasar luminosity function to get the redshift and luminosity distribution, and analytical models for the outflow expansion, AGNs are allowed to evolve in a cosmological volume. By the present epoch, 13 - 25% of the total volume is found to be pervaded by AGN outflows, with 10^{-9} G magnetic field.
