A wide range of atmospheric monitoring instruments is employed at the Pierre Auger Observatory: two laser facilities, elastic lidar stations, aerosol phase function monitors, a horizontal attenuation monitor, star monitors, weather stations, and balloon soundings. We describe the impact of analyzed atmospheric data on the accuracy of shower reconstructions, and in particular study the effect of the data on the shower energy and the depth of shower maximum (Xmax). These effects have been studied using the subset of golden hybrid events - events observed with high quality in the fluorescence and surface detector - used in the calibration of the surface detector energy spectrum.
