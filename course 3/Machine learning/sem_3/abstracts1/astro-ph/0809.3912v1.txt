The analysis of the spectral energy distribution variability at frequencies from radio to TeV is a powerful tool in the investigation of the dynamics, the physics and the structure evolution occurring in the most exotic flavour of active galaxies, the blazars. In particular, the presence of {\sl Fermi-GST} is providing a unique opportunity for such studies delivering $\gamma$-ray data of unprecedented quality. Here we introduce a monitoring program that has been running at the Effelsberg 100m telescope since January 2007, underpinning a broad multi-frequency collaboration of facilities that cover the band from radio to infrared. Sixty one selected blazars are observed monthly between 2.64 GHz and 43 GHz. The calibration accuracy is better than a few percent as it is demonstrated with some preliminary examples.
