We address the question of an appropriate choice of basis functions for the self-consistent field (SCF) method of simulation of the N-body problem. Our criterion is based on a comparison of the orbits found in N-body realizations of analytical potential-density models of triaxial galaxies, in which the potential is fitted by the SCF method using a variety of basis sets, with those of the original models. Our tests refer to maximally triaxial Dehnen gamma-models for values of $\gamma$ in the range 0<=gamma<=1. When an N-body realization of a model is fitted by the SCF method, the choice of radial basis functions affects significantly the way the potential, forces, or derivatives of the forces are reproduced, especially in the central regions of the system. We find that this results in serious discrepancies in the relative amounts of chaotic versus regular orbits, or in the distributions of the Lyapunov characteristic exponents, as found by different basis sets. Numerical tests include the Clutton-Brock and the Hernquist-Ostriker (HO) basis sets, as well as a family of numerical basis sets which are `close' to the HO basis set. The family of numerical basis sets is parametrized in terms of a quantity $\epsilon$ which appears in the kernel functions of the Sturm-Liouville (SL) equation defining each basis set. The HO basis set is the $\epsilon=0$ member of the family. We demonstrate that grid solutions of the SL equation yielding numerical basis sets introduce large errors in the variational equations of motion. We propose a quantum-mechanical method of solution of the SL equation which overcomes these errors. We finally give criteria for a choice of optimal value of $\epsilon$ and calculate the latter as a function of the value of gamma.
