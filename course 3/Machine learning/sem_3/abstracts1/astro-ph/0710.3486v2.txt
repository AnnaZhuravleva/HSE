Smooth double crossing of the phantom divide line $w_{\Lambda}=-1$ has been found possible with a single minimally coupled scalar field for the most simple form of generalized k-essence cosmological model, in the presence of background cold dark matter. Such crossing is a sufficiently late time transient phenomena and does not have any pathological behaviour.
