The radio sky is poorly sampled for rapidly varying transients because of the narrow field-of-view of most imaging radio telescopes at cm and shorter wavelengths. The emergence of sensitive long wavelength observations with intrinsically larger fields-of-view are changing this situation, as partly illustrated by our ongoing meter-wavelength monitoring observations and archival studies of the Galactic Center. In this search, we discovered a transient, bursting, radio source in the direction of the Galactic Center, GCRT J1745-3009, with extremely unusual properties. Its flux and rapid variability imply a brightness temperature >10^12 K if it is at a distance >70 pc, implying that it is a coherent emitter. I will discuss the discovery of the source and the subsequent re-detections, as well as searches for counterparts at other wavelengths, and several proposed models.
