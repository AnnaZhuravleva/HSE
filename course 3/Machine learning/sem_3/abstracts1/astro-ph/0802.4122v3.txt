Recently, some efforts focus on differentiating dark energy and modified gravity with the growth function $\delta(z)$. In the literature, it is useful to parameterize the growth rate $f\equiv d\ln\delta/d\ln a=\Omega_m^\gamma$ with the growth index $\gamma$. In this note, we consider the general DGP model with any $\Omega_k$. We confront the growth index of DGP model with currently available growth rate data and find that the DGP model is still consistent with it. This implies that more and better growth rate data are required to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity.
