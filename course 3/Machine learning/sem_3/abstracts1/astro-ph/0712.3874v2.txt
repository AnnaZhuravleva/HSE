The low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-238 is presently unique for its consistently regular bursting behavior. In previous Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) measurements between 1997 November and 2002 July, this source exhibited (nearly) limit-cycle bursts with recurrence times that decreased proportionately as the persistent flux increased. Here we report additional measurements of the burst recurrence time by RXTE, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, as well as observations of optical bursts. On a few occasions we measured burst recurrence times which deviated significantly from the earlier flux-recurrence time relationship, and most of these bursts occurred earlier than would be predicted based on the X-ray flux level. The epochs with early bursts were also accompanied by unusual broadband timing signatures, with the entire power spectrum shifting to higher frequencies. Concurrent XMM-Newton observations during one of these occasions, in 2003 April, indicate that an additional soft component may be present in the spectrum containing enough flux (30% of the total) to account for the burst recurrence time discrepancy. A self-consistent interpretation for the increase in soft flux and accompanying timing changes during 2003 April is that accretion disk extends down to smaller radial distances from the source than during the other observing epochs. The RXTE observations since 2003 April show that the spectral and timing properties have nearly returned to the previously established level.
