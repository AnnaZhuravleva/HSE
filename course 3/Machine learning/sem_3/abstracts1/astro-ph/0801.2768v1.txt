Mass segregation stands as one of the most robust features of the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating star clusters. In this paper we formulate parametrised models of mass segregated star clusters in virial equilibrium. To this purpose we introduce mean inter-particle potentials for statistically described unsegregated systems and suggest a single-parameter generalisation of its form which gives a mass-segregated state. We describe an algorithm for construction of appropriate star cluster models. Their stability over several crossing-times is verified by following the evolution by means of direct N-body integration.
