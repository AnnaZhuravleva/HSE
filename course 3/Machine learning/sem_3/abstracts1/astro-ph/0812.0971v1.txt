Galactic nuclei are unique laboratories for the study of processes connected with the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes. At the same time, they represent challenging environments from the point of view of stellar dynamics due to their extreme densities and masses involved. There is a growing evidence about the importance of the mutual interaction of stars with gas in galactic nuclei. Gas rich environment may lead to stellar formation which, on the other hand, may regulate accretion onto the central mass. Gas in the form of massive torus or accretion disc further influences stellar dynamics in the central parsec either via gravitational or hydrodynamical interaction. Eccentricity oscillations on one hand and energy dissipation on the other hand lead to increased rate of infall of stars into the supermassive black hole. Last, but not least, processes related to the stellar dynamics may be detectable with forthcoming gravitational waves detectors.
