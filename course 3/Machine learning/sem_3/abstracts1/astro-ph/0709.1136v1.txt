We present our observations of the radio emission from supernova (SN) 1993J, in M 81 (NGC 3031), made with the VLA, from 90 to 0.7 cm, as well as numerous measurements from other telescopes. The combined data set constitutes probably the most detailed set of measurements ever established for any SN outside of the Local Group in any wavelength range. Only SN 1987A in the LMC has been the subject of such an intensive observational program. The radio emission evolves regularly in both time and frequency, and the usual interpretation in terms of shock interaction with a circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by a pre-SN stellar wind describes the observations rather well considering the complexity of the phenomenon. However: 1) The 85 - 110 GHz measurements at early times are not well fitted by the parameterization, unlike the cm wavelength measurements. 2) At mid-cm wavelengths there is some deviation from the fitted radio light curves. 3) At a time ~3100 days after shock breakout, the decline rate of the radio emission steepens without change in the spectral index. This decline is best described as an exponential decay starting at day 3100 with an e-folding time of ~1100 days. 4) The best overall fit to all of the data is a model including both non-thermal synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) and a thermal free-free absorbing (FFA) components at early times, evolving to a constant spectral index, optically thin decline rate, until the break in that decline rate. Moreover, neither a purely SSA nor a purely FFA absorbing models can provide a fit that simultaneously reproduces the light curves, the spectral index evolution, and the brightness temperature evolution. 5) The radio and X-ray light curves exhibit similar behavior and suggest a sudden drop in the SN progenitor mass-loss rate at ~8000 years prior to shock breakout.
