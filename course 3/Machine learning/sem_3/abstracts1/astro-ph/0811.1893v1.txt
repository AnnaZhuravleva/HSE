Recently radio signals originating from extensive air showers have been observed at the Pierre Auger Observatory. In this note we present software to simulate the response of an array of antenna detectors and to reconstruct the radio signals. With this software it is possible to investigate design parameters of an antenna array and to visualize the radio data. We show comparisons between measurements of radio signals from air showers and simulated data which were generated with the REAS2 generator and then processed with the detector simulation and reconstruction software.
