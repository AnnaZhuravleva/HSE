We present three-dimensional, self-consistent radiative transfer solutions with a new Monte Carlo radiative equilibrium code. The code, RADISHE ($\bf{RAD}$iative transfer $\bf{I}$n $\bf{S}$moothed particle $\bf{H}$ydrodynamics and $\bf{E}$ulerian codes), can be applied to calculate the emergent spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and broadband images from optical to millimeter wavelengths of arbitrary density geometries with distributed sources of radiation. One of the primary uses of this code has been to interface with hydrodynamical codes to calculate emergent SEDs along a simulation time sequence. The primary methodological focus of this paper is on the radiative equilibrium temperature calculation. We find that an iterative calculation of the temperature, which takes as the Monte Carlo estimator for the mean free intensity the sum of photon flight paths, is significantly faster than relaxation temperature calculation methods, particularly when large numbers of grid cells are required, i.e., in modeling three-dimensional geometries such as the dust envelopes of turbulent massive protostellar cores or infrared bright galaxies. We present simulated color-color plots for infrared bright galaxies at a range of redshifts, and unfold these plots as color vs the fractional AGN luminosity, to demonstrate that $\it{Herschel}$ will be able to effectively discriminate between submillimeter galaxies where the energy source is dominated by AGN and those where star formation dominates.
