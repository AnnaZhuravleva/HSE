We report H-alpha observations of zeta Tauri, taken between late 2000 and early 2006. Next to extending existing long-term montioring of the disk state of this star we report an intermediate timescale of about 69 days to be present in the V/R variations of the Halpha line. The observational data will be published together with this manuscript.
