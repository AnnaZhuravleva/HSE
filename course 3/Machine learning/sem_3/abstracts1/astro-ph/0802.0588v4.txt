We calculate the tree-level bispectrum of the inflaton field perturbation directly from the field equations, and construct the corresponding f_NL parameter. Our results agree with previous ones derived from the Lagrangian. We argue that quantum theory should only be used to calculate the correlators when they first become classical a few Hubble times after horizon exit, the classical evolution taking over thereafter.
