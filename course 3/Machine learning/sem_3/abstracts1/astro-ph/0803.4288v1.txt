Hubble Space telescope (HST) images of merging galaxy system VV29 reveal the 0.3 Mpc baryonic-dark-matter (BDM) halo composed of primordial protoglobularstarcluster (PGC) clumps of planets. Star-cluster-wakes trace the merger by formation of stars from the planets. Aligned young globular star clusters (YGCs), star-wakes and dust-trails show the frictional, spiral passage of galaxy fragments VV29cdef in a long tail-like galaxy (VV29b) as the fragments merge on the accretion disk plane of the central spiral galaxy VV29a. The observations confirm the hydro-gravitational-dynamics (HGD) prediction of Gibson 1996 and quasar microlensing inference of Schild 1996 that the dark matter of galaxies is dominated by planets (PFPs) in million-solar-mass clumps. Globular star clusters (YGCs, OGCs, PGCs) preserve the density of the plasma epoch 30,000 years after the big bang when viscous supercluster-fragmentation began. Tadpole images show linear galaxy clusters reflecting turbulent vortex lines of protogalaxy fragmentation at the 0.003 Mpc Kolmogorov-Nomura scale of the plasma before transition to gas. The halo size indicates strong diffusion of PGC primordial-planet-clumps from a cooling protogalaxy as its planets freeze.
