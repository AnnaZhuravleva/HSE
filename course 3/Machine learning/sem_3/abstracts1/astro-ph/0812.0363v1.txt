(Abridged) We present a detailed analysis of the main physical processes responsible for the transport of angular momentum and chemical species in the radiative regions of rotating stars. We focus on cases where meridional circulation and shear-induced turbulence only are included in the simulations. Our analysis is based on a 2-D representation of the secular hydrodynamics, which is treated using expansions in spherical harmonics. We present a full reconstruction of the meridional circulation and of the associated fluctuations of temperature and mean molecular weight along with diagnosis for the transport of angular momentum, heat and chemicals. In the present paper these tools are used to validate the analysis of two main sequence stellar models of 1.5 and 20 Msun for which the hydrodynamics has been previously extensively studied in the literature. We obtain a clear visualization and a precise estimation of the different terms entering the angular momentum and heat transport equations in radiative zones. This enables us to corroborate the main results obtained over the past decade by Zahn, Maeder, and collaborators concerning the secular hydrodynamics of such objects. We focus on the meridional circulation driven by angular momentum losses and structural readjustements. We confirm quantitatively for the first time through detailed computations and separation of the various components that the advection of entropy by this circulation is very well balanced by the barotropic effects and the thermal relaxation during most of the main sequence evolution. This enables us to derive simplifications for the thermal relaxation on this phase. The meridional currents in turn advect heat and generate temperature fluctuations that induce differential rotation through thermal wind thus closing the transport loop.
