We show that TeV gamma-ray emission produced via interactions of high-energy particles with anisotropic radiation field of a massive star in binary systems should have a characteristic rotating hollow cone anisotropy pattern. The hollow cone, whose axis is directed away from the massive star, rotates with the period equal to the orbital period of the system. We note that the two maxima pattern of the TeV energy band lightcurve of the gamma-ray loud binary LS 5039 can be interpreted in terms of this rotating hollow cone model. Adopting such an interpretation, we are able to constrain the geometry of the system - either the inclination angle of the binary orbit, or the elevation of the gamma-ray emission region above the orbital plane.
