Five planets are presently believed to orbit the primary star of 55 Cnc, but there exists a large 5 AU gap in their distribution between the two outermost planets. This gap has attracted considerable interest because it may contain one or more lower--mass planets whose existence is not contradicted by long-term orbit stability analyses, in fact it is expected according to the "packed planetary systems" hypothesis and an empirical Titius--Bode relation recently proposed for 55 Cnc. Furthermore, the second largest planet is just the second farthest and it orbits very close to the star. Its orbit, the most circular of all, appears to be nearly but not quite commensurable with the orbit of the third planet, casting doubt that any migration or resonant capture of the inner planets has ever occurred and lending support to the idea of "in--situ" giant planet formation by the process of core accretion. All of the above ideas will be tested in the coming years in this natural laboratory as more observations will become available. This opportunity presents itself in conjunction with a physical model that relates the orbits of the observed planets to the structure of the original protoplanetary disk that harbored their formation at the early stages of protostellar collapse. Using only the 5 observed planets of 55 Cnc, this model predicts that the surface density profile of its protoplanetary disk varied with distance $R$ precisely as $\Sigma (R)\propto R^{-3/2}$, as was also found for the minimum--mass solar nebula. Despite this similarity, the disk of 55 Cnc was smaller, heavier, and less rotationally supported than the solar nebula, so this system represents a different mode of multi--planet formation compared to our own solar system.
