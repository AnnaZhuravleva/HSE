Classical variable stars called RR Lyrae stars have pulsating outer envelopes comprised of excited atoms. Here we demonstrate that the qualitative and quantitative properties of RR Lyrae variables and one subclass of their atomic scale constituents: singly-excited helium atoms undergoing transitions between Rydberg states, share a remarkable degree of self-similarity. In terms of masses, radii, oscillation periods, morphologies and kinematics the stellar and atomic analogues obey a simple set of discrete self-similar scaling equations. The concept of stellar/atomic self-similarity may prove useful in the search for a deeper understanding of both stellar and atomic systems.
