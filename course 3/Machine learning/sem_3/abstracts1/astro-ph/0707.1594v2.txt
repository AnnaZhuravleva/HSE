Scale transformations have played an extremely successful role in studies of cosmological large-scale structure by relating the non-linear spectrum of cosmological density fluctuations to the linear primordial power at longer wavelengths. Here we generalize this approach to investigate the usefulness of scale transformations for nonlinear higher-order statistics, specifically the bispectrum. We find that the bispectrum predicted by perturbation theory at tree-level can be rescaled to match the results of full numerical simulations in the weakly and intermediately nonlinear regimes, especially at high redshifts, with an accuracy that is surprising given the simplicity of the procedure used. This discovery not only offers a simple practical way of calculating the matter bispectrum, but also suggests that scale transformations may yet yield even deeper insights into the physics of hierarchical clustering.
