I use high resolution N-body/SPH simulations to model the new proper motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within the Milky Way (MW) halo and investigate the effects of gravitational and hydrodynamical forces on the formation of the Magellanic Stream (MS). Both the LMC and the MW are fully self consistent galaxy models embedded in extended cuspy LCDM dark matter halos. I find that ram-pressure from a low density ionized halo is sufficient to remove a large amount of gas from the LMC's disk forming a trailing Stream that extends more than 120 degrees from the Cloud. Tidal forces elongate the satellite's disk but do not affect its vertical structure. No stars become unbound showing that tidal stripping is almost effectiveless.
