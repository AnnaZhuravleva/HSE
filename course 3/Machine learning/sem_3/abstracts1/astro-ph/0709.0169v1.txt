Integral-field spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen in the optical wavelength region and complementary long-slit near-infrared spectroscopy are presented towards HH91A.The detection of some 200 H_2 lines arising from ro-vibrational levels up to v'=8 ranging between 7700A and 2.3 microns is reported. The emission arises from thermally excited gas where the bulk of the material is at 2750 K and where 1% is at 6000 K. The total column density of shocked gas is N(H_2) = 10^{18} cm^{-2}. Non-thermal excitation scenarios such as UV-fluorescence do not contribute to the excitation of H_2 towards HH91A. The emission is explained in terms of a slow non-dissociative J-shock which propagates into a low-density medium which has been swept-up by previous episodes of outflows which have occurred in the evolved HH90/91 complex.
