I study the dynamics of a superfluid vortex in a random potential, as in the inner crust of a neutron star. Below a critical flow velocity of the ambient superfluid, a vortex is effectively immobilized by lattice forces even in the limit of zero dissipation. Low-velocity, translatory motion is not dynamically possible, a result with important implications for understanding neutron star precession and the dynamical properties of superfluid nuclear matter.
