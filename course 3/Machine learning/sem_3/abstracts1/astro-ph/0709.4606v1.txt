Context: In preparation for the COROT mission, an exhaustive photometric study of Be stars located in the seismology fields of the COROT mission has been performed. The very precise and long-time-spanned photometric observations gathered by the COROT satellite will give important clues of the origin of the Be phenomenon.   Aims: The aim of this work is to find short-period variable Be stars located in the seismology fields of COROT and to study and characterise their pulsational properties.   Methods: Light curves obtained at the Observatorio de Sierra Nevada together with data from Hipparcos and ASAS-3 of a total of 84 Be stars have been analysed in order to search for short-term variations. We have applied standard Fourier techniques and non-linear least-square fitting to the time series.   Results: We have found 7 multiperiodic, 21 mono-periodic and 26 non-variable Be stars. Short-term variability has been detected in 74% of early-type Be stars and in 31% of mid- to late-type Be stars. We have shown that non-radial pulsations are most frequent among Be stars than in slow-rotating B stars of the same spectral range.
