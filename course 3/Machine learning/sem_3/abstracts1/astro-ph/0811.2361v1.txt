The ARENA08 conference, held in Rome in June 2008, gave an almost complete overview on applications of the new techniques radio and acoustic detection of electromagnetic showers generated by high-energy cosmic particles in air or in dielectric media. There are vast activities all over the world, and the progress is remarkable. This was displayed by more than 30 contributions to the conference related to the radio detection technique, only. This paper gives a short summary on the status of 'radio detection of particles from the cosmos' as presented at the conference.
