We present the results of our photometric and spectroscopic observations of Nova Sco 2007 N.1 (V1280 Sco). The photometric data was represented by a single data point in the light curve since the observation was carried out only for one night. The spectra cover two different phases of the object's evolution during the outburst, i.e. pre-maximum and post-maximum. Measurements of the P-Cygni profile on Na I 'D' line (5889 \AA) was derived as the velocity of shell expansion, yielding $1567.43 \pm 174.14$ km s$^{-1}$. We conclude that V1280 Sco is a fast Fe II-type nova.
