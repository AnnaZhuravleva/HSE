In this paper we study the sound speed - $c_s^2$, which is directly related to the classical perturbations - of the dynamical dark energy (DE), especially with an equation of state crossing the cosmological constant boundary in details and show its implications on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropy. With the present observational data of CMB, Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) and galaxy clustering, we perform a global analysis to constrain the sound speed of dark energy, using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We find that the sound speed of dark energy is weakly constrained by current observations thus the futuristic precision measurements of CMB on a very large angular scale (low multipoles) are necessary.
