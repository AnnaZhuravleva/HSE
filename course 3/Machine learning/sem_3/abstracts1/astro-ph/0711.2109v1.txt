The H3O+ molecule probes the oxygen chemistry and the ionization rate of dense circumnuclear gas in galaxies. In particular, recent H3O+ observations show variations in the cosmic-ray ionization rate by factors of $>$10 within our Galaxy. Using the JCMT, we have observed the 364 GHz line of p-H3O+ in the centers of M82 and Arp 220. In Arp 220, the line profile suggests that the emission originates in the Western nucleus. In M82, both the eastern molecular peak and the circumnuclear region contribute to the emission. The derived column densities, abundances, and H3O+ / H2O ratios indicate ionization rates similar to or even exceeding that in the Galactic Center. Model calculations of the chemistry of irradiated molecular gas indicate a likely origin of this high ionization rate in the extended, evolved starburst of M82. In contrast, irradiation by X-rays from the AGN disk is the most likely model for Arp 220.
