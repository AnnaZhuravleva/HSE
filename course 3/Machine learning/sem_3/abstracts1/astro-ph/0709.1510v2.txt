We use kinematic data from three new, nearby, extremely low-luminosity Milky Way dwarf galaxies (Ursa Major II, Willman 1, and Coma Berenices) to constrain the properties of their dark matter halos, and from these make predictions for the gamma-ray flux from annihilation of dark matter particles in these halos. We show that these 10^3 solar luminosity dwarfs are the most dark matter dominated galaxies in the Universe, with total masses within 100 pc in excess of 10^6 solar masses. Coupled with their relative proximity, their large masses imply that they should have mean gamma-ray fluxes comparable to or greater than any other known satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. Our results are robust to both variations of the inner slope of the density profile and the effect of tidal interactions. The fluxes could be boosted by up to two orders of magnitude if we include the density enhancements caused by surviving dark matter substructure.
