This paper is a continuation of an ongoing study of the evolutionary processes affecting cluster galaxies. Both CCD R band and H alpha narrow-band imaging was used to determine photometric parameters (m_(r), r_(24), H alpha flux and equivalent width) and derive star formation rates for 227 CGCG galaxies in 8 low-redshift clusters. The galaxy sample is a subset of CGCG galaxies in an objective prism survey of cluster galaxies for H alpha emission. It is found that detection of emission-line galaxies in the OPS is 85%, 70%, and 50% complete at the mean surface brightness values of 1.25 x 10^(-19), 5.19 x 10^(-20), and 1.76 x 10^(-20) W m^(-2) arcsec^(-2), respectively, measured within the R band isophote of 24 mag arcsec^(-2) for the galaxy. The CCD data, together with matched data from a recent H alpha galaxy survey of UGC galaxies within 3000 km s^(-1), will be used for a comparative study of R band and H alpha surface photometry between cluster and field spirals.
