Our current understanding of the star formation histories of early-type galaxies is reviewed, in the context of recent observational studies of their ultra-violet (UV) properties. Combination of UV and optical spectro-photometric data indicates that the bulk of the stellar mass in the early-type population forms at high redshift (z > 2), typically over short timescales (< 1 Gyr). Nevertheless, early-types of all luminosities form stars over the lifetime of the Universe, with most luminous (-23 < M(V) < -21) systems forming 10-15% of their stellar mass after z = 1 (with a scatter to higher value), while their less luminous (M(V) > -21) counterparts form 30-60% of their mass in the same redshift range. The large scatter in the (rest-frame) UV colours in the redshift range 0 < z < 0.7 indicates widespread low-level star formation in the early-type population over the last 8 billion years. The mass fraction of young (< 1 Gyr old) stars in luminous early-type galaxies varies between 1% and 6% at z~0 and is in the range 5-13% at z~0.7. The intensity of recent star formation and the bulk of the UV colour distribution is consistent with what might be expected from minor mergers (mass ratios < 1:6) in an LCDM cosmology.
