We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a geometrically thin accretion disk around a non-spinning black hole. The disk has a thickness $h/r\sim0.05-0.1$ over the radial range $(2-20)GM/c^2$. In steady state, the specific angular momentum profile of the inflowing magnetized gas deviates by less than 2% from that of the standard thin disk model of   Novikov & Thorne (1973). Also, the magnetic torque at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is only $\sim2%$ of the inward flux of angular momentum at this radius. Both results indicate that magnetic coupling across the ISCO is relatively unimportant for geometrically thin disks.
