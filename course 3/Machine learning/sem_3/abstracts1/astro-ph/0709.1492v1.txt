The recently suggested correlation between the surface temperature and the magnetic field in isolated neutron stars does not seem to work well for SGRs, AXPs and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINs; specifically the Magnificent Seven or M7). Instead by appealing to a Color-Flavor Locked Quark Star (CFLQS) we find a more natural explanation. In this picture, the heating is provided by magnetic flux expulsion from a crust-less superconducting quark star. Combined with our previous studies concerning the possibility of SGRs, AXPs, and XDINs as CFLQSs, this provides another piece of evidence that these objects are all related. Specifically, we propose that XDINs are the descendants of SGRs and AXPs.
