The GLAST mission to be launched in November 2007 will provide unique information about high energy photon fluxes from gamma-ray bursts. These data will be most useful when combined with multiwavelength observations that provide more complete characterizations of such events. To assist this process, we have estimated the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT) angular resolution for the coordinates of ensembles of photons from GRBs as a function of burst spectral index and fluence. This information may be useful in guiding the development of more effective GRB optical afterglow observation programs.
