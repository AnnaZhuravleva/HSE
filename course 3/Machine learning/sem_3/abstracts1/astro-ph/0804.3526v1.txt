We outline a scenario which traces a direct path from freely-floating nebula particles to the first 10-100km-sized bodies in the terrestrial planet region, producing planetesimals which have properties matching those of primitive meteorite parent bodies. We call this "primary accretion". The scenario draws on elements of previous work, and introduces a new critical threshold for planetesimal formation. We presume the nebula to be weakly turbulent, which leads to dense concentrations of aerodynamically size-sorted particles having properties like those observed in chondrites. The fractional volume of the nebula occupied by these dense zones or clumps obeys a probability distribution as a function of their density, and the densest concentrations have particle mass density 100 times that of the gas. However, even these densest clumps are prevented by gas pressure from undergoing gravitational instability in the traditional sense (on a dynamical timescale). While in this state of arrested development, they are susceptible to disruption by the ram pressure of the differentially orbiting nebula gas. However, self-gravity can preserve sufficiently large and dense clumps from ram pressure disruption, allowing their entrained particles to sediment gently but inexorably towards their centers, producing 10-100 km "sandpile" planetesimals. Localized radial pressure fluctuations in the nebula, and interactions between differentially moving dense clumps, will also play a role that must be allowed for in future studies. The scenario is readily extended from meteorite parent bodies to primary accretion throughout the solar system.
