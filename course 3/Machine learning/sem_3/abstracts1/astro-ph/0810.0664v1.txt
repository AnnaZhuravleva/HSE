The unidentified TeV gamma-ray source MGRO J1908+06/HESS J1908+063 was observed with the VERITAS Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Array during October 2007 and May-June 2008. This extended source is located on the galactic plane at a galactic longitude of 40.45 degrees and has a hard TeV spectrum with an index of approximately 2.08. The Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray flux was measured by H.E.S.S. out to energies greater than 30 TeV which along with its unidentified nature makes it an interesting hard-spectrum extended source for study. We confirm the detection of VHE gamma-ray emission from this source using VERITAS.
