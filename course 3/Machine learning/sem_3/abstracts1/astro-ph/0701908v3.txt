Absorbtion of Alfven waves is considered to be the main mechanism of heating in the solar corona. It is concluded that the sharp increase of the plasma temperature by two orders of magnitude is related to a self-induced opacity with respect to Alfven waves. The maximal frequency for propagation of Alfven waves is determined by the strongly temperature dependent kinematic viscosity. In such a way the temperature jump is due to absorption of high frequency Alfven waves in a narrow layer above the solar surface. It is calculated that the power per unit area dissipated in this layer due to damping of Alfven waves blows up the plasma and gives birth to the solar wind. A model short wave-length (WKB) evaluation takes into account the 1/f^2 frequency dependance of the transversal magnetic field and velocity spectral densities. Such spectral densities agree with old magnetometric data taken by Voyager 1 and recent theoretical calculations in the framework of Langevin-Burgers MHD. The present theory predicts existence of intensive high frequency MHD Alfven waves in the cold layer beneath the corona. It is briefly discussed how this statement can be checked experimentally. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of the Alfven waves generating random noise and the solar wind velocity can be expressed only in terms of satellite experimental data. It is advocated that investigation of properties of the solar surface as a random driver by optical methods is an important task for future solar physics. Jets of accretion disks are speculated as a special case of the wind from magnetized turbulent plasma.
