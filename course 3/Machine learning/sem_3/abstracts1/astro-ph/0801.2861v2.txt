Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the candidates of ultra-high-energy (around 10^18.5 eV) cosmic-ray (UHECR) sources. We investigate high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration including heavy nuclei in GRBs by using Geant 4, and discuss its various implications, taking both of high-luminosity (HL) and low-luminosity (LL) GRBs into account. This is because LL GRBs may also make a significant contribution to the observed UHECR flux if they form a distinct population. We show that not only protons but also heavier nuclei can be accelerated up to ultra-high energies in the internal, (external) reverse and forward shock models. We also show that the condition for ultra-high-energy heavy nuclei such as iron to survive is almost the same as that for about TeV gamma-rays to escape from the source and for high-energy neutrinos not to be much produced. The multi-messenger astronomy by neutrino and GeV-TeV gamma-ray telescopes such as IceCube and KM3Net, GLAST and MAGIC will be important to see whether GRBs can be accelerators of ultra-high-energy heavy nuclei. We also demonstrate expected spectra of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays, and discuss their detectabilities. In addition, we discuss implictaions of the GRB-UHECR hypothesis. We point out, since the number densities of HL-GRBs and LL-GRBs are quite different, its detemination by UHECR observations is also important.
