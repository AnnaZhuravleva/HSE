Shell galaxies are widely considered the debris of recent accretion/merging episodes. Their high frequency in low density environment suggests that such episodes could be among the driver of the early-type galaxy secular evolution. We present far and near UV (FUV and NUV respectively hereafter) GALEX photometric properties of a sample of shell galaxies.
