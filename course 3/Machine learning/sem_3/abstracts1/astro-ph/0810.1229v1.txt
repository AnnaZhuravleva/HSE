There are several wide field galaxy and cluster surveys planned for the nearest future, e.g. BOSS, WFMOS, ADEPT, Hetdex, SPT, eROSITA. In the simplest approach one would analyze these independently, thus neglecting the extra information provided by the cluster-galaxy cross-pairs. In this paper we have focused on the possible synergy between these surveys by investigating the amount of information encoded in the cross-pairs. We present a model for the cluster-galaxy cross-spectrum within the Halo Model framework. To assess the gain in performance due to inclusion of the cluster-galaxy cross-pairs we carry out a Fisher matrix analysis for a BOSS-like galaxy redshift survey targeting luminous red galaxies and a hypothetical mass-limited cluster redshift survey with a lower mass threshold of 1.7x10^14 M_sun/h over the same volume. On small scales cluster-galaxy cross-spectrum probes directly density profile of the halos, instead of the density profile convolved with itself, as is the case for the galaxy power spectrum. Due to this different behavior, adding information from the cross-pairs helps to tighten constraints on the halo occupation distribution. By inclusion of the cross-pairs a factor of ~2 stronger constraints are obtained for sigma_8, while the improvement for the dark energy figure-of-merit is somewhat weaker: an increase by a factor of 1.4.
