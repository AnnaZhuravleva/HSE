The dynamics of a self-gravitating neutron gas in presence of a magnetic field is being studied taking the equation of state of a magnetized neutron gas obtained in a previous study [2]. We work in a Bianchi I spacetime characterized by a Kasner metric, this metric allow us to take into account the anisotropy that introduces the magnetic field. The set of Einstein-Maxwell field equations for this gas becomes a dynamical system in a 4-dimensional phase space. We get numerical solutions of the system. In particular there is a unique point like solution for different initial conditions. Physically this singular solution may be associated with the collapse of a local volume of neutron material within a neutron star.
