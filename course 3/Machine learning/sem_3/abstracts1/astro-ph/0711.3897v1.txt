We report V, R, and I band CCD photometry of the radio galaxy 3C 390.3 obtained with the 1.56-m telescope of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory from March 1995 to August 2004. Combining these data with data from the literature, we have constructed a historical light curve from 1894 to 2004 and searched for periodicities using the CLEANest program. We find possible periods of 8.30+-1.17, 5.37+-0.49, 3.51+-0.21, and 2.13+-0.08 years.
