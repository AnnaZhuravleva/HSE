We compare the dark energy model constraints obtained by using recent standard ruler data (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at z=0.2 and z=0.35 and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters R and l_a) with the corresponding constraints obtained by using recent Type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) standard candle data (ESSENCE+SNLS+HST from Davis et. al.). We find that, even though both classes of data are consistent with LCDM at the 2\sigma level, there is a systematic difference between the two classes of data. In particular, we find that for practically all values of the parameters (\Omega_0m,\Omega_b) in the 2\sigma range of the the 3-year WMAP data (WMAP3) best fit, LCDM is significantly more consistent with the SnIa data than with the CMB+BAO data. For example for (\Omega_0m,\Omega_b)=(0.24,0.042) corresponding to the best fit values of WMAP3, the dark energy equation of state parametrization w(z)=w_0 + w_1 (z/(1+z)) best fit is at a 0.5\sigma distance from LCDM (w_0=-1,w_1=0) using the SnIa data and 1.7\sigma away from LCDM using the CMB+BAO data. There is a similar trend in the earlier data (SNLS vs CMB+BAO at z=0.35). This trend is such that the standard ruler CMB+BAO data show a mild preference for crossing of the phantom divide line w=-1, while the recent SnIa data favor LCDM. Despite of this mild difference in trends, we find no statistically significant evidence for violation of the cosmic distance duality relation \eta \equiv d_L(z)/(d_A(z) (1+z)^2)=1. For example, using a prior of \Omega_0m=0.24, we find \eta=0.95 \pm 0.025 in the redshift range 0<z<2, which is consistent with distance duality at the 2\sigma level.
