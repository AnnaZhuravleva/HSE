We report on VERITAS observations at energies above 200 GeV of known or potential galactic gamma-ray sources. The observed objects comprise pulsars, pulsar wind nebulae, high-mass X-ray binaries and gamma-ray sources with unknown counterparts in other wavelengths. Among the highlights are the observation of variable gamma-ray emission from the X-ray binary LS I +61 303 and the detection of MGRO J1906+06/HESS J1906+063, an extended gamma-ray source which could not be associated with any obvious counterpart at lower energies.
