There is a category of stable non-baryonic dark matter particles in the universe at the present time: fermions or bosons with mass ~10^(-1) eV. The existence of these do not contradict the dip phenomena of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic ray spectrum at ~10^(15) eV ("knee") and ~10^(18) eV ("ankle"), nor the existence of galaxies at large red shift z~10. The mass scales sequence connected by a large number A, especially the superstructure scale, is helpful in the understanding of the Hubble constant and the cosmological constant.   The second section (extension section) of this paper describes the extension of the mass scales sequence and new particles (u-particle, Planck particle, A-particle, delta-particle...). This can be used to explore the state of matter with super-high density (much greater than nuclear density), inflation, lightest black hole (LBH) etc in the early universe. The inflation appears as a step by step fission process of black holes. Measuring the rate of change of the speed of light and the Planck constant h at the present time year after year is an important step. Doing so can check whether the cosmological constant exists.   The third section of this paper is a summary. That describes and reviews the large number, the mass scales sequence, background particles, the evolution of the universe, critical energy, renormalization, and beyond SM (dark matter particles with low mass), especially for the finite universe.
