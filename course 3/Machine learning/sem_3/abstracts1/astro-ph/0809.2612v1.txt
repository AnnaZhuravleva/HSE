The ESSENCE project was a six year supernova search carried out with the CTIO 4-m telescope. We also obtained spectra with many of the world's largest ground-based telescopes and observed some of our SNe with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We achieved our goal of discovering over 200 Type Ia SNe in the redshift range 0.2 to 0.8. With these data we determined the cosmic equation of state parameter to +/- 10 percent. The data are consistent with a geometrically flat universe whose dark energy is equivalent to Einstein's cosmological constant.
