We report trigonometric parallaxes for the high-mass star forming regions G35.20-0.74 and G35.20-1.74, corresponding to distances of 2.19 (+0.24 -0.20) kpc and 3.27 (+0.56 -0.42) kpc, respectively. The distances to both sources are close to their near kinematic distances and place them in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. Combining the distances and proper motions with observed radial velocities gives the locations and full space motions of the star forming regions. Assuming a standard model of the Galaxy, G35.20-0.74 and G35.20-1.74 have peculiar motions of ~13 km/s and ~16 km/s counter to Galactic rotation and ~9 km/s toward the North Galactic Pole.
