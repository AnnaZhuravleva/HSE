Polarimetric observations are affected by leakage of unpolarized light into the polarization channels, in a way that varies with the angular position of the source relative to the optical axis. The off-axis part of the leakage is often corrected by subtracting from each polarization image the product of the unpolarized map and a leakage map, but it is seldom realized that heterogeneities in the array shift the loci of the leaked radiation in a baseline-dependent fashion. We present here a method to measure and remove the wide-field polarization leakage of a heterogeneous array. The process also maps the complex voltage patterns of each antenna, which can be used to correct all Stokes parameters for imaging errors due to the primary beams.
