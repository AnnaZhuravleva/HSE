Disk galaxies with a spheroidal component are known to host Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) in their center. Unequal-mass galaxy mergers have been rarely studied despite the fact that they are the large majority of merging events by number and they are associated with the typical targets of gravitational wave experiments such as LISA. We performed N-body/SPH simulations of disk galaxy mergers with mass ratios 1:4 and 1:10 at redshifts z=0 and z=3. They have the highest resolution achieved so far for merging galaxies, and include star formation and supernova feedback. Gas dissipation is found to be necessary for the pairing of SMBHs in these minor mergers. Still, 1:10 mergers with gas allow an efficient pairing only at high z when orbital times are short enough compared to the Hubble time.
