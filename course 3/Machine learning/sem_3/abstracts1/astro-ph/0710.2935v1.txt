TenTen is a proposed array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) optimized for the gamma ray energy regime of 10 TeV to 100 TeV, but with a threshold of ~1 to a few TeV. It will offer a collecting area of 10 km2 above energies of 10 TeV. In the initial phase, a cell of 3 to 5 modest-sized telescopes, each with 10-30 m2 mirror area, is suggested for an Australian site. A possible expansion of the array could comprise many such cells. Here we present work on configuration and technical issues from our simulation studies of the array. Working topics include array layout, telescope size and optics, camera field of view, telescope trigger system, electronics, and site surveys.
