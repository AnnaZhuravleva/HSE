Steady, spherically symmetric, adiabatic accretion and wind flows around non-rotating black holes were studied for fully ionized, multi-component fluids, which are described by a relativistic equation of state (EoS). We showed that the polytropic index depends on the temperature as well as on the composition of fluids, so the composition is important to the solutions of the flows. We demonstrated that fluids with different composition can produce dramatically different solutions, even if they have the same sonic point, or they start with the same specific energy or the same temperature. Then, we pointed that the Coulomb relaxation times can be longer than the dynamical time in the problem considered here, and discussed the implication.
