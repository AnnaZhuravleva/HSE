RS Ophiuchi is a recurrent nova with a period of about 22 years, consisting of a wind accreting binary system with a white dwarf (WD) very close to the Chandrasekhar limit and a red giant star (RG). The system is considered a prime candidate to evolve into an SNIa. We present a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of the quiescent accretion and the subsequent explosive phase. The computed circumstellar mass distribution in the quiescent phase is highly structured with a mass enhancement in the orbital plane of about a factor of 2 as compared to the poleward directions. The simulated nova remnant evolves aspherically, propagating faster toward the poles. The shock velocities derived from the simulations are in agreement with those derived from observations. For v_RG = 20 km/s and for nearly isothermal flows, we derive a mass transfer rate to the WD of 10% of the mass loss of the RG. For an RG mass loss of 10^{-7} solar masses per year, we found the orbit of the system to decay by 3% per million years. With the derived mass transfer rate, multi-cycle nova models provide a qualitatively correct recurrence time, amplitude, and fastness of the nova. Our simulations provide, along with the observations and nova models, the third ingredient for a deeper understanding of the recurrent novae of the RS Oph type. In combination with recent multi-cycle nova models, our results suggests that the WD in RS Oph will increase in mass. Several speculative outcomes then seem plausible. The WD may reach the Chandrasekhar limit and explode as an SN Ia. Alternatively, the mass loss of the RG could result in a smaller Roche volume, a common envelope phase, and a narrow WD+WD system. Angular momentum loss due to graviational wave emission could trigger the merger of the two WDs and - perhaps - an SN Ia via the double degenerate scenario.
