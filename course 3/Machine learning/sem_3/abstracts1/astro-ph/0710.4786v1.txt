The proper motion measurements for 143 previously known L and T dwarfs are presented. From this sample we identify and discuss 8 high velocity L dwarfs. We also find 4 new wide common proper motion binaries/multiple systems. Using the moving cluster methods we have also identified a number of L dwarfs that may be members of the Ursa Major (age ~400 Myr), the Hyades (age ~625 Myr) and the Pleiades (age ~125 Myr) moving groups.
