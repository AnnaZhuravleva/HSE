We investigate, by means of numerical simulations, the kinematics of elliptical-spiral merger remnants. Counterrotation can appear both in coplanar and in non-coplanar retrograde mergers, and it is mostly associated to the presence of a disk component, which preserves part of its initial spin. In turn, the external regions of the two interacting galaxies acquire part of the orbital angular momentum, due to the action of tidal forces.
