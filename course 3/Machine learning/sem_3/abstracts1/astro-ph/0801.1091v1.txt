This paper provides a review of the variants of dark matter which are thought to be fundamental components of the universe and their role in origin and evolution of structures and some new original results concerning improvements to the spherical collapse model. In particular, I show how the spherical collapse model is modified when we take into account dynamical friction and tidal torques.
