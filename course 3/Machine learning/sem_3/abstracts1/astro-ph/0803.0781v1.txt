We present the first results of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations investigating the imprint of a central black hole on the core structure of a globular cluster. We investigate the three-dimensional and the projected density profile of the inner regions of idealized as well as more realistic globular cluster models, taking into account a stellar mass spectrum, stellar evolution and allowing for a larger, more realistic, number of stars than was previously possible with direct N-body methods. We compare our results to other N-body simulations published previously in the literature.
