The yellow hypergiants are found in a stage between the massive Red Supergiants and the Wolf-Rayet stars. This review addresses current issues concerning the evolution of massive stars, concentrating on the transitional post-Red Supergiant phase. Few yellow hypergiants are known and even fewer show direct evidence for having evolved off the Red Supergiant branch. Indeed, only two such rare objects with clear evidence for having gone through of a previous mass losing phase are known, IRC +10420 and HD 179821. We will review their properties and present recent results employing near-infrared interferometry, integral field spectroscopy and polarimetry. Finally, their real-time evolution is discussed.
