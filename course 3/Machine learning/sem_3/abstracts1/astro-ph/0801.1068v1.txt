We present CCD photometric and mass function study of 9 young Large Magellanic Cloud star clusters namely NGC 1767, NGC 1994, NGC 2002, NGC 2003, NGC 2006, SL 538, NGC 2011, NGC 2098 and NGC 2136. The BVRI data reaching down to V ~ 21 mag, are collected from 3.5-meter NTT/EFOSC2 in sub-arcsec seeing conditions. For NGC 1767, NGC 1994, NGC 2002, NGC 2003, NGC 2011 and NGC 2136, broad band photometric CCD data are presented for the first time. Seven of the 9 clusters have ages between 16 to 25 Myr while remaining two clusters have ages $32\pm4$ Myr (NGC 2098) and $90\pm10$ Myr (NGC 2136). For 7 younger clusters, the age estimates based on a recent model and the integrated spectra are found to be systematically lower ($\sim$ 10 Myr) from the present estimate. In the mass range of $\sim 2 - 12$ $M_{\odot}$, the MF slopes for 8 out of nine clusters were found to be similar with the value of $\gamma$ ranging from $-1.90\pm0.16$ to $-2.28\pm0.21$. For NGC 1767 it is flatter with $\gamma = -1.23\pm0.27$. Mass segregation effects are observed for NGC 2002, NGC 2006, NGC 2136 and NGC 2098. This is consistent with the findings of Kontizas et al. for NGC 2098. Presence of mass segregation in these clusters could be an imprint of star formation process as their ages are significantly smaller than their dynamical evolution time. Mean MF slope of $\gamma = -2.22\pm0.16$ derived for a sample of 25 young ($\le 100$ Myr) dynamically unevolved LMC stellar systems provide support for the universality of IMF in the intermediate mass range $\sim 2-12 M_{\odot}$.
