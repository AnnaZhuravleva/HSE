The gamma-ray background is still a subject under great debate.   All phenomena in the universe emitting gamma-rays can contribute directly as diffuse emission or as an isotropic component from unresolved point sources. The question of the origin of the extragalactic component cannot be answered without determining the galactic emission. To discuss in detail all models resulting in gamma-ray background contributions is far beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore the focus will be on recent publications on the extragalactic high energy (>100 MeV) part of the gamma-ray background.
