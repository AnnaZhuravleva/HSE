The INTEGRAL/IBIS survey was performed collecting all the GPS and GCDE data together with all the available public data . The second catalogue, published in 2006 by Bird et al., is dominated by detection of 113 X-ray binaries, with 38 being high-mass and 67 low-mass. In most systems the compact object is a neutron star, but the sample also contains 4 confirmed Black Holes and 6 LMXB black hole candidates (BHC). There are also, in additional, 6 tentative associations as BHCs based simply on spectral and timing properties. In the sample of 12 sources (BHC and tentatively associated BHC) there are 7 transient sources that went into outbursts during the INTEGRAL survey observations. We present here the monitoring of the time and spectral evolution of these 7 outbursts.
