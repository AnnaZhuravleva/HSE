This paper addresses the problem of scattering line polarization and the Hanle effect in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) media for the case of a two-level model atom without lower-level polarization and assuming complete frequency redistribution. The theoretical framework chosen for its formulation is the QED theory of Landi Degl'Innocenti (1983), which specifies the excitation state of the atoms in terms of the irreducible tensor components of the atomic density matrix. The self-consistent values of these density-matrix elements is to be determined by solving jointly the kinetic and radiative transfer equations for the Stokes parameters. We show how to achieve this by generalizing to Non-LTE polarization transfer the Jacobi-based ALI method of Olson et al. (1986) and the iterative schemes based on Gauss-Seidel iteration of Trujillo Bueno and Fabiani Bendicho (1995). These methods essentially maintain the simplicity of the Lambda-iteration method, but their convergence rate is extremely high. Finally, some 1D and 2D model calculations are presented that illustrate the effect of horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities on magnetic and non-magnetic resonance line polarization signals.
