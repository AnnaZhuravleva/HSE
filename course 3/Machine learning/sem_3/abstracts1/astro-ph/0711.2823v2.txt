Sterile neutrinos with keV masses can constitute all or part of the cosmological dark matter. The electroweak-singlet fermions, which are usually introduced to explain the masses of active neutrinos, need not be heavier than the electroweak scale; if one of them has a keV-scale mass, it can be the dark-matter particle, and it can also explain the observed pulsar kicks. The relic sterile neutrinos could be produced by several different mechanisms. If they originate primarily from the Higgs decays at temperatures of the order of 100 GeV, the resulting dark matter is much ``colder'' than the warm dark matter produced in neutrino oscillations. The signature of this form of dark matter is the spectral line from the two-body decay, which can be detected by the X-ray telescopes. The same X-rays can have other observable manifestations, in particular, though their effects on the formation of the first stars.
