It has been suggested that our universe could be a 3-dimensional brane where the SM fields live embedded in a D-dimensional space-time. In flexible raneworlds, in addition to the SM fields, new degrees of freedom appear on the brane associated to brane fluctuations. These new fields, known as branons, are standard WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) and therefore natural dark matter candidates, whose spontaneous annihilations can provide first evidences for this scenario.
