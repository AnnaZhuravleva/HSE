This is the written account of the first of two panel discussions, on "Star formation in galaxies: how do we continue?" The chair of the panel was Phil James, and panel members were John Beckman, Torsten Boeker, Daniela Calzetti, Angeles Diaz, and Rob Kennicutt. The panel and audience discussed the four following questions: 1) What are the most critically needed techniques to give accurate measurements of total rates and efficiencies of star formation? 2) Do we understand the form of the initial mass function and its variation as a function of redshift and environment? 3) Are there multiple modes of star formation in galaxies (bulge vs. disk, burst vs. continuous) or does the Schmidt law explain everything? 4) How do we bring together our understanding of star formation in our Galaxy and in external systems?
