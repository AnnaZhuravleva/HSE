We describe the status of a project whose main goal is to detect variability along the extreme horizontal branch of the globular cluster NGC 6752. Based on Magellan 6.5m data, preliminary light curves are presented for some candidate variables. By combining our time-series data, we also produce a deep CMD of unprecedented quality for the cluster which reveals a remarkable lack of main sequence binaries, possibly pointing to a low primordial binary fraction.
