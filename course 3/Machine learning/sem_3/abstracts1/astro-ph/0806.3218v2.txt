We determine absolute dimensions and abundances for the three F-type main-sequence detached eclipsing binaries AD Boo, VZ Hya, and WZ Oph and perform a detailed comparison with results from recent stellar evolutionary models. uvby light curves and standard photometry were obtained at ESO,radial velocity observations at CfA facilities, and high-resolution spectra with ESO's FEROS spectrograph. State-of-the-art methods were applied for the analyses. Masses and radii that are precise to 0.5-0.7% and 0.4-0.9%, respectively, have been established for the components, which span the ranges of 1.1 to 1.4 M_sun and 1.1 to 1.6 R_sun. The [Fe/H] abundances are from -0.27 to +0.10, with uncertainties between 0.07 and 0.15 dex. We find indications of a slight alpha-element overabundance of [alpha/Fe] ~ +0.1$ for WZ Oph. The secondary component of AD Boo and both components of WZ Oph appear to be slightly active. Yale-Yonsai and Victoria-Regina evolutionary models fit the components of AD Boo and VZ Hya almost equally well, assuming coeval formation, at ages of about 1.75/1.50 Gyr (AD Boo) and 1.25/1.00 Gyr (VZ Hya). BaSTI models, however, predict somewhat different ages for the primary and secondary components. For WZ Oph, the models from all three grids are significantly hotter than observed. A low He content, decreased envelope convection coupled with surface activity, and/or higher interstellar absorption would remove the discrepancy, but its cause has not been definitively identified. We have demonstrated the power of testing and comparing recent stellar evolutionary models using eclipsing binaries, provided their abundances are known. The strongest limitations and challenges are set by T_eff and interstellar absorption determinations, and by their effects on and correlation with abundance results.
