In helioseismology, there is a well-known offset between observed and computed oscillation frequencies. This offset is known to arise from improper modeling of the near-surface layers of the Sun, and a similar effect must occur for models of other stars. Such an effect impedes progress in asteroseismology, which involves comparing observed oscillation frequencies with those calculated from theoretical models. Here, we use data for the Sun to derive an empirical correction for the near-surface offset, which we then apply three other stars (alpha Cen A, alpha Cen B and beta Hyi). The method appears to give good results, in particular providing an accurate estimate of the mean density of each star.
