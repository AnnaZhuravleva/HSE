The von Karman-Howarth equations are derived for three-dimensional (3D) Hall magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the case of an homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. From these equations, we derive exact scaling laws for the third-order correlation tensors. We show how these relations are compatible with previous heuristic and numerical results. These multi-scale laws provide a relevant tool to investigate the non-linear nature of the high frequency magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind or, more generally, in any plasma where the Hall effect is important.
