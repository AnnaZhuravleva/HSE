Simplified solutions to determine binary elements by astrometry were obtained in terms of elementary functions (Asada et al. 2004), and therefore require neither iterative nor numerical methods. In the framework of the simplified solution, this paper discusses the remaining two parameters of the time of periastron passage and the longitude of ascending node in order to complete the solution. We thus clarify a difference between the simplified solution and other analytical methods.
