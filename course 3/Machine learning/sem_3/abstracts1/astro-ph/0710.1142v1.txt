We present new millimetre 43 GHz observations of a sample of radio-bright Planetary Nebulae. Such observations were carried out to have a good determination of the high-frequency radio spectra of the sample in order to evaluate, together with far-IR measurements (IRAS), the fluxes emitted by the selected source in the millimetre and sub-millimetre band. This spectral range, even very important to constraint the physics of circumstellar environment, is still far to be completely exploited. To estimate the millimetre and sub-millimetre fluxes, we extrapolated and summed together the ionized gas (free-free radio emission) and dust (thermal emission) contributions at this frequency range. By comparison of the derived flux densities to the foreseen sensitivity we investigate the possible detection of such source for all the channels of the forthcoming ESA's PLANCK mission. We conclude that almost 80% of our sample will be detected by PLANCK, with the higher detection rate in the higher frequency channels, where there is a good combination of brighter intrinsic flux from the sources and reduced extended Galactic foregrounds contamination despite a worst instrumental sensitivity. From the new 43 GHz, combined with single-dish 5 GHz observations from the literature, we derive radio spectral indexes, which are consistent with optically thin free-free nebula. This result indicates that the high frequency radio spectrum of our sample sources is dominated by thermal free-free and other emission, if present, are negligible.
