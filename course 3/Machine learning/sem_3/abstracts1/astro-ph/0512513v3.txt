We propose to use a simple observable, the fractional area of "hot spots" in weak lensing mass maps which are detected with high significance, to determine background cosmological parameters. Because these high-shear regions are directly related to the physical non-linear structures of the universe, they derive cosmological information mainly from the non-linear regime of density fluctuations. We show that in combination with future cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, this method can place constraints on cosmological parameters that are comparable to those from the redshift distribution of galaxy cluster abundances. In particular, adding the information from this simple shear statistic derived from an LSST-like survey to CMB anisotropy information from a Planck-like experiment improves the constraints on the dark energy parameters (energy density and equation of state) and the normalization of the matter power spectrum by over a factor of ten. The main advantage of the statistic proposed in this paper is that projection effects, normally the main source of uncertainty when determining the presence and the mass of a galaxy cluster, here serve as a source of information.
