This article is a written and modified version of a talk presented at the conference `A Century of Cosmology' held at San Servolo, Venice, Italy, in August 2007. The talk focuses on some of the cosmology history leading to the discovery and exploitation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation anisotropies. We have made tremendous advances first in the development of the techniques to observe these anisotropies and in observing and interpreting them to extract their contained cosmological information. CMB anisotropies are now a cornerstone in our understanding of the cosmos and our future progress in the field. This is an outcome that Dennis Sciama hoped for and encouraged.
