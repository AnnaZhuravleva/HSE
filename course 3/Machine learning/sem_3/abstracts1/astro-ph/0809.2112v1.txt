We want to develop spectral diagnostics of stellar populations in the near-infrared (NIR), for unresolved stellar populations. We created a semi-empirical population model and we compare the model output with the observed spectra of a sample of elliptical and bulge-dominated galaxies that have reliable Lick-indices from literature to test if the correlation between Mg2 and CO 1.62 micron remains valid in galaxies and to calibrate it as an abundance indicator. We find that (i) there are no significant correlations between any NIR feature and the optical Mg2; (ii) the CaI, NaI and CO trace the alpha-enhancement; and (iii) the NIR absorption features are not influenced by the galaxy's age.
