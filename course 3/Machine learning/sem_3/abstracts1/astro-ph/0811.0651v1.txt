We studied the effects of rotation on standing accretion shock instability (SASI) by performing three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. Taking into account a realistic equation of state and neutrino heating/cooling, we prepared a spherically symmmetric and steady accretion flow through a standing shock wave onto a proto-neutron star (PNS). When the SASI entered the nonlinear phase, we imposed uniform rotation on the flow advecting from the outer boundary of the iron core, whose specific angular momentum was assumed to agree with recent stellar evolution models. Using spherical harmonics in space and Fourier decompositions in time, we performed mode analysis of the nonspherical deformed shock wave to observe rotational effects on the SASI in the nonlinear phase. We found that rotation imposed on the axisymmetric SASI did not make any spiral modes and hardly affected sloshing modes, except for steady l=2, m=0 modes. In contrast, rotation imposed on the non-axisymmetric flow increased the amplitude of spiral modes so that some spiral flows accreting on the PNS were more clearly formed inside the shock wave than without rotation. The amplitudes of spiral modes increased significantly with rotation in the progressive direction.
