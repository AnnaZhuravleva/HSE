We present $B$ and $V$ light curves of a large stellar flare obtained with the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton 2.5-m telescope (La Palma). The source object is a faint ($m_V=21.38$) foreground star in the field of the Andromeda galaxy, with its most probable spectral type being dM4. We provide an estimate of the total flare energy in the optical range and find it to be of the order of $10^{35}$ erg. The cooling phase of the large flare shows three additional weak flare-like events, which we interpret as results of a triggering mechanism also observed on the Sun during large coronal mass ejections.
