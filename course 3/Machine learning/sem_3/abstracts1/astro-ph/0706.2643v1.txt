More than two years of fluorescence detector data collected in coincidence with at least one station of the surface detector array (``hybrid data'') are used to measure the flux and energy spectrum of cosmic rays above about 10$^{18}$ eV. The hybrid measurement extends towards lower energies the spectrum measured with the surface detector data only, and provides a cross-check with an independent data set. The determination of the fluorescence detector aperture and of its live-time, which is the major aspect of this measurement, is illustrated in detail. Our current estimate of the corresponding systematic uncertainties are given.
