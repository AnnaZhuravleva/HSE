The two-component, core-crust, model of a neutron star with homogenous internal and dipolar external magnetic field is studied responding to quake-induced perturbation by substantially nodeless differentially rotational Alfv\'en oscillations of the perfectly conducting crustal matter about axis of fossil magnetic field frozen in the immobile core. The energy variational method of the magneto-solid-mechanical theory of a viscoelastic perfectly conducting medium pervaded by magnetic field is utilized to compute the frequency and lifetime of nodeless torsional vibrations of crustal solid-state plasma about the dipole magnetic-moment axis of the star. It is found that obtained two-parametric spectral formula for the frequency of this toroidal Alfven mode provides fairly accurate account of rapid oscillations of the X-ray flux during the flare of SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14, supporting the investigated conjecture that these quasi-periodic oscillations owe its origin to axisymmetric torsional oscillations predominately driven by Lorentz force of magnetic field stresses in the finite-depth crustal region of the above magnetars.
