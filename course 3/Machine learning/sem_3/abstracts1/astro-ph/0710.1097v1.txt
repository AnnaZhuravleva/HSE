We report extensive photometry of the dwarf nova V419 Lyr throughout its 2006 July superoutburst till quiescence. The superoutburst with amplitude of ~3.5 magnitude lasted at least 15 days and was characterized by the presence of clear superhumps with a mean period of Psh=0.089985(58) days (129.58+-0.08 min). According to the Stolz-Schoembs relation, this indicates that the orbital period of the binary should be around 0.086 days i.e. within the period gap. During the superoutburst the superhump period was decreasing with the rate of dotP/Psh=-24.8(2.2)*10^-5, which is one of the highest values ever observed in SU UMa systems. At the end of the plateau phase, the superhump period stabilized at a value of 0.08983(8) days. The superhump amplitude decreased from 0.3 mag at the beginning of the superoutburst to 0.1 mag at its end. In the case of V419 Lyr we have not observed clear secondary humps, which seems to be typical for long period systems.
