We discuss the autocorrelation function $/zeta (r)$ for the sample 1157 radio-identified galaxies . The sample of galaxies is based on the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS) and 1.4 Ghz NRA)-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog of the radio sources. For separation $2-15h^{-1}$ Mpc autocorrelation function $/zeta (r)$$\gamma (s)$ can be approximated by the power law with correlation length and slope $-\gamma (s)=-1.8$. There are no clearly differences for correlation length between AGN and SB galaxies while value $\gamma$ for both samples are different: $\gamma=2.4$ for AGN and $\gamma=1.7$ for SB.
