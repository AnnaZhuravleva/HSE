We study a possibility of detection of circumstellar absorption lines of Na I D$_{1,2}$ and Ca II H,K in spectra of type IIP supernovae at the photospheric epoch. The modelling shows that the circumstellar lines of Na I doublet will not be seen in type IIP supernovae for moderate wind density, e.g., characteristic of SN 1999em, whereas rather pronounced Ca II lines with P Cygni profile should be detectable. A similar model is used to describe Na I and Ca II circumstellar lines seen in SN 1998S, type IIL with a dense wind. We show that line intensities in this supernova are reproduced, if one assumes an ultraviolet excess, which is caused primarily by the comptonization of supernova radiation in the shock wave.
