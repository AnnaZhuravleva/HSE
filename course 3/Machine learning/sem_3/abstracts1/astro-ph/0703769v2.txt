We present a catalog of 110 variable stars within ~1' of Sgr A* based on image subtraction of near-infrared (H and K) photometry. Our images were obtained over 133 nights from 2000--2002 in H-band and over 134 nights from 2001--2002 in K-band; the typical FWHM is 1.4''. We match the catalog to other near-infrared, X-ray, and radio (i.e., maser) data, and we discuss some of the more interesting objects. The catalog includes 14 periodic sources, several known long-period variables and three new LPV candidates. We associate IRS 10* with OH, SiO, and H2O masers and a bright X-ray point source; this analysis suggests IRS 10* is an AGB star with an accreting companion. Among the approximately 90 newly discovered sources are a probable cataclysmic variable, a potential edge-on contact 84 day period eclipsing binary, and a possible 41 day period pulsating variable.
