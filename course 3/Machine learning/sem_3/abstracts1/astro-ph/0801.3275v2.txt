ZEBRA, the Zurich Extragalactic Bayesian Redshift Analyzer, is a tool for estimating redshifts and template types of galaxies using medium- and broad-band photometric data. ZEBRA employs novel techniques within the template-fitting approach to produce high-quality Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian redshift estimates.   This manuscript serves as a user guide to ZEBRA. It explains how to use ZEBRA, specifies input and output formats, and gives a short account of the available options. ZEBRA is a free and open-source software distributed under the GNU Public License 3 and available at http://www.exp-astro.phys.ethz.ch/ZEBRA .   Several upgrades are currently being implemented in ZEBRA. An updated documentation will be provided at each new release. Any problems, comments and suggestions on the code and the manual should be sent via e-mail to zebra@phys.ethz.ch.
