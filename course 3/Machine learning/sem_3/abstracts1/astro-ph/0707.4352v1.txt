GAW is a "path-finder" experiment to test the feasibility of a new generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes that join high flux sensitivity with large field of view capability using Fresnel lens, stereoscopic observational approach, and single photon counting mode. GAW is an array of three telescopes that will be erected at the Calar Alto Observatory site (Spain, 2150 m a.s.l.). To evaluate the performance of GAW, a consistent data--set has been simulated, including a Crab-like source observation, and a proper image analysis code has been developed, as described in this contribution. The expected performance of GAW are also reported, mainly for what concerns effective area, angular resolution, Cherenkov flux as function of the core distance, ability in the gamma/proton separation, and sensitivity. The first telescope realization, foreseen within the end of this year, will allow to verify if the parameters used in the analysis are in agreement with the "real" performance of the GAW apparatus.
