43024 objects, which were primarily identified as quasars in SDSS DR5 and have spectroscopic redshifts were used to study the luminosity dependence of the quasar clustering with the help of two different techniques. The obtained results reveal that brighter quasars are more clustered, but this dependence is weak, which is in agreement with the results by Porciani & Norberg, 2006 and theoretical predictions by Lidz et al., 2006.
