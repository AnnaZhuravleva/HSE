The spatial cross-correlation function xi_C recently introduced by Roukema et al. is applied to the equilateral toroidal topology of the universe. Several CMB maps based on the WMAP 5yr data are analysed and a small likelihood in favour of a torus cell is revealed. The results are compared to ten LCDM simulations which point to a high false positive rate of the spatial-correlation-function method such that a firm conclusion cannot be drawn.
