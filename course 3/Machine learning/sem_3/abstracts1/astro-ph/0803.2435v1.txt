We have investigated the structure, kinematics, and emission spectrum of the ionized gas in the synchrotron superbubble in the irregular galaxy IC 10 based on observations with the 6-m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope with the SCORPIO focal reducer in three modes: direct imaging in the [SII](6717+6731)A lines, long-slit spectroscopy, and spectroscopy with a scanning Fabry--Perot interferometer. We have identified a bright (in the [SII] lines) filamentary optical shell and determined its expansion velocity, mass, and kinetic energy. The nature of the object is discussed.
