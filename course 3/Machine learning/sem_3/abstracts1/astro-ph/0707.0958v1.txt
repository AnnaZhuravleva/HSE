We report here the discovery of two planet candidates as a result of our planet-search programme biased in favour of high-metallicity stars, using the ELODIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute Provence. One of them has a minimum mass m_2\sin{i} = 2.5 M_Jup and is orbiting the metal-rich star HD43691 with period P = 40 days and eccentricity e = 0.14. The other planet has a minimum mass m_2\sin{i} = 5.6 M_Jup and orbits the slightly metal-rich star HD132406 with period P = 974 days and eccentricity e = 0.34. Both stars were followed up with additional observations using the new SOPHIE spectrograph that replaces the ELODIE instrument, allowing an improved orbital solution for the systems.
