This study has three principal aims: (i) to increase the number of detected pulsation modes of 44 Tau, especially outside the previously known frequency ranges, (ii) to study the amplitude variability and its systematics, and (iii) to examine the combination frequencies.   During the 2004/5 and 2005/6 observing seasons, high-precision photometry was obtained with the Vienna Automatic Photoelectric Telescope in Arizona during 52 nights. Together with previous campaigns, a data base from 2000 to 2006 was available for multifrequency analyses.   Forty-nine pulsation frequencies are detected, of which 15 are independent pulsation modes and 34 combination frequencies or harmonics. The newly found gravity mode at 5.30 c/d extends the known frequency range of instability. Strong amplitude variability from year to year is found for the \ell = 1 modes, while the two radial modes have essentially constant amplitudes. Possible origins of the amplitude variability of the \ell = 1 modes, such as precession of the pulsation axis, beating and resonance effects are considered. The amplitudes of the combination frequencies, f_i + f_j, mirror the variations in the parent modes. The combination parameter, which relates the amplitudes of the combination frequencies to those of the parent modes, is found to be different for different parents.
