Non-monotonic features of rotation curves, and also the related gravitational effects typical of thin disks -- like backward-reaction or amplification of rotation by negative surface density gradients -- which are characteristic imprints of disk-like mass distributions, are discussed in the axisymmetric thin disk model. The influence of the data cutoff in rotational velocity measurements on the determination of the mass distribution in flattened galaxies is studied.   It has also been found that the baryonic matter distribution in the spiral galaxy NGC 5475, obtained in the axisymmetric thin disk approximation, accounts for the rotation curve of the galaxy. To obtain these results, the iteration method developed recently by the authors has been applied.
