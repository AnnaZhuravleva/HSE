The coming Planck and Herschel missions will survey the sky at unprecedented angular scales and sensitivities. Simulations are needed for better interpretating the results of the surveys and for testing new methods of, e.g., source extraction and component separation. We present new simulations of the infrared and submillimeter cosmic background, including the correlation between infrared galaxies. The simulations were used to quantify the source-detection thresholds for Herschel/SPIRE and Planck/HFI, as well as to study the detectability of the cosmic infrared background correlated fluctuations.   The simulations are based on an empirical model of IR galaxy evolution. For the correlations, we only included the linear clustering, assuming that infrared galaxies are biased tracers of the dark-matter fluctuation density field. We used the simulations with different bias parameters to predict the confusion noise for Herschel/SPIRE and Planck/HFI and the completeness levels. We also discuss the detectability of the linear clustering in Planck/HFI power spectra, including the foreground and backgrounds components.   Simulated maps and catalogs are publicly available online at http://www.ias.u-psud.fr/irgalaxies/simulations.php
