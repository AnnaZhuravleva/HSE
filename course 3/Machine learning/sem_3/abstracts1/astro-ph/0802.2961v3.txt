We find the nine bulk--flow and shear moments from the SFI++ survey, as well as for subsamples of group and field galaxies. We constrain the velocity power spectrum shape parameter $\Gamma$ in linear theory using these moments. A likelihood function for $\Gamma$ was found after marginalizing over the power spectrum amplitude $\sigma_8\Omega_m^{0.6}$ using constraints obtained from comparisons between redshift surveys and peculiar velocity data. We have estimated the velocity noise $\sigma_*$ from the data since without it our results may be biased. We also performed a statistical analysis of the difference between the field and group catalogues and found that the results from each reflect the same underlying large scale flows. We found that we can constrain the power spectrum shape parameter to be $\Gamma=0.15^{+0.18}_{-0.08}$ for the groups catalogue and $\Gamma=0.09^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ for the field galaxy catalogue in fair agreement with the value from WMAP.
