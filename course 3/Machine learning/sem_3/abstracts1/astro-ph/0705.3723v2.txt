Kinetic approaches provide an effective description of the process of particle acceleration at shock fronts and allow to take into account the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles as well as the amplification of the turbulent magnetic field as due to streaming instability. The latter does in turn affect the maximum achievable momentum and thereby the acceleration process itself, in a chain of causality which is typical of non-linear systems. Here we provide a technical description of two of these kinetic approaches and show that they basically lead to the same conclusions. In particular we discuss the effects of shock modification on the spectral shape of the accelerated particles, on the maximum momentum, on the thermodynamic properties of the background fluid and on the escaping and advected fluxes of accelerated particles.
