HESS J1745-303 is an extended, unidentified VHE (very high energy) gamma-ray source discovered using HESS in the Galactic Plane Survey. Since no obvious counterpart has previously been found in longer-wavelength data, the processes that power the VHE emission are not well understood. Combining the latest VHE data with recent XMM-Newton observations and a variety of source catalogs and lower-energy survey data, we attempt to match (from an energetic and positional standpoint) the various parts of the emission of HESS J1745-303 with possible candidates. Though no single counterpart is found to fully explain the VHE emission, we postulate that at least a fraction of the VHE source may be explained by a supernova-remnant/molecular-cloud association and/or a high-spin-down-flux pulsar.
