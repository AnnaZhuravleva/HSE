We study the limits of accuracy for weak lensing maps of dark matter using diffuse 21-cm radiation from the pre-reionization epoch using simulations. We improve on previous "optimal" quadratic lensing estimators by using shear and convergence instead of deflection angles. We find that non-Gaussianity provides a limit to the accuracy of weak lensing reconstruction, even if instrumental noise is reduced to zero. The best reconstruction result is equivalent to Gaussian sources with effectively independent cell of side length 2.0/h Mpc. Using a source full map from z=10-20, this limiting sensitivity allows mapping of dark matter at a Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) greater than 1 out to l < 6000, which is better than any other proposed technique for large area weak lensing mapping.
