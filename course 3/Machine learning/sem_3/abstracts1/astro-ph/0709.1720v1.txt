Galaxies in clusters are gas-deficient and a number of possible explanations for this observation have been advanced, including galaxy-cluster tidal interactions, galaxy harassment, and ISM-ICM gas stripping. In this paper, we use a cosmological simulation of cluster formation and evolution in order to examine this issue from a theoretical standpoint. We follow a large number of galaxies over time and track each galaxy's gas and stellar mass changes to discover what mechanism(s) dominate the evolution of the cluster galaxies. We find that while gas is lost due to a wide variety of mechanisms, the most common way is via a gas-only stripping event, and the amount of gas lost correlates with the ram-pressure the galaxy is experiencing. Although this gas-stripping occurs primarily in the central region (r < 1 Mpc), it is an important mechanism out to the virial radius of the cluster. This is due to the wide scatter in ram-pressure strength that a galaxy experiences at fixed radius. We find that the timescale for complete gas removal is > 1 Gyr. In addition, we find that galaxies in the field and in the cluster periphery (r > 2.4 Mpc) often accrete cool gas; the accretion stops between 1-2.4 Mpc, possibly indicating the onset of galaxy starvation.
