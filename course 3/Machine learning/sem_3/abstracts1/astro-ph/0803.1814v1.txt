This paper offers a new point of view on component separation, based on a model of additive components which enjoys a much greater flexibility than more traditional linear component models. This flexibility is needed to process the complex full-sky observations of the CMB expected from the Planck space mission, for which it was developed, but it may also be useful in any context where accurate component separation is needed.
