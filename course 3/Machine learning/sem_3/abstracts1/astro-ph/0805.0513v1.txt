Melott has made pioneering studies of the effects of particle discreteness in N-body simulations, a fundamental point that needs careful thought and analysis since all such simulations suffer from numerical noise arising from the use of finite-mass particles. Melott (arXiv:0804.0589) claims that the conclusions of our paper (arXiv:0804.0294) are essentially equivalent to those of his earlier work. Melott is wrong: he has jumped onto one of our conclusions and interpreted that in his own way. Here we point out the whys and the wherefores.
