We present results of submillimeter observations of a low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) condensation in the Cederblad 110 region of the Chamaeleon I dark cloud with Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment. Our HCO+(J=4-3) map reveals a dense molecular gas with an extent of ~ 0.1 pc, which is a complex of two envelopes associated with class I sources Ced110 IRS4 and IRS11 and a very young object Cha-MMS1. The other two class I sources in this region, IRS6 and NIR89, are located outside the clump and have no extended HCO+ emission. HCO+ abundance is calculated to be 2.6 x 10^{-10} for MMS1 and 3.4 x 10^{-9} for IRS4, which are comparable to the reported value for other young sources. Bipolar outflows from IRS4 and IRS6 are detected in our 12CO(J=3-2) map. The outflow from IRS4 seems to collide with Cha-MMS1. The outflow has enough momentum to affect gas motion in MMS1, although no sign has been detected to indicate that a triggered star formation has occurred.
