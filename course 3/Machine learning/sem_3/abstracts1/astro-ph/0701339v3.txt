We study one of the simplest covariant modified-gravity models based on the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane cosmology, a self-accelerating universe. In this model gravitational leakage into extra dimensions is responsible of late-time acceleration. We mainly focus on the effects of the model parameters on the geometry and the age of universe. Also we investigate the evolution of matter density perturbations in the modified gravity model, and obtain an analytical expression for the growth index, $f$. We show that increasing $\Omega_{r_c}$ leads to less growth of the density contrast $\delta$, and also decreases the growth index. We give a fitting formula for the growth index at the present time and indicate that dominant term in this expression verifies the well-known approximation relation $f\simeq \Omega_m^{\gamma}$. As the observational test, the new Supernova Type Ia (SNIa) Gold sample and Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data, size of baryonic acoustic peak from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the position of the acoustic peak from the CMB observations and the Cluster Baryon Gas Mass Fraction (gas) are used to constrain the parameters of the DGP model. We also combine previous results with large scale structure formation (LSS) from the 2dFGRS survey. Finally to check the consistency of the DGP model, we compare the age of old cosmological objects with age of universe in this model.
