World Space Observatory UltraViolet (WSO-UV) is a multipurpose space observatory, made by a 170 cm aperture telescope, capable of UV high-resolution spectroscopy, long slit low-resolution spectroscopy, and deep UV and optical imaging. With a nominal mission life time of 5 years, and a planned extension to 10 years, from a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of 51.8 degrees, WSO-UV will provide observations of exceptional importance for the study of many unsolved astrophysical problems. WSO-UV is implemented in the framework of a collaboration between Russia (chair), China, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Ukraine. This book illustrates the results of the feasibility study for the Field Camera Unit (FCU), a multi-spectral radial instrument on the focal plane of WSO-UV. The book provides an overview of the key science topics that are drivers to the participation of the Italian astronomical community in the WSO-UV project. The science drivers here illustrated have been used to define the technical requirements for the conceptual and architectural design of the Field Camera Unit (FCU) focal plane instrument. In Chapter I we show that WSO-UV will give a significant contribution to solve the key astronomical problems individuated by the ASTRONET consortium, and which are driving the European Space Agency Cosmic Vision program. Chapter II elucidates the scientific requirements for WSO-UV FCU instrument, discussed in Chapter I, which are translated in a list of verifiable top level requirements usable to make the conceptual design of the FCU instrument. Chapter III is dedicated to the Field Camera Unit opto-mechanical design, its detectors and electronics subsystems. Finally, Chapter IV outlines the AIV and GSE plans and activities for the FCU instrument.
