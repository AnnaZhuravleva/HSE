We have observed EY Draconis with the 24`` telescope of Konkoly Observatory in Budapest for 64 nights. In the first obse rving season the star produced a stable light curve for more than 60 rotation periods, however, the light curves observe d in the next season and the spot modelling show clear evidence of the evolution of the spotted stellar surface. The chan ges of the maximum brightness level suggests the existence of a longer period of about 300 days, which seems to be confir med by the ROTSE archival data.
