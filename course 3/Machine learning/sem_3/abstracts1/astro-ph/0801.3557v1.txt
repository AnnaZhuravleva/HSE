We present a catalogue of overdensities in the GOODS-South field. We find various high density peaks that are embedded in structures diffused on the entire field, up to z ~ 2.5. The slope of their colour-magnitude relation does not show significative evolution with z. We find evidence that galaxies forming these structures are more massive than galaxies located in low density regions. We also analyse the variation of galaxy properties with the associated environmental density and we find that the segregation of red galaxies with density is stronger at low redshift and at high luminosities while it gets much weaker for increasing z.
