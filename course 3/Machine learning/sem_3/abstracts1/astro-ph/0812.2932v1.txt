An interesting strategy for indirect detection of Dark Matter comes through the amounts of electrons and positrons usually emitted by DM pair annihilation. The e+e- gyrating in the galactic magnetic field then produce secondary synchrotron radiation. The radio emission from the galactic halo as well as from its expected substructures if compared with the measured diffuse radio background can provide constraints on the physics of WIMPs. In particular one gets the bound of <sigma_A*v> = 10^{-24} cm^3 s^{-1} for a DM mass m_chi = 100 GeV even though sensibly depending on the astrophysical uncertainties.
