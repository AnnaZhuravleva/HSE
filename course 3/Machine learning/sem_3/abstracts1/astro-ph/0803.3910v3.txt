We discuss the basic hydrodynamics that determines the density structure of the disks around hot stars. Observational evidence supports the idea that these disks are Keplerian (rotationally supported) gaseous disks. A popular scenario in the literature, which naturally leads to the formation of Keplerian disks, is the viscous decretion model. According to this scenario, the disks are hydrostatically supported in the vertical direction, while the radial structure is governed by the viscous transport. This suggests that the temperature is one primary factor that governs the disk density structure. In a previous study we demonstrated, using 3-D NLTE Monte Carlo simulations, that viscous keplerian disks can be highly non-isothermal. In this paper we build upon our previous work and solve the full problem of the steady-state non-isothermal viscous diffusion and vertical hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the self-consistent solution departs significantly from the analytic isothermal density, with potentially large effects on the emergent spectrum. This implies that non-isothermal disk models must be used for a detailed modeling of Be star disks.
