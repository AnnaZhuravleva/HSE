We present an analysis of the extreme obscuration variability observed during an XMM-Newton 5-days continuous monitoring of the AGN in NGC 1365. The source was in a reflection-dominated state in the first ~1.5 days, then a strong increase of the 7-10 keV emission was observed in ~10 hours, followed by a symmetric decrease. The spectral analysis of the different states clearly shows that this variation is due to an uncovering of the X-ray source. From this observation we estimate a size of the X-ray source D_S<10^13 cm, a distance of the obscuring clouds R~10^16 cm and a density n~10^11 cm^{-3}. These values suggest that the X-ray absorption/reflection originate from the broad line region clouds. This is also supported by the resolved width of the iron narrow Kalpha emission line, consistent with the width of the broad Hbeta line.
