Context: Magnetic fields are thought to be one of the possible mechanisms responsible for shaping the generally spherical outflow of evolved stars into often aspherical planetary nebulae. However, direct measurements of magnetic fields during the transition to the planetary nebula phase are rare.   Aims: The aim of this project is to expand the number of magnetic field measurements of stars in the (proto-)planetary nebula phase and find if the magnetic field strength is sufficient to affect the stellar outflow.   Methods: We used Very Long Baseline Array observations to measure the circular polarization due to the Zeeman splitting of 22 GHz water masers in the envelope of the proto-planetary nebula candidate star IRAS 19296+2227 and the planetary nebula K3-35.   Results: A strong magnetic field of B||=-135+-28 is detected in the water maser region of the proto-planetary nebula candidate IRAS 19296+2227. The water masers of K3-35 are too weak to detect circular polarization although we do present the measurements of weak linear polarization in those masers.   Conclusions: The field measured in the masers of IRAS 19296+2227 is dynamically important and, if it is representative of the large scale field, is an important factor in driving the stellar mass loss and shaping the stellar outflow.
