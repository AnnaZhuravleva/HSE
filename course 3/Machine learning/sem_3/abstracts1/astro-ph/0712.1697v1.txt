For the first time, the bolometric correction of $\alpha$ Cir was determined. Two values, both based on an estimation of the total integrated flux, were obtained. For that purpose spectroscopic and photometric data of $\alpha$ Cir available in the literature was used. The values derived were then used to place $\alpha$ Cir in the HR diagram.
