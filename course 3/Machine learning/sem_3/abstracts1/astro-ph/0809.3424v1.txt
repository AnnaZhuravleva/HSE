The super massive black hole candidate, Sagittarius A*, exhibits variability from radio to X-ray wavelengths on time scales that correspond to < 10 Schwarzschild radii. We survey the potential of millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect and constrain time variable structures that could give rise to such variations, focusing on a model in which an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretion disk. Non-imaging algorithms are developed that use interferometric closure quantities to test for periodicity, and applied to an ensemble of hot-spot models that sample a range of parameter space. We find that structural periodicity in a wide range of cases can be detected on most potential VLBI arrays using modern VLBI instrumentation. Future enhancements of mm/sub-mm VLBI arrays including phased array processors to aggregate VLBI station collecting area, increased bandwidth recording, and addition of new VLBI sites all significantly aid periodicity detection. The methods described herein can be applied to other models of Sagittarius A*, including jet outflows and Magneto-Hydrodynamic accretion simulations.
