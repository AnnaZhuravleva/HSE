Asteroseismology provides powerful means to probe stellar interiors. The oscillations frequencies are closely related to stellar interior properties via the density and sound speed profiles. Since these are tightly linked with the mass and evolutionary state, we can expect to determine the age and mass of a star from the comparison of its oscillation spectrum with predictions of stellar models. Such a comparison suffers both from the problems we face when modeling a particular star (as the uncertainties on global parameters and chemical composition) and from our misunderstanding of processes at work in stellar interiors (as the transport processes that may lead to core mixing and affect the model ages). For stars where observations have provided precise and numerous oscillation frequencies together with accurate global parameters and additional information (as the radius or the mass if the star is in a binary system, the interferometric radius or the mean density if the star is an exoplanet host), we can also expect to better constrain the physical description of the stellar structure and to get a more reliable age estimation. After a survey of stellar pulsations, we present some seismic diagnostics that can be used to infer the age of a star as well as their limitations. We then illustrate the ability of asteroseismology to scrutinize stellar interiors on the basis of a few exemples. In the years to come, extended very precise asteroseismic observations are expected, in photometry or in spectroscopy, from ground-based (HARPS, CORALIE, ELODIE, UVES, UCLES, SIAMOIS, SONG) or spatial devices (MOST, CoRoT, WIRE, Kepler, PLATO). This will considerably enlarge the sample of stars eligible to asteroseismic age determination and should allow to estimate the age of individual stars with a 10-20% accuracy.
