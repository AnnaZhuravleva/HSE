Under the assumption that LS 5039 is a system composed by a pulsar rotating around an O6.5V star in a $\sim 3.9$ day orbit, we present the results of a theoretical modeling of the high energy phenomenology observed by the High Energy Stereoscopy Array (H.E.S.S.). This model (including detailed account of the system geometry, Klein-Nishina inverse Compton, $\gamma$-$\gamma$ absorption, and cascading) is able to describe well the rich observed phenomenology found in the system at all timescales, both flux and spectrum-wise.
