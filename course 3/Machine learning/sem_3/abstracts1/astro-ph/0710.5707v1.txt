In February 1997, the Japanese radio astronomy satellite HALCA was launched to provide the space-bourne element for the VLBI Space Observatory Programme (VSOP) mission. Approximately twenty-five percent of the mission time was dedicated to the VSOP Survey of bright compact Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at 5 GHz. This paper, the fifth in the series, presents images and models for the remaining 140 sources not included in Paper III, which contained 102 sources. For most sources, the plots of the uv-coverage, the visibility amplitude versus uv-distance, and the high resolution image are presented. Model fit parameters to the major radio components are determined, and the brightness temperature of the core component for each source is calculated. The brightness temperature distributions for all of the sources in the VSOP AGN survey are discussed.
