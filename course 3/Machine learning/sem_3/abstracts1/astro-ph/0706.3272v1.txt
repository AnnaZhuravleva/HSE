The current generation of X-ray observatories like Chandra allows studies with very fine spatial details. It is now possible to resolve X-ray point sources projected into the cluster diffuse emission and exclude them from the analysis to estimate the ``correct'' X-ray observables. In order to verify the incidence of point sources on the cluster thermal emission and to evaluate the impact of their non-thermal emission on the determination of cluster properties, we used a sample of 18 high-z (0.25 < z < 1.01) clusters from the Chandra archive. We performed a detailed analysis of the cluster properties and compared the changes observed in the X-ray observables, like temperature and luminosity or their inter-relation, when one keeps the point sources in the analysis. The point sources projected into the cluster extended emission affect the estimates of cluster temperature or luminosity considerably (up to 13% and 17% respectively). These percentages become even larger for clusters with z > 0.7 where temperature and luminosity increase up to 24% and 22%, respectively. Thus the point sources should be removed to correctly estimate the cluster properties. However the inclusion of the point sources does not impact significantly the slope and normalization of the L-T relationship since for each cluster the correction to be applied to T and L produces a moderate shift in the L-T plane almost parallel to the best-fit of the ``correct'' L-T relation.
