With the advent of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes in late 1980's, ground-based observation of TeV gamma-rays came into reality after struggling trials by pioneers for twenty years, and the number of gamma-ray sources detected at TeV energies has increased to be over seventy now. In this review, recent findings from ground-based very-high-energy gamma-ray observations are summarized (as of 2008 March), and up-to-date problems in this research field are presented.
