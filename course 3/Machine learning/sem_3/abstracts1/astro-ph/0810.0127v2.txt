Cosmological limits on neutrino masses are softened, by more than a factor 2, if Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Dark Energy (DE) are coupled. In turn, a neutrino mass yielding $\Omega_\nu$ up to $\sim0.20$ allows coupling levels $\beta \simeq 0.15, $ or more, already easing the coincidence problem. The coupling, in fact, displaces both $P(k)$ and $C_l$ spectra in a fashion opposite to neutrino mass. Estimates are obtained through a Fisher--matrix technique.
