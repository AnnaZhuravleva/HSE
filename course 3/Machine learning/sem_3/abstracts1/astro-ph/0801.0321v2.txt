We present detailed radiative transfer spectral synthesis models for the Iron Low Ionization Broad Absorption Line (FeLoBAL) active galactic nuclei (AGN) FIRST J121442.3+280329 and ISO J005645.1-273816. Detailed NLTE spectral synthesis with a spherically symmetric outflow reproduces the observed spectra very well across a large wavelength range. While exact spherical symmetry is probably not required, our model fits are of high quality and thus very large covering fractions are strongly implied by our results. We constrain the kinetic energy and mass in the ejecta and discuss their implications on the accretion rate. Our results support the idea that FeLoBALs may be an evolutionary stage in the development of more ``ordinary'' QSOs.
