Angular power spectra are an important measure of the angular clustering of a given distribution. In Cosmology, they are applied to such vastly different observations as galaxy surveys that cover a fraction of the sky and the Cosmic Microwave Background that covers the entire sky, to obtain fundamental parameters that determine the structure and evolution of the universe. The calculation of an angular power spectrum, however, is complex and the optimization of these calculations is a necessary consideration for current and forthcoming observational surveys. In this work, we present preliminary results of implementing angular power spectrum estimation scheme on a high-performance reconfigurable computing platform.
