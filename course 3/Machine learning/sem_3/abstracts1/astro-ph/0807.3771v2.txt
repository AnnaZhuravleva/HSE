We show that the proper motion of the Becklin-Neugebauer (BN) object is consistent with its dynamical ejection from the theta^1 Ori C binary, contrary to recent claims by Gomez et al. Continued radio observations of BN and future precise astrometric observations of theta^1 Ori C with SIM and the Orion Nebula Cluster with GAIA can constrain the properties of this ejection event, with implications for theories of how the nearest example of massive star formation is proceeding.
