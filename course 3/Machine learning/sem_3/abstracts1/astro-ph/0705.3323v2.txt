We introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) distance measurements from galaxy samples covering different redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. BAO are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS and SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation at z=0.2. BAO in the clustering of the SDSS luminous red galaxies measure the distance--redshift relation at z=0.35. The observed scale of the BAO calculated from these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using estimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance measure D_V(z)=[(1+z)^2D_A^2cz/H(z)]^(1/3). Here D_A is the angular diameter distance, and H(z) is the Hubble parameter. This gives r_s/D_V(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/D_V(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors), with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizon scale at recombination. Matching the BAO to have the same measured scale at all redshifts then gives D_V(0.35)/D_V(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060. The recovered ratio is roughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift SNLS supernovae data for Lambda cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmological acceleration at low redshift. If we force the cosmological model to be flat with constant w, then we find Om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 after combining with the SNLS data, and including the WMAP measurement of the apparent acoustic horizon angle in the CMB.
