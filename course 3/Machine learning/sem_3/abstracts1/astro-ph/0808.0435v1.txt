The different methods of determination of black holes (BHs) masses are presented for three classes of BHs observed in the Universe: stellar mass BHs, intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs) and supermassive BHs (SBHs). The results of these determinations are briefly reviewed: stellar mass BHs are found in the range of about 3 to about 20 solar masses, IMBHs in the range of a few hundreds to a few tens of thousands solar masses (the determinations are much less precise for these objects) and SBHs in the range of about 3x10^5 to about 6x10^10 solar masses.
