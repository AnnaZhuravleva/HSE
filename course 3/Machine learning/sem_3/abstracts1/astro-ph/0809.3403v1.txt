Gravitational lensing of background compact objects like active galactic nuclei and quasars, by extended intermediate mass lenses such as globular clusters and and dark matter clumps with masses 10^5 - 10^8 M_sun, is considered. It is shown that observational study of the galaxy-quasar's associations is a powerful direct observational test of the nature of massive galaxy haloes. Optical interferometric observations with VLTI and Keck instruments are able to constrain masses and number of substructure halo objects. Evidence of gravitational lensing by globular clusters in haloes of spiral and elliptical galaxies is presented.
