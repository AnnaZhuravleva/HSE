An attempt is made to explain the spiral structure of spiral galaxies through a possible rotation of the Universe. To this end, we write down a possible form of the metric, and we calculate the necessary quantities (Rik, Tik, ...) in order to form the Einstein equations. We find the two Einstein equations pertaining to the Robertson-Walker metric and no rotation at all in this way, if we assume p+e not= 0. There are introduced then two suitable rotational motions in the universe, and we try to generalize again the Robertson-Walker metric in this way. The result is again null, since it is found that the corresponding angular velocities must vanish, for p+e not= 0. A third attempt is finally done, without restricting ourselves to generalize any existing cosmological model. We introduce again two suitable rotational motions, and we form the appropriate Einstein equations. After solving them, we find that the two rotations, corresponding to the usual rotations on a torus, dictate again the equation of state p+e = 0. This solution is a steady state one, and it describes naturally the observationally discovered acceleration of the Universe (1998), without a cosmological constant and the ambiguous dark energy.
