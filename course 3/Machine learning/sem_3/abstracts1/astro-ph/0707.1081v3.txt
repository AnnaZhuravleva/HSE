The simplistic model of the classical spacetime foam is considered, which consists of static wormholes embedded in Minkowski spacetime. We explicitly demonstrate that such a foam structure leads to a topological bias of point-like sources which can equally be interpreted as the presence of a dark halo around any point source. It is shown that a non-trivial halo appears on scales where the topological structure possesses a local inhomogeneity, while the homogeneous structure reduces to a constant renormalization of the intensity of sources. We also show that in general dark halos possess both (positive and negative) signs depending on scales and specific properties of topological structure of space.
