In this talk we introduce our recent results of global 1D MHD simulations for the acceleration of solar and stellar winds. We impose transverse photospheric motions corresponding to the granulations, which generate outgoing Alfven waves. The Alfven waves effectively dissipate by 3-wave coupling and direct mode conversion to compressive waves in density-stratified atmosphere. We show that the coronal heating and the solar wind acceleration in the open magnetic field regions are natural consequence of the footpoint fluctuations of the magnetic fields at the surface (photosphere). We also discuss winds from red giant stars driven by \Alfven waves, focusing on different aspects from the solar wind. We show that red giants wind are highly structured with intermittent magnetized hot bubbles embedded in cool chromospheric material.
