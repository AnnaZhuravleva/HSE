We present the first attempt to analytically study the nonlinear matter power spectrum for a mixed dark matter (cold dark matter plus neutrinos of total mass ~0.1eV) model based on cosmological perturbation theory. The suppression in the power spectrum amplitudes due to massive neutrinos is, compared to the linear regime, enhanced in the weakly nonlinear regime where standard linear theory ceases to be accurate. We demonstrate that, thanks to this enhanced effect and the gain in the range of wavenumbers to which the PT prediction is applicable, the use of such a nonlinear model may enable a precision of sigma(m_nu,tot) ~ 0.07eV in constraining the total neutrino mass for the planned galaxy redshift survey, a factor of 2 improvement compared to the linear regime.
