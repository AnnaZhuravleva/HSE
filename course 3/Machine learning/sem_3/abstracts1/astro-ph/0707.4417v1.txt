The High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment (HiRes) measures cosmic rays (CR) at the highest energies using the air fluorescence technique. As data taking on the Dugway Proving Grounds in Western Utah is finished, the HiRes data are relevant for cosmogenic neutrinos in two different ways. We first use our best fit to the measured HiRes CR spectrum together with a model of the extragalactic CR sources to derive the expected cosmogenic neutrino and gamma ray fluxes at Earth. We then use the HiRes data directly to set competitive experimental limits on the electron and tau neutrino fluxes at the highest energies.
