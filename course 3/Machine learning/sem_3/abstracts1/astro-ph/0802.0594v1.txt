Context: The detection of narrow SiO lines toward the young shocks of the L1448-mm outflow has been interpreted as a signature of the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. In contrast with the low SiO abundances (<10E-12) in the ambient gas, the narrow SiO emission at almost ambient velocities reveals enhanced SiO abundances of 10E-11. This enhancement has been proposed to be produced by the sputtering of the grain mantles at the first stages of C-shocks. However, modelling of the sputtering of grains has usually averaged the SiO abundances over the dissipation region of C-shocks, which cannot explain the recent observations. Aims: To model the evolution of the gas phase abundances of SiO, CH3OH and H2O, produced by the sputtering of grains as the shock propagates through the ambient gas. Methods: We propose a parametric model to describe the physical structure of C-shocks as a function of time. Using the known sputtering yields for water mantles (with minor constituents like silicon and CH3OH) and olivine cores by collisions with H2, He, C, O, Si, Fe and CO, we follow the evolution of the abundances of silicon, CH3OH and H2O ejected from grains. Results: The evolution of these abundances shows that CO seems to be the most efficient sputtering agent in low velocity shocks. The velocity threshold for the sputtering of silicon from the grain mantles is reduced by 5-10 km s-1 by CO compared to other models. The sputtering by CO can generate SiO abundances of 10E-11 at the early stages of low velocity shocks, consistent with those observed in the magnetic precursor of L1448-mm. Our model also satisfactorily reproduce the progressive enhancement of SiO, CH3OH and H2O observed in this outflow by the coexistence of two shocks with vs=30 and 60kms-1 within the same region.
