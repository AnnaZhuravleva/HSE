Central Compact Objects (CCOs) are a handful of soft X-ray sources located close to the centers of Supernova Remnants and supposed to be young, radio-quiet Isolated Neutron Stars (INSs). A clear understanding of their physics would be crucial in order to complete our view of the birth properties of INSs. We will review the phenomenologies of CCOs, underlining the most important, recent results, and we will discuss the possible relationships of such sources with other classes of INSs.
