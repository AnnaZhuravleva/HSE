We report the results of speckle-interferometric observations of 109 high proper-motion metal-poor stars made with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We resolve eight objects -- G102-20, G191-55, BD+19$^\circ$~1185A, G89-14, G87-45, G87-47, G111-38, and G114-25 -- into individual components and we are the first to astrometrically resolve seven of these stars. New resolved systems included two triple (G111-38, G87-47) and one quadruple (G89-14) star. The ratio of single-to-binary-to-triple-to-quadruple systems among the stars of our sample is equal to 71:28:6:1.
