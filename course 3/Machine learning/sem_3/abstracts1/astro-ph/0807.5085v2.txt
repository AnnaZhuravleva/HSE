Recently measured VHE gamma ray spectra from supernovae remnants (SNRs) are best fit by power laws with an exponential cutoff. But this feature does not occur at the `knee-equivalent' energy at which VHE gamma ray spectra are expected to reflect the `knee' in the otherwise featureless cosmic ray spectrum. In this article, the VHE gamma ray feature is explained as a consequence of a recently deduced quantum effect. The effect distinguishes `trajectory energy' from `particle state energy' and requires that the particle state energy depends strongly on gravitational potential at very high energies. Based on this effect and the observed CR spectrum, a tight two-parameter fit is obtained to the combined VHE gamma ray spectra of SNRs RX J1713.7-3946 and RX J0852.0-4622 and the Galactic Center ridge.
