We investigate the damping of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) signature in the matter power spectrum due to the quasi-nonlinear clustering of density perturbations. On the basis of the third order perturbation theory, we construct a fitting formula of the damping in an analytic way. This demonstrates that the damping is closely related with the growth factor and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum. Then, we investigate the feasibility of constraining the growth factor through a measurement of the damping of the BAO signature. An extension of our formula including higher order corrections of density perturbations is also discussed.
