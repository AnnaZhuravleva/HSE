We use the Millennium Simulation to measure the cross-correlation between halo centres and mass (or equivalently the average density profiles of dark haloes) in a LCDM cosmology. We present results for radii in the range 10 kpc/h < r < 30 Mpc/h for halo masses in the range 4e10 Msol/h < M200 < 4e14 Msol/h. Both at z=0 and at z=0.76 these cross-correlations are surprisingly well fit by approximating the inner region by a density profile of NFW or Einasto form, the outer region by a biased version of the linear mass autocorrelation function, and by adopting the maximum of the two where they are comparable. We use a simulation of the formation of galaxies within the Millennium Simulation to explore how these results are reflected in cross-correlations between galaxies and mass. These are directly observable through galaxy-galaxy lensing. Here also we find that simple models can represent the simulation results remarkably well, typically to < 10%. Such models can be used to extend our results to other redshifts, to cosmologies with other parameters, and to other assumptions about how galaxies populate dark haloes. The characteristic features predicted in the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal should provide a strong test of the LCDM cosmology as well as a route to understanding how galaxies form within it.
