Recent observations have revealed the existence of enormously energetic ~10^61 erg AGN outbursts in three relatively distant galaxy clusters. These outbursts have produced bubbles in the intra-cluster medium, apparently supported by pressure from relativistic particles and/or magnetic fields. Here we argue that if > GeV particles are responsible then these particles are very likely protons and nuclei, rather than electrons, and that the gamma-ray emission from these objects, arising from the interactions of these hadrons in the intra-cluster medium, may be marginally detectable with instruments such as GLAST and HESS.
