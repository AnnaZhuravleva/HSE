We reconstruct the interaction rate of the holographic dark energy model recently proposed by Zimdahl and Pav\'{o}n \cite{wd} in the redshift interval $0 < z < 1.8$ with observational data from supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, and the growth factor. It shows a reasonable behavior in the sense that it increases with expansion from a small or vanishing value in the long past but starts decreasing at recent times. The later feature suggests that the equation of state parameter of dark energy does not cross the phantom divide.
