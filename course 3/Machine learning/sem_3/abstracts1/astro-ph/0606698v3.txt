The luminosity distance - redshift relation is analytically given for generalized Randall-Sundrum type II brane-world models containing dark radiation. The derived expressions contain both elementary functions and elliptic integrals of the first and second kind. First we derive the relation for models with the Randall-Sundrum fine-tuning. Then we generalize the method for models with cosmological constant. The analytical results are suitable for testing brane-world models when future supernova data at higher redshifts will be available.
