Broad-band photometric and moderate-resolution spectroscopic observations of the young eruptive star V1647 Ori, obtained between 28 August and 1 September 2008, are presented. The observed magnitudes and emission line equivalent widths of the star indicate that the initial conditions of the new outburst are very similar to those of the previous one in 2004.
