The energy spectrum of nuclear recoils in Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) direct detection experiments depends on the underlying WIMP mass (strongly for light WIMPs, weakly for heavy WIMPs). We discuss how the accuracy with which the WIMP mass could be determined by a single direct detection experiment depends on the detector configuration and the WIMP properties. In particular we examine the effects of varying the underlying WIMP mass, the detector target nucleus, exposure, energy threshold and maximum energy, the local velocity distribution and the background event rate and spectrum.
