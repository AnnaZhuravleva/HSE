In this paper we study a stellar dynamic model for the stars' rotational-dynamics, with a distribution of its own mass, rotating around its center with a higher density like spiral galaxies happen, by means of a classical calculus of the rotation velocities of a particle around its rotation axis, inside a smoothed distribution of matter. The stars are supposed to be particles and their distribution in the galaxy is modelled as a matter distribution inversely proportional to its distance from its centre.. Two kinds of matter distribution are supposed: one with constant density, and other with radial distribution. Two types of galaxy symmetry are also considered: spherical and oblate ellipsoidal. Using only classical mechanics arguments it is shown that the calculated velocity distribution inside the galaxy is similar to that obtained from astronomical observations, without the necessity of suppose the existence of dark matter or other phenomena.
