Today, the generation of magnetic fields in solar-type stars and its relation to activity and rotation can coherently be explained, although it is certainly not understood in its entirety. Rotation facilitates the generation of magnetic flux that couples to the stellar wind, slowing down the star. There are still many open questions, particularly at early phases (young age), and at very low mass. It is vexing that rotational braking becomes inefficient at the threshold to fully convective interiors, although no threshold in magnetic activity is seen, and the generation of large scale magnetic fields is still possible for fully convective stars. This article briefly outlines our current understanding of the rotation-magnetic field relation.
