Since its original formulation the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect has been recognized as a ``powerful laboratory'' for our comprehension of physical processes in cosmic structures and to derive crucial information on some general properties of the universe. After a discussion of the fundamental concepts and of some well established applications of the SZ effect towards galaxy clusters, I will focus on dedicated themes related to the SZ effect and other features in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) of particular interest in the view of the extremely high angular resolution observations achievable in the future with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). SKA will allow the mapping of the thermal and density structure of clusters of galaxies at radio and centimetre bands with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity and with an extremely accurate control of extragalactic radio source contamination. The signatures from SZ effects and free-free emission at galactic scales and in the intergalactic medium probe the structure evolution at various cosmic times. The detection of these sources and their imaging at the high resolution and sensitivity achievable with SKA will greatly contribute to the comprehension of crucial cosmological and astrophysical aspects, as the physical conditions of early ionized halos, quasars and proto-galactic gas. The spectacular improvement in our understanding of the properties of extragalactic radio sources at very faint fluxes achievable with SKA will allow to accurately model their contribution to the diffuse radio background, greatly contributing to the interpretation of next generation of CMB spectrum experiments devoted to probe the thermal plasma history at early times.
