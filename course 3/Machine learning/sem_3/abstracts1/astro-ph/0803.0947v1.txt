Abundances of 18 chemical elements have been derived for 27 A/Am and 16 F stars members of the Pleiades and Coma Berenices open clusters. We have specifically computed, with the Montr\'eal code, a series of evolutionary models for two A stars members of these two clusters. None of the models reproduces entirely the overall shape of the abundances patterns. The inclusion of competing processes such as rotational mixing in the radiative zones of these stars seems necessary to improve the agreement between observed and predicted abundances patterns.
