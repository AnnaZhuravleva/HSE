The Flamingos-2 Tandem Tunable filter is a tunable, narrow-band filter, consisting of two Fabry-Perot etalons in series, capable of scanning to any wavelength from 0.95 to 1.35 microns with a spectral resolution of R~800. It is an accessory mode instrument for the near-IR Flamingos-2 imaging-spectrograph designed for the Gemini South 8m Observatory and will be fed through the upcoming Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics feed. The primary science goal of the F2T2 filter is to perform a ground-based search for the first star forming regions in the universe at redshifts of 7 < z < 11. The construction of the F2T2 filter is complete and it is currently in its calibration and commissioning phases. In this proceeding, we describe the calibration and performance of the instrument.
