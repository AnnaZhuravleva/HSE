The study of extragalactic sources of high energy radiation via the direct measurement of the proton and neutrino fluxes that they are likely to emit is one of the main goals for the future observations of the recently developed air showers detectors and neutrino telescopes. In this work we discuss the relation between the inclusive proton and neutrino signals from the ensemble of all sources in the universe, and the resolved signals from the closest and brightest objects. We also compare the sensitivities of proton and neutrino telescopes and comment on the relation between these two new astronomies.
