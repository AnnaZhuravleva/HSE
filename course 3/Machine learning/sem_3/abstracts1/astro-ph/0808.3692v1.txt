Recent analyses of the WMAP 5-year data constrain possible non-adiabatic contributions to the initial conditions of CMB anisotropies. Depending upon the early dynamics of the plasma, the amplitude of the entropic modes can experience a different suppression by the time of photon decoupling. Explicit examples of the latter observation are presented both analytically and numerically when the post-inflationary dynamics is dominated by a stiff contribution.
