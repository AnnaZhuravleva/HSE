The effects of temperature on strange stars are studied and it is found that the maximum mass of the star decreases with the increase of temperature since at high temperatures the equations of state become softer. Moreover, if the temperature of a strange star increases, keeping its baryon number fixed, its gravitational mass increases and radius decreases. This leads to a limiting temperature where it turns into a black hole. These features are due to a combined effect of the change of gluon mass and the quark distribution with temperature. We report a new kind of radial oscillations of strange stars driven by what we call chromo-thermal instability. We also discuss the relevance of our findings in the astrophysics of core collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts.
