Since most high- and intermediate-mass protostars are at great distance and form in clusters, high linear resolution observations are needed to investigate their physical properties. To study the gas in the innermost region around the protostars in the proto-cluster IRAS 05358+3543, we observed the source in several transitions of methanol and other molecular species with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer and the Submillimeter Array, reaching a linear resolution of 1100 AU. We determine the kinetic temperature of the gas around the protostars through an LVG and LTE analysis of their molecular emission; the column densities of CH3OH, CH3CN and SO2 are also derived. Constrains on the density of the gas are estimated for two of the protostellar cores. We find that the dust condensations are in various evolutionary stages. The powerhouse of the cluster, mm1a, harbours a hot core with T~220 (75<T<330) K. A double-peaked profile is detected in several transitions toward mm1a, and we found a velocity gradient along a linear structure which could be perpendicular to one of the outflows from the vicinity of mm1a. Since the size of the double-peaked emission is less than 1100 AU, we suggest that mm1a might host a massive circumstellar disk. The other sources are in earlier stages of star formation. The least active source, mm3, could be a starless massive core, since it is cold (T<20 K), with a large reservoir of accreting material (M ~ 19 M_\odot), but no molecular emission peaks on it.
