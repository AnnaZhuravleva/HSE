We investigate the crystallization rate of a one-component plasma (OCP) in the context of classical nucleation theory. From our derivation of the free energy of an arbitrary distribution of solid clusters embedded in a liquid phase, we derive the steady-state nucleation rate of an OCP as a function of the Coulomb coupling parameter. Our result for the rate is in accord with recent molecular dynamics simulations, but it is greater than that of previous analytical estimates by many orders of magnitude. Further molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleation rate of a supercooled liquid OCP for several values of the coupling parameter would clarify the physics of this process.
