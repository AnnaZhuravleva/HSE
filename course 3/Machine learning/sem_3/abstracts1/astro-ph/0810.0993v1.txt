International Astronomical Union (IAU) has passed the must needed definition of planet in its general assembly held in Prague during August 2006. The definition had to be passed by means of voting. A group of scientists who raised the banner of revolt against the IAU definition has pointed out that the IAU has failed to give an acceptable definition regarding a planet. A brief description of the serious objections found in the definition of planet has been discussed here. In this paper an attempt has also been made to give a new definition of a planet by introducing some modifications to the IAU definition.
