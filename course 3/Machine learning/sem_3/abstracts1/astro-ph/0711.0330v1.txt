The least-squares (or Lomb-Scargle) periodogram is a powerful tool which is used routinely in many branches of astronomy to search for periodicities in observational data. The problem of assessing statistical significance of candidate periodicities for different periodograms is considered. Based on results in extreme value theory, improved analytic estimations of false alarm probabilities are given. They include an upper limit to the false alarm probability (or a lower limit to the significance). These estimations are tested numerically in order to establish regions of their practical applicability.
