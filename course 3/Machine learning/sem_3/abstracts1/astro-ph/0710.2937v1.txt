We report null results on a two year photometric search for outburst predictors in SS Cyg. Observations in Johnson V and Cousins I were obtained almost daily for multiple hours per night for two observing seasons. The accumulated data are put through various statistical and visual analysis techniques but fails to detect any outburst predictors. However, analysis of 102 years of AAVSO archival visual data led to the detection of a correlation between a long term quasi-periodic feature at around 1,000-2,000 days in length and an increase in outburst rate.
