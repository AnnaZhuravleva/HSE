An oscillating Universe which arises from the linearized R^{2} theory of gravity is discussed, showing that some observative evidences like the cosmological redshift and the Hubble law are in agreement with the model. In this context Dark Energy is seen like a pure curvature effect arising by the Ricci scalar.
