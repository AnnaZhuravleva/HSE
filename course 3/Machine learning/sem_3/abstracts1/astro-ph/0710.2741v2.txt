We study the cosmological evolution of an induced gravity model with a self-interacting scalar field $\sigma$ and in the presence of matter and radiation. Such model leads to Einstein Gravity plus a cosmological constant as a stable attractor among homogeneous cosmologies and is therefore a viable dark-energy (DE) model for a wide range of scalar field initial conditions and values for its positive $\gamma$ coupling to the Ricci curvature $\gamma \sigma^{2}R$.
