We present experimental results obtained from photoionization and photodissociation processes of abundant interstellar methanol (CH$_3$OH) as an alternative route for the production of H$_3^+$ in dense clouds. The measurements were taken at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) employing soft X-ray and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Mass spectra were obtained using the photoelectron-photoion coincidence techniques. Absolute averaged cross sections for the production of H$_3^+$ due to molecular dissociation of methanol by soft X-rays (C1s edge) were determined. The H$_3^+$'s photoproduction rate and column density were been estimated adopting a typical soft X-ray luminosity inside dense molecular and the observed column density of methanol. Assuming a steady state scenario, the highest column density value for the photoproduced H$_3^+$ was about 10$^{11}$ cm$^2$, which gives the ratio photoproduced/observed of about 0.05%, as in the case of dense molecular cloud AFGL 2591. Despite the small value, this represent a new and alternative source of H$_3^+$ into dense molecular clouds and it is not been considered as yet in interstellar chemistry models.
