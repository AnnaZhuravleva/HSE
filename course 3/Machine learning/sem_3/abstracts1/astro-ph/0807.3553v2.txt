Various radio observations have showed that the hot atmospheres of galaxy clusters are magnetized. However, our understanding of the origin of these magnetic fields, their implications on structure formation and their interplay with the dynamics of the cluster atmosphere, especially in the centers of galaxy clusters is still very limited. In preparation to the upcoming new generation of radio telescopes (like EVLA, LWA, LOFAR and SKA), a huge effort is being made to learn more about cosmological magnetic fields from the observational perspective. Here we present the implementation of magneto hydrodynamics in the cosmological SPH code GADGET. We discuss the details of the implementation and various schemes to suppress numerical instabilities as well as regularization schemes, in the context of cosmological simulations. The performance of the SPH MHD code is demonstrated in various one and two dimensional test problems, which we performed if a fully, three dimensional setup to test the code under realistic circumstances. Comparing with solutions obtained with ATHENA, we find excellent agreement with our SPH MHD implementation. Finally we apply our SPH MHD implementation to forming galaxy clusters within a large, cosmological box. Performing a resolution study we demonstrate the robustness of the predicted shape of the magnetic field profiles in galaxy clusters, which is in good agreement with previous studies.
