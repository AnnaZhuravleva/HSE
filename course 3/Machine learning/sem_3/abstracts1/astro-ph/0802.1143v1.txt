There is not as yet full agreement on the mechanism that causes the rapid damping of the oscillations observed by TRACE in coronal loops. It has been suggested that the variation of the observed values of the damping time as function of the corresponding observed values of the period contains information on the possible damping mechanism. The aim of this Letter is to show that, for resonant absorption, this is definitely not the case unless detailed a priori information on the individual loops is available.
