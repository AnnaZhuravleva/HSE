We have performed smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to study the response of the central kiloparsec region of a gaseous disk to the imposition of nonaxisymmetric bar potentials. The model galaxies are composed of the three axisymmetric components (halo, disk, and bulge) and a non-axisymmetric bar. These components are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame corotating with the bar. The potential of spherical $\gamma$-models of Dehnen is adopted for the bulge component whose density varies as $r^{-\gamma}$ near the center and $r^{-4}$ at larger radiiand hence, possesses a central density core for $\gamma = 0$ and cusps for $\gamma > 0$. Since the central mass concentration of the model galaxies increases with the cusp parameter $\gamma$, we have examined here the effect of the central mass concentration by varying the cusp parameter $\gamma$ on the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies. Our simulations show that the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic spiral shocks driven by the gravitational torque of the bar for the models with $\gamma = 0$ and 0.5. On the other hand, the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in the models with $\gamma=1$ and 1.5 are explained by gas density waves. Thus, we conclude that the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two-armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies changes from the hydrodynamic shocks to the gas density waves when the central mass concentration increases from $\gamma = 0$ to 1.5.
