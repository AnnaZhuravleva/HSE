We present the first results of a study where we determine the metallicity distribution function in the Galactic disks as a function of height above the Galactic plane. Observations in the Stromgren photometric system enables us to identify the dwarf stars and derive metallicities for them. The resulting metallicity distribution functions at 0.5 and 2.0 kpc above the Galactic plane are significantly broader and more metal-rich than is anticipated from standard models such as the Besancon model. Our results can be explained by invoking a smaller scale height and larger local normalisation for the thick disk than is commonly used in the models. These results are compatible with recent determinations of the thick disk scale height based e.g. on SDSS data.   The age of the stellar populations as a function of height above the Galactic plane is also investigated by studying the turn-off colour and metallicity. We tentatively find that at 2.0 kpc above the Galactic plane there exist an intermediate age population.
