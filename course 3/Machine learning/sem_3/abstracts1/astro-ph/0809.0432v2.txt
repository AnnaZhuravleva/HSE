Radiation from accretion discs in cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) provides fundamental information about the properties of these close binary systems and about the physics of accretion in general. The detailed diagnostics of accretion disc structure can be achieved by including in its description all the relevant heating and cooling physical mechanism, in particular the convective energy transport that, although dominant at temperatures less than about 10 000 K, is usually not taken into account when calculating spectra of accretion discs. We constructed a radiative transfer code coupled with a code determining the disc's hydrostatic vertical structure. We have obtained for the first time model spectra of cold, convective accretion discs. As expected, these spectra are mostly flat in the optical wavelengths with no contribution from the UV, which in quiescence must be emitted by the white dwarf. The disc structures obtained with our radiative-transfer code compare well with the solutions of equations used to describe the dwarf-nova outburst cycle according to the thermal-viscous disc instability model thus allowing the two to be combined. Our code allows calculating the spectral evolution of dwarf nova stars through their whole outburst cycle, providing a new tool for testing models of accretion discs in cataclysmic variables. We show that convection plays an important role in determining the vertical disc structure and substantially affects emitted spectra when, as often the case, it is effective at optical depths tau ~ 1. The emergent spectrum is independent of the parameters of the convection model.(Abstract shortened)
