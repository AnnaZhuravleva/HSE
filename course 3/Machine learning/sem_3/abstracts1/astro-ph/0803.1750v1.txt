In 2005 March 22nd, the INTEGRAL satellite caught a type-I X-ray burst from the unidentified source XMMU J174716.1-281048, serendipitously discovered with XMM-Newton in 2003. Based on the type-I X-ray burst properties, we derived the distance of the object and suggested that the system is undergoing a prolonged accretion episode of many years. We present new data from a Swift/XRT campaign which strengthen this suggestion. AX J1754.2-2754 was an unclassified source reported in the ASCA catalogue of the Galactic Centre survey. INTEGRAL observed a type-I burst from it in 2005, April 16th. Recently, a Swift ToO allowed us to refine the source position and establish its persistent nature.
