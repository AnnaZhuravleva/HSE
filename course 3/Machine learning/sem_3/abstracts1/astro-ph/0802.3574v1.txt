We present new VLBI observations of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in eight nearby Abell clusters. These data show a possible difference between Brightest Cluster Galaxies in cool core clusters (two-sided pc scale jets) and in non cool core clusters (one-sided pc scale jets). We suggest that this difference could be due to the jet interaction with the surrounding medium. More data are necessary to discuss if pc-scale properties of Brightest Cluster Galaxies are influenced by their peculiar morphology and position in the center of rich clusters of galaxies.
