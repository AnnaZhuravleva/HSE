We have carried out a detailed analysis of the NANTEN 12CO(J=1-0) dataset in two large areas of ~25 square degrees towards SS433 (l~40 degree) and of ~18 square degrees towards l~348.5 degree, respectively. We have discovered two groups of remarkably aligned molecular clouds at |b|~1--5 degree in the two regions. In SS433, we have detected 10 clouds in total, which are well aligned nearly along the axis of the X-ray jet emanating from SS433. These clouds have similar line-of-sight velocities of 42--56 km s^-1 and the total projected length of the feature is ~300 pc, three times larger than that of the X-ray jet, at a distance of 3 kpc. Towards l~348.5 degree, we have detected four clouds named as MJG348.5 at line-of-sight velocities of -80 -- -95 km s^-1 in V_LSR, which also show alignment nearly perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The total length of the feature is ~400 pc at a kinematic distance of 6 kpc. In the both cases, the CO clouds are distributed at high galactic latitudes where such clouds are very rare. In addition, their alignments and coincidence in velocity should be even rarer, suggesting that they are physically associated. We tested a few possibilities to explain these clouds, including protostellar outflows, supershells, and interactions with energetic jets. Among them, a favorable scenario is that the interaction between relativistic jet and the interstellar medium induced the formation of molecular clouds over the last ~10^5-6 yrs. It is suggested that the timescale of the relativistic jet may be considerably larger, in the order of 10^5-6 yrs, than previously thought in SS433. The driving engine of the jet is obviously SS433 itself in SS433, although the engine is not yet identified in MJG348.5 among possible several candidates detected in the X-rays and TeV gamma rays.
