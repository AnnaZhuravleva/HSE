The dynamics of planetesimals in the circumbinary debris disc of the quadruple star system HD 98800 are investigated. Evolving a spherical shell of test particles from a million years ago to the present day indicates that both coplanar and retrograde warped discs could exist, as well as a high inclination halo of material. Significant gaps are seen in the discs, as well as unexpected regions of stability due to the retrograde nature of the stellar orbits. Despite a viewing angle almost perpendicular to the direction of the warp of the planetesimal disc it is still intersected by the line of sight for eccentricities of the outer orbit of 0.5 or less.
