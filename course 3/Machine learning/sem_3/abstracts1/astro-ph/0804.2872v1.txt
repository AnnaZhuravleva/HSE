We present the results of a survey of nearby, young M stars for wide low-mass companions with IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We observed 40 young M dwarfs within 20 pc of the Sun, selected through X-ray emission criteria. A total of 10 candidate companions were found with IRAC colors consistent with T dwarfs. Extensive ground-based NIR follow-up observations rejected all these candidates. Two additional candidates were discovered via common proper motion measurements, one of which was rejected as a background object and the other is a bona fide companion to GJ 2060, a member of the AB Doradus moving group.
