In this paper we study the angular momentum properties of simulated dark matter halos at high redshift that likely host the first stars in the Universe. Calculating the spin distributions of these $10^6 - 10^7 \Msun$ halos in redshift slices from $z = 15 - 6$, we find that they are well fit by a log-normal distribution as is found for lower redshift and more massive halos in earlier work. We find that both the mean value of the spin and dispersion are largely unchanged with redshift for all halos. Our key result is that subsamples of low and high spin $10^6 \Msun$ and $10^7 \Msun$ halos show difference in clustering strength. In both mass bins, higher spin halos are more strongly clustered in concordance with a tidal torquing picture for the growth of angular momentum in dark matter halos in the CDM paradigm.
