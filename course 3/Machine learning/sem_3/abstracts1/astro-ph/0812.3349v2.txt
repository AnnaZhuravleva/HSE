We present a catalogue with the properties of all the bursts detected and localized by the IBIS instrument onboard the INTEGRAL satellite from November 2002 to September 2008. The sample is composed of 56 bursts, corresponding to a rate of ~ 0.8 GRB per month. Thanks to the performances of the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, 50% of the IBIS GRBs have detected afterglows, while 5% have redshift measurements. A spectral analysis of the 43 bursts in the INTEGRAL public archive has been carried out using the most recent software and calibration, deriving an updated, homogeneous and accurate catalogue with the spectral features of the sample. When possible also a time-resolved spectral analysis has been carried out. The GRBs in the sample have 20-200 keV fluences in the range 5 x 1E-8 --2.5 x 1E-4 erg cm-2, and peak fluxes in the range 0.11 - 56 ph cm-2 s-1. While most of the spectra are well fitted by a power law with photon index ~ 1.6, we found that 9 bursts are better described by a cut-off power law, resulting in Ep values in the range 35--190 keV. Altough these results are comparable with those obtained with BAT onboard Swift, there is a marginal evidence that ISGRI detects dimmer bursts than Swift/BAT. Using the revised spectral parameters and an updated sky exposure map that takes into account also the effects of the GRB trigger efficiency, we strengthen the evidence for a spatial correlation with the super galactic plane of the faint bursts with long spectral lag (Foley et al.,2008).
