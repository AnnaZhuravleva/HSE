We use high-resolution simulations of large-scale structure formation to analyze the effects of interacting dark matter and dark energy on the evolution of the halo mass function. Using a chi-square likelihood analysis, we find significant differences in the mass function between models of coupled dark matter-dark energy and standard concordance cosmology Lambda-CDM out to redshift z=1.5. We also find a preliminary indication that the Dark Energy Survey should be able to distinguish these models from Lambda-CDM within its mass and redshift contraints. While we can distinguish the effects of these models from Lambda-CDM cosmologies with different fundamental parameters, DES will require independent measurements of sigma-8 to confirm these effects.
