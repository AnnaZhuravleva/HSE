We report on the discovery of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from the BL Lacertae object 1ES1011+496. The observation was triggered by an optical outburst in March 2007 and the source was observed with the MAGIC telescope from March to May 2007. Observing for 18.7 hr we find an excess of 6.2 sigma with an integrated flux above 200 GeV of (1.58$\pm0.32) 10^{-11}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The VHE gamma-ray flux is >40% higher than in March-April 2006 (reported elsewhere), indicating that the VHE emission state may be related to the optical emission state. We have also determined the redshift of 1ES1011+496 based on an optical spectrum that reveals the absorption lines of the host galaxy. The redshift of z=0.212 makes 1ES1011+496 the most distant source observed to emit VHE gamma-rays up to date.
