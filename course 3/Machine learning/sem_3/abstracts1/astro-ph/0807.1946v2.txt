We investigate the total kinetic powers (L_j) and ages (t_age) of powerful jets in FR II radio galaxies by comparison of the dynamical model of expanding cocoons with observations. We select four FR II radio sources (Cygnus A, 3C 223, 3C 284, and 3C 219), for which the mass-density profiles of intracluster medium (ICM) are known in the literature. It is found that large fractions > 0.02 - 0.7 of the Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) are carried away as a kinetic power of jet. The upper limit of estimated 2 L_j / L_Edd are larger than unity (< 10) for some sources, suggesting a possibility of super-Eddington mass accretions. As a consequence of the large powers, we also find that the total energy stored in the cocoon (E_c) exceeds the energy derived from the minimum energy condition for the energy of radiating non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields (E_min): 4< E_c /E_min <310. This implies that most of the energy in cocoon is carried by invisible components such as thermal leptons (electron and positron) and/or protons.
