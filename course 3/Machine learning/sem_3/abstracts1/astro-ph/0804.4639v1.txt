The advent of affordable parallel computers such as Beowulf PC clusters and, more recently, of multi-core PCs has been highly beneficial for a large number of scientists and smaller institutions that might not otherwise have access to substantial computing facilities. However, there has not been an analogous progress in the development and dissemination of parallel software: scientists need the expertise to develop parallel codes and have to invest a significant amount of time in the development of tools even for the most common data analysis tasks. We describe the Beowulf Analysis Symbolic INterface (BASIN) a multi-user parallel data analysis and visualization framework. BASIN is aimed at providing scientists with a suite of parallel libraries for astrophysical data analysis along with general tools for data distribution and parallel operations on distributed data to allow them to easily develop new parallel libraries for their specific tasks.
