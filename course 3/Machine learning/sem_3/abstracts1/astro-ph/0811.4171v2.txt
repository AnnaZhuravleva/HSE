The CDMS-II experiment operates 19 germanium detectors with a mass of 250g each in a very low background environment. Originally designed for the search for Dark Matter the experiment can also detect solar axions by Primakoff conversion to photons. The Bragg condition for X-ray momentum transfer in a crystal allows for coherent amplification of the Primakoff process. Since the orientation of the crystal lattice with respect to the Sun changes with daytime an unique pattern in time and energy of solar axion conversions is expected. The low background ~1.5 counts/kg/day/keV and knowledge of the exact orientation of all three crystal axes with respect to the Sun make the CDMS-II experiment very sensitive to solar axions. In contrast to helioscopes, the high mass region < 1 keV can also be probed effectively. The alternating orientations of the individual crystals in the experimental setup provide different patterns of solar axion conversion, making a false positive result extremely unlikely. The result of an analysis of 289 kg-days of exposure resulted in a null observation of solar axion conversion. This analysis sets an upper limit on the axion photon coupling constant of g_{a\gamma\gamma} < 2.6 x 10^{-9} GeV{-1} at a 95% confidence level.
