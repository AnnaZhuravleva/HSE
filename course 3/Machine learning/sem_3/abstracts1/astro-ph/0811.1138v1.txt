Several types of variable stars are found along the HR diagram whose pulsations are driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism. Given their nature, the precise ($T_{\rm eff}-L$) domain where these pulsators are located is highly dependent on the value of opacity and on its variation inside the star. We analyze the sensitivity of opacity driven pulsators of spectral-type A and B ($\delta$ Scuti, $\beta$ Cephei and SPB stars) to the opacity tables (OP/OPAL) and to the chemical composition of the stellar matter. We also briefly discuss the effect of opacity on pulsators whose oscillations are not driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism, such as $\gamma$ Doradus and solar-like stars.
