Evidence on the ages and masses of Mira variables is reviewed. Period increases with increasing initial mass. Miras of logP about 3.0 have initial masses of near 4 solar masses. It is suggestd that the apparent gap in the LMC PL relation at about this period may be due to the onset of hot bottom burning and that this adds about 15 to 20 percent to the stellar energy production. Shorter period HBB stars are probably overtone pulsators. T Lep may be an example of cool bottom processing.
