We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the peculiar SN 2005la, an object which shows an optical light curve with some luminosity fluctuations and spectra with comparably strong narrow hydrogen and helium lines, probably of circumstellar nature. The increasing full-width-half-maximum velocity of these lines is indicative of an acceleration of the circumstellar material. SN 2005la exhibits hybrid properties, sharing some similarities with both type IIn supernovae and 2006jc-like (type Ibn) events. We propose that the progenitor of SN 2005la was a very young Wolf-Rayet (WN-type) star which experimented mass ejection episodes shortly before core collapse.
