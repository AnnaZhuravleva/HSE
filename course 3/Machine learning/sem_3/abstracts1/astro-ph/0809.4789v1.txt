We discuss the role of mass loss for the evolution of the most massive stars, highlighting the role of the predicted bi-stability jump that might be relevant for the evolution of rotational velocities during or just after the main sequence. This mechanism is also proposed as an explanation for the mass-loss variations seen in the winds from Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). These might be relevant for the quasi-sinusoidal modulations seen in a number of recent transitional supernovae (SNe), as well as for the double-throughed absorption profile recently discovered in the Halpha line of SN 2005gj. Finally, we discuss the role of metallicity via the Z-dependent character of their winds, during both the initial and final (Wolf-Rayet) phases of evolution, with implications for the angular momentum evolution of the progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
