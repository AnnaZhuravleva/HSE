We have studied the kinematics of the ionized gas and stellar component in Mrk334 using methods of panoramic (3D) spectroscopy. The observations were performed at the prime focus of the SAO RAS 6-m telescope with the integral-field spectrograph MPFS (Afanasiev et al. 2001) and with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), installed on the multimode device SCORPIO (Afanasiev & Moiseev 2005). Based on these data, the monochromatic maps and velocity fields in different emission lines of the ionized gas were constructed. The diagnostic diagrams have been made based on the emission lines ratios.
