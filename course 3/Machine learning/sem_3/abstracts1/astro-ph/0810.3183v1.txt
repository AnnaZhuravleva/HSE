A spectroscopic support survey of 103 objects observed by the MOST satellite is presented; 96 are variable stars with 83 of them being new MOST variable-star detections or stars with variability types verified and/or modified on the basis of the MOST data. Analysis of 241 medium-resolution spectra using the broadening-functions formalism yielded radial velocities, projected rotational velocities (for 31 targets for which it was possible) and spectral type estimates. Seven new spectroscopic binaries were discovered; orbital solutions are given for two of them (HD73709, and GSC 0814-0323). The visual binary HD46180 was found to be composed of two close binary stars (eclipsing and non-eclipsing one) very probably forming a physical quadruple system.
