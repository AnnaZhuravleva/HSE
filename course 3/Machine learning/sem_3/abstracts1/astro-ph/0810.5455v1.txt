MGRO J2019+37 is an unidentified source of very high energy gamma-rays originally reported by the MILAGRO collaboration as the brightest TeV source in the Cygnus region. Despite the poor angular resolution of MILAGRO, this object seems to be most likely an extended source or, alternatively, a superposition of point-like TeV sources.   In order to contribute to the understanding of this peculiar object, we have mosaiced it with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune, India, at the 610 MHz frequency covering a field of view of about 6 square degrees down to a typical rms noise of a few tenths of mJy. We also observed the central square degree of this mosaic in the near infrared Ks-band using the 3.5 m telescope and the OMEGA2000 camera at the Calar Alto observatory (Spain). We present here a first account of our observations and results, together with a preliminar cross correlation of the radio and infrared source catalog as well as a correlation with the available X-ray observations of the region.
