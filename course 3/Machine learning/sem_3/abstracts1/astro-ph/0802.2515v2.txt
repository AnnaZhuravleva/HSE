We present a medium-resolution optical spectrum of the alleged high-redshift quasar Q0045-3337, taken at the ESO/3.6m telescope. Our observations show that the object is not a quasar but a star of spectral type B. We suggest that the object is either a white dwarf or a halo population Blue Horizontal Branch star.
