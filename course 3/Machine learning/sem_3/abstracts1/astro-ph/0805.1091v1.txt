Kepler's supernova, discovered in October 1604, produced a remnant that has been well studied observationally in the radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray bands, and theoretically. Some models have predicted a TeV gamma-ray flux that is detectable with current Imaging Cherenkov Atmospheric Telescopes. We report on observations carried out in 2005 April with the CANGAROO-III telescope. No statistically significant excess was observed, and limitations on the allowed parameter range in the model are discussed.
