We present simultaneous high-resolution optical spectroscopy and X-ray data of the X-ray binary system GR Mus (XB1254-690), obtained over a full range of orbital phases. The X-ray observations are used to re-establish the orbital ephemeris for this source. The optical data includes the first spectroscopic detection of the donor star in this system, through the use of the Doppler Tomography technique on the Bowen fluorescence blend (~4630-4650 A). In combination with an estimate for the orbital parameters of the compact object using the wings of the He II 4686 emission line, dynamical mass constraints of 1.20 < M_X/M_{sun} < 2.64 for the neutron star and 0.45 < M_2/M_{sun} < 0.85 for the companion are derived.
