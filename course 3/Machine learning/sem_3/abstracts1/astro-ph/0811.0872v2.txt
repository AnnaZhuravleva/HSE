For r-process nucleosynthesis the beta decay rates of very neutron-rich nuclei are important ingredients. We consider the region around the neutron number N=82 and calculate the half-lives and rates for a number of nuclei. Forms for beta strength functions based on spectral distribution methods are used. The calculated half-lives are first compared to the observed values and then predictions are made for very neutron-rich nuclei close to drip line for which no experimental values are available.
