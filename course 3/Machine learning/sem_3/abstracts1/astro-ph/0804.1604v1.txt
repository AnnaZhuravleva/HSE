We study the evolution of the number of close companions of similar luminosities per galaxy (Nc) by choosing a volume-limited subset of the photometric redshift catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-1). The sample contains over 157,000 objects with a moderate redshift range of 0.25 < z < 0.8 and absolute magnitude in Rc (M_Rc) < -20. This is the largest sample used for pair evolution analysis, providing data over 9 redshift bins with about 17,500 galaxies in each. After applying incompleteness and projection corrections, Nc shows a clear evolution with redshift. The Nc value for the whole sample grows with redshift as (1+z)^m, where m = 2.83 +/- 0.33 in good agreement with N-body simulations in a LCDM cosmology. We also separate the sample into two different absolute magnitude bins: -25 < M_Rc < -21 and -21 < M_Rc < -20, and find that the brighter the absolute magnitude, the smaller the m value. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the pair fraction for different projected separation bins and different luminosities. We find that the m value becomes smaller for larger separation, and the pair fraction for the fainter luminosity bin has stronger evolution. We derive the major merger remnant fraction f_rem = 0.06, which implies that about 6% of galaxies with -25 < M_Rc < -20 have undergone major mergers since z = 0.8.
