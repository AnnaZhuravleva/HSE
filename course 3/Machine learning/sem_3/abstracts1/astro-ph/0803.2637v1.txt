The generation of non-gaussianity is studied in a three fluid curvaton model. By utilizing second order perturbation theory we derive general formulae for the large scale temperature fluctuation and non-gaussianity parameter, $f_{NL}$, that includes the possibility of a non-adiabatic final state. In the adiabatic limit we recover previously known results. The results are applied to a three fluid curvaton model where the curvaton decays into radiation and matter. We find that the amount of non-gaussianity decreases as the final state of the system becomes more adiabatic and that the generated non-gaussianity in the scenario is small, $|f_{NL}| \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$.
