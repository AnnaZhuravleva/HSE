We study the possibility to extract the multipolar moments of an underlying distribution from a set of cosmic rays observed with non-uniform or even partial sky coverage. We show that if the degree is assumed to be upper bounded by $L$, each multipolar moment can be recovered whatever the coverage, but with a variance increasing exponentially with the bound $L$ if the coverage is zero somewhere. Despite this limitation, we show the possibility to test predictions of a model without any assumption on $L$ by building an estimate of the covariance matrix seen through the exposure function.
