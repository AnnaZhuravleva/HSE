Hybrid Chaplygin gas model is put forward, in which the gases play the role of dark energy. For this model the coincidence problem is greatly alleviated. The effective equation of state of the dark energy may cross the phantom divide $w=-1$. Furthermore, the crossing behaviour is decoupled from any gravity theories. In the present model, $w<-1$ is only a transient behaviour. There is a de Sitter attractor in the future infinity. Hence, the big rip singularity, which often afflicts the models with matter whose effective equation of state less than -1, is naturally disappear. There exist stable scaling solutions, both at the early universe and the late universe. We discuss the perturbation growth of this model. We find that the index is consistent with observations.
