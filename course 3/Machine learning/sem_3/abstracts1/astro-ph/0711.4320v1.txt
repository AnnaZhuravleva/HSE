New XRT observations of the north polar region taken from the X-ray Telescope (XRT) of the Hinode (Solar-B) spacecraft are used to analyze several time sequences showing small loop brightenings with a long ray above. We focus on the recorded transverse displacement of the jet and discuss scenarios to explain the main features of the events: the relationship with the expected surface magnetism, the rapid and sudden radial motion, and possibly the heating, based on the assumption that the jet occurs above a null point of the coronal magnetic field. We conclude that 3-D reconnection models are needed to explain the observational details of these events.
