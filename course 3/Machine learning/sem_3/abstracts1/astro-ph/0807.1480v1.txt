Context. We analyse the line and continuum spectra of the symbiotic system CH Cygni. Aims. To show that the colliding-wind model is valid to explain this symbiotic star at different phases. Methods. Peculiar observed features such as flickering, radio variation, X-ray emission, as well as the distribution of the nebulae and shells throughout the system are investigated by modelling the spectra at different epochs. The models account consistently for shock and photoionization and are constrained by absolute fluxes. Results. We find that the reverse shock between the stars leads to the broad lines observed during the active phases, as well as to radio and hard X-ray emission, while the expanding shock is invoked to explain the data during the transition phases.
