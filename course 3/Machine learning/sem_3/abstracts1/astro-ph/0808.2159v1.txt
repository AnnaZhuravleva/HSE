We are conducting a large program to classify newly discovered Milky Way star cluster candidates from the list of Froebrich, Scholz & Raftery (2007). Here we present deep NIR follow-up observations from ESO/NTT of 14 star cluster candidates. We show that the combined analysis of star density maps and colour-colour/magnitude diagrams derived from deep near-infrared imaging is a viable tool to reliably classify new stellar clusters. This allowed us to identify two young clusters with massive stars, three intermediate age open clusters, and two globular cluster candidates among our targets. The remaining seven objects are unlikely to be stellar clusters. Among them is the object FSR1767 which has previously been identified as a globular cluster using 2MASS data by Bonatto et al. (2007). Our new analysis shows that FSR1767 is not a star cluster. We also summarise the currently available follow-up analysis of the FSR candidates and conclude that this catalogue may contain a large number of new stellar clusters, probably dominated by old open clusters.
