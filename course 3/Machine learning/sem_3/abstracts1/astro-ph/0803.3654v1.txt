A quantitative spectral analysis of 24 A supergiants in the Sculptor Group spiral galaxy NGC 300 at a distance of 1.9 Mpc is presented. A new method is introduced to analyze low resolution (~5 AE) spectra, which yields metallicities accurate to 0.2 dex including the uncertainties arising from the errors in Teff (5%) and log g (0.2 dex). For the first time the stellar metallicity gradient based on elements such as titanium and iron in a galaxy beyond the Local Group is investigated. Solar metallicity is measured in the center and 0.3 solar in the outskirts and a logarithmic gradient of -0.08 dex/kpc. An average reddening of E(B-V)~0.12 mag is obtained, however with a large variation from 0.07 to 0.24 mag. We also determine stellar radii, luminosities and masses and discuss the evolutionary status. Finally, the observed relationship between absolute bolometric magnitudes M_{bol} and flux weighted gravities g_{F} = g/Teff^4 is investigated. At high temperatures the strengths of the Balmer lines depends solely on the flux-weighted gravity, which allows a precise direct determination of log g_{F} with an accuracy of 0.05 to 0.1 dex. We find a tight relationship between M_{bol} and log g_{F} in agreement with stellar evolution theory. Combining these new results with previous work on Local Group galaxies we obtain a new flux weighted gravity luminosity relationship (FGLR), which is very well defined and appears to be an excellent alternative tool to determine distances to galaxies.
