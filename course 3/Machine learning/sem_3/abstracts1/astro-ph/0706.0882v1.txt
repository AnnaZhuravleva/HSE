We present here the capabilities of the GLAST Large Area Telescope to detect cosmic ray high-energy (HE) electrons in the energy range from 10 GeV to 1 TeV. We also discuss the science topics that can be investigated with HE electron data and quantify the results with LAT instrument simulations. The science topics include CR propagation, calibration of the IC gamma-ray model, testing hypotheses regarding the origin of HE energy cosmic-ray electrons, searching for any signature of Kaluza Klein Dark Matter annihilation, and measuring the HE electron anisotropy. We expect to detect ~ 107 electrons above 20 GeV per year of LAT operation.
