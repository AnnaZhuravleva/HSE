We briefly recall the physical background of the transport of angular momentum and the mixing of chemicals inside stellar radiation zones and its importance for stellar evolution. Then, we describe its present modeling, its successes and its weaknesses. Next, we introduce the new theoretical developments that allow us to treat in a self-consistent way the effect of the Coriolis force on the low-frequencies internal waves and its consequences for the transport processes. This research is aimed at improving the modeling of stellar interiors in the perspective of future astero and helioseismology missions such as COROT and GOLF-NG.
