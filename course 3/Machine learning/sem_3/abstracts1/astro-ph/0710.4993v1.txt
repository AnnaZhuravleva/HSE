There is increasing evidence that the universe is dominated by dark energy of the type given by an invariant cosmological constant. Latest data also indicates that fundamental interaction couplings and particle masses have remained remarkably constant from the earliest epochs. It is natural to connect these two steady state features of the evolving universe, suggesting a role for the cosmic vacuum energy in fixing these interaction constants. Advances in high precision cosmology have revealed that dark matter of an unknown type constitutes about one-fourth of cosmic matter while baryons account for just four percent. These various cosmic parameters are enumerated by the six numbers of Rees. With the dark energy as a unifying link these
