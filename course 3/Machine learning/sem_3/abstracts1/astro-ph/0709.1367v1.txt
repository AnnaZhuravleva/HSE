Once the first sources have formed, their mass deposition, energy injection and emitted radiation can deeply affect the subsequent galaxy formation process and influence the evolution of the IGM via a number of so-called feedback effects. The word 'feedback' is by far one of the most used in modern cosmology, where it is applied to a vast range of situations and astrophysical objects. Generally speaking, the concept of feedback invokes a back reaction of a process on itself or on the causes that have produced it. The character of feedback can be either negative or positive. Here, I will review the present status of investigation of the feedback effects from the first stars and galaxies.
