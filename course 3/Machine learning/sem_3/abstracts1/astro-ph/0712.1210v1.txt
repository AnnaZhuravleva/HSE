The Cosmic Neutrinos Background (\textbf{CNB}) are Primordial Neutrinos decoupled when the Universe was very young. Its detection is complicated, especially if we take into account neutrino mass and a possible breaking of Lorentz Invariance at high energy, but has a fundamental relevance to study the Big-Bang. In this paper, we will see that a Lorentz Violation does not produce important modification, but the mass does. We will show how the neutrinos current velocity, with respect to comobile system to Universe expansion, is of the order of 1065 $[\frac{km}{s}]$, much less than light velocity. Besides, we will see that the neutrinos distribution is complex due to Planetary motion. This prediction differs totally from the usual massless case, where we would get a correction similar to the Dipolar Moment of the \textbf{CMB}.
