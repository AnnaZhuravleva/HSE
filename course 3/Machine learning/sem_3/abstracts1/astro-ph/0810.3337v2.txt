Three-dimensional neutral hydrogen mapping using the redshifted 21 cm line has recently emerged as a promising cosmological probe. Within the framework of slow-roll reconstruction, we analyze how well the inflationary potential can be reconstructed by combining data from 21 cm experiments and cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite. We consider inflationary models classified according to the amplitude of their tensor component, and show that 21 cm measurements can significantly improve constraints on the slow-roll parameters and determine the shape of the inflationary potential.
