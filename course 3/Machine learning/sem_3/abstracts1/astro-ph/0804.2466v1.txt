Auger results on clustering of > 60 EeV ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) ions and the interpretation of the gamma-ray spectra of TeV blazars are connected by effects from the extragalactic background light (EBL). The EBL acts as an obscuring medium for gamma rays and a reprocessing medium for UHECR ions and protons, causing the GZK cutoff. The study of the physics underlying the coincidence between the GZK energy and the clustering energy of UHECR ions favors a composition of > 60 EeV UHECRs in CNO group nucleons. This has interesting implications for the sources of UHECRs. We also comment on the Auger analysis.
