The universe content is considered as a non-perfect fluid with bulk viscosity and can be described by a general equation of state (endowed some deviation from the conventionally assumed cosmic perfect fluid model). An explicitly bulk viscosity dark energy model is proposed to confront consistently with the current observational data sets by statistical analysis and is shown consistent with (not deviated away much from) the concordant $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model by comparing the decelerating parameter. Also we compare our relatively simple viscosity dark energy model with a more complicated one by contrast with the concordant $\Lambda$CDM model and find our model improves for the viscosity dark energy model building. Finally we discuss the perspectives of dark energy probes for the coming years with observations.
