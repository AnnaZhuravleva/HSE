We use the recent type Ia supernova, cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data to shed light on the temporal evolution of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ out to redshift one. We constrain the most flexible parametrization of dark energy to date, and include the dark energy perturbations consistently throughout. Interpreting our results via the principal component analysis, we find no significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the cosmological constant model is consistent with data everywhere between redshift zero and one at 95% C.L.
