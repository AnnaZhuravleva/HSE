The model of pulsar radio emission is discussed in which a coherent radio emis-sion is excited in a vacuum gap above polar cap of neutron star. Pulsar X and gamma radiation are considered as the result of low-frequency radio emission inverse Comp-ton scattering on ultra relativistic electrons accelerated in the gap. The influence of the pulsar magnetic field on Compton scattering is taken into account. The relation of radio and gamma radiation spectra has been found in the framework of the model.
