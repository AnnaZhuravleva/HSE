We present a new method for dealing with geometrical selection effects in galaxy surveys while using a multifractal framework. The power of multifractal analysis lies in its connection to higher order moments, in that it not only probes clustering on different scales but also different densities. Therefore any incompleteness issues must be correctly addressed before blindly applying this technique to real survey data.
