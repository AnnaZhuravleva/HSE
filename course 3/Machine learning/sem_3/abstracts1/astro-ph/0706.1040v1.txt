%Context: {Previous studies have indicated that the 372.4 GHz ground transition of ortho-H$_2$D$^+$ might be a powerful probe of Proto-Planetary Disks. The line could be especially suited for study of the disk mid-plane, where the bulk of the mass resides and where planet formation takes place.} %Aims: {Provide detailed theoretical predictions for the line intensity, profile and maps expected for representative disk models.} %Methods: {We determine the physical and chemical structure of the disks from the model developed by Ceccarelli & Dominik (2005). The line emission is computed with the new radiative transfer method developed recently by Elitzur & Asensio Ramos (2006).} %Results: {We present intensity maps convolved with the expected ALMA resolution, which delineate the origin of the H$_2$D$^+$ 372.4 GHz line. In the disk inner regions, the line probes the conditions in the mid-plane out to radial distances of a few tens of AU, where Solar-like planetary systems might form. In the disk outermost regions, the line originates from slightly above the mid-plane. When the disk is spatially resolved, the variation of line profile across the image provides important information about the velocity field. Spectral profiles of the entire disk flux show a double peak shape at most inclination angles.} %Conclusions: {Our study confirms that the 372.4 GHz H$_2$D$^+$ line provides powerful diagnostics of the mid-plane of Proto-Planetary Disks. Current submillimeter telescopes are capable of observing this line, though with some difficulties. The future ALMA interferometer will have the sensitivity to observe and even spatially resolve the H$_2$D$^+$ line emission.}
