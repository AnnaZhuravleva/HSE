Detecting high-z GRBs is important for constraining the GRB formation rate, and tracing the history of re-ionization and metallicity of the universe. Based on the current sample of GRBs detected by Swift with known redshifts, we investigated the relationship between red-shift, and spectral and temporal characteristics, using the BAT event-by-event data. We found red-shift trends for the peak-flux-normalized temporal width T90, the light curve variance, the peak flux, and the photon index in simple power-law fit to the BAT event data. We have constructed criteria for screening GRBs with high red-shifts. This will enable us to provide a much faster alert to the GRB community of possible high-z bursts.
