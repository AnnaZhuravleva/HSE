Here I discuss possible relations between free precession of neutron stars, Tkachenko waves inside them and glitches. I note that the proposed precession period of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 (Haberl et al. 2006) is consistent with the period of Tkachenko waves for the spin period 8.4s. Based on a possible observation of a glitch in RX J0720.4-3125 (van Kerkwijk et al. 2007), I propose a simple model, in which long period precession is powered by Tkachenko waves generated by a glitch. The period of free precession, determined by a NS oblateness, should be equal to the standing Tkachenko wave period for effective energy transfer from the standing wave to the precession motion. A similar scenario can be applicable also in the case of the PSR B1828-11.
