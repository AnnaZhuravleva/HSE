Panoramic spectroscopic data of the sample of 80 nearby lenticular galaxies obtained with the Multi-Pupil Fiber Spectrograph of the 6-m telescope are presented. The SSP-equivalent ages, [Z/H], and [Mg/Fe] are determined through the Lick indices H-beta, Mgb, and <Fe> separately for the nuclei and for the bulges. About a half of the sample contain chemically distinct nuclei, more metal-rich and younger than the bulges. The correlations of the stellar population properties for the nearby S0s are discussed.
