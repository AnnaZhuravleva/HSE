We present a self-consistent MHD model for the jet of M87. The model consist of two distinct zones: an inner relativistic outflow, which we identify with the observed jet, and an outer cold disk-wind. While the former does not self-collimate efficiently due to its high effective inertia, the latter fulfills all the conditions for efficient collimation by the magneto-centrifugal mechanism. Given the right balance between the effective inertia of the inner flow and the collimation efficiency of the outer disk wind, the relativistic flow is magnetically confined into a well collimated beam for a wide range of parameters and matches the measurements of the opening angle of M87 over several orders of magnitude in spatial extent.   In the second part of this work, we present synthetic synchrotron emission maps for our MHD models. In principle the two-zone model can reproduce the morphological structure seen in radio observations, as central-peaked profiles across the jet close the the source, limb-bright further down the jet, and a bright knot close to the position of HST-1. However it is difficult to reconcile all features into a single set of parameters.
