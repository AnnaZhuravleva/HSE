Statistical analyses of several Delta Scuti stars (FG Vir, 44 Tau, BL Cam and others) show that the photometrically observed frequencies cluster around the frequencies of the radial modes over many radial orders. The observed regularities can be partly explained by modes trapped in the stellar envelope. This mode selection mechanism was already proposed by Dziembowski & Krolikowska (1990) and was shown to be efficient for l=1 modes. New pulsation model calculations confirm the observed regularities. We present the s-f diagram, which compares the average separation of the radial frequencies (s) with the frequency of the lowest unstable radial mode (f). The diagram provides an estimate for the log g value of the observed star, if we assume that the centers of the observed frequency clusters correspond to the radial mode frequencies. This assumption is confirmed by examples of well-studied Delta Scuti variables in which radial modes were definitely identified.
