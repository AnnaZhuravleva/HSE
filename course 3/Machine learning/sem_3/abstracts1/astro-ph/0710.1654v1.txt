We report an SMA interferometric identification of a bright submillimeter source, GOODS 850-5. This source is one of the brightest 850 um sources in the GOODS-N but is extremely faint at all other wavelengths. It is not detected in the GOODS HST ACS images and only shows a weak 2 sigma signal at 1.4 GHz. It is detected in the Spitzer IRAC bands and the MIPS 24 um band, however, with very low fluxes. We present evidence in the radio, submillimeter, mid-IR, near-IR, and optical that suggest GOODS 850-5 may be a z>4 galaxy.
