We present the broadband analysis of the powerful quasar 4C04.42 (z=0.965) observed by XMM and INTEGRAL. The 0.2--200 keV spectrum is well reproduced with a hard power-law component ($\Gamma\sim$1.2), augmented by a soft component below 2 keV (observer frame), which is described by a thermal blackbody with temperature kT$\backsimeq$ 0.15 keV. Alternatively, a broken power-law with E$_{break}$=2 keV and $\Delta\Gamma$=0.4 can equally well describe the data. Using archival data we compile the not-simultaneous Spectral Energy Distribution of the source from radio to gamma-ray frequencies. The SED shows two main components: the low frequency one produced by Synchrotron radiation from the electrons moving in the jet and the high energy one produced through external Compton scattering of the electrons with the photon field of the Broad Line Region. Within this scenario the excess emission in the soft-X ray band can be interpreted as due to Bulk Compton radiation of cold electrons. However, some other processes, briefly discussed in the text, can also reproduce the observed bump.
