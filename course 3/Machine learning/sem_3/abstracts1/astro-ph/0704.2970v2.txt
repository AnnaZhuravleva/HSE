(abridged) The soft excess seen in the X-ray spectra of many high mass accretion rate AGN can be well modelled by reflection from a partially ionised accretion disc. However, the derived parameters are often extreme, both in terms of the underlying spacetime and the reflection geometry, and these models require that the disc is far from hydrostatic equilibrium. An alternative model uses similarly partially ionised, velocity smeared material but seen in absorption, though again the derived velocities are extreme, requiring magnetic driving (in the jet?) rather than a simple line driven disc wind. We find that while both models give comparably good fits to XMM--Newton data, we favour the absorption model as, unlike reflection, all the derived spectral indices are soft. This is as expected by analogy with the correspondingly high mass accretion rate stellar mass black holes. Furthermore, these X-ray spectra are consistent with a one--to--one mapping between AGN type and spectral state, with NLS1's having softer spectra corresponding to the very high state, while the broad line AGN have Gamma~2 as expected for the high/soft state. We also use the simultaneous OM data to derive the ratio of disc to total accretion power which is another tracer of spectral state in X-ray binaries. This does not always show that the disc in NLS1's contributes less than 80 per cent of the total power, as expected for a very high state. We suggest that this is an artifact of the standard disc models used to determine the disc luminosity in our fits. The disc seen in the very high state of black hole binaries is often observed to be distorted from the standard shape, and a similar effect in NLS1's could recover the correspondance between black hole binary spectral state and AGN type.
