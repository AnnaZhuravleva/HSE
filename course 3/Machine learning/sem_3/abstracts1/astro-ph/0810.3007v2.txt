When gauged cosmic strings form in a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the gauge field configuration at the time becomes imprinted in the spatial string distribution by the flux trapping mechanism. It is shown that quantum and thermal gauge field fluctuations give rise to long-range superhorizon correlations in the string network. Numerical simulations in the Abelian Higgs model confirm this finding. In contrast, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which most cosmic string studies are based on, only gives rise to short-distance subhorizon correlations. The potential observable effects of the correlations are discussed.
