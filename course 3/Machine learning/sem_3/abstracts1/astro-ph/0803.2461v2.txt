The distribution of dust and molecular clouds in the direction of Galactic longitudes 132--158 deg and latitudes pm 12 deg is investigated. The maps of dust distribution in the area were plotted from the following surveys: the star counts in the DSS I database by Dobashi et al. (2005), the survey of the average infrared color excesses by Froebrich et al. (2007) and the thermal dust emission survey at 100 micrometers by Schlegel et al. (1998). The distribution of molecular clouds was taken from the whole sky CO survey by Dame et al. (2001). All these surveys show very similar cloud patterns in the area. Using the radial velocities of CO, the distances to separate clouds are estimated. A revised list of the Cam OB1 association members contains 43 stars and the open cluster NGC 1502. 18 young irregular variable and H alpha emission stars are identified in the area. All this proves that the star forming process in the Camelopardalis clouds is still in progress.
