Adopting the Lindblom-Detweiler formalism for polar oscillations of neutron stars, we study the $w$-mode oscillation and find that the Lagrangian change in pressure, measured by the physical quantity $X$, is negligibly small. Based on this observation, we develop the generalised inverse-Cowling approximation (GICA) with the approximation $X=X'=0$, where $X'$ is the derivative of $X$ with respect to the circumferential radius, for $w$-mode oscillations of neutron stars. Under GICA, $w$-mode oscillations are described by a second-order differential system, which can yield accurate frequencies and damping rates of quasi-normal modes.
