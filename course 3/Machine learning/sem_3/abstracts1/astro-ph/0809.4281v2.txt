We present results from our X-ray data analysis of the SNR G330.2+1.0 and its CCO, CXOU J160103.1--513353 (J1601). Using our XMM-Newton and Chandra observations, we find that the X-ray spectrum of J1601 can be described by neutron star atmosphere models (T ~ 2.5--3.7 MK). Assuming the distance of d ~ 5 kpc for J1601 as estimated for SNR G330.2+1.0, a small emission region of R ~ 1--2 km is implied. X-ray pulsations previously suggested by Chandra are not confirmed by the XMM-Newton data, and are likely not real. However, our timing analysis of the XMM-Newton data is limited by poor photon statistics, and thus pulsations with a relatively low amplitude (i.e., an intrinsic pulsed-fraction < 40%) cannot be ruled out. Our results indicate that J1601 is a CCO similar to that in the Cassiopeia A SNR.X-ray emission from SNR G330.2+1.0 is dominated by power law continuum (Gamma ~ 2.1--2.5) which primarily originates from thin filaments along the boundary shell. This X-ray spectrum implies synchrotron radiation from shock-accelerated electrons with an exponential roll-off frequency ~ 2--3 x 10^17 Hz. For the measured widths of the X-ray filaments (D ~ 0.3 pc) and the estimated shock velocity (v_s ~ a few x 10^3 km s^-1), a downstream magnetic field B ~ 10--50 $\mu$G is derived. The estimated maximum electron energy E_max ~ 27--38 TeV suggests that G330.2+1.0 is a candidate TeV gamma-ray source. We detect faint thermal X-ray emission in G330.2+1.0. We estimate a low preshock density n_0 ~ 0.1 cm^-3, which suggests a dominant contribution from an inverse Compton mechanism (than the proton-proton collision) to the prospective gamma-ray emission. Follow-up deep radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations will be essential to reveal the details of the shock parameters and the nature of particle accelerations in this SNR.
