A new map of the sky representing the degree of randomness in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature has been obtained. The map based on estimation of the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter clearly distinguishes the contribution of the Galactic disk from the CMB and reveals regions of various degrees of randomness that can reflect the properties of inhomogeneities in the Universe. For example, among the high randomness regions is the southern non-Gaussian anomaly, the Cold Spot, with a stratification expected for the voids. Existence of its counterpart, a Northern Cold Spot with almost identical randomness properties among other low-temperature regions is revealed. By its informative power, Kolmogorov's map can be complementary to the CMB temperature and polarization sky maps.
