We present results obtained with a 3D, Ly alpha radiative transfer code, applied to a fully cosmological galaxy formation simulation. The developed Monte Carlo code is capable of treating an arbitrary distribution of source Ly alpha emission, neutral hydrogen density, temperature, and peculiar velocity of the interstellar medium. We investigate the influence of resonant scattering on the appearance and properties of young galaxies by applying the code to a simulated "Lyman Break Galaxy" at redshift z = 3.6, and of star formation rate 22 M_sun/yr and total Ly alpha luminosity 2.0 X 10^43 erg/s. It is found that resonant scattering of Ly alpha radiation can explain that young galaxies frequently are observed to be more extended on the sky in Ly alpha than in the optical. Moreover, it is shown that, for the system investigated, due to the anisotropic escape of the photons, the appearent maximum surface brightness can differ by a factor of ~15, and the total derived luminosity by a factor of ~4, depending on the orientation of the system relative to the observer.
