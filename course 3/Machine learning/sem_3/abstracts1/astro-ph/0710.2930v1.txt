Hot Jupiters are new laboratories for the physics of giant planet atmospheres. Subject to unusual forcing conditions, the circulation regime on these planets may be unlike anything known in the Solar System. Characterizing the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters is necessary for reliable interpretation of the multifaceted data currently being collected on these planets. We discuss several fundamental concepts of atmospheric dynamics that are likely central to obtaining a solid understanding of these fascinating atmospheres. A particular effort is made to compare the various modeling approaches employed so far to address this challenging problem.
