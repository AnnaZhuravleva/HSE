The X-ray spectrum of NGC7213 is known to present no evidence for Compton reflection, a unique result among bright Seyfert 1s. The observed neutral iron K$\alpha$ line, therefore, cannot be associated with a Compton-thick material, like the disc or the torus, but is due to Compton-thin gas, with the Broad Line Region (BLR) as the most likely candidate. To check this hypothesis, a long Chandra HETG observation, together with a quasi-simultaneous optical spectroscopic observation at the ESO NTT EMMI were performed. We found that the iron line is resolved with a FWHM=$2 400^{+1 100}_{-600}$ km/s, in perfect agreement with the value measured for the broad component of the H$\alpha$, $2640^{+110}_{-90}$ km/s. Therefore, NGC7213 is the only Seyfert 1 galaxy whose iron K$\alpha$ line is unambiguously produced in the BLR. We also confirmed the presence of two ionised iron lines and studied them in greater detail than before. The resonant line is the dominant component in the Fe XXV triplet, therefore suggesting an origin in collisionally ionised gas. If this is the case, the blueshift of around 1000 km/s of the two ionised iron lines could be the first measure of the velocity of a starburst wind from its X-ray emission.
