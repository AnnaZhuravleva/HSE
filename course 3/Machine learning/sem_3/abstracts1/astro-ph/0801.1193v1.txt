Context: Galaxy metallicities have been measured to redshift z~2 by gas-phase oxygen abundances of the interstellar medium using the R23 and N2 methods. Galaxy stellar metallicities provide crucial data for chemical evolution models but have not been assessed reliably much outside the local Universe. Aims: We determine the iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at redshift z~2, observed as part of the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS). Methods: We compute the equivalent width of a rest-frame mid-ultraviolet, photospheric absorption-line index, the 1978 index found to vary monotonically with stellar metallicity by Rix and collaborators. We normalise and combine 75 SFG spectra from the GMASS survey to produce a spectrum corresponding to a total integration time 1652.5 hours (and a signal-to-noise ratio ~100 for our 1.5 angstrom binning) of FORS2 spectroscopic observations at the Very Large Telescope. Results: We measure an iron-abundance, stellar metallicity of log (Z/Zsolar) = -0.574+/-0.159 for our spectrum representative of a galaxy of stellar mass 9.4 x 10^9 Msolar assuming a Chabrier IMF. We find that the R04 model SFG spectrum for log (Z/Zsolar) = -0.699 solar metallicity provides the best description of our GMASS coadded spectrum. For similar galaxy stellar mass, our stellar metallicity is ~0.25 dex lower than the oxygen-abundance, gas-phase metallicity quantified by Erb and collaborators for UV-selected star-forming galaxies at z=2. Conclusions: We conclude that we are witnessing the establishment of a light-element overabundance in galaxies as they are being formed at redshift z~2. Our measurements are reminiscent of the alpha-element enhancement seen in low-redshift, galactic bulges and early-type galaxies. (Abridged)
