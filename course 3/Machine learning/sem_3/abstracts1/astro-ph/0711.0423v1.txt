Radiatively-driven transfer flow perpendicular to a luminous disk is examined in the relativistic regime of $(v/c)^2$, taking into account the gravity of the central object. The flow is assumed to be vertical, and the gas pressure as well as the magnetic field are ignored. Using a velocity-dependent variable Eddington factor, we can solve the rigorous equations of the relativistic radiative flow accelerated up to the {\it relativistic} speed. For sufficiently luminous cases, the flow resembles the case without gravity. For less-luminous or small initial radius cases, however, the flow velocity decreases due to gravity. Application to a supercritical accretion disk with mass loss is briefly discussed.
