We prescribe a pseudo-Newtonian vector potential for studying accretion disks around Kerr black holes. The potential is useful to study the inner properties of disk not confined to the equatorial plane where general relativistic effect is indispensable. Therefore, we incorporate the essential properties of the metric at the inner radii through the pseudo-Newtonian potential derived from the general Kerr spacetime. The potential, reproducing most of the salient features of the general-relativity, is valid for entire regime of Kerr parameter. It reproduces the last stable circular orbit exactly as that in the Kerr geometry. It also reproduces last bound orbit and energy at last stable circular orbit with a maximum error ~7% and ~15% respectively upto an orbital inclination 30 degree.
