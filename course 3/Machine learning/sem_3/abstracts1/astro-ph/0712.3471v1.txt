Cles is an evolution code recently developed to produce stellar models meeting the specific requirements of studies in asteroseismology. It offers the users a lot of choices in the input physics they want in their models and its versatility allows them to tailor the code to their needs and implement easily new features. We describe the features implemented in the current version of the code and the techniques used to solve the equations of stellar structure and evolution. A brief account is given of the use of the program and of a solar calibration realized with it.
