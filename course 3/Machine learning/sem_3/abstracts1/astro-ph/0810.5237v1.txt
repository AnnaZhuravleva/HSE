We calculate the structure properties of protoneutron star such as equation of state, maximum mass, radius and temperature profile using the lowest order constrained variational method. We show that the mass and radius of protoneutron star decrease by decreasing both entropy and temperature. For the protoneutron star, it is shown that the temperature is nearly constant in the core and drops rapidly near the crust.
