We investigate the age constraint on the agegraphic dark energy model by using two old galaxies (LBDS 53W091 and LBDS 53W069) and the old high redshift quasar APM 08279+5255. We find that the agegraphic dark energy model can easily accommodate LBDS 53W091 and LBDS 53W069. To accommodate APM 08279+5255, one can take the reduced Hubble parameter as large as h=0.64, when the fraction matter energy density $\Omega_{m0}\approx 0.22$.
