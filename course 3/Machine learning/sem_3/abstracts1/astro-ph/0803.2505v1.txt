In this paper we present a grid of stellar evolution models, computed with an up-to-date physical description of the internal structure, using the Code d'Evolution Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESAM). The evolutionary sequences span from the pre-main sequence to the beginning of the Red Giant Branch and cover an interval of mass typical for low and intermediate mass stars. The chemical composition (both helium and metal abundance) is the solar one. The frequencies of oscillation, computed for specific stellar models of the grid using the Porto Oscillations Code (POSC), are also provided.   This work was accomplished in order to support the preparation of the CoRoT mission within the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity (CoRoT/ESTA). On the other hand, the grid can also be used, more generally, to interpret the observational properties of either individual stars or stellar populations. The grids (data and documentation) can be found at http://www.astro.up.pt/corot/models/cesam
