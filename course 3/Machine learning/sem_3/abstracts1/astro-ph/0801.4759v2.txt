We show that Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) of known redshift and rest frame optical extinction detected by the Swift satellite fully confirm earlier results concerning the distribution of the optical afterglow luminosity at 12 hours after trigger (rest frame time). This distribution is bimodal and relatively narrow, especially for the high luminosity branch. This is intriguing, given that Swift GRBs have, on average, a redshift larger than pre-Swift ones, and is unexpected in the common scenario explaining the GRB afterglow. We investigate if the observed distribution can be the result of selection effects affecting a unimodal parent luminosity distribution, and find that either the distribution is intrinsically bimodal, or most (60 per cent) of the bursts are absorbed by a substantial amount of grey dust. In both cases we suggest that most dark bursts should belong to the underluminous optical family.
