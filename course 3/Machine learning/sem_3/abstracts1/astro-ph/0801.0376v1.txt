Studies in astroparticle physics are actively developed all over the world. It is clear that the effectiveness of the work depends strongly on the information exchange rate and on the overall coordination of this activity. An international forum, be it virtual, which can join all the groups and coordinate their efforts would give a boost to this cooperation. Particularly this is important for isolated scientific groups and scientists from small countries which can contribute a lot to this work being a part of the large international collaboration. Objectives, instruments and structure of proposed Virtual Instutute of Astroparticle Physics are discussed.
