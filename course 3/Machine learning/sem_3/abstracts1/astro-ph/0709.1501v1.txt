Spectra and light curves of SN 2006gz show the strongest signature of unburned carbon and one of the slowest fading light curves ever seen in a type Ia event (Delta m_15 = 0.69 +/- 0.04). The early-time Si II velocity is low, implying it was slowed by an envelope of unburned material. Our best estimate of the luminosity implies M_V = -19.74 and the production of ~ 1.2 M_sun of 56Ni. This suggests a super-Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. A double degenerate merger is consistent with these observations.
