We imaged the protostars of the nearby region NGC1333 IRAS 4 in the water maser line at 22.2 GHz by using the VLBA in phase referencing at milliarcsecond scale over four epochs spaced by one month to measure proper motions. We measure the absolute positions and proper motions of the H2O spots to investigate the kinematics of the region from where the jet is launched.   Two protostars (A2 and B) have been detected in a highly variable H2O maser emission, with an active phase shorter than four weeks. A 70 AU chain of several maser spots, very well aligned, has been observed close to the B protostar. The apparent proper motions have been derived, finding that the H2O spots are moving along the N-NW direction with projected velocities between 10 and 50 km/s. We conclude that in IRAS 4B, water maser trace a highly collimated bipolar jet clearly associated with the protostar.
