We introduce a modified version of a standard power spectrum `peak-bagging' technique which is designed to gain some of the advantages that fitting the entire low-degree p-mode power spectrum simultaneously would bring, but without the problems involved in fitting a model incorporating many hundreds of parameters. Employing Monte-Carlo simulations we show that by using this modified fitting code it is possible to determine the true background level in the vicinity of the p-mode peaks. In addition to this we show how small biases in other mode parameters, which are related to inaccurate estimates of the true background, are also consequently removed.
