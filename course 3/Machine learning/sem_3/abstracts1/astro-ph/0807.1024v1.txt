The Auger project was designed to study the high-energy cosmic rays by measuring the properties of the showers produced in the atmosphere. The Southern Auger Observatory has taken data since January 2004 and is now completed. Results on mass composition, energy spectrum and anisotropy of the arrival directions are presented together with upper limits on the neutrino fraction. The most important result is the recent observation of correlations with nearby extragalactic objects.
