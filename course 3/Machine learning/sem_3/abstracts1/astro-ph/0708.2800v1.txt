The existence of strong correlation between the peak luminosity (and/or bolometric energetics) of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) is one of the most intrigue problem of GRB physics. This correlation is not yet understood. Here we demonstrate that this correlation can be explained in framework of synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) mechanism of GRB prompt emission. We estimate the magnetic field strength of the central engine at the level $B\sim 10^{14} (10^3/\Gamma)^3 (1+z)^2$, where $\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of fireball.
