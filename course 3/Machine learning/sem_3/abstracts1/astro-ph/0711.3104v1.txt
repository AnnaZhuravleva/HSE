We report the analysis of the young star clusters NGC 1960, NGC 2453 and NGC 2384 observed in the $J$ (1.12 $\mu$m), $H$ (1.65 $\mu$m) and $K^{'}$ (2.2 $\mu$m) bands. Estimates of reddening, distance and age as $E(B-V)=0.25$, $d= 1380$ pc and $t=31.6$ to 125 Myr for NGC 1960, $E(B-V)=0.47$, $d=3311$ pc and $t=40$ to 200 Myr for NGC 2453 and $E(B-V)=0.25$, $d=3162$ pc and $t=55$ to 125 Myr for NGC 2384 have been obtained. Also, we have extended the color--magnitude diagrams of these clusters to the fainter end and thus extended the luminosity functions to fainter magnitudes. The evolution of the main sequence and luminosity functions of these clusters have been compared with themselves as well as Lyng\aa 2 and NGC 1582.
