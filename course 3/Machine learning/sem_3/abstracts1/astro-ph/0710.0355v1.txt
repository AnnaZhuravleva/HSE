An analytical approximation to periodic orbits in the circular restricted three-body problem is provided. The formulation given in this work is based in calculations known from classical mechanics, but with the addition of the necessary terms to give a fairly good approximation that we compare with simulations, resulting in a simple set of analytical expressions that solve periodic orbits on discs of binary systems without the need of solving the motion equations by numerical integrations.
