Observations of the ELAIS-N1 field taken at 610 MHz with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope are presented. Nineteen pointings were observed, covering a total area of 9 square degrees with a resolution of 6" x 5", PA +45 deg. Four of the pointings were deep observations with an rms of 40 microJy before primary beam correction, with the remaining fifteen pointings having an rms of 70 microJy. The techniques used for data reduction and production of a mosaicked image of the region are described, and the final mosaic is presented, along with a catalogue of 2500 sources detected above 6 sigma. This work complements the large amount of optical and infrared data already available on the region. We calculate 610-MHz source counts down to 270 microJy, and find further evidence for the turnover in differential number counts below 1 mJy, previously seen at both 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz.
