We present submillimeter observations of 12CO J=3-2 and J=2-1, and 13CO J = 2-1 lines of the Venusian mesosphere and lower thermosphere with the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (HHSMT) taken around the second MESSENGER flyby of Venus on 5 June 2007. The observations cover a range of Venus solar elongations with different fractional disk illuminations. Preliminary results like temperature and CO abundance profiles are presented.These data are part of a coordinated observational campaign in support of the ESA Venus Express mission. Furthermore, this study attempts to contribute to cross-calibrate space- and ground-based observations, to constrain radiative transfer and retrieval algorithms for planetary atmospheres, and to a more thorough understanding of the global patters of circulation of the Venusian atmosphere.
