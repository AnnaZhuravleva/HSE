Previous studies of the X-ray flux and spectral properties of 1RXS J170849-400910 showed hints of a possible correlation with the spin glitches that occurred in 1999 and 2001. However, due to the sparseness of spectral measurements and the paucity of detected glitches no firm conclusion could be drawn. We retrieved and analysed archival XTE pointings of 1RXS J170849-400910 covering the time interval between January 2003 and June 2006 and carried out a detailed timing analysis by means of phase fitting techniques. We detected two relatively large glitches Delta nu / nu of 1.2 and 2.1 10^-6 occurred in January and June 2005. Interestingly, the occurrence times of these glitches are in agreement with the predictions made in our previous studies. This finding strongly suggests a connection between the flux, spectral and timing properties of 1RXS J170849-400910.
