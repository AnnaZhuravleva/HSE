We present the analysis of 4.5 years of nearly continuous observations of the classical Cepheid Polaris, which comprise the most precise data available for this star. We have made spectroscopic measurements from ground and photometric measurements from the WIRE star tracker and the SMEI instrument on the Coriolis satellite. Measurements of the amplitude of the dominant oscillation (P = 4 days), that go back more than a century, show a decrease from 120 mmag to 30 mmag (V magnitude) around the turn of the millennium. It has been speculated that the reason for the decrease in amplitude is the evolution of Polaris towards the edge of the instability strip. However, our new data reveal an increase in the amplitude by about 30% from 2003-2006. It now appears that the amplitude change is cyclic rather than monotonic, and most likely the result of a pulsation phenomenon. In addition, previous radial velocity campaigns have claimed the detection of long-period variation in Polaris (P > 40 days). Our radial velocity data are more precise than previous datasets, and we find no evidence for additional variation for periods in the range 3-50 days with an upper limit of 100 m/s. However, in the WIRE data we find evidence of variation on time-scales of 2-6 days, which we interpret as being due to granulation.
