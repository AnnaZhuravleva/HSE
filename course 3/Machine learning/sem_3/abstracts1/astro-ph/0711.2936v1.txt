We give a gravitational upper limit for the mass of static degenerate fermionic dark matter objects. The treatment we use includes fully relativistic equations for describing the static solutions of these objects. We study the influence of the annihilation of the particles on this mass limit. We give the change of its value over the age of the Universe with annihilation cross sections relevant for such fermions constituting the dark matter. Our calculations take into account the possibility of Dirac as well Majorana spinors.
