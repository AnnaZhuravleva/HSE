These notes provide an introduction to the theory of the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. Topics covered include the structure, evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks; the formation of planetesimals, terrestrial and gas giant planets; and orbital evolution due to gas disk migration, planetesimal scattering, planet-planet interactions, and tides.
