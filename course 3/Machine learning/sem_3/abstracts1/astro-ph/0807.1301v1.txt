We analyze the data of Kamiokande-II, IMB, Baksan using a parameterized description of the antineutrino emission, that includes an initial phase of intense luminosity. The luminosity curve, the average energy of $\bar\nu_e$ and the astrophysical parameters of the model, derived by fitting the observed events (energies, times and angles) are in reasonable agreement with the generic expectations of the delayed scenario for the explosion.
