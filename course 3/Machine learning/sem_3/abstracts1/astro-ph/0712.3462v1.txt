Atutov and Shalagin (1988) proposed light-induced drift (LID) as a physically well understandable mechanism to explain the formation of isotopic anomalies observed in CP stars. We generalized the theory of LID and applied it to diffusion of heavy elements and their isotopes in quiescent atmospheres of CP stars. Diffusional segregation of isotopes of chemical elements is described by the equations of continuity and diffusion velocity. Computations of the evolutionary sequences for abundances of mercury isotopes in several model atmospheres have been made using the Fortran 90 program SMART, composed by the authors. Results confirm predominant role of LID in separation of isotopes.
