In the context of dwarf spheroidal galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine Blue Stragglers (BSS) population from a normal young main (MS) sequence. This difficulty is persistent. For a sample of 9 non-star forming Local Group dwarf galaxies we compute the ``BSS frequency'' and compare it with that found in the Milky Way globular/open clusters and halo. The comparison shows that the BSS-frequency in dwarf galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of similar luminosities. Moreover, the estimated BSS-frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo and open clusters. We conclude that the low density, almost collision-less environment, of our dwarf galaxy sample point to their very low dynamical evolution and consequent negligible production of collisional BSS.
