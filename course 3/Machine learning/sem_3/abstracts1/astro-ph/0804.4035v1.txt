We describe observations with the Mopra radiotelescope designed to assess the feasibility of the H$_2$O maser southern Galactic plane survey (HOPS). We mapped two one-square-degree regions along the Galactic plane using the new 12 mm receiver and the UNSW Mopra spectrometer (MOPS). We covered the entire spectrum between 19.5 and 27.5 GHz using this setup with the main aims of finding out which spectral lines can be detected with a quick mapping survey. We report on detected emission from H$_2$O masers, NH$_3$ inversion transitions (1,1), (2,2) and (3,3), HC$_3$N (3-2), as well as several radio recombination lines.
