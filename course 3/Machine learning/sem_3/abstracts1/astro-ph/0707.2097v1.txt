In this work we investigate the evolution of matter density perturbations for quintessence models with a self-interaction potential that is a combination of exponentials. One of the models is based on the Einstein theory of gravity, while the other is based on the Brans-Dicke scalar tensor theory. We constrain the parameter space of the models using the determinations for the growth rate of perturbations derived from data of the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey.
