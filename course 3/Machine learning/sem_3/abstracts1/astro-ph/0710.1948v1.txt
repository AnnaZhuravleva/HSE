The primary proton spectrum up to 100 TeV has been investigated by balloon- and satellite-borne instruments. Above this energy range only ground-based air shower arrays can measure the cosmic ray spectrum with a technique moderately sensitive to nuclear composition. An array which exploits the full coverage approach at very high altitude can achieve an energy threshold well below the TeV region, thus allowing, in principle, the inter-calibration of the measured proton content in the primary cosmic ray flux with the existing direct measurements from balloons/satellites.   The capability of the ARGO-YBJ experiment, located at the YangBaJing Cosmic Ray Laboratory (4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, P.R. China), in selecting the surviving primary cosmic ray protons is discussed. A procedure looking for quasi-unaccompanied events with a very steep lateral distribution is also presented.
