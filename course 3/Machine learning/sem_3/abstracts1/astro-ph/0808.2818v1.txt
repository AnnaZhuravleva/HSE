The lithium problem arises from the significant discrepancy between the primordial 7Li abundance as predicted by BBN theory and the WMAP baryon density, and the pre-Galactic lithium abundance inferred from observations of metal-poor (Population II) stars. This problem has loomed for the past decade, with a persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2--3 in 7Li/H. Recent developments have sharpened all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory predictions have sharpened due to new nuclear data, particularly the uncertainty on 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be, has reduced to 7.4%, and with a central value shift of ~ +0.04 keV barn. (2) The WMAP 5-year data now yields a cosmic baryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7%. (3) Observations of metal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects, and have reaped new lithium isotopic data. With these, we now find that the BBN+WMAP predicts 7Li/H = (5.24+0.71-0.67) 10^{-10}. The Li problem remains and indeed is exacerbated; the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4--4.3 or 4.2sigma (from globular cluster stars) to 5.3sigma (from halo field stars). Possible resolutions to the lithium problem are briefly reviewed, and key nuclear, particle, and astronomical measurements highlighted.
