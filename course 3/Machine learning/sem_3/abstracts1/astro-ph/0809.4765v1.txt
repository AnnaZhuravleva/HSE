High resolution observations of solar filaments suggest the presence of groups of prominence threads, i.e. the fine-structures of prominences, which oscillate coherently (in phase). In addition, mass flows along threads have been often observed. Here, we investigate the effect of mass flows on the collective fast and slow nonadiabatic magnetoacoustic wave modes supported by systems of prominence threads. Prominence fine-structures are modeled as parallel, homogeneous and infinite cylinders embedded in a coronal environment. The magnetic field is uniform and parallel to the axis of threads. Configurations of identical and nonidentical threads are both explored. We apply the T-matrix theory of acoustic scattering to obtain the oscillatory frequency and the eigenfunctions of linear magnetosonic disturbances. We find that the existence of wave modes with a collective dynamics, i.e. those that produce significant perturbations in all threads, is only possible when the Doppler-shifted individual frequencies of threads are very similar. This can be only achieved for very particular values of the plasma physical conditions and flow velocities within threads.
