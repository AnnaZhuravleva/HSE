Magnetowave induced plasma wakefield acceleration (MPWA) in a relativistic astrophysical outflow has been proposed as a viable mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic particles to ultra high energies. Here we present simulation results that demonstrate the viability of this mechanism. We invoke the high frequency and high speed whistler mode for the driving pulse. The plasma wakefield so induced validates precisely the theoretical prediction. This mechanism is shown capable of accelerating charged particles to ZeV energies in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
