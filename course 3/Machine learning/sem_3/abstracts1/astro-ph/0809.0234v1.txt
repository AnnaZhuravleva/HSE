The $^{92}$Mo($\alpha,n$)$^{95}$Ru, $^{94}$Mo($\alpha,n$)$^{97}$Ru, and $^{112}$Sn($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{116}$Te cross sections were measured at the upper end of the $p$-process Gamow window between 8.2 MeV and 11.1 MeV. Our results are slightly lower than global Hauser-Feshbach calculations from the code NON-SMOKER, but still within the uncertainty of the prediction. The $^{112}$Sn($\alpha,\gamma$)$^{116}$Te cross section agrees well with a recently measured thick-target cross section in the same energy range. For the $^{92,94}$Mo($\alpha,n$) reactions the present data close to the reaction thresholds could eliminate previous uncertainties within a factor of 20, and we can present now useful comparisons to statistical model calculations with different optical potentials.
