The set of equations for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in a shear flow is consecutively derived. The proposed scenario involves the presence of a self-sustained turbulence and magnetic field. In the framework of Langevin--Burgers approach the influence of the turbulence is described by an additional external random force in the MHD system. Kinetic equation for the spectral density of the slow magnetosonic (Alfvenic) mode is derived in the short wavelength (WKB) approximation. The results show a pressing need for conduction of numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a random driver to take into account the influence of the long wavelength modes and to give a more precise analytical assessment of the short ones. Realistic MC calculations for the heating rate and shear stress tensor should give an answer to the perplexing problem for the missing viscosity in accretion disks and reveal why the quasars are the most powerful sources of light in the universe. The planned MC calculations can be incorporated in global models for accretion disks and also in all other physical conditions where there is a shear flow in a magnetized turbulent plasma. It is supposed that the heating mechanism by Alfven waves absorption is common for many kinds of space plasmas from solar corona to active galactic nuclei and the solution of these longstanding puzzles deserves active interdisciplinary research. The work is illustrated by numerical calculations and by exact solutions for the time dependence of the magnetic field given by the Heun function.
