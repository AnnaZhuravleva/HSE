We introduce the main lines and specificities of the CoRoT Seismology Core Programme. The development and consolidation of this programme has been made in the framework of the CoRoT Seismology Working Group. With a few illustrative examples, we show how CoRoT data will help to address various problems associated with present open questions of stellar structure and evolution.
