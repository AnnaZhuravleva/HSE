A Fourier analysis on galaxy number counts from redshift data of both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey indicates that galaxies have preferred periodic redshift spacings of $\Delta z =$ 0.0102, 0.0246, and 0.0448 in the SDSS and strong agreement with the results from the 2dF GRS. The redshift spacings are confirmed by the mass density fluctuations, the power spectrum $P(z)$ and $N_{pairs}$ calculations. Application of the Hubble law results in galaxies preferentially located on co-moving concentric shells with periodic spacings. The combined results from both surveys indicate regular co-moving radial distance spacings of $31.7 \pm 1.8$ $h^{-1} Mpc$, $73.4 \pm 5.8$ $h^{-1} Mpc$ and $127 \pm 21$ $h^{-1} Mpc$. The results are consistent with oscillations in the expansion rate of the universe over past epochs.
