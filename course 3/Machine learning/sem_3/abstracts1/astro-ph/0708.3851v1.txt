Characterizing multiplicity in the very low mass (VLM) domain is a topic of much current interest and fundamental importance. Here we report on a near-IR AO imaging survey of 31 young brown dwarfs and VLM stars, 28 of which are in Chamaeleon I, using the ESO VLT. Our survey is sensitive enough to detect equal mass binaries down to separations of 0.04-0.07" (6-10 AU at 160 pc) and, typically, companions with mass ratios as low as 0.2 outside of 0.2" (~30 AU). We resolve the suspected 0.16" (~26 AU) binary Cha_Halpha 2 and present two new binaries, Hn 13 and CHXR 15, with separations of 0.13" (~20 AU) and 0.30" (~50 AU); the latter is one of the widest VLM systems discovered to date. We do not find companions around the majority of our targets, giving a binary frequency of 11% [+9,-6], thus confirming the trend for a lower binary frequency with decreasing mass. By combining our work with previous surveys, we arrive at the largest sample of young VLMOs (72) with high angular resolution imaging to date. Its multiplicity fraction is in statistical agreement with that for VLMOs in the field. In addition we note that many field stellar binaries with lower binding energies and/or wider cross sections have survived dynamical evolution and that statistical models suggest tidal disruption by passing stars is unlikely to affect the binary properties of our systems. Thus, we argue that there is no significant evolution of multiplicity with age among brown dwarfs and VLM stars in OB and T associations between a few Myr to several Gyr. Instead, the observations to date suggest that VLM objects are either less likely to be born in fragile multiple systems than solar mass stars or such systems are disrupted very early.
