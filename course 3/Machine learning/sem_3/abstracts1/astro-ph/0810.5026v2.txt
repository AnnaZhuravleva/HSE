We present quasi-simultaneous, multi-frequency VLA observations at 4.8, 8.4, and 22.5 GHz, of a sample of 13 Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, aimed at disentangling the nature of their radio emission and the possible detection of a non-thermal behavior in close binary systems. We detected 12 stars from our sample, for which we derived spectral information and estimated their mass loss rates. From our data, we identified four thermal sources (WR 89, 113, 138, and 141), and three sources with a composite spectrum (similar contribution of thermal and non-thermal emission; WR 8, 98, and 156). On the other hand, from the comparison with previous observations, we confirm the non-thermal spectrum of one (WR 105), and also found evidence of a composite spectrum for WR 79a, 98a, 104, and 133. Finally, we discuss the possible scenarios to explain the nature of the emission for the observed objects.
