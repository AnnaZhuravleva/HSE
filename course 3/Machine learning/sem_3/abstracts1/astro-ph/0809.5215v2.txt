The aim of our paper is to make high-precision positional stellar catalogs by compiling large astrophysical data bulk and large astrometrical surveys. The data reliability and uniqueness is the primary request. The common precision of 1 arc sec in coordinates is insufficient now to guarantee the simple identification of stars. Therefore the technique of catalogs verification become relevant. The paper presents the outcome of stars identification in The Henry Draper Extension Charts catalog and Variable stars catalog using proper method. Examples of conflicts permission concerning doubles and multiples stars in astrophysical catalogs are discussed.
