We show that the properties of gamma ray burst 080319B and its afterglow are well reproduced by the cannonball model of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs). It was an ordinary GRB, produced by a jet of highly relativistic plasmoids (CBs), ejected in a core-collapse supernova (SN) and viewed, as some others before, particularly close to the CB-emission axis. It still remains to be seen whether GRB 080319B was associated with an SN akin to SN1998bw, the SN type ordinarily associated with GRBs, or with a much more luminous SN.
