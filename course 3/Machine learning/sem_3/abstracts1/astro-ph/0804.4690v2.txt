We study the radial distribution of supernova Ia (SNe Ia) in morphologically selected early-type host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and discuss its implications for the progenitor systems of SNe Ia. While new observations of early-type galaxies suggest that they contain small fractions of young stellar populations, they are also the most likely hosts for long time delay SNe Ia. We find that there is no statistically significant difference between the radial distribution of SNe Ia and the light profile of their early-type host galaxies, which are dominated by old, metal-rich stellar populations. This confirms the commonly accepted idea that some SN Ia progenitors have time delays of the order of several Gyr.
