Context: We present the results of an extensive ground-based photometric and spectroscopic campaign on the gamma Dor CoRoT target HD49434. This campaign was preparatory to the CoRoT satellite observations, which took place from October 2007 to March 2008. Results: The frequency analysis clearly shows the presence of four frequencies in the 0.2-1.7 c/d interval, as well as six frequencies in the 5-12 c/d domain. The low frequencies are typical for gamma Dor variables while the high frequencies are common for delta Sct pulsators. We propose the frequency 2.666 c/d as a possible rotational frequency. All modes, for which an identification was possible, seem to be high-degree modes (3 <= l <= 8). We did not find evidence for a possible binary nature of HD49434. The element abundances we derived are consistent with the values obtained in previous analyses. Conclusions: We classify the gamma Dor star HD49434 as a hybrid pulsator, which pulsates simultaneously in p- and g-modes. This finding makes HD49434 an extremely interesting target for asteroseismic modelling. Observations: Based on observations made with the 2.2m ESO/MPI telescope at the La Silla Observatory under the ESO Large Programme: LP178.D-0361. Also based on observations obtained at Observatorio de Sierra Nevada (Spain), at the Centro Astronomico Hispano Aleman at Calar Alto (Spain), at Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir (Mexico), at the Piszkesteto Mountain Station of Konkoly Observatory (Hungary), at Observatoire de Haute Provence (France) and at Mount John University Observatory (New Zealand).
