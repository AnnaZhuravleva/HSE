Adopting a distance for RS Pup derived from a period-luminosity relation based on Cepheid parallaxes, it is shown that the phase-lag observations of the surrounding nebulosity by Kervella et al. are well fitted by a model of an equatorial disc at an angle of 8.1 $\pm$ 0.6 degrees to the plane of the sky. The astrophysical implications of this are briefly mentioned.
