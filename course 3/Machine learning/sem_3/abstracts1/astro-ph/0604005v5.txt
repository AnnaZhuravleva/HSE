The main aim of this paper is to extend the early approach to quantum cosmogenesis provided by Fomin. His approach was developed independently to the well-known Tryon description of the creation of the closed universe as a process of quantum fluctuation of vacuum. We apply the Fomin concept to derive the cosmological observables. We argue that Fomin's idea from his 1973 work, in contrast to Tryon's one has impact on the current Universe models and the proposed extension of his theory now can be tested by distant supernovae SNIa. Fomin's idea of the creation of the Universe is based on the intersection of two fundamental theories: general relativity and quantum field theory with the contemporary cosmological models with dark energy. As a result of comparison with contemporary approaches concerning dark energy, we found out that Fomin's idea appears in the context of the present acceleration of the Universe explanation: cosmological models with decaying vacuum. Contemporary it appears in the form of Ricci scalar dark energy connected with the holographic principle. We show also that the Fomin model admits the bounce instead of the initial singularity. We demonstrate that the Fomin model of cosmogenesis can be falsified and using SNIa data the values of model parameters is in agreement with observations.
