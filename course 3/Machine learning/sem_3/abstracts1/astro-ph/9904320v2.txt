Eliptical and bulge galaxies share a tight correlation of velocity distribution to both luminosity and black hole mass. There are similar orbital speeds for all galaxies of a given luminosity including dark matter (DM) at large radii. The halo surface density of DM is constant for almost all types of galaxies and ranges 14 mag. down to dwarf spherical galaxies. There are supermassive black holes or giant, pure disk galaxies at high redshift inexplicable with hierarchical clustering or collapse dynamics. These and a myriad of other galaxy formation problems are explainable by an initial shell which caused the Planck cosmic microwave background radiation. A reduction in the energy-density of primordial galactic black holes is necessary to explain dark energy.
