For Seyfert galaxies, the AGN unification model provides a simple and well established explanation of the Type 1/Type 2 dichotomy through orientation based effects. The generalization of this unification model to the higher luminosity AGNs that are the quasars remains a key question. The recent detection of Type 2 Radio-Quiet quasars seems to support such an extension. We propose to further test this scenario.   On the basis of a compilation of quasar host galaxy position angles consisting of previously published data and of new measurements performed using HST Archive images, we investigate the possible existence of a correlation between the linear polarization position angle and the host galaxy/extended emission position angle of quasars.   We find that the orientation of the rest-frame UV/blue extended emission is correlated to the direction of the quasar polarization. For Type 1 quasars, the polarization is aligned with the extended UV/blue emission while these two quantities are perpendicular in Type 2 objects. This result is independent of the quasar radio-loudness. We interpret this (anti-)alignment effect in terms of scattering in a two-component polar+equatorial model which applies to both Type 1 and Type 2 objects. Moreover the orientation of the polarization -and then of the UV/blue scattered light- does not appear correlated to the major axis of the stellar component of the host galaxy measured from near-IR images.
