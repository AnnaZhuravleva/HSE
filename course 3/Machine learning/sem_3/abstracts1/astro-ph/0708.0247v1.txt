The instability of dark matter may produce visible signals in the spectrum of cosmic gamma-rays. We consider this possibility in frameworks with additional spatial dimensions and supersymmetry. Examples of particles include superweakly-interacting massive particles such as gravitinos in supersymmetry models, the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) state in models with universal extra dimensions, and weakly-interacting massive particles such as branons in flexible brane-worlds.
