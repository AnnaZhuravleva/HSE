The Swift/XRT data of 179 GRBs (from 050124 to 070129) and the optical afterglow data of 57 pre- and post-Swift GRBs are analyzed, in order to systematically investigate the jet-like breaks in the X-ray and optical afterglow lightcurves. We find that not a single burst can be included in the ``Platinum'' sample, in which the data satisfy all the criteria of a jet break. By releasing one or more requirements to define a jet break, some candidates of various degrees could be identified. In the X-ray band, 42 out of the 103 well-sampled X-ray lightcurves have a decay slope of the post-break segment >1.5 (``Bronze'' sample), and 27 of them also satisfy the closure relations of the forward models (``Silver'' sample). The numbers of the ``Bronze'' and ``Silver'' candidates in the optical lightcurves are 27 and 23, respectively. Thirteen bursts have well-sampled optical and X-ray lightcurves, but only seven cases are consistent with an achromatic break, but even in these cases only one band satisfies the closure relations (``Gold'' sample). The observed break time in the XRT lightcurves is systematically earlier than that in the optical bands. All these raise great concerns in interpreting the jet-like breaks as jet breaks and further inferring GRB energetics from these breaks. By assuming that these breaks are jet breaks, we perform a similar analysis as previous work to calculate the jet opening angle (theta_j) and energetics (E_k) with the ``Silver'' and ``Gold'' jet break candidates. The derived E_K distribution reveals a much larger scatter than the pre-Swift sample. A tentative anti-correlation between theta_j and E_{K,iso} is found for both the pre-Swift and Swift GRBs, indicating that the E_K could still be quasi-universal, if the breaks in discussion are indeed jet breaks(abridge).
