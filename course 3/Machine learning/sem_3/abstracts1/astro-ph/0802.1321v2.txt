[Abridged] We describe the near-infrared reddening signature of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in external galaxies. In particular, we examine the E(J-H) and E(H-K) color-excesses, and the effective extinction law observed in discrete GMC regions. We also study the effect of the relative scale height of the GMC distribution to the color-excesses, and to the observed mass function of GMCs. We perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations with 3D models of stellar radiation and clumpy dust distributions, resembling a face-on geometry. The scattered light is included in the models, and near-infrared color maps are calculated from the simulated data. The effective near-infrared reddening law, i.e. the ratio E(J-H)/E(H-K), has a value close to unity in GMC regions. The ratio depends on the relative scale height of GMCs, xi, and for xi values 0.1...0.75 we find the typical ratios of 0.6...1.1. The effective extinction law turns out to be very flat in GMC regions. We find the ratios of apparent extinctions of A(H)/A(K)=1.35...1.55 and A(J)/A(H)=1.15. The effect of the scattered flux on the effective reddening law, as well as on the effective extinction law, is significant. Regarding the GMC mass function, we find no correlation between the input and observed slopes of the mass functions. Rather, the observed slope reflects the parameter $\xi$ and the dynamical range of the mass function. We estimate that only a fraction of 10...20 % of the total mass of GMCs is recovered, if the observed color-excess values are transformed to masses using the Galactic reddening law. In the case of individual clouds the fraction can vary between ~0...50 %.
