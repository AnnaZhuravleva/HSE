We have used the VIMOS IFU to map the properties of the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy LEDA 135736. These maps reveal a number of interesting features including: an Extended Narrow Line Region detectable out to 9 kpc, an area of intense star formation located at a projected distance of 12 kpc from the centre, an elliptical companion galaxy, and kinematic features, aligned along the long-axis of the ENLR, that are consistent with radio jet-driven mass outflow. We propose that the ENLR results from extra-planar gas ionized by the AGN, and that the AGN in turn might be triggered by interaction with the companion galaxy, which can also explain the burst of star formation and morphological features. Only about two percent of the ENLR's kinetic energy is in the mass outflow. We infer from this that the bulk of mechanical energy imparted by the jet is used to heat this gas.
