Concentrations of molecular hydrogen (H2) have been detected by SUMER in active region plage. The H2 is excited by O VI line emission at 1031.94 A which, although not observed, must be brightening along with the observed transition region line, Si III 1113.24 A. We have made co-ordinated observations of active region plage with the spectrometer SUMER/SoHO in lines of H2 1119.10 A and Si III 1113.24 A and with XRT/Hinode X-ray and SOT/Hinode Ca II filters. In six hours of observation, six of the seven H2 events seen occurred near a footpoint of a brightening X-ray loop. The seventh is associated with an unusually strong Si III plasma outflow. We conclude that microflare energy dissipation heats the chromosphere, reducing its opacity, so that O VI microflare emission is able to reach the lower layers of the chromosphere and excite the H2.
