The On-The-Fly (OTF) imaging technique enables single-dish radio telescopes to construct images of small areas of the sky with greater efficiency and accuracy. This paper describes the practical application of the OTF imaging technique. By way of example the implementation of the OTF imaging technique at the NRAO 12 Meter Telescope is described. Specific requirements for data sampling, image formation, and Doppler correction are discussed.
