We present multi-waveband optical imaging data obtained from observations of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS). The survey field, centered at R.A.=02:18:00, decl.=-05:00:00, has been the focus of a wide range of multi-wavelength observing programs spanning from X-ray to radio wavelengths. A large part of the optical imaging observations are carried out with Suprime-Cam on Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea in the course of Subaru Telescope Observatory Projects. This paper describes our optical observations, data reduction and analysis procedures employed, and the characteristics of the data products. A total area of 1.22 sqdeg is covered in five contiguous sub-fields, each of which corresponds to a single Suprime-Cam field of view (34'x27'), in five broad-band filters B, V, Rc, i', z' to the depths of B=28.4, V=27.8, Rc=27.7, i'=27.7 and z'=26.6 (AB, 3-sigma, 2-arcsec aperture). The data are reduced and compiled into five multi-waveband photometric catalogs, separately for each Suprime-Cam pointing. The i'-band catalogs contain about 900,000 objects, making the SXDS catalogs one of the largest multi-waveband catalogs in corresponding depth and area coverage. The SXDS catalogs can be used for an extensive range of astronomical applications such as the number density of the Galactic halo stars to the large scale structures at the distant universe. The number counts of galaxies are derived and compared with those of existing deep extragalactic surveys. The optical data, the source catalogs, and configuration files used to create the catalogs are publicly available via the SXDS web page (http://www.naoj.org/Science/SubaruProject/SXDS/index.html)
