A fine structure related to the kinematic peculiarities of three components of the Scorpius-Centaurus association (LCC, UCL, and US) has been revealed in the UV-velocity distribution of Gould Belt stars. We have been able to identify the most likely members of these groups by applying the method of analyzing the two-dimensional probability density function of stellar UV velocities that we developed. A kinematic analysis of the identified structural components has shown that, in general, the center--of--mass motion of the LCC, UCL, and US groups follows the motion characteristic of the Gould Belt, notably its expansion. The entire Scorpius-Centaurus complex is shown to possess a proper expansion with an angular velocity parameter of 46+-8 km/s/kpc for the kinematic center with lo=-40 degrees and Ro=110 pc found. Based on this velocity, we have estimated the characteristic expansion time of the complex to be 21+-4 Myr. The proper rotation velocity of the Scorpius-Centaurus complex is lower in magnitude, is determined less reliably, and depends markedly on the data quality.
