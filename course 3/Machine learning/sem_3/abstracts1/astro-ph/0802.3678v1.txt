We present a preliminary study of the star formation distribution within three Virgo Cluster galaxies using the 24 micron Spitzer observations from the Spitzer Survey of Virgo (SPITSOV) in combination with H-alpha observations. The purpose of our study is to explore the relationship between the star formation distribution within galaxies and the type (and phase) of interactions experienced within the cluster environment. Neither highly-obscured star formation nor strongly enhanced star-forming regions along the leading edges of galaxies experiencing ICM-ISM interactions were found. However, very unobscured star-forming regions were found in the outer parts of one galaxy (NGC 4402), while relatively obscured star-forming regions were found in the extraplanar regions of another galaxy (NGC 4522). We attribute the observed differences between NGC 4402 and NGC 4522 to the direction of motion of each galaxy through the ICM.
