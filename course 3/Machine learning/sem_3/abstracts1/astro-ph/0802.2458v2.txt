We derive the properties of dusty tori in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the comparison of observed Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of SDSS quasars and a precomputed grid of torus models. The observed SEDs comprise SDSS photometry, 2MASS J, H, and K data, whenever available and mid-Infrared (MIR) data from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic (SWIRE) Survey. The adopted model is that of Fritz et al., 2006. The fit is performed by standard chi^2 minimisation, the model however can be multi-component comprising a stellar and a starburst components, whenever necessary. Models with low equatorial optical depth, tau_9.7, were allowed as well as ``traditional'' models with tau_9.7 > 1.0, corresponding to A_V > 22 and the results were compared. Fits using high optical depth tori models only produced dust more compactly distributed than in the configuration where all tau_9.7 models were permitted. Tori with decreasing dust density with the distance from the centre were favoured while there was no clear preference for models with or without angular variation of the dust density. The computed outer radii of the tori are of some tens of parsecs large but can reach, in a few cases, a few hundreds of parsecs. The mass of dust, M_Dust, and infrared luminosity, L_IR, integrated in the wavelength range between 1 and 1000 micron, do not show significant variations with redshift, once the observational biases are taken into account. Objects with 70 micron detections, representing 25% of the sample, are studied separately and the starburst contribution (whenever present) to the IR luminosity can reach, in the most extreme but very few cases, 80%.
