An updated catalogue of 76 galaxies with direct supermassive black hole mass measurements (M_bh) plus, when available, their host bulge's central velocity dispersion (sigma_0) is provided. Fifty of these mass measurements are considered reliable, while the others remain somewhat uncertain at this time. An additional eight stellar systems, including one stellar cluster and three globular clusters, are listed as hosting potential intermediate mass black holes < 10^6 M_solar.   With this larger data set, the demographics within the M_bh-sigma_0 diagram are briefly explored. Many barred galaxies are shown to be offset from the M_bh-sigma_0 relation defined by the non-barred galaxies, in the sense that their velocity dispersions are too high. Furthermore, including 88 AGN with black hole mass estimates from reverberation mapping studies, we speculate that barred AGN may follow this same general trend. We also show that some AGN with sigma_0 < 100 km/s tend to reside up to 0.6 dex above the "barless" M_bh-sigma_0 relation. Finally, it is shown that ``core galaxies'' appear not to define an additional subdivision of the M_bh-sigma_0 diagram, although improved methods for measuring sigma_0-values will be valuable.
