(abridged) We study a previously discovered protostellar source that is deeply embedded and drives an energetic molecular outflow. The source, UYSO1, is located close to IRAS 07029-1215 at a distance of ~1 kpc. The multi-wavelength observations resulted in the detection of a double intermediate-mass protostar at the location of UYSO1. In addition to the associated molecular outflow, with a projected size of 0.25 pc, two intersecting near-infrared jets with projected sizes of 0.4 pc and 0.2 pc were found. However, no infrared counterparts to the driving sources could be detected in sensitive near- to far-infrared observations. In interferometric millimeter observations, UYSO1 was resolved into two continuum sources with high column densities and gas masses of 3.5 Mo and 1.2 Mo, with a linear separation of 4200 AU. We report the discovery of a H2O maser toward one of the two sources. The total luminosity is roughly estimated to be ~50 Lo, shared by the two components, one of which is driving the molecular outflow that has a dynamical timescale of less than a few thousand years. The jets of the two individual components are not aligned. Submillimeter observations show that the region lacks typical hot-core chemistry. We thus find two protostellar objects, whose associated circumstellar and parent core masses are high enough to suggest that they may evolve into intermediate-mass stars. This is corroborated by their association with a very massive and energetic CO outflow, suggesting high protostellar accretion rates. The short dynamical timescale of the outflow, the pristine chemical composition of the cloud core and absence of hot core tracers, the absence of detectable radio continuum emission, and the very low protostellar luminosity argue for an extremely early evolutionary stage.
