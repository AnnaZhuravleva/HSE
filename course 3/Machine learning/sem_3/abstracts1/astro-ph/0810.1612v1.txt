A strict lower limit flux for the extragalactic background light from ultraviolet to the far-infrared photon energies is presented. The spectral energy distribution is derived using an established EBL model based on galaxy formation. The model parameters are chosen to fit the lower limit data from number count observations in particular recent results by the SPITZER infrared space telescope. A lower limit EBL model is needed to calculate guaranteed absorption due to pair production in extragalactic gamma-ray sources as in TeV blazars.
