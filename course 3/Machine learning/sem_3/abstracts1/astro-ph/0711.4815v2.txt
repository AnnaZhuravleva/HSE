Jet-induced supernovae (SNe) have been suggested to occur in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and highly-energetic SNe (hypernovae). I investigate hydrodynamical and nucleosynthetic properties of the jet-induced explosion of a population III $40_\odot$ star with a two-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamical code. The abundance distribution after the explosion and the angular dependence of the yield are obtained for the models with high and low energy deposition rates $\dot{E}_{\rm dep}=120\times10^{51} {\rm ergs s^{-1}}$ and $1.5\times10^{51} {\rm ergs s^{-1}}$. The ejection of Fe-peak products and the fallback of unprocessed materials in the jet-induced SNe account for the abundance patterns of the extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. It is also found that the peculiar abundance pattern of a Si-deficient metal-poor star HE 1424--0241 is reproduced by the angle-delimited yield for $\theta=30^\circ-35^\circ$ of the model with $\dot{E}_{\rm dep}=120\times10^{51} {\rm ergs s^{-1}}$. Furthermore, I compare the yield of the jet-induced explosion with that of the spherical explosion and confirm the ejection and fallback in the jet-induced explosion is almost equivalent to the "mixing-fallback" in spherical explosions. In contrast to the spherical models, however, the high-entropy environment is realized in the jet-induced explosion and thus [(Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Zn)/Fe] are enhanced. The enhancements of [Sc/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] improve agreements with the abundance patterns of the EMP stars.
