An increasing number of photometric observations of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters is seriously challenging the paradigm of GCs hosting single, simple stellar populations. These multiple populations manifest themselves in a split of some evolutionary sequences of the cluster color-magnitude diagrams. In this paper we will summarize the observational scenario.
