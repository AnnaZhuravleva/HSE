Spectroscopic studies of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) and H {\sc ii} regions have driven much development in atomic physics. In the last few years the combination of a generation of powerful observatories, the development of ever more sophisticated spectral modeling codes, and large efforts on mass production of high quality atomic data have led to important progress in our understanding of the atomic spectra of such astronomical objects. In this paper I review such progress, including evaluations of atomic data by comparisons with nebular spectra, detection of spectral lines from most iron-peak elements and n-capture elements, observations of hyperfine emission lines and analysis of isotopic abundances, fluorescent processes, and new techniques for diagnosing physical conditions based on recombination spectra. The review is directed toward atomic physicists and spectroscopists trying to establish the current status of the atomic data and models and to know the main standing issues.
