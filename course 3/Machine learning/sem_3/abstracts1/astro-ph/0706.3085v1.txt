Two sets of high-resolution spectra of R CrB obtained during the 2003 light decline are described. The first set was obtained on the descending branch of the light curve when V ~12.0 and the second one in the recovery phase with V ~7.5. The usual sharp and broad emissions are described and the lines radial velocities measured. C_2 Swan system (0,0) band was found to be in emission for the first set. The other C_2 bands were in absorption. Few CN red system (5,1) band rotational lines and low excitation FeI lines were in absorption. A table with measured radial velocities of various spectral features is presented.
