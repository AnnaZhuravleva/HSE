The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) will be a powerful instrument for performing large-scale surveys of galaxies. Its frequency range and large field of view makes it especially useful for an all-sky survey of Local Volume galaxies, and will probably increase the number of known galaxies closer than 10 Mpc by a factor of two and increase, by at least an order of magnitude, the number detected in HI. Implications for our knowledge of the HI mass function for the very faintest galaxies and for the structure and dynamics of the Local Volume are discussed.
