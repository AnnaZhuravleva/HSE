A generic consequence of supersymmetry is formation of a scalar condensate along the flat directions of the potential at the end of cosmological inflation. This condensate is usually unstable, and it can fragment into non-topological solitons, Q-balls. The gravitational waves produced by the fragmentation can be detected by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and Big Bang Observer (BBO), which can offer an important window on the early universe and the physics at some very high energy scales.
