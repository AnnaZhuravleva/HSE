abridged) In this paper we present new redshifts for 747 galaxies in 23 ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) cluster fields. We use the "gap"-technique to search for significant overdensities in redshift space for identifying groups/clusters of galaxies. In this way we spectroscopically confirm systems in 10 of the 23 cluster candidate fields with a matched-filter estimated redshift z_MF=0.3-0.4 and with spectroscopic redshifts in the range from z=0.158 to z=0.534. We find that the systems identified in the present paper span a broad range of one-dimensional velocity dispersion (175-497 km/s) and richness (12L*<=L<=65L*). Both undersampling and contamination by substructures contribute to the uncertainty of these measurements. From the analysis of the colours of the galaxy populations we find that ~60% of the spectroscopically confirmed systems have a "significant" red sequence with a colour matching passive stellar evolution models. With this paper we complete our spectroscopic survey of the fields of 58 EIS cluster candidates with estimated redshifts z<=0.4. We have measured a total of 1954 galaxy redshifts in the range z=0.0065 to z=0.6706. Of the 58 systems we confirm 42 (~75%) with redshifts between z=0.095 and z=0.534.
