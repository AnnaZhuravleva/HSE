We report the discovery of a planet transiting a moderately bright (V = 12.00) G star, with an orbital period of 2.788491 +/-0.000025 days. From the transit light curve we determine that the radius of the planet is Rp = 1.257 +/- 0.053 RJup. HAT-P-5b has a mass of Mp = 1.06 +/- 0.11 MJup, similar to the average mass of previously-known transiting exoplanets, and a density of rho = 0.66 +/- 0.11 g cm^-3 . We find that the center of transit is Tc = 2,454,241.77663 +/- 0.00022 (HJD), and the total transit duration is 0.1217 +/- 0.0012 days.
