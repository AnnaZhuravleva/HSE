We present a weak lensing analysis of the Coma Cluster using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release Five. Complete imaging of a ~ 200 square degree region is used to measure the tangential shear of this cluster. The shear is fit to an NFW model and we find a virial radius of r_{200}=1.99_{-0.22}^{+0.21}h^{-1}Mpc which corresponds to a virial mass of M_{200}=1.88_{-0.56}^{+0.65}\times10^{15}h^{-1}M_{\odot}. We additionally compare our weak lensing measurement to the virial mass derived using dynamical techniques, and find they are in agreement. This is the lowest redshift, largest angle weak lensing measurement of an individual cluster to date.
