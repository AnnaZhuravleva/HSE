We explore the epoch dependence of number density and star-formation rate for submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) found at 850 um. The study uses a sample of 38 SMG in the GOODS-N field, for which cross-waveband identifications have been obtained for 35/38 members together with redshift measurements or estimates. A maximum-likelihood analysis is employed, along with the `single-source-survey' technique. We find a diminution in both space density and star formation rate at z > 3, closely mimicking the redshift cut-offs found for QSOs selected in different wavebands. The diminution in redshift is particularly marked, at a significance level too small to measure. The data further suggest, at a significance level of about 0.001, that two separately-evolving populations may be present, with distinct luminosity functions. These results parallel the different evolutionary behaviours of LIRGs and ULIRGs, and represent another manifestation of `cosmic down-sizing', suggesting that differential evolution extends to the most extreme star-forming galaxies.
