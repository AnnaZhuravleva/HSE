Aims:We aim to significantly increase the number of detected extra-solar planets in a magnitude-limited sample to improve our knowledge of their orbital element distributions and thus obtain better constraints for planet-formation models.   Methods: Radial-velocity data were taken at Haute-Provence Observatory (OHP, France) with the ELODIE echelle spectrograph.   Results: We report the presence of a planet orbiting HD 196885 A, with an orbital period of 1349 days. This star was previously suggested to host a 386 -day planet, but we cannot confirm its existence. We also detect the presence of a stellar companion, HD 196885 B, and give some constraints on its orbit.
