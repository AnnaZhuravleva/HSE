We analyzed BiSON and GOLF/SoHO data with a new technique, to investigate p-mode power variation over solar cycle 23. We found a decrease in the mean velocity power of about 20% for BiSON during the ascending phase, in agreement with previous findings. We also found that GOLF, during the red-wing configuration, seems to be working at a different height than the theoretically computed one.
