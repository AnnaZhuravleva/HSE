In this article we use 1420 MHz data to demonstrate the likely reality of Galactic radio Loops V and VI. We further estimate distances and spectral indices for both these and the four main radio loops. In the cases of Loops I - IV, radio spectral indices are calculated from the mean brightnesses at 1420 and 820/404 MHz. The spectral indices of Loops V and VI are obtained from $T - T$ plots between 1420 and 408 MHz. Using the supernova remnant (SNR) hypothesis for the origin of radio loops, distances are calculated from the surface brightnesses and the angular diameters at 1420 MHz. We also study how results for brightnesses and distances of radio loops agree with current theories of SNR evolution. For this purpose, the ambient density and initial explosion energy of the loops are discussed. We also discuss applications of different $\Sigma - D$ relations. The results obtained confirm a non-thermal origin and nearby locations for the Galactic radio loops. Therefore, we have indications that they are very old SNRs that evolve in low ambient densities, with high initial explosion energies.
