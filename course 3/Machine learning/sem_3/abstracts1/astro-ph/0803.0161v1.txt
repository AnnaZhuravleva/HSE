(Abridged). We present a sample of 1716 galaxies with companions within Delta v < 500 km/s, r_p < 80 kpc and stellar mass ratio 0.1 < M_1/M_2 < 10 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 4 (DR4). In agreement with previous studies, we find an enhancement in the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxy pairs at projected separations < 30--40 kpc. In addition, we find that this enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) for galaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called `major' pairs. However, SFR enhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses are within a factor of 10 of each other. In agreement with the one previous study of the luminosity-metallicity (LZ) relation in paired galaxies, we find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.1 dex) for a given luminosity for galaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. We also present the first mass-metallicity (MZ) relation comparison between paired galaxies and the field, and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.05 dex) for a given mass. The smaller offset in the MZ relation indicates that both higher luminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairs relative to the control in the LZ relation. We show that the offset in the LZ relation depends on galaxy half light radius, r_h. Galaxies with r_h < 3 kpc and with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downwards offset in metallicity compared to control galaxies of the same size. Finally, we study the AGN fraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selecting galaxies in different cuts of color and asymmetry yields different AGN fractions, the fraction for pairs and the control sample are consistent for a given set of selection criteria.
