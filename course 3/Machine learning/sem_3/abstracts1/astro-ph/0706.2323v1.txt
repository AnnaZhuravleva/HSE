With the goal of identifying high redshift radio galaxies with FRI classification, here are presented high resolution, wide-field radio observations, near infra-red and optical imaging and multi-object spectroscopy of two fields of the Leiden-Berkeley Deep Survey. These fields, Hercules.1 and Lynx.2, contain a complete sample of 81 radio sources with S(1.4 GHz) > 0.5 mJy within 0.6 square degrees. This sample will form the basis for a study of the population and cosmic evolution of high redshift, low power, FRI radio sources which will be presented in Paper II. Currently, the host galaxy identification fraction is 86% with 11 sources remaining unidentified at a level of r > 25.2 mag (Hercules; 4 sources) or r > 24.4 mag (Lynx; 7 sources) or K > 20 mag. Spectroscopic redshifts have been determined for 49% of the sample and photometric redshift estimates are presented for the remainder of the sample.
