The building block of the surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory is a water Cherenkov tank. The response to shower particles is simulated using a dedicated program based on GEANT4. To check the simulation chain, we compare the simulated signals produced by cosmic muons at various zenith angles with experimental data from a special Cherenkov detector equipped with a muon hodoscope. The signals from muon-decay electrons and the evolution of the charge with water level are also studied.
