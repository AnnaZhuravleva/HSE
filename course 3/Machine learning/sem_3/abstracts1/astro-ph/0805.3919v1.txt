We report on the intense burst ``forest'' recorded on 2006 March 29 which lasted for ~30s. More than 40 bursts were detected both by BAT and by XRT, seven of which are rare intermediate flares (IFs): several times 10^{42} ergs were released. The BAT data were used to carry out time-resolved spectroscopy in the 14-100keV range down to 8ms timescales.   This unique dataset allowed us to test the magnetar model predictions such as the magnetically trapped fireball and the twisted magnetosphere over an unprecedented range of fluxes and with large statistics (in terms of both photons and IFs). We confirmed that a two blackbody component fits adequately the time-resolved and integrated spectra of IFs. However, Comptonization models give comparable good reduced chi^2. Moreover, we found: i) a change of behavior, around ~10^{41} erg/s, above which the softer blackbody shows a sort of saturation while the harder one still grows to a few times 10^{41} erg/s; ii) a rather sharp correlation between temperature and radii of the blackbodies (R^2 prop kT^{-3}), which holds for the most luminous parts of the flares (approximately for L_{tot} > 10^{41} erg/s). Within the magnetar model, the majority of these findings can be accounted for in terms of thermalised emission from the E-mode and O-mode photospheres. Interestingly, the maximum observed luminosity coming from a region of ~15km matches the magnetic Eddington luminosity at the same radius, for a surface dipole field of ~8 x 10^{14} G (virtually equal to the one deduced from the spindown of SGR 1900+14).
