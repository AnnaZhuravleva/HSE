The standing MHD modes in a zero-$\beta$ cylindrical magnetic flux tube modelled as a straight core surrounded by a magnetically twisted annulus, both embedded in a straight ambient external field is considered. The dispersion relation for the fast MHD waves is derived and solved numerically to obtain the frequencies of both the kink ($m=1$), and fluting ($m=2,3$) waves. Damping rates due to both viscous and resistive dissipations in presence of the twisted magnetic field is derived and solved numerically for both the kink and fluting waves.
