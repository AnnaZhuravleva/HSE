The jet of the quasar 3C273 is observed at different spectral bands. This jet has a knot structure. Jet radiation in radio and optical bands are connected with synchrotron mechanism, while the emission mechanism producing the X-rays is controversial. We suppose that the X-rays observed for two knots nearest to the quasar can originate from the inverse Compton scattering of external source radiation on relativistic electrons. But in the jet region with constant low X-ray intensity the inverse Compton scattering on cosmic microwave background photons (IC/CMB) is essential because the energy density of external source decreases. Upon this scenario the constraints on the angle between the jet axis and line sight values have been obtained. Also, some physical parameters for two nearest knots of the jet of 3C273 have been estimated.
