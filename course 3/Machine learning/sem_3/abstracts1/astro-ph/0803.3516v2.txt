We investigate the future evolution of two extragalactic X-ray binaries: IC10 X-1 and NGC300 X-1. Each of them consists of a high mass BH ($\sim 20-30 \msun$) accreting from a massive WR star companion ($\gtrsim 20 \msun$), and both are located in low metallicity galaxies. We analyze the current state of the systems and demonstrate that both systems will very quickly ($\lesssim 0.3$ Myr) form close BH-BH binaries with the short coalescence time ($\sim 3$ Gyr) and large chirp mass ($\sim 15 \msun$). The formation of BH-BH system seems unavoidable, as {\em (i)} WR companions are well within their Roche lobes and they do not expand so no Roche lobe overflow is expected, {\em (ii)} even intense WR wind mass loss does not remove sufficient mass to prohibit the formation of the second BH, {\em (ii)} even if BH receives the large natal kick, the systems are very closely bound and are almost impossible to disrupt. As there are two such immediate BH-BH progenitor systems within 2 Mpc and as the current gravitational wave instruments LIGO/VIRGO (initial stage) can detect such massive BH-BH mergers out to $\sim 200$ Mpc, the empirically estimated detection rate of such inspirals is $R=3.36^{+8.29}_{-2.92}$ at the 99% confidence level. If there is no detection in the current LIGO/VIRGO data (unreleased year of $s6$ run), the existence of these two massive BH systems poses an interesting challenge. Either the gravitational radiation search is not sensitive to massive inspirals or there is some fundamental misunderstanding of stellar evolution physics leading directly to the formation of BH-BH binaries.
