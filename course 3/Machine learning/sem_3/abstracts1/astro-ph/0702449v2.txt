(Abridged) We use a complete sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected on the basis of relativistically beamed 15 GHz radio flux density to derive the parent radio luminosity function (RLF) of bright radio-selected blazar cores. We use a maximum likelihood method to fit a beamed RLF to the observed data and thereby recover the parameters of the intrinsic (unbeamed) RLF. We analyze two subsamples of the MOJAVE sample: the first contains only objects of known FR II class, with a total of 103 sources, and the second subsample adds 24 objects of uncertain FR class for a total of 127 sources. Both subsamples exclude four known FR I radio galaxies and two gigahertz-peaked spectrum sources. We obtain good fits to both subsamples using a single power law intrinsic RLF with pure density evolution function. We find that a previously reported break in the observed MOJAVE RLF actually arises from using incomplete bins (because of the luminosity cutoff) across a steep and strongly evolving RLF, and does not reflect a break in the intrinsic RLF. The derived space density of the parent population of the FR II sources from the MOJAVE sample (with L>1.3e25 W/Hz) is approximately 1600/Gpc^3.
