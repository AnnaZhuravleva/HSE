We have identified a sample of 41 low-mass high--oxygen abundance outliers from the mass--metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies measured by Tremonti et al (2004). These galaxies, which have 8.6 < [12 + log(O/H)] < 9.3 over a range of -14.4 > M_B > -19.1 and 7.4 < log M_*/M_solar < 10, are surprisingly non-pathological. They have typical specific star formation rates, are fairly isolated and, with few exceptions, have no obvious companions. Morphologically, they are similar to dwarf spheroidal or dwarf elliptical galaxies. We predict that their observed high oxygen abundances are due to relatively low gas masses, concluding that these are transitional dwarf galaxies nearing the end of their star formation activity.
