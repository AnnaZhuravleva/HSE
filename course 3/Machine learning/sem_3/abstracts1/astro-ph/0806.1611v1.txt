In this contribution we outline plans for identifying and characterising numerous young, low-mass stars within 150 pc of the Sun using the new SkyMapper telescope and Southern Sky Survey. We aim to learn more about the star formation history of the solar neighbourhood over the past 5-50 Myr, the dispersal processes involved, as well as testing pre-main sequence evolutionary models and the universality of the stellar Inital Mass Function. Searching for the dispersed halo of low-mass objects predicted to surround the Eta Chamaeleontis cluster will be one of the first goals of the project.
