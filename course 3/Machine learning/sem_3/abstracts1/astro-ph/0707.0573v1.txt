We report about the status of the PICsIT layer of the imager IBIS. The instrument has been tested in both Spectral Imaging and Spectral Timing Mode. PICsIT Single Events, Multiple and ISGRI data of the Crab are simultaneously fitted to a power law model and fit parameters are compared with the standard values. We present a joint fit of SPI, ISGRI, PICsIT data of the long GRB041219, that was seen by the PICsIT instrument in both Spectral Imaging and Spectral Timing acquisition modes. This allowed us to generate a preliminary version of the instrumental response matrices for the PICsIT Spectral Timing mode.
