We present a novel model in which shortening of a magnetic flux tube following localized, three-dimensional reconnection generates strong gas-dynamic shocks around its apex. The shortening releases magnetic energy by progressing away from the reconnection site at the Alfven speed. This launches inward flows along the field lines whose collision creates a pair of gas-dynamic shocks. The shocks raise both the mass density and temperature inside the newly shortened flux tube. Reconnecting field lines whose initial directions differ by more that 100 degrees can produce a concentrated knot of plasma hotter that 20 MK, consistent with observations. In spite of these high temperatures, the shocks convert less than 10% of the liberated magnetic energy into heat - the rest remains as kinetic energy of bulk motion. These gas-dynamic shocks arise only when the reconnection is impulsive and localized in all three dimensions; they are distinct from the slow magnetosonic shocks of the Petschek steady-state reconnection model.
