Super Heavy quasi-stable particles are naturally produced in the early universe and could represent a substantial fraction of the Dark Matter: the so-called Super Heavy Dark Matter (SHDM). The decay of SHDM represents also a possible source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR), with a reliably calculated spectrum of the particles produced in the decay $(\propto E^{-1.9})$. The SHDM model for the production of UHECR can explain quantitatively only the excess of UHE events observed by AGASA. In the case of an observed spectrum not showing the AGASA excess the SHDM model can provide only a {\it subdominant} contribution to the UHECR flux. We discuss here the basic features of SHDM for the production of a {\it subdominant} UHECR flux, we refer our study to the possible signatures of the model at the Auger observatory discussing in particular the expected chemical composition and anisotropy.
