We present a quantitative investigation of the effect of stellar oscillations on Doppler velocity planet searches. Using data from four asteroseismological observation campaigns, we find a power law relationship between the noise impact of these oscillations on Doppler velocities and both the luminosity-to-mass of the target stars, and observed integration times. Including the impact of oscillation jitter should improve the quality of Keplerian fits to Doppler velocity data. The scale of the effect these oscillations have on Doppler velocity measurements is smaller than that produced by stellar activity, but is most significant for giant and subgiant stars, and at short integration times (i.e. less than a few minutes). Such short observation times tend to be used only for very bright stars. However, since it is these very same stars that tend to be targeted for the highest precision observations, as planet searches probe to lower and lower planet masses, oscillation noise for these stars can be significant and needs to be accounted for in observing strategies.
