The photon-neutrino processes $\gamma e^{\pm} \to e^{\pm} \nu \bar \nu$, $\gamma \to \nu \bar \nu$ and $\gamma \gamma \to \nu \bar \nu$ are investigated in the presence of a strongly magnetized and dense electron-positron plasma. The amplitudes of the reactions $\gamma e^{\pm} \to e^{\pm} \nu \bar \nu$ and $\gamma \gamma \to \nu \bar \nu$ are obtained. In the case of a cold degenerate plasma contributions of the considering processes to neutrino emissivity are calculated. It is shown that contribution of the process $\gamma \gamma \to \nu \bar \nu$ to neutrino emissivity is supressed in comparision with the contributions of the processes $\gamma e^{\pm} \to e^{\pm} \nu \bar \nu$ and $\gamma \to \nu \bar \nu$. The constraint on the magnetic field strength in the magnetar outer crust is obtained.
