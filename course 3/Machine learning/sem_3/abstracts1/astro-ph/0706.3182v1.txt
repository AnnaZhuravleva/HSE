We report on dual-frequency radio polarimetry observations of two young, energetic pulsars, PSRs J0940-5428 and J1301-6305. These were among the first Vela-like pulsars discovered in the Parkes Multibeam survey. We conducted observations of these pulsars with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at center frequencies of 1384 and 2496 MHz using pulsar gating while preserving full Stokes parameters. After correcting for bandwidth depolarization, we have measured polarization characteristics, flux densities, and rotation measures for these pulsars. The spectral indices derived from the ATCA data are shallow but still consistent with values seen for pulsars of this type. The rotation measures for both pulsars are consistent with those reported recently using data from the Parkes telescope, and both pulsars have highly linearly polarized pulse profiles at both 1384 and 2496 MHz. Our results support a previously noted correlation between high degree of linear polarization, shallow spectral index, and large spin-down luminosity.
