The conversion of neutron star to strange star is argued to be a two step process. The first process involves the deconfinement of nuclear to two-flavour quark matter. The GR results shows that the propagating front breaks up into fragments which propagate with different velocities along different directions. The time taken for this conversion to happen is of the order of few $ms$. This calculation indicates the inadequacy of non-relativistic (NR) or even Special Relativistic (SR) treatments for these cases.
