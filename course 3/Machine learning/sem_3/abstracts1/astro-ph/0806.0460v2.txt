Lithium detectors have a high sensitivity to CNO neutrinos from the Sun. The present experimental data and prospects for future experiments on the detection of CNO neutrinos are discussed. A nonstationary case is considered when the flux of 13N neutrinos is higher than the standard solar model predicts due to the influx of fresh material from the peripheral layers to the solar core.
