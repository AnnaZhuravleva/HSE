Using MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of STars) satellite guide star photometry, we have discovered a metallic A star showing hybrid p- and g-mode pulsations. HD 114839 was observed nearly continuously for 10 days in March, 2005. We identify frequencies in three groups: the first centered near 2 cycles/day, in the gamma Dor pulsation range, and two others near 8 and 20, both in the delta Scuti range. This is only the fourth known such hybrid pulsator, including another MOST discovery (Rowe et al. 2006, this issue).
