UGC 8584 was selected by a computer program as having a number of quasars around it that obeyed the Karlsson periodicity in its reference frame. On closer examination 9 of the nearest 10 quasars turned out to be extremely close to the predicted values. Also it turned out that UGC 8584 was a disturbed triple galaxy and a strong triple radio source as well as being a strong millimeter and infrared source. Evidence for present ejection velocities of $z_v \sim .01$ for the associated quasars is present and some pairing of ejections is noted.   A new and important result emerges from this sample of galaxy/quasar families, namely that rings and shells of galaxies and quasars tend to surround galaxies which have active nuclei. Test cases suggest obscuration of the background around these galaxies out to about 20' or beyond. Because incidents of strong reddening are not observed, obscuring particles are suggested to be large compared to optical wavelengths. In principle, material ejected with the quasars could be of sizes of gravel or larger.
