Recent astrophysical data indicates that dark matter shows a controversial behaviour in galaxy cluster collisions. In case of the notorious Bullet cluster, dark matter component of the cluster behaves like a collisionless system. However, its behaviour in the Abell 520 cluster indicates a significant self-interaction cross-section. It is hard for the WIMP based dark matter models to reconcile such a diverse behaviour. Mirror dark matter models, on the contrary, are more flexible and for them diverse behaviour of the dark matter is a natural expectation.
