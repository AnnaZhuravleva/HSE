We consider a situation in which a pulsar (and its nebula) is formed inside or close to a high density regions of a molecular cloud. We apply a recent model for the gamma radiation of pulsar wind nebulae (PWN), which includes not only radiation processes due to injected leptons but also processes due to injection of relativistic hadrons, in order to calculate the expected gamma-ray emission from such interacting PWNe. The example calculations have been performed for two objects of this type from which directions TeV gamma-ray sources have recently been observed (IC443 and W41). We show that the gamma-ray emission below a few TeV can be produced by leptons accelerated in the past in the vicinity of the pulsars. gamma-rays with energies above ~10 TeV can be produced by hadrons interacting with the matter inside the supernova remnant and surrounding dense clouds. In contrary to the low energy TeV emission, this high energy TeV emission should be correlated with the location of dense clouds able to capture hadrons due to their strong magnetic fields.
