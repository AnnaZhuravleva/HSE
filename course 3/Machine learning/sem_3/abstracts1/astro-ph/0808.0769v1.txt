We investigate the correlation between the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and metal abundance, using existing data sets. The SMBH mass $M_{bh}$ is well correlated with integrated stellar feature of Mgb. For 28 galaxies, the best-fit $M_{bh}$-Mgb relation has a small scatter, which is an equivalent level with other well-known relation, such as a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the mass. An averaged iron index $<$Fe$>$ also positively correlates with $M_{bh}$, but the best-fit $M_{bh}$-$<$Fe$>$ relation has a larger scatter. The difference comes from the synthesis and evolution mechanisms, and may be important for the SMBH and star formation history in the host spheroid.
