I present to this conference our latest measurements of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. After a brief review of the reasons for which this effect arises and of the technique to detect it by cross-correlating the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the large scale structure of the Universe (LSS), I describe the current state of the art measurement. This is obtained from a combined analysis of six different galaxy datasets, and has a significance level of ~ 4.5 sigma. I then describe the cosmological implications, which show agreement with a flat LCDM model with Omega_m = 0.20 +0.19 -0.11 at 95% confidence level. I finally show how these data can be used to constrain modified gravity theories, focusing in particular on the Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) model.
