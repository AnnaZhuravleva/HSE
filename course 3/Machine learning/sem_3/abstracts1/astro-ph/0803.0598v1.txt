We describe the first optical survey of absorption systems associated with galaxy clusters at z= 0.3-0.9. We have cross-correlated SDSS DR3 quasars with high-redshift cluster/group candidates from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey. We have found 442 quasar-cluster pairs for which the MgII doublet might be detected at a transverse (physical) distance d<2 Mpc from the cluster centers. To investigate the incidence (dN/dz) and equivalent-width distribution n(W) of MgII systems at cluster redshifts, two statistical samples were drawn out of these pairs: one made of high-resolution spectroscopic quasar observations (46 pairs), and one made of quasars used in MgII searches found in the literature (375 pairs). The results are: (1) the population of strong MgII systems (W_0>2.0 Ang.) near cluster redshifts shows a significant (>3 sigma) overabundance (up to a factor of 15) when compared with the 'field' population; (2) the overabundance is more evident at smaller distances (d<1 Mpc) than larger distances (d<2 Mpc) from the cluster center; and, (3) the population of weak MgII systems (W_0<0.3 Ang.) near cluster redshifts conform to the field statistics. Unlike in the field, this dichotomy makes n(W) in clusters appear flat and well fitted by a power-law in the entire W-range. A sub-sample of the most massive clusters yields a stronger and still significant signal. Since either the absorber number density or filling-factor/cross-section affects the absorber statistics, an interesting possibility is that we have detected the signature of truncated halos due to environmental effects. Thus, we argue that the excess of strong systems is due to a population of absorbers in an overdense galaxy environment, and the lack of weak systems to a different population, that got destroyed in the cluster environment.
