We present the results of our recent search for pulsational line profile variations in high time resolution UVES spectra of the most evolved Ap star known, the delta Scuti star HD21190, and of the Ap Sr star HD218994. We found that HD218994 is an roAp star with a pulsation period of 5.1 min, which makes it the 36th star known to be a roAp star. No rapid pulsations have been found in the spectra of the delta Scuti star HD21190. However, we detect moving peaks in the cores of spectral lines, which indicate the presence of non-radial pulsations in this star.
