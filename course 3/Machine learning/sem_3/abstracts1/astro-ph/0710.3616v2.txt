A rare coincidence of scales in standard particle physics is needed to explain why $\Lambda$ or the negative pressure of cosmological dark energy (DE) coincides with the positive pressure $P_0$ of random motion of dark matter (DM) in bright galaxies. Recently Zlosnik et al. (2007) propose to modify the Einsteinian curvature by adding a non-linear pressure from a medium flowing with a four-velocity vector field $U^\mu$. We propose to check whether a smooth extension of GR with a simple kinetic Lagrangian of $U^\mu$ can be constructed, and whether the pressure can bend space-time sufficiently to replace the roles of a $w=-1$ DE, $w=0$ Cold DM and heavy neutrinos in explaining anomalous accelerations at all scales. As a specific proof of concept we find a Vector-for-$\Lambda$ model (${\mathbf V\Lambda}$-model) and its variants. With essentially {\it no free parameters}, these appear broadly consistent with the solar system, gravitational potentials in dwarf spiral galaxies and the bullet cluster of galaxies, early universe with inflation, structure formation and BBN, and late acceleration with a 1:3 ratio of DM:DE.
