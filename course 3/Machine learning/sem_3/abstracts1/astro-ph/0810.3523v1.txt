Gamma-ray Bursts are the most powerful objects in the Universe. Discovered in the 1960's as brief flashes of gamma-radiation, we now know they emit across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, are located in distant galaxies and comprise two distinct populations, one of which may originate in the deaths of massive stars. The launch of the Swift satellite in 2004 has brought a flurry of new discoveries, advancing our understanding of these sources and the galaxies that host them. We highlight a number of important results from the Swift era thus far.
