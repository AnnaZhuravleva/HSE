We study the spectral index of curvature perturbations for inflationary models where the driving scalar field is coupled to a relativistic fluid through a friction term $\Gamma$. We find that only a very small friction term - $\Gamma \ll H$, with H being the Hubble parameter during inflation - is allowed by observations, otherwise curvature fluctuations are generated with a spectral index $n_s$ unacceptably red. These results are generic with respect to the inflationary potential and known dependence of the friction term on the scalar field and the energy density of the relativistic fluid. We compare our findings with previous investigations.
