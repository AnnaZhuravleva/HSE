Our presentation is aimed at data centers providing access to complex observational and theoretical data and to the users of these resources. We show how to visualize complex datasets stored in the VO enabled data archives using existing VO client software and PLASTIC, a prototype of an application messaging protocol, for interaction between archive query results and tools. We demonstrate how to display and explore observable IFU datasets, provided within the ASPID-SR archive, using CDS Aladin, ESA VOSpec, and VO-Paris Euro3D Client. In the second part of the paper we show how to use TOPCAT for displaying results of N-body simulations of galaxy mergers available in the HORIZON GalMer database.
