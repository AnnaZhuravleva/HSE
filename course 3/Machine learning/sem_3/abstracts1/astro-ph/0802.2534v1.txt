Anisotropic emission of gravitational waves during the merger or formation of black holes can lead to the ejection of these black holes from their host galaxies. A recoiled black hole which moves on an almost radial bound orbit outside the virial radius of its central galaxy, in the cold dark matter background, reaches its apapsis in a finite time. The low value of dark matter velocity dispersion at high redshifts and also the black hole velocity near the apapsis passage yield a high-density wake around these black holes. Gamma-ray emission can result from the enhancement of dark matter annihilation in these wakes. The diffuse high-energy gamma-ray background from the ensemble of such black holes in the Hubble volume is also evaluated.
