We present the results of a multiwavelength study of the z = 0.31 radio source PKS2250-41. Integral field unit and long-slit spectroscopy obtained using VIMOS and FORS1 on the VLT, and archival HST optical imaging observations are used to study the morphology, kinematics and ionisation state of the extended emission line region (EELR) surrounding this source, and also a companion galaxy at a similar redshift. Near-infrared imaging observations obtained using the NTT are used to analyse the underlying galaxy morphologies. The EELR displays a complex variety of different gas kinematics and ionization states, consistent with a mixture of radio source shocks and AGN photoionization. The radio galaxy is likely to lie within a group environment, and is plausibly undergoing interactions with one or more other objects. The disk-like galaxy to the northeast of the radio source lies at a similar redshift to the radio galaxy itself, and has its major axis position angle aligned with the filamentary continuum and line emission extending outwards from the radio galaxy. This filamentary structure is most plausibly interpreted as a tidal structure associated with an interaction involving the radio source host galaxy and the aligned companion galaxy to the north-east; this encounter may have potentially triggered the current epoch of radio source activity. Overall, PKS2250-41 displays some of the best evidence that radio source activity can be triggered in this manner. [abridged]
