We introduce the contour process to describe the geometrical properties of merger trees. The contour process produces a one-dimensional object, the contour walk, which is a translation of the merger tree. We portray the contour walk through its length and action. The length is proportional to to the number of progenitors in the tree, and the action can be interpreted as a proxy of the mean length of a branch in a merger tree.   We obtain the contour walk for merger trees extracted from the public database of the Millennium Run and also for merger trees constructed with a public Monte-Carlo code which implements a Markovian algorithm. The trees correspond to halos of final masses between 10^{11} h^{-1} M_sol and 10^{14} h^{-1} M_sol. We study how the length and action of the walks evolve with the mass of the final halo. In all the cases, except for the action measured from Markovian trees, we find a transitional scale around 3 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} M_sol. As a general trend the length and action measured from the Markovian trees show a large scatter in comparison with the case of the Millennium Run trees.
