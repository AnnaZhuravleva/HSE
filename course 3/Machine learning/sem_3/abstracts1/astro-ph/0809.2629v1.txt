A quasar wind model is proposed to describe the spatial and velocity structure of the broad line region. This model requires detailed photoionization and magnetohydrodynamic simulation, as the broad line region it too small for direct spatial resolution. The emission lines are Doppler broadened, since the gas is moving at high velocity. The high velocity is attained by the gas from a combination of radiative and magnetic driving forces. Once this model is complete, the model predictions will be tested against recent microlensing data in conjunction with diverse existing observations.
