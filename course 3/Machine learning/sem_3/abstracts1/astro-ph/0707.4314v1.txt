We present Spitzer/IRS observations of a small sample of heavily obscured IRAS sources displaying both the infrared and OH maser emission characteristic of OH/IR stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), but also radio continuum emission typical of ionized planetary nebulae (PNe), the so-called OHPNe. Our observations show that their mid-infrared spectra are dominated by the simultaneous presence of strong and broad amorphous silicate absorption features together with crystalline silicate features, originated in their O-rich circumstellar shells. Out of the five sources observed, three of them are clearly non-variable at infrared wavelengths, confirming their post-AGB status, while the remaining two still show strong photometric fluctuations, and may still have not yet departed from the AGB. One of the non-variable sources in the sample, IRAS 17393-2727, displays a strong [Ne II] nebular emission at 12.8 microns, indicating that the ionization of its central region has already started. This suggests a rapid evolution from the AGB to the PN stage. We propose that these heavily obscured OHPNe represent the population of high mass precursors to PNe in our Galaxy.
