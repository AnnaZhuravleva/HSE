We have observed the recently discovered rich star cluster GLIMPSE-C01 for 46 ks with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Seventeen X-ray sources with luminosities greater than 0.6e31 ergs/s were discovered, one of which is likely a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary. The spatial distribution of these X-ray sources with respect to the NIR and IR images of the cluster, combined with the luminosity and spectral hardness distributions of the sources, provide strong evidence that GLIMPSE-C01 is a rich Galactic globular cluster.
