The Euler equation has been accepted as the basic postulate of stellar physics long before the plasma physics was developed. The existence of electrical interaction between particles of interstellar plasma poses the question, how this interaction must be accounted for. We argue that the right way is in formulation of a new postulate. On the base of the new postulate, the theory of a hot star interior is developed. Using this theory we obtain the distribution of stars over their masses and mass-radius, mass-temperature and mass-luminosity dependencies. The theory of the apsidal rotation of binary stars and the spectrum of solar oscillation is considered. All these theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the known measurement data, which confirms the validity of this consideration.
