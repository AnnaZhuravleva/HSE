We present analysis and results of a coordinated CCD photometry campaign to observe the 2006 June superoutburst of the cataclysmic variable V1316 Cyg involving 8 longitudinally-distributed observers. The outburst peaked at magnitude 15.03 on June 10, declined at a rate of 0.14 mag/day, lasted 11 days and had an amplitude above quiescence of 2.4 magnitudes. We detected common superhumps for the first time, thereby confirming that V1316 Cyg is a member of the UGSU class of dwarf novae. We observed a transition to late superhumps two-thirds of the way through the outburst with an associated phase shift of 0.50 +/- 0.06 cycles. The mean common superhump period before this transition was 0.07685 +/- 0.00003 d and the mean late superhump period following the transition was 0.07654 +/- 0.00002 d. The common superhump period decreased at a rate dP/dt = -5.1 +/- 1.7 x10^-5 /cycle. At the onset of late superhumps, there was a transient shift in power from the superhump fundamental frequency to its first harmonic and back again. We detected an orbital period of 0.0740 +/- 0.0002 d giving a fractional superhump period excess of 0.038 +/- 0.003 and a mass ratio of 0.167 +/- 0.010. A scalegram analysis of the flickering behaviour of V1316 Cyg found that the alpha and sigma parameters characterising flickering changed significantly during the superoutburst. We also found flickering to be at a relatively much lower level at the beginning of the superoutburst and during two normal outbursts.
