The cosmological dynamics of minimally coupled scalar field that couples to the background matter with thermal interactions is investigated by using statefinder diagnostics. The time evolution of the statefinder pairs $\{r,s\}$ and $\{r,q\}$ are obtained under the circumstance that different values of model parameters are chosen. We show that the thermal coupling term does not affect the location of the late-time attractor, but exert an influence on the evolution of the statefinder parameters. The most notable feature of the $r-s$ plane for the thermal coupling model which is distinguished from the other dark energy models is that some part of the curve with thermal coupling can form a closed loop in the second quadrant ($r>1,s<0$).
