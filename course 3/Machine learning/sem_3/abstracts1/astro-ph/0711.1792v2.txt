Due to the lack of low redshift long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the circular problem has been a severe obstacle for using GRBs as cosmological candles. In this paper, we present a new method to deal with such a problem in MCMC global fitting analysis. Assuming that a certain type of correlations between different observables exists in a subsample of GRBs, for the parameters involved in the correlation relation, we treat them as free parameters and determine them simultaneously with cosmological parameters through MCMC analysis on GRB data together with other observational data. Then the circular problem is naturally eliminated in this procedure. We take the Ghirlanda relation as an example while keeping in mind the debate about its physical validity. Together with SNe Ia, WMAP and SDSS data, we include 27 GRBs with the reported Ghirlanda relation in our study, and perform MCMC global fitting. We consider the $\Lambda$CDM model and dynamical dark energy models. In each case, in addition to the constraints on the relevant cosmological parameters, we obtain the best fit values as well as the distributions of the correlation parameters $A$ and $C$. We find that the observational data sets other than GRBs can affect $A$ and $C$ considerably through their degeneracies with the cosmological parameters. The results on $A$ and $C$ for different cosmological models are in well agreement within $1\sigma$ range. The best fit value of $A$ in all models being analyzed is $A\sim 1.53$ with $\sigma \sim 0.08$. For $C$, we have the best value in the range of $0.94-0.98$ with $\sigma\sim 0.1$. It is also noted that the distributions of $A$ and $C$ are generally broader than the priors used in many studies in literature. (Abriged)
