We introduce the log(Ha/[SII]6717+6731) vs. log(Ha/[NII]6583) (S2N2) diagnostic diagram as metallicity and ionisation parameter indicator for HII regions in external galaxies. The location of HII regions in the S2N2 diagram was studied both empirically and theoretically. We found that, for a wide range of metallicities, the S2N2 diagram gives single valued results in the metallicity-ionisation parameter plane. We demonstrate that the S2N2 diagram is a powerful tool to estimate metallicities of high-redshift (z ~ 2) HII galaxies. Finally, we derive the metallicity for 76 HII regions in M33 from the S2N2 diagram and calculate an O/H abundance gradient for this galaxy of -0.05 (+-0.01) dex kpc^-1.
