We present new X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of a composite supernova remnant G327.1-1.1 using the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. G327.1-1.1 has an unusual morphology consisting of a symmetric radio shell and an off center nonthermal component that indicates the presence of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Radio observations show a narrow finger of emission extending from the PWN structure towards the northwest. X-ray studies with ASCA, ROSAT, and BeppoSAX revealed elongated extended emission and a compact source at the tip of the finger that may be coincident with the actual pulsar. The high resolution Chandra observations provide new insight into the structure of the inner region of the remnant. The images show a compact source embedded in a cometary structure, from which a trail of X-ray emission extends in the southeast direction. The Chandra images also reveal two prong-like structures that appear to originate from the vicinity of the compact source and extend into a large bubble that is oriented in the north-west direction, opposite from the bright radio PWN. The emission from the entire radio shell is detected in the XMM data and can be characterized by a thermal plasma model with a temperature of 0.3 keV, which we use to estimate the physical properties of the remnant. The peculiar morphology of G327.1-1.1 may be explained by the emission from a moving pulsar and a relic PWN that has been disrupted by the reverse shock.
