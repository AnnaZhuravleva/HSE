It is now recognized that long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are linked to the collapse of massive stars, based on the association between (low-redshift) GRBs and (type Ic) core-collapse supernovae (SNe). The census of massive stars and GRBs reveals, however, that not all massive stars do produce a GRB. Only ~1% of core collapse SNe are able to produce a highly relativistic collimated outflow, and hence a GRB. The extra crucial parameter has long been suspected to be metallicity and/or rotation. We find observational evidence strongly supporting that both ingredients are necessary in order to make a GRB out of a core-collapsing star. A detailed study of the absorption pattern in the X-ray spectrum of GRB060218 reveals evidence of material highly enriched in low atomic number metals ejected before the SN/GRB explosion. We find that, within the current scenarios of stellar evolution, only a progenitor star characterized by a fast stellar rotation and sub-solar initial metallicity could produce such a metal enrichment in its close surrounding.
