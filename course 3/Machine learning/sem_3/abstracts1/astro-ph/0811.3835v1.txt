The cosmological constant problem is seen as a symptom of the ambiguity of the Riemann curvature in general relativity. The solution of that ambiguity provided by Nash's theorem on gravitational perturbations along extra dimensions eliminate the direct comparison between the vacuum energy density and Einstein's cosmological constant, besides being compatible with the formation of structures and the accelerated expansion of the universe.
