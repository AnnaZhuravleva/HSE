We report on a new, wide field ($20^{\prime} \times 20^{\prime}$), multicolor ($UBVI$), photometric campaign in the area of the nearby old open cluster NGC 2112. At the same time, we provide medium-resolution spectroscopy of 35 (and high-resolution of additional 5) Red Giant and Turn Off stars. This material is analyzed with the aim to update the fundamental parameters of this traditionally difficult cluster, which is very sparse and suffers from heavy field star contamination. Among the 40 stars with spectra, we identified 21 {\it bona fide} radial velocity members which allow us to put more solid constraints on the cluster's metal abundance, long suggested to be as low as the metallicity of globulars. As indicated earlier by us on a purely photometric basis (Carraro et al. 2002), the cluster [Fe/H] abundance is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H] =0.16$\pm$0.03) and close to the Hyades value, as inferred from a detailed abundance analysis of 3 of the 5 stars with higher resolution spectra. Abundance ratios are also marginally super solar. Based on this result, we revise the properties of NGC 2112 using stellar models from the Padova and Yale-Yonsei groups. For this metal abundance, we find the cluster's age, reddening, and distance values are 1.8 Gyr, 0.60 mag, and 940 pc, respectively. Both the Yale-Yonsei and Padova models predict the same values for the fundamental parameters within the errors. Overall, NGC 2112 is a typical solar neighborhood, thin disk star cluster, sharing the same chemical properties of F-G stars and open clusters close to the Sun. This investigation outlines the importance of a detailed membership analysis in the study of disk star clusters.
