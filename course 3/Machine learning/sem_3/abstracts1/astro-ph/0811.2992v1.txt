Star formation in the Local spiral arm in the direction of the Galactic longitudes 132--158 deg is reviewed. Recent star-forming activity in this Milky Way direction is evidenced by the presence here of the Cam OB1 association and dense dust and molecular clouds containing H$\alpha$ emission stars, young irregular variables and infrared stellar objects. The clouds of the Local arm concentrate in two layers at 150-300 pc and at about 900 pc from the Sun. The Perseus arm objects in this direction are at a distance of about 2 kpc.
