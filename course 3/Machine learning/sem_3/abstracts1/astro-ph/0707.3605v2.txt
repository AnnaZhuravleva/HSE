The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS02) experiment will be installed in 2009 on the International Space Station (ISS) for an operational period of at least three years. The purpose of AMS02 experiment is to perform accurate, high statistics, long duration measurements in space of charged cosmic rays in rigidity range from 1 GV to 3 TV and of high energy photons up to few hundred of GeV. In this work we will discuss the experimental details and the physics capabilities of AMS02 on ISS.
