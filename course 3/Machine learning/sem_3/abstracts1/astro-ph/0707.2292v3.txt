We complete our previous investigation concerning the structure and the stability of "isothermal" spheres in general relativity. This concerns objects that are described by a linear equation of state $P=q\epsilon$ so that the pressure is proportional to the energy density. In the Newtonian limit $q\to 0$, this returns the classical isothermal equation of state. We consider specifically a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/3), the core of neutron stars (q=1/3) and a gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field (q=1). We study how the thermodynamical parameters scale with the size of the object and find unusual behaviours due to the non-extensivity of the system. We compare these scaling laws with the area scaling of the black hole entropy. We also determine the domain of validity of these scaling laws by calculating the critical radius above which relativistic stars described by a linear equation of state become dynamically unstable. For photon stars, we show that the criteria of dynamical and thermodynamical stability coincide. Considering finite spheres, we find that the mass and entropy as a function of the central density present damped oscillations. We give the critical value of the central density, corresponding to the first mass peak, above which the series of equilibria becomes unstable. Finally, we extend our results to d-dimensional spheres. We show that the oscillations of mass versus central density disappear above a critical dimension d_{crit}(q). For Newtonian isothermal stars (q=0) we recover the critical dimension d_{crit}=10. For the stiffest stars (q=1) we find d_{crit}=9 and for a self-gravitating radiation (q=1/d) we find d_{crit}=9.96404372... very close to 10. Finally, we give analytical solutions of relativistic isothermal spheres in 2D gravity.
