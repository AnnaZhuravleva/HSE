By basing on observations of skeletal structures of the Sun and assuming that some of them are located inside of star, and also that a filamentary (linear) matter (whose a model earlier was put forward by B.U. Rodionov) is in basis of these internal structures the author consider possible processes of images formation of these structures inside the Sun and theirs coming out into space and also gives an elementary estimations of its parameters, which allow: i) to form their images in a flux of electronic neutrinos; ii) to carry out these images from within of the Sun into space; iii) to develop these images in form of a concomitant flux of soft x-ray, which next is recorded by telescope of soft x-ray. It is supposed the processes considered here, actually, can be accepted as future base of neutrino astronomy with high spatial resolution.
