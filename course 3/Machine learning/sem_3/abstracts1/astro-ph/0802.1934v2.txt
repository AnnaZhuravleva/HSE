Using the SDSS spectroscopic sample, we estimate the dark matter halo spin parameter lambda for ~53,000 disk galaxies for which MOPED star formation histories are available. We investigate the relationship between spin and total stellar mass, star formation history, and environment. First, we find a clear anti-correlation between stellar mass and spin, with low mass galaxies generally having high dark matter spins. Second, galaxies which have formed more than ~5% of their stars in the last 0.2 Gyr have more broadly distributed and typically higher spins (including a significant fraction with lambda > 0.1) than galaxies which formed a large fraction of their stars more than 10 Gyr ago. Finally, we find little or no correlation between the value of spin of the dark halo and environment as determined both by proximity to a new cluster catalog and a marked correlation study. This agrees well with the predictions from linear hierarchical torquing theory and numerical simulations.
