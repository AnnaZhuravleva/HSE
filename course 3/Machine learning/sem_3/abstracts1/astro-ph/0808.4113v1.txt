The red spectral shape of the visible to near infrared reflectance spectrum of the sharply-edged ring-like disk around the young main sequence star HR 4796A was recently interpreted as the presence of tholin-like complex organic materials which are seen in the atmosphere and surface of Titan and the surfaces of icy bodies in the solar system. However, we show in this Letter that porous grains comprised of common cosmic dust species (amorphous silicate, amorphous carbon, and water ice) also closely reproduce the observed reflectance spectrum, suggesting that the presence of complex organic materials in the HR 4796 disk is still not definitive.
