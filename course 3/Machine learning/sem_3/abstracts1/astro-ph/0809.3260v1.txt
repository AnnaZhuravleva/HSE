From optical high-resolution spectra the nature of the unseen companion of HW Vir is determined without detection of any spectral features originating from the secondary itself. Using radial velocity measurements from the primary hot subdwarf B star and from weak additional absorption lines detected close to the secondary eclipse, probably caused by reflected light off the surface of the secondary, the mass and radius of the companion is determined. The values are consistent with those of a M type main sequence star.
