The goal of this paper is to present and analyse a new sample of cool carbon (C)stars located in the halo. Twenty three new C stars were discovered. Spectra are typical of N-type stars with C2 and CN bands and sometimes Halpha in emission. ... Four objects are particularly red with J-K > 3, with 2 located at more than 5 kpc. from the Galactic plane. Eight additional objects with similar properties are found in the literature and our previous works. These 12 C stars could be useful to study mass loss at low metallicity. Two objects are at distances of 95 and 110 kpc. They are located in the region with galactocentric Z < -60 kpc in which the model of Law et al. predicts the Sgr stream to have a loop.
