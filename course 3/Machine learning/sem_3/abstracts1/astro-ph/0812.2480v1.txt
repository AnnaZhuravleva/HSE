In a series of papers we have recently studied the clustering of LRG galaxies in the latest spectroscopic SDSS data release, which has 75000 LRG galaxies sampling 1.1 Gpc^3/h^3 to z=0.47. Here we focus on detecting a local maxima shaped as a circular ring in the bidimensional galaxy correlation function \xi(pi,sigma), separated in perpendicular \sigma and line-of-sight \pi distances. We find a significant detection of such a peak at r ~110 Mpc/h. The overall shape and location of the ring is consistent with it originating from the recombination-epoch baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). This agreement provides support for the current understanding of how large scale structure forms in the universe. We study the significance of such feature using large mock galaxy simulations to provide accurate errorbars.
