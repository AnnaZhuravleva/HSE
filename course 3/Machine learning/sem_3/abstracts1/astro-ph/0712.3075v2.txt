M87 is the first extragalactic source detected in the TeV gamma-ray domain that is not a blazar, its large scale jet not being aligned to the line of sight. We present here a multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton model accounting explicitly for large viewing angles and moderate Lorentz factors as inferred from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jet formation, motivated by the detection of M87 at very high energies (VHE; E > 100GeV). Predictions are presented for the very high-energy emission of active galactic nuclei with extended optical or X-ray jet, which could be misaligned blazars but still show some moderate beaming. We include predictions for 3C273, Cen A and PKS 0521-36.
