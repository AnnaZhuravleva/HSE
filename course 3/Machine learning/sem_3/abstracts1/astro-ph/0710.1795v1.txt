The Parkes deep HI ZOA survey has been extended between 2002 and 2004 towards higher latitudes in the Galactic Bulge region. This area of extreme star crowding and high extinction levels remains impenetrable at any other waveband regime.   Preliminary results of the 3 dimensional distribution based on the combined HI-surveys are presented. We focus on the extent and "content" of the Local Void as outlined by these HI surveys, followed by a preliminary discussion of the properties of the few galaxies detected in the Local Void.
