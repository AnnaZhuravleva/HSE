With reasonable assumptions and approximations, we compute the velocity of the meridional flow $U$ in the convective envelope by modified Chandrasekhar's (1956) MHD equations. The analytical solution of such a modified equation is found to be $U(x,\mu) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \bigl[u1_n x^n + u2_n x^{-(n+3)}\bigr] C_n^{3/2}(\mu)$, where $x$ is non-dimensional radius, $\mu = cos{\vartheta}$, ${\vartheta}$ is the co-latitude, $C_n^{3/2} {(\mu)}$ are the Gegenbaur polynomials of order 3/2, $u1_n$ and $u2_n$ are the unknown constants. The results show that meridional velocity flow from the surface appears to penetrates deep below base of the convective envelope and at outer part of the radiative zone. With such a deep flow velocity below the convective envelope and a very high density stratification in the outer part of the radiative zone with likely existence of a strong ($\sim$ $10^{4}$ G) toroidal magnetic field structure, the velocity of transport of meridional flow is considerably reduced. Hence, it is very unlikely that the return flow will reach the surface (with a period of solar cycle) as required by some of the flux transport dynamo models. On the other hand, deep meridional flow is required for burning of Lithium at outer part of the radiative zone supporting the observed Lithium deficiency at the surface.
