High resolution HST/ACS images of the galaxy cluster RX J1347-1145 have enabled us to identify several new multiple image candidates in the cluster, including a 5 image system with a central image. The multiple images allow us to construct an accurate 2-dimensional mass map of the central part of the cluster. The modelling of the cluster mass includes the most prominent cluster galaxies modelled as truncated isothermal spheres and a smooth halo component that is described with 2 parametric profiles. The mass reconstruction is done using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that provides us with a total projected mass density as well as estimates for the parameters of interest and their respective errors. The mass profile is in reasonable agreement with previous mass estimates based on the X-ray emission from the hot intra-cluster gas, however the X-ray mass estimates are systematically lower than what we obtain with gravitational lensing.
