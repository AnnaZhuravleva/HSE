(abridged) We present deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, along with 16, 24, 70, and 850um photometry, for 22 galaxies located in GOODS-N. The sample spans a redshift range of 0.6 < z < 2.6, 24um flux densities between ~0.2-1.2 mJy, and consists of SMGs, AGN, and optically faint (z_AB > 25) sources. We find that IR luminosities derived by fitting local SEDs with 24um photometry alone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic and longer wavelength photometric data is used for galaxies having z < 1.4 and 24um-derived IR luminosities typically > 3x10^12 L_sun. However, for galaxies in the redshift range between 1.4 < z < 2.6, typically having 24um-derived IR luminosities > 3x10^12 L_sun, IR luminosities are overestimated by an average factor of ~5 when SED fitting with 24um photometry alone. This result arises partly due to the fact that high redshift galaxies exhibit PAH EQWs that are large compared to local galaxies of similar luminosities. Using improved estimates for the IR luminosities of these sources, we investigate whether their IR emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based on extinction corrected UV SFRs, possibly suggesting the presence of an obscured AGN. Through a spectral decomposition of IRS spectroscopic data, we are able to isolate the fraction of IR luminosity arising from an AGN as opposed to star formation activity. This fraction is only ~30% of the total IR luminosity among the entire sample, on average. Of the sources identified as having mid-infrared excesses, half are accounted for by using proper bolometric corrections while half show the presence of obscured AGN. We do not find evidence for evolution in the FIR-radio correlation over this redshift range, although the SMGs have IR/radio ratios which are, on average, ~3 times lower than the nominal value.
