We developed a 3D pure LTE radiative transfer code to derive observables expected for RSGs, with emphasis on small scale structures, from radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of red supergiant stars (RSGs) carried out with CO5BOLD (Freytag et al. 2002). We show that the convection-related surface structures are observable with today's interferometers. Moreover, the RHD simulations are a great improvement over parametric models for the interpretation of interferometric observations.
