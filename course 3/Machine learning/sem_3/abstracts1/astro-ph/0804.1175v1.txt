We describe 2DPHOT, a general purpose analysis environment for source detection and analysis in deep wide-field images. 2DPHOT is an automated tool to obtain both integrated and surface photometry of galaxies in an image, to perform reliable star-galaxy separation with accurate estimates of contamination at faint flux levels, and to estimate completeness of the image catalog. We describe the analysis strategy on which 2DPHOT is based, and provide a detailed description of the different algorithms implemented in the package. This new environment is intended as a dedicated tool to process the wealth of data from wide-field imaging surveys. To this end, the package is complemented by 2DGUI, an environment that allows multiple processing of data using a range of computing architectures.
