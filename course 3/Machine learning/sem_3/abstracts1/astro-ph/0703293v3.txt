The mean iron abundance observed in the intergalactic medium (IGM) within galaxy clusters and without galaxy clusters is consistent with the mean amount of iron per unit volume in the Universe which has been produced by standard supernova (SN) explosions with a rate proportional to the cosmic star-formation rate. If most SNe took place inside galaxies, then the IGM could have been enriched with their metals by galactic winds and jets that swept most of the galactic gas with the SNe ejecta into the IGM. A significant fraction of the early SNe, however, could have taken place outside galaxies or within dwarf galaxies, which were later disrupted by tidal interactions, and/or mass loss through fast winds, SN ejecta and jets. Little is known about such intergalactic SNe at high red-shifts. They could have occurred primarily in highly obscured environments, avoiding detection. Supporting evidence for intergalactic SNe is provided by SNe associated with gamma ray bursts (GRBs) without a host galaxy and from the ratio of well localized GRBs with and without a host galaxy. A direct test of whether a significant contribution to the iron abundance in the IGM came from intergalactic SNe would require the measurement of their rate per comoving unit volume as function of red-shift. This may be feasible with IR telescopes, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope.
