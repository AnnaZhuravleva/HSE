Gaskell et al. (2007) introduced polarization reverberation mapping as a new technique to explore the structure of active galactic nuclei. We present modeling results for the time-dependent polarization signal expected from scattering inside a centrally illuminated spheroid. Such a model setup describes a larger corona surrounding the compact source of an active nucleus. Time-delays between the polarized and the total flux are computed and related to the geometry of the cloud and the viewing angle. When including the in-flow dynamics of the cloud, it is possible to constrain its optical depth and velocity, which enables estimations of the mass inflow rate.
