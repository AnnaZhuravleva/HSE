We study second order gravitational effects of local inhomogeneities on the cosmic microwave background radiation in flat universes with matter and a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We find that the general relativistic correction to the Newtonian approximation is negligible at second order provided that the size of the inhomogeneous region is sufficiently smaller than the horizon scale. For a spherically symmetric top-hat type quasi-linear perturbation, the first order temperature fluctuation corresponding to the linear integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is enhanced(suppressed) by the second order one for a compensated void(lump). As a function of redshift of the local inhomogeneity, the second order temperature fluctuations due to evolution of the gravitational potential have a peak before the matter-$\Lambda$ equality epoch for a fixed comoving size and a density contrast. The second order gravitational effects from local quasi-linear inhomogeneities at a redshift z~1 may significantly affect the cosmic microwave background.
