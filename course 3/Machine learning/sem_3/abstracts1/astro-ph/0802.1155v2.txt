In this work we present a modified TOV equation which incorporates the cosmological constant with regard to the recent astronomical observations that the Universe is in a phase of accelerated expansion. Using this modified TOV equation we considered the structure of a neutron star in SdS space-time and calculated maximum mass limit for neutron stars.
