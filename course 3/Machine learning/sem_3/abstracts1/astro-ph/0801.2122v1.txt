Self-consistent stellar models including all effects of atomic diffusion and radiative accelerations as well as mass loss are evolved from the pre main sequence for stars of 1.35-1.5, M$_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity (Z=0.02). A mass loss rate similar to the solar mass loss rate is sufficient to reproduce observations of the star $\tau$UMa. We discuss the effect of mass loss on the iron convection zone that naturally appears beneath the main hydrogen convection zone of these stars. We also find that the effects of mass loss can be distinguished from those caused by turbulence, but are nevertheless able to explain the particularities of the AmFm phenomenon.
