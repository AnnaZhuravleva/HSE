This study reports pulse variation analysis results for the forth discovered accretion-powered millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 during its 2003 outburst observed by {\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}. The pulsation is significantly detected only in the first $\sim$90d out of $\sim$150d observations. The pulse phase variation is too complex to be described as an orbital motion plus a simple polynomial model. The precise orbital parameters with $P_{orb}=40.073601(8)$ min and ${\it a_x}\sin {\it i}=4.823(5)$ lt-ms were obtained after applying the trend removal to the daily observed 150s segments pulse phases folded with a constant spin frequency without Keplerian orbit included. The binary barycenter corrected pulse phases show smooth evolution and clear negative phase shifts coincident with the flares seen on the light curve and the enhancements of fractional pulse amplitude. The non-flare pulse phases for the first $\sim$60d data are well described as a fourth order polynomial implying that the neutron star was spun-up during the first $\sim$60d with a rate $\dot \nu=(1.7\pm0.3) \times 10^{-13}$ Hz/s at the beginning of the outburst. Significant soft phase lags up to $\sim$500 $\mu s$ ($\sim$10% cycle) between 2 to 20 keV were detected for the nonflare pulse phases. We conclude that the anomalous phase shifts are unlikely due to the accretion torque but could result from the ``hot spot'' moving on the surface of neutron star.
