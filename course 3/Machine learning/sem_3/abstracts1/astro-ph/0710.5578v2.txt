We investigate properties of iron fluorescent line arising as a result of illumination of a black hole accretion disc by an X-ray source located above the disc surface. We study in details the light-bending model of variability of the line, extending previous work on the subject.   We indicate bending of photon trajectories to the equatorial plane, which is a distinct property of the Kerr metric, as the most feasible effect underlying reduced variability of the line observed in several objects. A model involving an X-ray source with a varying radial distance, located within a few central gravitational radii around a rapidly rotating black hole, close to the disc surface, may explain both the elongated red wing of the line profile and the complex variability pattern observed in MCG--6-30-15 by XMM-Newton.   We point out also that illumination by radiation which returns to the disc (following the previous reflection) contributes significantly to formation of the line profile in some cases. As a result of this effect, the line profile always has a pronounced blue peak (which is not observed in the deep minimum state in MCG--6-30-15), unless the reflecting material is absent within the innermost 2--3 gravitational radii.
