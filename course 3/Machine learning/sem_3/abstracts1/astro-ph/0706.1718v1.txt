Statistical properties of the intensity in adaptive optics images are usually modeled with a Rician distribution. We study the central point of the image, where this model is inappropriate for high to very high correction levels. The central point is an important problem because it gives the Strehl ratio distribution. We show that the central point distribution can be modeled using a non-central Gamma distribution.
