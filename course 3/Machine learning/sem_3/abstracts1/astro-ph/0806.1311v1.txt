Recent Chandra and Newton observations indicate that there are two-temperature components ($T \sim$ 8 keV, 0.8 keV) of the diffuse x-rays emitted from deep inside the center of Milky Way. We show that this can be explained by the existence of sterile neutrinos, which decay to emit photons that can be bound-free absorbed by the isothermal hot gas particles in the center of Milky Way. This model can account for the two-temperature components naturally as well as the energy needed to maintain the $\sim$ 8 keV temperature in the hot gas. The predicted sterile neutrino mass is between 16-18 keV.
