The evolution of galaxies results from a combination of internal and external processes. The star formation is an internal process transforming cold and dense cores of molecular clouds to stars. It may be triggered internally by expanding shells, or externally, e. g. by galaxy collisions. The gas accretion and galaxy merging events are external contributors to galaxy evolution. They compete with another internal process of galaxy evolution, which is the secular evolution redistributing the mass and angular momentum inside of galaxies as a consequence of bar and spiral arms formation. As a nearby example of gas accretion we mention the interacting system Milky Way - Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Stripping of ISM in galaxy clusters is reviewed as another example of interaction of galaxies with their environment.
