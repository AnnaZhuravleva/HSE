Pulsar timing experiments are reaching sufficient sensitivity to detect a postulated stochastic gravitational wave background generated by merging supermassive black hole systems in the cores of galaxies. We describe the techniques behind the pulsar timing detection method, provide current upper bounds on the amplitude of any gravitational wave background, describe theoretical models predicting the existence of such a background and highlight new techniques for providing a statistically rigorous detection of the background.
