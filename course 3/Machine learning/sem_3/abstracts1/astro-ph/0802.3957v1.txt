A Doppler image of the ZAMS late-type rapidly rotating star LO Pegasi, based on spectra acquired between 12 and 15 September 2003, is presented. The Least Square Deconvolution technique is applied to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the mean rotational broadened line profiles extracted from the observed spectra. In the present application, a unbroadened spectrum is used as a reference, instead of a simple line list, to improve the deconvolution technique applied to extract the mean profiles. The reconstructed image is similar to those previously obtained from observations taken in 1993 and 1998, and shows that LO Peg photospheric activity is dominated by high-latitude spots with a non-uniform polar cap. The latter seems to be a persistent feature as it has been observed since 1993 with little modifications. Small spots, observed between ~ 10 and ~ 60 degrees of latitude, appears to be different with respect to those present in the 1993 and 1998 maps.
