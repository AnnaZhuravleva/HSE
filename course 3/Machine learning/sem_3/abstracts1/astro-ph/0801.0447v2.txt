We present equivalent width measurements and limits of six diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in seven damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs) over the redshift range 0.091<z<0.524, sampling 20.3<log[N(HI)]<21.7. DIBs were detected in only one of the seven DLAs, that which has the highest reddening and metallicity. Based upon the Galactic DIB-N(HI) relation, the 6284 DIB equivalent width upper limits in four of the seven DLAs are a factor of 4-10 times below the 6284 DIB equivalent widths observed in the Milky Way, but are not inconsistent with those present in the Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the Galactic DIB-E(B-V) relation, we determine reddening upper limits for the DLAs in our sample. Based upon the E(B-V) limits, the gas-to-dust ratios, N(HI)/E(B-V), of the four aforementioned DLAs are at least 5 times higher than that of the Milky Way ISM. The ratios of two other DLAs are at least a factor of a few times higher. The best constraints on reddening derive from the upper limits for the 5780 and 6284 DIBs, which yield E(B-V)<0.08 for four of the seven DLAs. Our results suggest that, in DLAs, quantities related to dust, such as reddening and metallicity, appear to have a greater impact on DIB strengths than does HI gas abundance; the organic molecules likely responsible for DIBs in DLA selected sightlines are underabundant relative to sightlines in the Galaxy of similarly high N(HI). With regards to the study of astrobiology, this could have implications for the abundance of organic molecules in redshifted galaxies. However, since DLAs are observed to have low reddening, selection bias likely plays a role in the apparent underabundance of DIBs in DLAs.
