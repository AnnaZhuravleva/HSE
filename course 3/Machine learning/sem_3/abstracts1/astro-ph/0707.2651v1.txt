We report the discovery of a quadruply imaged quasar, SDSSJ125107.57+293540.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up imaging reveals that the system consists of four blue point-like components in a typical cusp lens geometry surrounding a central red galaxy. The source redshift is 0.802 and the lens redshift is 0.410. The maximum image separation between the lensed components is 1"79. While the image configuration is well reproduced by standard mass models with reasonable parameter values, the flux ratios predicted by these models differ from the observed ratios in all bands. This is suggestive of small-scale structures in this lens, although the definitive identification of the anomaly requires more accurate photometry and astrometry.
