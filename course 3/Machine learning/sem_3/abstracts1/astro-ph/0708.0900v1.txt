The deconfinement phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter can continuously occur during spins down of neutron stars. It will lead to the release of latent heat if the transition is the first-order one. We have investigated the energy release of such deconfinement phase transition for rotating hybrid stars model which include mixed phase of hadronic matter and quark matter. The release of latent heat per baryon is calculated through studying a randomly process of infinitesimal compressing. Finally, we can self-consistently get the heating luminosity of deconfinement phase transition by imputing the EOS of mixed phase, and based on the equation of rotation structure of stars.
