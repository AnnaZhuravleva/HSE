We investigate numerically the orbital evolution of massive extrasolar planets within central cavities of their parent protoplanetary discs. Assuming that they arrive at the inner edge of the disc due to type II migration, we show that they spiral further in. We find that in magnetospheric cavities more massive planets stop migrating at a larger distance from the edge of the disc. This effect may qualitatively explain the correlation between masses and orbital periods found for massive planets with P shorter than 5 days.
