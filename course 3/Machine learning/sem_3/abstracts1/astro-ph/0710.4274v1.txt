We performed MHD simulations of very light bipolar jets with density contrasts down to 10^-4 in axisymmetry, which were injected into a medium of constant density and evolved up to 200 kpc (200 r_j) full length. These jets show weak and roundish bow shocks as well as broad cocoons and thermalize their kinetic energy very efficiently. We argue that very light jets are necessary to match low-frequency radio observations of radio lobes as well as the bow shocks seen in X-rays. Due to the slow propagation, the backflows and their turbulent interaction in the midplane are important for a realistic global appearance.
