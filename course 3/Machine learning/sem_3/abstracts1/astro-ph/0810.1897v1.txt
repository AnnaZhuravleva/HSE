We present a large multi-epoch high resolution spectroscopic investigation for the search of binary candidates in the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) M4. The aim of our work is the identification of the binary candidates, and the determination of the binary fraction and of the binary radial distribution. We present a large multi-epoch high resolution spectroscopic investigation for the search of binary candidates in the Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) M4. The aim of our work is the identification of the binary candidates, and the determination of the binary fraction and of the binary radial distribution. The average radial velocity of the observed cluster members is $70.29+/-0.07(+/-0.3)(+/-0.1)km/s. The search for variations in radial velocities among the stars with multi-epoch observations yielded 57 binary star candidates. Our radial velocity measurement accuracy allowed us to identify at a 3sigma level binaries with radial velocity variations larger than ~0.3km/s for the target stars with V<15, and larger than ~0.5km/s for the targets with V>15. We identified 4 binary star candidates out of 97 observed targets inside the core radius, and 53 candidates out of 2372 observed stars outside the core radius. Accounting for the incompleteness affecting our survey, the lower limit for the total binary fraction is f=3.0+/-0.3%. The lower limit for the binary fraction in the cluster core is f=5.1+/-2.3%, while outside the core it decreases to f=3.0+/-0.4%. Similarly, we found f=4.5+/-0.4% and f=1.8+/-0.6% for the binary fraction inside and outside the half mass radius.
