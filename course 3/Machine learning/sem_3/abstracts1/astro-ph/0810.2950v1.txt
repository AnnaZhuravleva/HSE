We investigate the growth and structure of magnetic fields amplified by kinematic dynamo action in turbulence with non-zero kinetic helicity. We assume a simple Gaussian velocity correlation tensor, which allows us to consider very large magnetic Reynolds numbers, up to one trillion. We use the kinematic Kazantsev-Kraichnan model of dynamo and find a complete numerical solution for the correlation functions of growing magnetic fields.
