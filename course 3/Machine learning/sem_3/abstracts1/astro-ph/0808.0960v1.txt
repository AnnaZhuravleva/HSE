Aspects of turbulence in protostellar accretion discs are being reviewed. The emergence of dead zones due to poor ionization and alternatives to the magneto-rotational instability are discussed. The coupling between dust and gas in protostellar accretion discs is explained and turbulent drag is compared with laminar drag in the Stokes and Epstein regimes. Finally, the significance of magnetic field generation in turbulent discs is emphasized in connection with driving outflows and with star-disc coupling.
