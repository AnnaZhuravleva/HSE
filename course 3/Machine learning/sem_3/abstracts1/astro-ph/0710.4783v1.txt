In this paper, we illustrate the main features of the electronics and data acquisition systems of the ANTARES apparatus, a large volume, deep-sea neutrino telescope under construction in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Toulon, France. The apparatus consists of an array of 900 large-area photomultipliers arranged on 12 detection lines, 5 of which are in data acquisition since January 2007. The schedule is to complete the apparatus construction in early 2008.
