A model of the universe as proposed by Allen Rothwarf based upon a degenerate Fermion fluid composed of polarizable particle-antiparticle pairs leads to a big bang model of the universe where the velocity of light varies inversely with the square root of cosmological time, t. This model is here extended to predict a decelerating expansion of the universe and to derive the Tully-Fisher law describing the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. The estimated critical acceleration parameter, aoR, is compared to the experimental, critical modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) cosmological acceleration constant, obtained by fitting a large number of rotation curves. The present estimated value is much closer to the experimental value than that obtained with the other models. This model for aR(t) allows the derivation of the time dependent radius of the universe as a function of red shift Other cosmological parameters such as the velocity of light, Hubble's constant, the Tully-Fisher relation, and the index of refraction of the aether can also be expressed in terms of redshift. This is compared with the statistical fitting for Veron-Cetty data (2006) for quasar red shifts and good agreement is found. This model also determines the time and/or redshift dependence of certain electromagnetic parameters, i.e., the permittivity; the permeability ; and index of refraction of free space. These are found to be useful in various cosmological theories dealing with light passing through media in motion.
