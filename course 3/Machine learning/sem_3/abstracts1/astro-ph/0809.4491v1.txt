This work aims to provide a theoretical formulation of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) in the framework of probabilistic synthesis models, and to distinguish between the different distributions involved in the SBF definition. RESULTS: We propose three definitions of SBF: (i) stellar population SBF, which can be computed from synthesis models and provide an intrinsic metric of fit for stellar population studies; (ii) theoretical SBF, which include the stellar population SBF plus an additional term that takes into account the distribution of the number of stars per resolution element psi(N); theoretical SBF coincide with Tonry & Schneider (1998) definition in the very particular case that psi(N) is assumed to be a Poisson distribution. However, the Poisson contribution to theoretical SBF is around 0.1% of the contribution due to the stellar population SBF, so there is no justification to include any reference to Poisson statistics in the SBF definition; (iii) observational SBF, which are those obtained in observations that are distributed around the theoretical SBF. Finally, we show alternative ways to compute SBF and extend the application of stellar population SBF to defining a metric of fitting for standard stellar population studies. CONCLUSIONS: We demostrate that SBF are observational evidence of a probabilistic paradigm in population synthesis, where integrated luminosities have an intrinsic distributed nature, and they rule out the commonly assumed deterministic paradigm of stellar population modeling.
