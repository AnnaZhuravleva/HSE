We present a spectral line survey of the C-rich envelope CIT 6 in the 2mm and 1.3mm bands carried out with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope and the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). The observations cover the frequency ranges of 131--160 GHz, 219--244 GHz, and 252--268 GHz with typical sensitivity limit of T_R<10 mK. A total of 74 individual emission features are detected, of which 69 are identified to arise from 21 molecular species and isotopologues, with 5 faint lines remaining unidentified. Two new molecules (C4H and CH3CN) and seven new isotopologues (C17O, 29SiC2, 29SiO, 30SiO, 13CS, C33S, and CS) are detected in this object for the first time. The column densities, excitation temperatures, and fractional abundances of the detected molecules are determined using rotation diagram analysis. Comparison of the spectra of CIT 6 to that of IRC+10216 suggests that the spectral properties of CIT 6 are generally consistent with those of IRC+10216. For most of the molecular species, the intensity ratios of the lines detected in the two objects are in good agreement with each other. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting enhanced emission from CN and HC3N and depleted emission from HCN, SiS, and C4H in CIT 6. Based on their far-IR spectra, we find that CIT 6 probably has a lower dust-to-molecular gas ratio than IRC+10216. To investigate the chemical evolution of evolved stars, we compare the molecular abundances in the AGB envelopes CIT 6 and IRC+10216 and those in the bright proto-planetary nebula CRL 618. The implication on the circumstellar chemistry is discussed.
