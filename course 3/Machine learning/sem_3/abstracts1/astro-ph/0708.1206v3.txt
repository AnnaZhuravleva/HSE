In this paper we study the detectability of $\gamma$-rays from dark matter annihilation in the subhalos of the Milky Way by the satellite-based experiments, EGRET and GLAST. We work in the frame of supersymmetric extension of the standard model and assume the lightest neutralino being the dark matter particles. Based on the N-body simulation of the evolution of dark matter subhalos we first calculate the average intensity distribution of this new class of $\gamma$-ray sources by neutralino annihilation. It is possible to detect these $\gamma$-ray sources by EGRET and GLAST. Conversely, if these sources are not detected the nature of the dark matter particls will be constrained by these experiments, which, however, depending on the uncertainties of the subhalo profile.
