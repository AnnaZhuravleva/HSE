We present the galaxy cluster autocorrelation function of 277 galaxy cluster candidates with 0.25 \le z \le 1.5 in a 7 deg^2 area of the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey. We find strong clustering throughout our galaxy cluster sample, as expected for these massive structures. Specifically, at <z> = 0.5 we find a correlation length of r_0 = 17.40^{+3.98}_{-3.10} h^-1 Mpc, in excellent agreement with the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey, the only other non-local measurement. At higher redshift, <z> = 1, we find that strong clustering persists, with a correlation length of r_0=19.14^{+5.65}_{-4.56} h^-1 Mpc. A comparison with high resolution cosmological simulations indicates these are clusters with halo masses of \sim 10^{14} Msun, a result supported by estimates of dynamical mass for a subset of the sample. In a stable clustering picture, these clusters will evolve into massive (10^{15} Msun) clusters by the present day.
