We have constrained the extragalactic source count distributions over a broad range of X-ray fluxes and in various energy bands to test whether the predictions from X-ray background synthesis models agree with the observational constraints provided by our measurements. We have used 1129 XMM-Newton observations at |b|>20 deg covering a sky area of 132.3 deg^2 to compile the largest complete samples of X-ray objects to date in the 0.5-1 keV, 1-2 keV, 2-4.5 keV, 4.5-10 keV, 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV energy bands. Our survey includes in excess of 30,000 sources down to ~10^-15 erg/cm^2/s below 2 keV and down to ~10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s above 2 keV. A break in the source count distributions was detected in all energy bands except the 4.5-10 keV band. An analytical model comprising 2 power-law components cannot adequately describe the curvature seen in the source count distributions. The shape of the logN(>S)-logS is strongly dependent on the energy band with a general steepening apparent as we move to higher energies. This is due to non-AGN populations, comprised mainly of stars and clusters of galaxies, contribute up to 30% of the source population at energies <2 keV and at fluxes >10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, and these populations of objects have significantly flatter source count distributions than AGN. We find a substantial increase in the relative fraction of hard X-ray sources at higher energies, from >55% below 2 keV to >77% above 2 keV. However the majority of sources detected above 4.5 keV still have significant flux below 2 keV. Comparison with predictions from the synthesis models suggest that the models might be overpredicting the number of faint absorbed AGN, which would call for fine adjustment of some model parameters such as the obscured to unobscured AGN ratio and/or the distribution of column densities at intermediate obscuration.
