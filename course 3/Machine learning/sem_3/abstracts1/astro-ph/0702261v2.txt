Fluctuation dynamo action has been obtained for a flow previously used to model fluid turbulence, where the sensitivity of the magnetic field parameters to the kinetic energy spectrum can be explored. We apply quantitative morphology diagnostics, based on the Minkowski functionals, to magnetic fields produced by the kinematic fluctuation dynamo to show that magnetic structures are predominantly filamentary rather than sheet-like. Our results suggest that the thickness, width and length of the structures scale differently with magnetic Reynolds number.
