We present a Suzaku X-ray study of the Sagittarius D (Sgr D) HII region in the Galactic center region. Two 18'x18' images by the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) encompass the entire Sgr D complex. Thanks to the low background, XIS discovered two diffuse sources with low surface brightness and obtained their high signal-to-noise ratio spectra. One is associated with the core of the Sgr D HII region, arising from the young stellar cluster. The other is a new object in the vicinity of the region. We also present 3.5 cm and 6.0 cm radio continuum maps of the new source using the 100 m Green Bank Telescope. We conclude that the source is a new supernova remnant (SNR; G1.2--0.0) based on: (1) the 0.9+/-0.2 keV thermal X-ray spectrum with emission lines from highly ionized atoms; (2) the diffuse nature with an apparent extent of ~10 pc at the Galactic center distance inferred from the X-ray absorption (~8.5x10^{22} cm^{-2}); and (3) the nonthermal radio continuum spectral index (~-0.5). Our discovery of an SNR in the Sgr D HII region leads to a revision of the view of this system, which had been considered to be a thermal HII region and its environment.
