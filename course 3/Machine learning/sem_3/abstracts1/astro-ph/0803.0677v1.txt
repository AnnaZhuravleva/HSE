We measured a sample of 150 pulsar Rotation Measures (RMs) using the 20-cm receiver of the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. 46 of the pulsars in our sample have not had their RM values previously published, whereas 104 pulsar RMs have been revised. We used a novel quadratic fitting algorithm to obtain an accurate RM from the calibrated polarisation profiles recorded across 256 MHz of receiver bandwidth. The new data are used in conjunction with previously known Dispersion Measures (DMs) and the NE2001 electron-density model to study models of the direction and magnitude of the Galactic magnetic field.
