In this paper two theoretical approaches for the calculation of the rate of quasi-stationary, two-dimensional magnetic reconnection with nonuniform anomalous resistivity are considered in the framework of incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In the first, ``global'' equations approach the MHD equations are approximately solved for a whole reconnection layer, including the upstream and downstream regions and the layer center. In the second, ``local'' equations approach the equations are solved across the reconnection layer, including only the upstream region and the layer center. Both approaches give the same approximate answer for the reconnection rate. Our theoretical model is in agreement with the results of recent simulations of reconnection with spatially nonuniform resistivity by Baty, Priest and Forbes (2006), contrary to their conclusions.
