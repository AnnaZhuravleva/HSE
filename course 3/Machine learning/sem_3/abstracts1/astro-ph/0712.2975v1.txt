The origin and evolution of the X-rays in very young stellar objects (YSOs) are not yet well understood since it is very hard to observe YSOs in the protostellar phase. We study the X-ray properties of Class 0-I objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and compare them with those of the more evolved Class II and III members. Using Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) data, we study the X-ray properties of stars in different evolutionary classes: luminosities, NH, temperatures and time variability are compared in order to understand if the interaction between the circumstellar material and the central object can influence the X-ray emission. We have assembled the deepest and most complete photometric catalog of objects in the ONC region from the UV to 8 microns using data from HST, WFI@2.2m ESO and ISPI@4m CTIO telescopes, and Spitzer IRAC. We select high probability candidate Class 0-I protostars, distinguishing between those having a spectral energy distribution which rises from K up to 8 microns (Class 0-Ia) from those where the SED rises from K up to 4.5 microns and decreasing afterwards (Class 0-Ib). We select a sample of bona fide Class II stars and a set of Class III stars with IR emission consistent with normal photospheres. Our principal result is that Class 0-Ia objects are significantly less luminous in X-rays, both in the total and hard bands, than the more evolved Class II stars with mass larger than 0.5 Msun; these latter show X-ray luminosities similar to those of Class 0-Ib stars. This result supports the hypothesis that the onset of X-ray emission occurs at a very early stage of star formation. Temporal variability and spectral properties of Class 0-I stars are similar to those of the more evolved Class II and III objects, except for a larger absorption likely due to gas in the circumstellar material.
