Stellar populations, building blocks of galaxies, are direct tracers of the star formation history, the chemical enrichment and the assembly of galaxies in the Universe. They therfore allow us to understand how galaxies formed and evolved. This last decade has witnessed a revolution in our observations of galaxies; with larger telescopes and new instruments we are not only able to look deeper in the Universe, we can also study nearby galaxies with greater detail. The fact that now is becoming possible to resolve stars up to the distance of Virgo Cluster allows us to rigorously compare and calibrate the analysis of the integrated light with resolved stellar populations. These Proceedings report the considerable progress made in recent years in this topic. Theorists and observers, researchers of resolved and unresolved stellar populations, discussed the ingredients of stellar population models, and rigorously compared them to new data, forcing theorists to develop more refined models and methods to derive the physical parameters of the stellar populations. New results from the Milky Way, the Local Group, and nearby and distant galaxies were presented.
