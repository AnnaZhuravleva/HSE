We study the dependence of the surface magnetic fields of radio pulsars on the choice of Equations of State, pulsar masses and the values of the angle between the magnetic axis and the spin axis of the pulsars within simple dipole model. We show that the values of the surface magnetic field can be even order of magnitude different from its canonical values. This difference will effect any magnetosphere related model to explain observational features of radio pulsars and magnetars. We find a significant difference of the value of the surface magnetic field from the commonly quoted value for the faster member of the double pulsar system, i.e. PSR J0737-3039A as here both the mass of the pulsar and the angle between the magnetic axis and the spin axis are known. Our study reveals the importance of constraining the dense matter Equations of State in pulsar astrophysics as well as hints an alternative way to constrain these by independent determination of the pulsar magnetic field.
