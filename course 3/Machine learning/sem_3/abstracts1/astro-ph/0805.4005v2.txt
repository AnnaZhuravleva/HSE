We develop here a relatively simple description of dark energy based on the dynamics of non-minimally coupled to gravity phantom scalar field which, in limit, corresponds to cosmological constant. The dark energy equation of state, obtained directly from the dynamics of the model, turns out to be an oscillatory function of the scale factor. This parameterisation is compared to other possible dark energy parameterisations, among them, the most popular one, linear in the scale factor. We use the Bayesian framework for model selection and make a comparison in the light of SN Ia, CMB shift parameter, BAO A parameter, observational H(z) and growth rate function data. We find that there is evidence to favour a parameterisation with oscillations over {\it a priori} assumed linear one.
