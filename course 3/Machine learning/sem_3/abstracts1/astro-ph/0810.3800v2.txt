Evolution of self-gravitating rotating dense stellar systems (e.g. globular clusters, galactic nuclei) with embedded black holes is investigated. The interaction between the black hole and stellar component in differential rotating flattened systems is followed. The interplay between velocity diffusion due to relaxation and black hole star accretion is investigated together with cluster rotation using 2D+1 Fokker-Planck numerical methods. The models can reproduce the Bahcall-Wolf solution $f \propto E^{1/4}$ ($n \propto r^{-7/4}$) inside the zone of influence of the black hole. Gravo-gyro and gravothermal instabilities conduce the system to a faster evolution leading to shorter collapse times with respect to the non-rotating systems. Angular momentum transport and star accretion support the development of central rotation in relaxation time scales. We explore system dissolution due to mass-loss in the presence of an external tidal field (e.g. globular clusters in galaxies).
