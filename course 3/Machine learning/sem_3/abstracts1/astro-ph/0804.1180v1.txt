We estimate the intrinsic luminosities and synchrotron peak frequency using the derived Doppler factor for a sample of 170 BL Lac objects, of which the synchrotron peak frequency are derived by fitting the SED constructed with the collected multi-band data from literatures. We find that the debeamed radio and optical core luminosities follow the same correlation found for FR I radio galaxies, which is in support of the unification of the BL Lac objects and the FR I galaxies based on orientation. For the debeamed luminosity at synchrotron peak frequency, we find a significant positive correlation between the luminosity and intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. This implies that the more powerful sources may have the majority of jet emission at higher frequency. At synchrotron peak frequency, the intrinsic luminosity and black hole mass show strong positive correlation, while mild correlation is found in the case of jet power, indicating that the more powerful sources may have heavier black hole.
