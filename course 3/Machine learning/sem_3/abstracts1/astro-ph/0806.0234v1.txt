In this paper we describe a focal plane array (FPA) prototype, based on Vivaldi elements, developed for the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) to increase its instantaneous field of view by a factor 25 and double its current bandwidth. This prototype is the first step in a project that has the ambition to equip most of the WSRT antennas with FPAs to improve the survey speed of the telescope. Examples of scientific applications are surveys of the northern sky in polarised continuum and HI emission, and efficient searches for pulsars and transients.
