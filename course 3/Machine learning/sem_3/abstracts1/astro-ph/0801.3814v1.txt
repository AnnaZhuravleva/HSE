I briefly review our current knowledge of the non thermal emission from galaxy clusters and discuss future prospect with Simbol-X. Simbol-X will map the hard X-ray emission in clusters, determine its origin and disentangle the thermal and non-thermal components. Correlated with radio observations, the observation of the non-thermal X-ray emission, when confirmed, will allow to map both the magnetic field and the relativistic electron properties, key information to understand the origin and acceleration of relativistic particles in clusters and its impact on cluster evolution.
