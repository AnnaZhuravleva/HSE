Low mass surface density spiral and irregular galaxies like low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies are unique laboratories to study the dynamical properties of Dark Matter halos because their mass is generally dominated by dark matter at all galactocentric radii. We present results from the largest sample ever assembled of high resolution Halpha velocity fields of LSB and dwarf galaxies in order to study their mass distributions.
