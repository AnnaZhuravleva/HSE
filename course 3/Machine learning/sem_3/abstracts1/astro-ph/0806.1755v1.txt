We present a preliminary calibration and flight performance of the Long-Slit Imaging Dual Order Spectrograph (LIDOS), a rocket-borne instrument with a large dynamic range in the 900 - 1700A bandpass. The instrument observes UV-bright objects with a CCD channel and fainter nebulosity with an MCP detector. The image quality and the detector quantum efficiencies were determined using the calibration and test equipment at the Johns Hopkins University, and further monitored using an on-board electron-impact calibration lamp. We review results from each of the three flights of the instrument.
