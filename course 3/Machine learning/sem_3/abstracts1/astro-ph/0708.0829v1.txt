We report on the serendipitous discovery of a 442-Hz pulsar during a Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observation of the globular cluster NGC 6440. The oscillation is detected following a burst-like event which was decaying at the beginning of the observation. The time scale of the decay suggests we may have seen the tail-end of a long-duration burst. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are known to emit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that are sometimes modulated by the spin frequency of the star, the so called burst oscillations. The pulsations reported here are peculiar if interpreted as canonical burst oscillations. In particular, the pulse train lasted for ~500 s, much longer than in standard burst oscillations. The signal was highly coherent and drifted down by ~2x10^-3 Hz, much smaller than the ~Hz drifts typically observed during normal bursts. The pulsations are reminiscent of those observed during the much more energetic ``superbursts'', however, the temporal profile and the energetics of the burst suggest that it was not the tail end nor the precursor feature of a superburst. It is possible that we caught the tail end of an outburst from a new `intermittent'' accreting X-ray millisecond pulsar, a phenomenon which until now has only been seen in HETE J1900.1$-$2455 (Galloway et al. 2007). We note that (Kaaret et al. 2003) reported the discovery of a 409.7 Hz burst oscillation from SAX J1748.9-2021, also located in NGC 6440. However, Chandra X-ray   Observatory imaging indicates it contains several point-like X-ray sources, thus the 442 Hz object is likely a different source.
