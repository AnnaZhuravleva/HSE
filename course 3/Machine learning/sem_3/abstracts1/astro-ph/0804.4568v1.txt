The VVDS-Wide survey has been designed with the general aim of tracing the large-scale distribution of galaxies at z~1 on comoving scales reaching ~100Mpc/h, while providing a good control of cosmic variance over areas as large as a few square degrees. This is achieved by measuring redshifts with VIMOS at the ESO VLT to a limiting magnitude I_AB=22.5, targeting four independent fields with size up to 4 sq.deg. each. The whole survey covers 8.6 sq.deg., here we present the general properties of the current redshift sample. This includes 32734 spectra in the four regions (19977 galaxies, 304 type I AGNs, and 9913 stars), covering a total area of 6.1 sq.deg, with a sampling rate of 22 to 24%. The redshift success rate is above 90% independently of magnitude. It is the currently largest area coverage among redshift surveys reaching z~1. We give the mean N(z) distribution averaged over 6.1 sq.deg. Comparing galaxy densities from the four fields shows that in a redshift bin Deltaz=0.1 at z~1 one still has factor-of-two variations over areas as large as ~0.25 sq.deg. This level of cosmic variance agrees with that obtained by integrating the galaxy two-point correlation function estimated from the F22 field alone, and is also in fairly good statistical agreement with that predicted by the Millennium mocks. The variance estimated over the survey fields shows explicitly how clustering results from deep surveys of even ~1 sq.deg. size should be interpreted with caution. This paper accompanies the public release of the first 18143 redshifts of the VVDS-Wide survey from the 4 sq.deg. contiguous area of the F22 field at RA=22h, publicly available at http://cencosw.oamp.fr
