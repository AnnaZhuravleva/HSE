We take a new approach to construct Quintessential models. With this approach, we first easily obtain a tracker solution that is different from those discovered before and straightforwardly find a solution of multiple attractors, i.e., a solution with more than one attractor for a given set of parameters. Then we propose a scenario of Quintessence where the field jumps out of the scaling attractor to the de-Sitter-like attractor, by introducing a field whose value changes a certain amount in a short time, leading to the current acceleration. We also calculate the change the field needs for a successful jump and suggest a possible mechanism that involves spontaneous symmetry breaking to realize the sudden change of the field value.
