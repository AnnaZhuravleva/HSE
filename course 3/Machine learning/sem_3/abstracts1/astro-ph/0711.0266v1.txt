We present mid-infrared observations of 18 sources from a sample of 21 z~2 radio-intermediate obscured quasars. The mid-infrared spectra of the sources are continuum dominated, and 12 sources show deep silicate absorption with tau_9.7~1-2. Combining mid-infrared and optical spectra, we achieve 86% spectroscopic completeness which allows us to confirm that most (63 +14 -22 %) z~2 radio-intermediate quasars are obscured. The new spectra also prove that many high-redshift type-2 quasars do not show any rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines. From the 18 individual mid-infrared spectra, we classify most of the sources into three subsamples: those with hints of the 7.7 and 6.2 micron polyaromatic hydrocarbons (3/18 sources show PAHs, subsample A), those with an excess of emission around 8 micron but no hint of the 6.2 micron PAH (7/18 cases, subsample B) and pure-continuum sources with no visible excess (4/18 sources, subsample C). The remaining 4/18 sources have spectra that are featureless or too noisy for any features to be visible. In subsample A, averaging the spectra leads to a statistical detection of both 6.2 and 7.7 micron PAHs over the continuum, with the strength of the 7.7 micron PAH comparable to that of submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) at similar redshifts. These sources are in a phase of coeval growth of a supermassive black hole and a host galaxy.
