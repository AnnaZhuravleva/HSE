We consider viscosity and thermal conductivity as dissipation mechanisms to derive a general dispersion relation for MHD waves propagating in a homogeneous plasma. We show that the actual dispersion relation for MHD waves in a homogeneous medium must be six-order. The finding is in agreement (except some coefficients) with the results of Porter et al. (1994) but it is in disagreement with the previous results obtained by Kumar et al. (2006). We also discuss in detail differences between our approach and those considered by other authors.
