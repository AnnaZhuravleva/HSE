Progress in understanding the formation and evolution of planetary nebulae (PN) has been restricted by a paucity of well-determined central star masses.   To address this deficiency we aim to (i) significantly increase the number of known eclipsing binary central stars of PN (CSPN), and subsequently (ii) directly obtain their masses and absolute dimensions by combining their light-curve parameters with planned radial velocity data.   Using photometric data from the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) we have searched for periodic variability in a large sample of PN towards the Galactic Bulge using Fourier and phase-dispersion minimisation techniques.   Among some dozen periodically variable CSPN found, we report here on three new eclipsing binaries: M 3-16, H 2-29 and M 2-19.   We present images, confirmatory spectroscopy and light-curves of the systems.
