We present stellar evolution calculations for Population III stars for both single and binary star evolution. Our models include 10 Msun and 16.5 Msun single stars and a 10 Msun model star that undergoes an episode of accretion resulting in a final mass of 16.1 Msun. For comparison, we present the evolution of a solar heavy element abundance model. We use the structure from late stage evolution models to calculate simulated supernova light curves. Light curve comparisons are made between accretion and non-accretion progenitor models, and models for single star evolution of comparable masses. Where possible, we make comparisons to previous works. Similar investigations have been carried out, but primarily for solar or near solar heavy metal abundance stars and not including both the evolution and supernovae explosions in one work.
