Tachyonic inflationary universe model in the context of a Chaplygin gas equation of state is studied. General conditions for this model to be realizable are discussed. By using an effective exponential potential we describe in great details the characteristic of the inflationary universe model. The parameters of the model are restricted by using recent astronomical observations.
