A long term, multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on the TeV binary LS I +61 303 has been performed utilizing >300 GeV observations with VERITAS along with monitoring in the 0.2-10 keV band by RXTE and Swift between September 2006 and February 2008. The source was detected by VERITAS as a variable TeV source with flux values ranging from 5-20% of the Crab Nebula flux with the strongest flux levels appearing around apastron. X-ray observations by RXTE and Swift show the source as a highly variable hard X-ray source with flux values varying in the range of 0.5-3*10^-11 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 over a single orbital cycle. The 2007-2008 RXTE data set also shows the presence of several extremely large flaring episodes presenting a flux of up to 7.2*10^-11 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, the largest such flare recorded from this source. Comparison of the contemporaneous TeV and X-ray data does not show a correlation at this time, however, the sparsity of data sets do not preclude the existence of such a correlation.
