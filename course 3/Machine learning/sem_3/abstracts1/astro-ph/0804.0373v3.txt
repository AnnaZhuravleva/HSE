We study the corrections to the galaxy three-point correlation function (3PCF) induced by weak lensing magnification due to the matter distribution along the line of sight. We consistently derive all the correction terms arising up to second order in perturbation theory and provide analytic expressions as well as order of magnitude estimates for their relative importance. The magnification contributions depend on the geometry of the projected triangle on the sky plane, and scale with different powers of the number count slope and redshift of the galaxy sample considered. We evaluate all terms numerically and show that, depending on the triangle configuration as well as the galaxy sample considered, weak lensing can in general significantly contribute to and alter the three-point correlation function observed through galaxy and quasar catalogs.
