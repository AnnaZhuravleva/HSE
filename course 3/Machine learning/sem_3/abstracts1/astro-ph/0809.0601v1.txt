We present an analysis of the chemical abundances of the star Tycho G in the direction of the remnant of supernova (SN) 1572, based on Keck high-resolution optical spectra. The stellar parameters of this star are found to be those of a G-type subgiant with $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5900 \pm 100$ K, \loggl $ = 3.85 \pm 0.30$ dex, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -0.05 \pm 0.09$. This determination agrees with the stellar parameters derived for the star in a previous survey for the possible companion star of SN 1572 (Ruiz-Lapuente et al. 2004). The chemical abundances follow the Galactic trends, except for Ni, which is overabundant relative to Fe, $[{\rm Ni/Fe}] $ $=$ 0.16 $\pm$ 0.04. Co is slightly overabundant (at a low significance level). These enhancements in Fe-peak elements could have originated from pollution by the supernova ejecta. We find a surprisingly high Li abundance for a star that has evolved away from the main sequence. We discuss these findings in the context of companion stars of supernovae.
