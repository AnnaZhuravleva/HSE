Looking for spectroscopic families in the whole set of discovered diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) is an indirect trial of solving the problem of DIBs' carriers. Basing on optical high resolution spectra, covering the range from 5655 to 7020 \AA, we found few relatively strong DIBs which are not well correlated one with another and therefore they may play a role of representatives of separate spectroscopic families. In the next step we indicated DIBs which tend to follow the behaviour of their representatives. As a result of our analysis we propose few, probably not complete yet, spectroscopic families of DIBs.
