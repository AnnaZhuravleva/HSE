The yellow hypergiant stars (YHGs) are very massive objects that are expected to pass through periods of intense mass loss during their evolution. Despite of this, massive circumstellar envelopes have been found only in two of them, IRC+10420 and AFGL 2343. The envelopes around these objects and the processes that form them are poorly known. We aim to study the structure, dynamics and chemistry of the envelope around AFGL 2343. We have obtained interferometric maps of the rotational lines 29SiO J= 2-1, HCN J= 1-0 and SO J(K)= 2(2)-1(1) towards AFGL 2343. We have used an LVG excitation model to analyze the new observations and some previously published line profiles of AFGL 2343. The analysis of the observational data and the fitting results show the presence of a thin, hot and dense component within the previously identified CO shell. This component can be associated with recently shocked gas, but it could also be due to a phase of extremely copious mass loss. We suggest that this shell is the responsible for the whole 29SiO emission and significantly contributes to the HCN emission. The presence of such a dense shell rich in SiO can be related with that previously found for IRC+10420, which was also suggested to result from a shock. This may be a common feature in the evolution of these stars, as a consequence of the episodic mass loss periods that they pass during their evolution. We present new results for the mass loss pattern, the total mass of the circumstellar envelope and the molecular abundances of some species in AFGL 2343.
