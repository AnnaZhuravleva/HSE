We present the results of the timing analysis of five Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of the Black Hole Candidate GRS 1915+105 between 1996 September and 1997 December. The aim was to investigate the possible presence of a type-B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). Since in other systems this QPO is found to appear during spectral transitions from Hard to Soft states, we analyzed observations characterized by a fast and strong variability, in order to have a large number of transitions. In GRS 1915+105, transitions occur on very short time scales (~ sec): to single them out we averaged Power Density Spectra following the regular path covered by the source on a 3D Hardness-Hardness-Intensity Diagram. We identified both the type-C and the type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs): this is the first detection of a type-B QPO in GRS 1915+105. As the spectral transitions have been associated to the emission and collimation of relativistic radio-jets, their presence in the prototypical galactic jet source strengthens this connection.
