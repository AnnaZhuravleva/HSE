The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle physics detector designed to measure charged cosmic ray spectra with energies up to the TeV region and with high energy photon detection capability up to few hundred GeV. It will be installed on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008 and will operate for more than three years. Due to its large acceptance, the flight duration and the state-of-art of particle identification techniques, AMS will have a remarkable sensitivity on antimatter and dark matter searches. The addition of different detector systems provide AMS with complementary and redundant electric charge and velocity measurements. The velocity of singly charged particles is expected to be measured with a precision of 0.1% and charge separation up to iron is attainable. The AMS capability of measuring a large range of electric charges and accurate velocities, will largely contribute to a better understanding of cosmic ray production, acceleration and propagation mechanisms in the galaxy.
