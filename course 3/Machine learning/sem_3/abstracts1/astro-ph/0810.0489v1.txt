We observed the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 with Gemini-South in g' and i' bands, nearly simultaneous with XMM-Newton observations. A clear periodic flux modulation on the system's orbital period is present, consistent with the varying aspect of the donor star's heated face. We model the contributions of a disk and donor star to these optical bands. To produce the observed modulation amplitudes, we conclude that the donor must be irradiated by an external flux 2 orders of magnitude greater than provided by the measured X-ray luminosity. A possible explanation for this irradiation is that the radio pulsar mechanism becomes active during the quiescent state as suggested by Burderi et al., with relativistic particles heating the donor's day-side face. Our modelling constrains the binary inclination to be between 36 and 67 degrees. We obtain estimates for the pulsar mass of >2.2 solar masses (although this limit is sensitive to the source's distance), consistent with the accelerated NS cooling in this system indicated by X-ray observations. We also estimate the donor mass to be in the range of 0.07-0.11 solar masses, providing further indications that the system underwent non-standard binary evolution to reach its current state.
