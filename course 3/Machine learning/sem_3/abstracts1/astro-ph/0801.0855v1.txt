In this Letter, we propose that a microphysical process takes a vital role in the shocked region in which the prompt emission of GRBs is emitted. The turbulent energy is included in the internal energy transferred by the kinetic energy of the shock. It dissipates through stochastic acceleration for the electrons to supply the early X-ray emission in the phase of shallow decay. We put the constraints on the time evolution of microphysical parameters. The early X-ray fluxes can be obtained by this scenario and these results are consistent with the Swift observation
