We present sensitive and high angular resolution (~1") 1.3 mm continuum observations of the dusty core D-MM1 in the Spokes cluster in NGC 2264 using the Submillimeter Array. A dense micro-cluster of seven Class 0 sources was detected in a 20" x 20" region with masses between 0.4 to 1.2 solar masses and deconvolved sizes of about 600 AU. We interpret the 1.3 mm emission as arising from the envelopes of the Class 0 protostellar sources. The mean separation of the 11 known sources (SMA Class 0 and previously known infrared sources) within D-MM1 is considerably smaller than the characteristic spacing between sources in the larger Spokes cluster and is consistent with hierarchical thermal fragmentation of the dense molecular gas in this region.
