The precision study of dark matter using weak lensing by large scale structure is strongly constrained by the accuracy with which one can measure galaxy shapes. Several methods have been devised but none have demonstrated the ability to reach the level of precision required by future weak lensing surveys. In this Letter we explore new avenues to the existing Shapelets approach, combining a priori knowledge of the galaxy profile with the power of orthogonal basis function decomposition. This Letter discusses the new issues raised by this matched filter approach and proposes promising alternatives to shape measurement techniques. In particular it appears that the use of a matched filter (e.g. Sersic profile) restricted to elliptical radial fitting functions resolves several well known Shapelet issues.
