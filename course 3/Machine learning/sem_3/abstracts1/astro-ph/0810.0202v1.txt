If the jets of microquasars carry a significant power in the form of relativistic hadrons, then gamma rays and neutrinos can be produced by interactions with matter and photon fields either external or internal to the jet. In this paper I present some recent results of calculations of the interaction of hadronic jets with 1) matter of the jet itself, 2) photon fields generated by synchrotron radiation of both protons and electrons, and 3) matter external to the jet (e.g. a clumped wind). I briefly discuss neutrino production in these scenarios and the prospects of detection with new gamma-ray instruments. Finally, I make a few comments on the controversy about the nature of LS I +61 303.
