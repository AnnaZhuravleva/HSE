We analyze the rotation curves of 10 spiral galaxies with a newtonian potential corrected with an extra logarithmic term, using a disc modelization for the spiral galaxies. There is a new constant associated with the extra term in the potential. The rotation curve of the chosen sample of spiral galaxies is well reproduced for a given range of the new constant. It is argued that this correction can have its origin from string configurations. The compatibility of this correction with local physics is discussed.
