We reexamine the impact of dark matter (DM) annihilation on the intergalactic medium, taking into account the clumping of DM particles. We find that energy injection from the annihilation of the thermal relic DM particles may significantly raise the gas temperature at high redshifts and leave a strong imprint on the cosmological 21-cm signal, provided the particle mass is below ~1 TeV. Further, we find that while the energy injection from DM annihilation could not alone complete the reionization of the Universe, it could make a significant contribution to the electron optical depth.
