Radio continuum emission from the supernova remnant G296.5+10.0 was observed using the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Using a 104 MHz bandwidth split into 13 x 8 MHz spectral channels, it was possible to produce a pixel-by-pixel image of Rotation Measure (RM) across the entire remnant. A lack of correlation between RM and X-ray surface brightness reveals that the RMs originate from outside the remnant. Using this information, we will characterise the smooth component of the magnetic field within the supernova remnant and attempt to probe the magneto-ionic structure and turbulent scale sizes in the ISM and galactic halo along the line-of-sight.
