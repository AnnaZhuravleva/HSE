We introduce a new polarimeter installed on the high-resolution fiber-fed echelle spectrograph (called BOES) of the 1.8-m telescope at the Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, Korea. The instrument is intended to measure stellar magnetic fields with high-resolution (R $\sim$ 60000) spectropolarimetric observations of intrinsic polarization in spectral lines. In this paper we describe the spectropolarimeter and present test observations of the longitudinal magnetic fields in some well-studied F-B main sequence magnetic stars (m_v < 8.8^m). The results demonstrate that the instrument has a high precision ability of detecting the fields of these stars with typical accuracies ranged from about 2G to a few tens of gauss.
