We present molecular line observations of L1251B, a small group of pre- and protostellar objects, and its immediate environment in the dense C18O core L1251E. These data are complementary to near-infrared, submillimeter and millimeter continuum observations reported by Lee et al. (2006, ApJ, 648, 491; Paper I). The single-dish data of L1251B described here show very complex kinematics including infall, rotation and outflow motions, and the interferometer data reveal these in greater detail. Interferometer data of N2H+ 1-0 suggest a very rapidly rotating flattened envelope between two young stellar objects, IRS1 and IRS2. Also, interferometer data of CO 2-1 resolve the outflow associated with L1251B seen in single-dish maps into a few narrow and compact components. Furthermore, the high resolution data support recent theoretical studies of molecular depletions and enhancements that accompany the formation of protostars within dense cores. Beyond L1251B, single-dish data are also presented of a dense core located ~150" to the east that, in Paper I, was detected at 850 micron but has no associated point sources at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths. The relative brightness between molecules, which have different chemical timescales, suggests it is less chemically evolved than L1251B. This core may be a site for future star formation, however, since line profiles of HCO+, CS, and HCN show asymmetry with a stronger blue peak, which is interpreted as an infall signature.
