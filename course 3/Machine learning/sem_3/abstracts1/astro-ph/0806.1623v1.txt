We use deep multi-colour (UBVRIJK) images mostly taken in the framework of the ESO Deep Public Survey (DPS) to optically identify and derive photometric redshifts for a complete sample of 131 radio sources with S>0.4 mJy, observed at both 1.4 and 5 GHz as part of the ATESP radio survey. The availability of multi-wavelength radio and optical information is exploited to infer the physical properties of the faint radio population. In particular we find that, considering both early-type galaxies and quasars as sources with an active nucleus, AGNs largely dominate our sample sub-mJy sample (78%). Further radio/optical analysis of such AGN component has revealed a somewhat unexpected class of flat/inverted-spectrum sources with low radio-to-optical ratios (R<100), which are preferentially identified with early-type galaxies. Such sources are quite compact (d<10-30 kpc), suggesting core-dominated radio emission triggered by low luminosity AGNs. This intriguing class of objects deserves further analysis, and new higher resolution radio observations are currently under way. In parallel we are developing radio source models, for both the AGN and the star-forming components of the sub-mJy radio pupulation. Here we discuss the first results.
