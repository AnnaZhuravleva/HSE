For the 2dFGRS we study the properties of voids and of fainter galaxies within voids that are defined by brighter galaxies. Our results are compared with simulated galaxy catalogues from the Millenium simulation coupled with a semianalytical galaxy formation recipe. We derive the void size distribution and discuss its dependence on the faint magnitude limit of the galaxies defining the voids. While voids among faint galaxies are typically smaller than those among bright galaxies, the ratio of the void sizes to the mean galaxy separation reaches larger values. This is well reproduced in the mock galaxy samples studied. We provide analytic fitting functions for the void size distribution. Furthermore, we study the galaxy population inside voids defined by objects with $B_J -5\log{h}< -20$ and diameter larger than 10 \hMpc. We find a clear bimodality of the void galaxies similar to the average comparison sample. We confirm the enhanced abundance of galaxies in the blue cloud and a depression of the number of red sequence galaxies. There is an indication of a slight blue shift of the blue cloud. Furthermore, we find that galaxies in void centers have higher specific star formation rates as measured by the $\eta$ parameter. We determine the radial distribution of the ratio of early and late type galaxies through the voids. We find and discuss some differences between observations and the Millenium catalogues.
