We compare the clustering properties of the combined dataset of ultra-high energy cosmic rays events, reported by the AGASA, HiRes, Yakutsk and Sugar collaborations, with a catalogue of galaxies of the local universe (redshift z<~0.06). We find that the data reproduce particularly well the clustering properties of the nearby universe within z <~0.02. There is no statistically significant cross-correlation between data and structures, although intriguingly the nominal cross-correlation chance probability drops from ~50% to ~10% using the catalogue with a smaller horizon. Also, we discuss the impact on the robustness of the results of deflections in some galactic magnetic field models used in the literature. These results suggest a relevant role of magnetic fields (possibly extragalactic ones, too) and/or possibly some heavy nuclei fraction in the UHECRs. The importance of a confirmation of these hints by Auger data is emphasized.
