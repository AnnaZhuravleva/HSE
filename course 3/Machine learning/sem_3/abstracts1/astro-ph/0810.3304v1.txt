A new multi-frequency synthesis algorithm for reconstructing images from multi-frequency VLBI data is proposed. The algorithm is based on a generalized maximum-entropy method, and makes it possible to derive an effective spectral correction for images over a broad frequency bandwidth, while simultaneously reconstructing the spectral-index distribution over the source. The results of numerical simulations demonstrating the capabilities of the algorithm are presented.
