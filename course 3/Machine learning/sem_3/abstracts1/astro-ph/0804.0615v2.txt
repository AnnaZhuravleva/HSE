We present a Ks-selected catalog, dubbed FIREWORKS, for the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) containing photometry in U_38, B_435, B, V, V_606, R, i_775, I, z_850, J, H, Ks, [3.6 um], [4.5 um], [5.8 um], [8.0 um], and the MIPS [24 um] band. The imaging has a typical Ks limit of 24.3 mag (5 sigma, AB) and coverage over 113 arcmin^2 in all bands and 138 arcmin^2 in all bands but H. We cross-correlate our catalog with the 1 Ms X-ray catalog by Giacconi et al. (2002) and with all available spectroscopic redshifts to date. We find and explain systematic differences in a comparison with the 'z_850 + Ks'-selected GOODS-MUSIC catalog that covers ~90% of the field. We exploit the U38-to-24 micron photometry to determine which Ks-selected galaxies at 1.5<z<2.5 have the brightest total IR luminosities and which galaxies contribute most to the integrated total IR emission. The answer to both questions is that red galaxies are dominating in the IR. This is true no matter whether color is defined in the rest-frame UV, optical, or optical-to-NIR. We do find however that among the reddest galaxies in the rest-frame optical, there is a population of sources with only little mid-IR emission, suggesting a quiescent nature.
