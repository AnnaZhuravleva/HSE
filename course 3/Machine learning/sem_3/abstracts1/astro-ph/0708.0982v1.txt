We present multi-object spectroscopy of galaxies in the immediate (Mpc-scale) environments of four low-power (L_1.4 GHz < 10^25 W/Hz) radio galaxies at z~0.5, selected from the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field. We use the spectra to calculate velocity dispersions and central redshifts of the groups the radio galaxies inhabit, and combined with XMM-Newton (0.3-10 keV) X-ray observations investigate the L_X--sigma_v and T_X--sigma_v scaling relationships. All the radio galaxies reside in moderately rich groups -- intermediate environments between poor groups and rich clusters, with remarkably similar X-ray properties. We concentrate our discussion on our best statistical example that we interpret as a low-power (FRI) source triggered within a sub-group, which in turn is interacting with a nearby group of galaxies, containing the bulk of the X-ray emission for the system -- a basic scenario which can be compared to more powerful radio sources at both high (z>4) and low (z<0.1) redshifts. This suggests that galaxy-galaxy interactions triggered by group mergers may play an important role in the life-cycle of radio galaxies at all epochs and luminosities.
