The binary YY Gem shows many interesting properties, one of which is the periodicity in its flaring rate. The period, which is about $48 \pm 3$ min, was ever interpreted in terms of the oscillation of a filament. In this paper, we propose a new model to explain this phenomenon by means of 2.5-dimensional MHD numerical simulations. It is found that magnetic reconnection is induced as the coronal loops rooted on both stars inflate and approach each other, which is driven by the differential stellar rotation. The magnetic reconnection is modulated by fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves which are trapped between the surfaces of the two stars, so that the reconnection rate presents a periodic behaviour. With the typical parameters for the binary system, the observed period can be reproduced. We also derive an empirical formula to relate the period of the flaring rate to the coronal temperature and density, as well as the magnetic field.
