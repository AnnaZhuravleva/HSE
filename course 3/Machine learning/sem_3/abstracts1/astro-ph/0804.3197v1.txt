Based on the Thomas-Fermi approach, we describe and distinguish the electron distributions around extended nuclear cores: (i) in the case that cores are neutral for electrons bound by protons inside cores and proton and electron numbers are the same; (ii) in the case that super charged cores are bare, electrons (positrons) produced by vacuum polarization are bound by (fly into) cores (infinity).
