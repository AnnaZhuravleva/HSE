We present a three-dimensional photoionisation and dust radiative transfer model of NGC 6302, an extreme, high-excitation planetary nebula. We use the 3D photoionisation code Mocassin} to model the emission from the gas and dust. We have produced a good fit to the optical emission-line spectrum, from which we derived a density distribution for the nebula. A fit to the infrared coronal lines places strong constraints on the properties of the unseen ionising source. We find the best fit comes from using a 220,000 K hydrogen-deficient central star model atmosphere, indicating that the central star of this PN may have undergone a late thermal pulse.   We have also fitted the overall shape of the ISO spectrum of NGC 6302 using a dust model with a shallow power-law size distribution and grains up to 1.0 micron in size. To obtain a good fit to the infrared SED the dust must be sufficiently recessed within the circumstellar disk to prevent large amounts of hot dust at short wavelengths, a region where the ISO spectrum is particularly lacking. These and other discoveries are helping to unveil many properties of this extreme object and trace it's evolutionary history.
