Non thermal emission from galaxy clusters demonstrates the existence of relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM). Present instruments do not allow to firmly establish the energy associated to these components. In a few years gamma ray observations will put important constraints on the energy content of non thermal hadrons in clusters, while the combination of radio and hard X-ray data will be crucial to measure the energy content in the form of relativistic electrons and magnetic field. SIMBOL-X is expected to drive an important breakthrough in the field also because it is expected to operate in combination with the forthcoming low frequency radio telescopes (LOFAR, LWA). In this contribution we report first estimates of statistical properties of the hard X-ray emission in the framework of the re-acceleration model. This model allows to reproduce present radio data for Radio Halos and to derive expectations for future low frequency radio observations, and thus our calculations provide hints for observational strategies for future radio and hard--X-ray combined observations.
