We use a new method to trace backwards the star formation history of the Milky Way disk, using a sample of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood which is representative for the entire solar circle. M stars are used because they show H_alpha emission until a particular age which is a well calibrated function of their absolute magnitudes. This allows us to reconstruct the rate at which disk stars have been born over about half the disk's lifetime. Our star formation rate agrees well with those obtained by using other, independent, methods and seems to rule out a constant star formation rate.   The principal result of this study is to show that a relation of the Schmidt-Kennicut type (which relates the star formation rate to the interstellar gas content of galaxy disks) has pertained in the Milky Way disk during the last 5 Gyr. The star formation rate we derive from the M dwarfs and the interstellar gas content of the disk can be inferred as a function of time from a model of the chemical enrichment of the disk, which is well constrained by the observations indicating that the metallicity of the Galactic disk has remained nearly constant over the timescales involved. We demonstrate that the star formation rate and gas surface densities over the last 5 Gyrs can be accurately described by a Schmidt-Kennicutt law with an index of Gamma = 1.45 (+0.22,-0.09). This is, within statistical uncertainties, the same value found for other galaxies.
