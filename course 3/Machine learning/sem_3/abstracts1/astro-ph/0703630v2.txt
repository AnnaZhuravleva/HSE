We apply the Statefinder diagnostic to the Modified Polytropic Cardassian Universe in this work. We find that the Statefinder diagnostic is quite effective to distinguish Cardassian models from a series of other cosmological models. The $s-r$ plane is used to classify the Modified Polytropic Cardassian models into six cases. The evolutionary trajectories in the $s-r$ plane for the cases with different $n$ and $\beta$ reveal different evolutionary properties of the universe. In addition, we combine the observational $H(z)$ data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data to make a joint analysis. We find that \textbf{Case 2} can be excluded at the 68.3% confidence level and any case is consistent with the observations at the 95.4% confidence level.
