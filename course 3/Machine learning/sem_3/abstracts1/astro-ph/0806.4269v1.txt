It is widely accepted that the progenitors of core collapse SNe are young massive stars and therefore their host galaxies are mostly spiral or irregular galaxies dominated by a young stellar population. Surprisingly, among morphologically classified hosts of core collapse SNe, we find 22 cases where the host has been classified as an Elliptical or S0 galaxy. To clarify this apparent contradiction, we carry out a detailed morphological study and an extensive literature search for additional information on the sample objects. Our results are as follows: 1. Of 22 "early type" objects, 17 are in fact misclassified spiral galaxies, one is a misclassified irregular, and one is a misclassified ring galaxy. 2. Of the 3 objects maintaining the early type classification, one (NGC2768) is a suspected merger remnant, another (NGC4589) is definitely a merger, and the third (NGC2274) is in close interaction. The presence of some amount of young stellar population in these galaxies is therefore not unexpected. These results confirm the presence of a limited, but significant, number of core collapse SNe in galaxies generally classified of early type. In all cases, anyway, there are independent indicators of the presence in host galaxies of recent star formation due to merging or gravitational interaction.
