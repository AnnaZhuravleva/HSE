We present deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS and NICMOS images of six bright Lyman-break galaxy candidates that were previously discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that five of the objects are consistent with unresolved point sources. Although somewhat atypical of the class, they are most likely LoBAL quasars, perhaps FeLoBALs. The sixth object, J1147, has a faint companion galaxy located ~0.8 arcsec to the southwest. The companion contributes ~8% of the flux in the observed-frame optical and infrared. It is unknown whether this companion is located at the same redshift as J1147.
