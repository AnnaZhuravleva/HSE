The objective of the PSU/TCfA Search for Planets Around Evolved Stars is to study evolution of planetary systems in the stellar evolution timescale. For such an analysis precise physical parameters of the hosts of the planetary systems are essential. In this paper we present an attempt to obtain basic physical parameters for a sample of evolved stars observed within our survey with the High Resolution Spectrograph of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.
