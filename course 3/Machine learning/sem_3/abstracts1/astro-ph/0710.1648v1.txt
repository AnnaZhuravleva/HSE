We have carried out a search for radio emission from six X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) observed with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Radio Telescope (GBT) at 820 MHz. No bursty or pulsed radio emission was found down to a 4sigma significance level. The corresponding flux limit is 0.01-0.04 mJy depending on the integration time for the particular source and pulse duty cycle of 2%. These are the most sensitive limits yet on radio emission from these objects.
