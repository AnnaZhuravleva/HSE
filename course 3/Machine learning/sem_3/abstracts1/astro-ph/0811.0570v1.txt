Multi-wavelength studies at radio, infrared, optical, X-ray, and TeV wavelengths have discovered probable counterparts to many Galactic sources of GeV emission detected by EGRET. These include pulsar wind nebulae, high mass X-ray binaries, and mixed morphology supernova remnants. Here we provide an overview of the observational properties of Galactic sources which emit across 19 orders of magnitude in energy. We also present new observations of several sources.
