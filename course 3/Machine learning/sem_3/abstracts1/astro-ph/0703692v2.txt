Using VLT/ISAAC, we detected 2 candidate counterparts to the bursting pulsar GRO J1744-28, one bright and one faint, within the X-ray error circles of XMM-Newton and Chandra. In determining the spectral types of the counterparts we applied 3 different extinction corrections; one for an all-sky value, one for a Galactic Bulge value and one for a local value. We find the local value, with an extinction law of alpha = 3.23 +- 0.01 is the only correction that results in colours and magnitudes for both bright and faint counterparts consistent with a small range of spectral types, and for the bright counterpart, consistent with the spectroscopic identification. Photometry of the faint candidate indicates it is a K7/M0 V star at a distance of 3.75 +- 1 kpc. This star would require a very low inclination angle (i < 9deg) to satisfy the mass function constraints; however it cannot be excluded as the counterpart without follow-up spectroscopy to detect emission signatures of accretion. Photometry and spectroscopy of the bright candidate indicate it is most likely a G/K III star. The spectrum does not show Br-gamma emission, a known indicator of accretion. The bright star's magnitudes are in agreement with the constraints placed on a probable counterpart by the calculations of Rappaport & Joss (1997) for an evolved star that has had its envelope stripped. The mass function indicates the counterpart should have M < 0.3 Msol for an inclination of i >= 15deg; a stripped giant, or a main sequence M3+ V star are consistent with this mass-function constraint. In both cases mass-transfer, if present, will be by wind-accretion as the counterpart will not fill its Roche lobe given the observed orbital period. The derived magnetic field of 2.4 x 10^{11} G will inhibit accretion by the propeller effect, hence its quiescent state.
