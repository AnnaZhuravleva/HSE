Using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), we have detected the (J,K) = (1,1) to (10,10) ammonia inversion lines, up to 1030 K above the ground state, in a face-on spiral galaxy viewed against the radio continuum of the lensed background source PKS 1830-211. The ammonia absorption lines, seen at redshift 0.886, appear to be optically thin with absolute peak flux densities up to 2.5 percent of the total continuum of the background source. Measured intensities are consistent with a kinetic temperature of 80 K for 80-90 percent of the ammonia column. The remaining gas is warmer, reaching at least 600 K. Column density and fractional abundance are of order (5-10) x 10^14 cm^-2 and (1.5-3.0) x 10^-8. Similarities with a hot ammonia absorption component observed toward the Sgr B2 region close to the Galactic center may suggest that the Sgr B2 component also originates from warm diffuse low-density molecular gas. The warm ammonia column observed toward PKS 1830-211 is unique in the sense that it originates in a spiral arm.
