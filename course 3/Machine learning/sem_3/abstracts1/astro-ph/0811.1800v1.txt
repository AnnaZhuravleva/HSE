Recently, Y. Sobouti (2007) has provided a metric theory f(R) that can account for certain dynamical anomalies observed in spiral galaxies. Mendoza & Rosas-Guevara (2007) have shown that in this theory there is an extra-bending as compared to standard general relativity. In the present work we have developed in more specific detail this additional lensing effect and we have made evaluations of the alpha parameter used in the model adjusting the theory to observations in X-rays of 13 clusters of galaxies with gravitational lensing (Hoekstra (2007)).
