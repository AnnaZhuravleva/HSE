We have obtained long-slit observations in the optical and near infrared of 12 circumnuclear HII regions (CNSFR) in the early type spiral galaxies NGC 2903, NGC 3351 and NGC 3504 with the aim of deriving their chemical abundances. Only for one of the regions, the [SIII] $\lambda$ 6312 \AA was detected providing, together with the nebular [SIII] lines at $\lambda\lambda$ 9069, 9532 \AA, a value of the electron temperature of T$_e$([SIII])= 8400$^{+ 4650}_{-1250}$K. A semi-empirical method for the derivation of abundances in the high metallicity regime is presented.   We obtain abundances which are comparable to those found in high metallicity disc HII regions from direct measurements of electron temperatures and consistent with solar values within the errors. The region with the highest oxygen abundance is R3+R4 in NGC 3504, 12+log(O/H) = 8.85, about 1.5 solar if the solar oxygen abundance is set at the value derived by Asplund et al. (2005), 12+log(O/H)$_{\odot}$ = 8.66$\pm$0.05. Region R7 in NGC 3351 has the lowest oxygen abundance of the sample, about 0.6 times solar. In all the observed CNSFR the O/H abundance is dominated by the O$^+$/H$^+$ contribution, as is also the case for high metallicity disc HII regions. For our observed regions, however, also the S$^+$/S$^{2+}$ ratio is larger than one, contrary to what is found in high metallicity disc HII regions for which, in general, the sulphur abundances are dominated by S$^{2+}$/H$^+$...
