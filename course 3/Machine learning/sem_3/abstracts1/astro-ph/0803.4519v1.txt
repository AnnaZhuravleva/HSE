We present spectroscopic observations of 26 galaxies of type E and S0, based on their blue morphologies, located in voids by the study of Grogin & Geller (1999). Measurements of redshift, velocity dispersion, and four Lick line indices, Mgb, Fe5270, Fe5335, and Hbeta with their errors are given for all of these galaxies, along with Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII] emission line strengths for a subset of these objects. These sources are brighter than M star for low density regions and tend to be bluer than their counterpart early-type objects in high density regions. Using the models of Thomas et al. (2003) gives metal abundances and ages with a median alpha enhancement, [alpha/Fe] = +0.13, and median metals abundance, [Z/H] = +0.22, values comparable to those found for E and S0 galaxies in clusters, but with a wider spread in [Z/H] towards low values. If the emission line subsample is interpreted as younger, the proportion of young objects is higher than for early-types in higher density regions. There is a significant incidence of sources in the sample with emission lines in their spectra (46% with Hbeta and [OIII] and 69% with Halpha or [NII]) as well as shells and rings in their morphologies (19%). The diagnostic log[NII/Halpha], log[OIII/Hbeta] diagram places 10 of 12 emission line galaxies in or near the star forming and liner region and two among the Seyferts. The Halpha fluxes indicate star formation rates of 0.2 to 1.0 Msun per yr. The percentage of these early-type void galaxies undergoing star formation appears to be higher compared to their cluster counterparts and the range of ages wider.
