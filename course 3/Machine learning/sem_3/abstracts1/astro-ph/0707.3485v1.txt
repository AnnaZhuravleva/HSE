We present X-ray, broad band optical and low frequency radio observations of the bright type IIP supernova SN 2004et. The \cxo observed the supernova at three epochs, and the optical coverage spans a period of $\sim$ 470 days since explosion. The X-ray emission softens with time, and we characterise the X-ray luminosity evolution as $\Lx \propto t^{-0.4}$. We use the observed X-ray luminosity to estimate a mass-loss rate for the progenitor star of $\sim \ee{2}{-6} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. The optical light curve shows a pronounced plateau lasting for about 110 days. Temporal evolution of photospheric radius and color temperature during the plateau phase is determined by making black body fits. We estimate the ejected mass of $^{56}$Ni to be 0.06 $\pm$ 0.03 M$_\odot$. Using the expressions of Litvinova & Nad\"{e}zhin (1985) we estimate an explosion energy of (0.98 $\pm$ 0.25) $\times 10^{51}$ erg. We also present a single epoch radio observation of SN 2004et. We compare this with the predictions of the model proposed by Chevalier et al. (2006). These multi-wavelength studies suggest a main sequence progenitor mass of $\sim$ 20 M$_\odot$ for SN 2004et.
