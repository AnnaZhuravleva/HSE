The barred galaxy NGC 7479 hosts a remarkable jet-like radio continuum feature: bright, 12-kpc long in projection, and hosting an aligned magnetic field. The degree of polarization is 6%-8% along the jet, and remarkably constant, which is consistent with helical field models. The radio brightness of the jet suggests strong interaction with the ISM and hence a location near the disk plane. We observed NGC 7479 at four wavelengths with the VLA and Effelsberg radio telescopes. The equipartition strength is 35-40 micro-G for the total and >10 micro-G for the ordered magnetic field in the jet. The jet acts as a bright, polarized background. Faraday rotation between 3.5 and 6 cm and depolarization between 6 and 22 cm can be explained by magneto-ionic gas in front of the jet, with thermal electron densities of ~0.06 cm**(-3) in the bar and ~0.03 cm**(-3) outside the bar. The regular magnetic field along the bar points toward the nucleus on both sides. The regular field in the disk reveals multiple reversals, probably consisting of field loops stretched by a shearing gas flow in the bar. The projection of the jet bending in the sky plane is in the sense opposite to that of the underlying stellar and gaseous spiral structure. The bending in 3-D is most easily explained as a precessing jet, with an age less than 10**6 years. Our observations are consistent with very recent triggering, possibly by a minor merger. NGC 7479 provides a unique opportunity to study interaction-triggered 15-kpc scale radio jets within a spiral galaxy.
