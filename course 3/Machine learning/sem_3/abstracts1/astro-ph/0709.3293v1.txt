In this poster we present the analysis of the CMD of M67 (proposed in the Stellar Population Challenge) performed with VO applications. We found that, although the VO environment is still not ready to perform a complete analysis, its use provides highly useful additional information for the analysis. Thanks to the current VO framework, we are able to identify stars in the provided CMD that are not suitable for isochrone fitting. Additionally, we can complete our knowledge of this cluster extending the analysis to IR colors, which were not provided in the original data but that are available thanks to the VO. On the negative side, we find it difficult to access theoretical data from VO applications, so, currently, it is not possible to perform completely the analysis of the cluster inside the VO framework. However it is expected that the situation will improve in a near future.
