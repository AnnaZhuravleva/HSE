We investigate torsional Alfv\'en oscillations of relativistic stars with a global dipole magnetic field, via two-dimensional numerical simulations. We find that a) there exist two families of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with harmonics at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, b) the lower-frequency QPO is related to the region of closed field lines, near the equator, while the higher-frequency QPO is generated near the magnetic axis, c) the QPOs are long-lived, d) for the chosen form of dipolar magnetic field, the frequency ratio of the lower to upper fundamental QPOs is ~0.6, independent of the equilibrium model or of the strength of the magnetic field, and e) within a representative sample of equations of state and of various magnetar masses, the Alfv\'en QPO frequencies are given by accurate empirical relations that depend only on the compactness of the star and on the magnetic field strength. The lower and upper QPOs can be interpreted as corresponding to the edges or turning points of an Alfv\'en continuum, according to the model proposed by Levin (2007). Several of the low-frequency QPOs observed in the X-ray tail of SGR 1806-20 can readily be identified with the Alfv\'en QPOs we compute. In particular, one could identify the 18Hz and 30Hz observed frequencies with the fundamental lower and upper QPOs, correspondingly, while the observed frequencies of 92Hz and 150Hz are then integer multiples of the fundamental upper QPO frequency (three times and five times, correspondingly). With this identification, we obtain an upper limit on the strength of magnetic field of SGR 1806-20 (if is dominated by a dipolar component) between ~3 and $7\times 10^{15}$G. Furthermore, we discuss the implications for the high-density EOS of compact stars. (Abridged)
