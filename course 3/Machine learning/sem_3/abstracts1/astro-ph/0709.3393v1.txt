EE Cam is a previously little studied Delta Scuti pulsator with amplitudes between those of the HADS (High-Amplitude Delta Scuti stars) group and the average low-amplitude pulsators. Since the size of stellar rotation determines both which pulsation modes are selected by the star as well as their amplitudes, the star offers a great opportunity to examine the astrophysical connections. Extensive photometric measurements covering several months were carried out. 15 significant pulsation frequencies were extracted. The dominant mode at 4.934 cd$^{-1}$ was identified as a radial mode by examining the phase shifts at different wavelengths. Medium-dispersion spectra yielded a $v\sin i$ value of $40 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$. This shows that EE Cam belongs to the important transition region between the HADS and normal Delta Scuti stars.
