We have obtained a criterion for spherically symmetric and static structures under hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity (GR), which states that for a given value of $\sigma \equiv (P_0/E_0) \equiv $ the ratio of central pressure to central energy-density], the compaction parameter $u \equiv (M/a)$, where $M$ is the total mass and $a$ is the radius of the configuration] or the surface redshift of any regular configuration cannot exceed that of the corresponding homogeneous density sphere, that is, $u \leq u_h$, where $u_h$ is the compaction parameter of the homogeneous density sphere. By examining various exact solutions and surface). On the other hand, configurations having a finite density on the surface (that is, the self-bound structures) do not fulfill this criterion. This criterion puts a severe restriction on the static structures based upon the general relativistic field equations and consequently on the upper limit of mass, surface and central redshift and other physical parameters of spherically symmetric and static configurations.
