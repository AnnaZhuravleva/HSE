We perform a general study of the primordial scalar non-Gaussianities in multi-field inflationary models in Einstein gravity. We consider models governed by a Lagrangian which is a general function of the scalar fields and their first spacetime derivatives. We use $\delta N$ formalism to relate scalar fields and curvature perturbations. We calculate the explicit cubic order perturbation action and the three-point function of curvature perturbation evaluated at horizon-crossing. Under reasonable assumptions, in the limit of small slow-varying parameters and a sound speed $c_s$ close to one, we find that the non-Gaussianity is completely determined by these slow-varying parameters and some other parameters determined by the structure of the inflationary models. Our work generalizes previous results, and would be useful to study non-Gaussianity in multi-field inflationary models that will be constructed in the future.
