The Korea Invisible Mass Search(KIMS) experiment presents new limits on WIMP-nucleon cross section using the data from an exposure of 3409 kgd taken with low background CsI(Tl) crystals at Yangyang underground laboratory. The most stringent limit on the spin dependent interaction for pure proton case is obtained. The DAMA signal region for both spin independent and spin dependent interactions for the WIMP mass higher than 20 GeV/c^2are excluded by the single experiment with crystal scintillators.
