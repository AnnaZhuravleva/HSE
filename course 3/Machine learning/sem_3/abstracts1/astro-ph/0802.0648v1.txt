Quark matter both in terrestrial experiment and in astrophysics is briefly reviewed. Astrophysical quark matter could appear in the early Universe, in compact stars, and as cosmic rays. Emphasis is put on quark star as the nature of pulsars. Possible astrophysical implications of experiment-discovered sQGP are also concisely discussed.
