GX 339--4 is a well-known microquasar. In this contribution we show the obtained results with the INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observatories of the outburst undertaken on 2007. The observations cover spectral evolution from the hard, soft intermediate states to the high/soft state. Spectral hardening correlated with the appearance of an skewed Fe line is detected during one of the observations during the soft intermediate state. In all spectral states joint XMM/EPIC-pn, JEM-X, ISGRI and SPI data were fit with the hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization model (EQPAIR). With this model a non-thermal component seems to be required by the data in all the observations. Our results imply evolution in the coronal properties, the most important one being the transition from a compact corona in the first observation to the disappearance of coronal material in the second and re-appearance in the third. We discuss the results obtained in the context of possible physical scenarios for the origin and geometry of the corona and its relation to black hole states.
