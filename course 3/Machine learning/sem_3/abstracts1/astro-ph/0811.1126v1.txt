We present CAIXA, a Catalogue of AGN In the XMM-Newton Archive. It consists of all the radio-quiet X-ray unobscured ($\mathrm{N_H}<2\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observed by XMM-Newton in targeted observations, whose data are public as of March 2007. With its 156 sources, this is the largest catalogue of high signal-to-noise X-ray spectra of AGN. All the EPIC pn spectra of the sources in CAIXA were extracted homogeneously and a baseline model was applied in order to derive their basic X-ray properties. These data are complemented by multiwavelength data found in the literature: Black Hole masses, Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of H$\beta$, radio and optical fluxes. Here we describe our homogeneous spectral analysis of the X-ray data in CAIXA and present all the results on the parameters adopted in our best-fit models.
