The Square Kilometre Array is going to become operational at the time when several new large optical, X-ray and Gamma-ray telescopes are expected to be working. The main drive for building the SKA is a significant improvement of sensitivity that would widen the general scope of the centimetre-wavelength radio science. To this end, a thorough design studies should be made, in order to ensure that the SKA becomes a competitive counterpart of the facilities at other wavebands.   To quantify imaging performance of the SKA configurations, we are implementing figures of merit based on spatial dynamic range (SDR). This work is focused on extensive numerical tests of the analytical, SDR--based figures of merit derived in the SKA Memo 38 (A. Lobanov). Here, we present our preliminary results.
