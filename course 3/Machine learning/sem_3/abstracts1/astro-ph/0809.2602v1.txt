We study a sample of 43 early-type galaxies, selected from the SDSS because they appeared to have velocity dispersion > 350 km/s. High-resolution photometry in the SDSS i passband using HRC-ACS on board the HST shows that just less than half of the sample is made up of superpositions of two or three galaxies, so the reported velocity dispersion is incorrect. The other half of the sample is made up of single objects with genuinely large velocity dispersions. None of these objects has sigma larger than 426 +- 30 km/s. These objects define rather different relations than the bulk of the early-type galaxy population: for their luminosities, they are the smallest, most massive and densest galaxies in the Universe. Although the slopes of the scaling relations they define are rather different from those of the bulk of the population, they lie approximately parallel to those of the bulk "at fixed sigma". These objects appear to be of two distinct types: the less luminous (M_r>-23) objects are rather flattened and extremely dense for their luminosities -- their properties suggest some amount of rotational support and merger histories with abnormally large amounts of gaseous dissipation. The more luminous objects (M_r<-23) tend to be round and to lie in or at the centers of clusters. Their properties are consistent with the hypothesis that they are BCGs. Models in which BCGs form from predominantly radial mergers having little angular momentum predict that they should be prolate. If viewed along the major axis, such objects would appear to have abnormally large sigma for their sizes, and to be abnormally round for their luminosities. This is true of the objects in our sample once we account for the fact that the most luminous galaxies (M_r<-23.5), and BCGs, become slightly less round with increasing luminosity.
