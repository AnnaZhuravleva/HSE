We examine a simple theoretical model to estimate (by fine tuning condition) the value of the cosmological constant. We assume, in analogy with holographic principle, that cosmological constant, like classical surface tension coefficient in a liquid drop, does not correspond to a volume (bulk) vacuum mass (energy) density distribution, but rather to the surface vacuum mass (energy) density distribution. Then the form of given surface mass distribution and fine tuning condition imply observed growing (for about 61 order of magnitude) of the scale factor, from the initial (corresponding to Planck length), to the recent, at the beginning of the cosmic acceleration (corresponding to 10 Glyr length).
