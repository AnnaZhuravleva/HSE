A few Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been suggested to be an explosion of a super-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (WD) to account for their large luminosities, requiring a large amount of 56Ni. However, the candidate over-luminous SNe Ia 2003fg, 2006gz, and (moderately over-luminous) SN 1991T, have very different observational features: the characteristic time-scale and velocity are very different. We examine if and how the diversity can be explained, by 1D spherical radiation transport calculations covering a wide range of model parameters (e.g., WD mass). The observations of SN 2006gz are naturally explained by the super-Chandrasekhar-mass model. SN 1991T represents a marginal case, which may either be a Chandrasekhar or a super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD explosion. On the other hand, the low velocity and short time-scale seen in SN 2003fg indicate that the ejecta mass is smaller than the Chandrasekhar-mass, which is an apparent contradiction to the large luminosity. We suggest that the problem is solved if the progenitor WD, and thus the SN explosion, is aspherical. This may reflect a rapid rotation of the progenitor star, likely a consequence of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD progenitor. The observed differences between SNe 2003fg and 2006gz may be attributed to different viewing orientations.
