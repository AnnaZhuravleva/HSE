A single point source on the OGLE LMC database shows the characteristics of two superimposed eclipsing binaries (EBs). The two EBs happen to have periods very close to the 3:2 resonance. The telescope's small PSF and the apparent resonance between the two EBs raises the suspicion that this is not chance alignment but rather a compact hierarchical system of two pairs of interacting EBs in 3:2 resonance.
