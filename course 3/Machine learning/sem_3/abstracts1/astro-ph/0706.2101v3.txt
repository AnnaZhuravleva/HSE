Upcoming $\gamma$-ray satellites will search for Dark Matter annihilations in Milky Way substructures (or 'clumps'). The prospects for detecting these objects strongly depend on the assumptions made on the distribution of Dark Matter in substructures, and on the distribution of substructures in the Milky Way halo. By adopting simplified, yet rather extreme, prescriptions for these quantities, we compute the number of sources that can be detected with upcoming experiments such as GLAST, and show that, for the most optimistic particle physics setup ($m_\chi=40$ GeV and annihilation cross section $\sigma v = 3 \times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$), the result ranges from zero to $\sim$ hundred sources, all with mass above $10^{5}M\odot$. However, for a fiducial DM candidate with mass $m_\chi=100$ GeV and $\sigma v = 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$, at most a handful of large mass substructures can be detected at $5 \sigma$, with a 1-year exposure time, by a GLAST-like experiment. Scenarios where micro-clumps (i.e. clumps with mass as small as $10^{-6}M\odot$) can be detected are severely constrained by the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background detected by EGRET.
