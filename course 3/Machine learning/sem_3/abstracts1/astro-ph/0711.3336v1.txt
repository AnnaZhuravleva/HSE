In this paper, the new forms obtained for Chandrasekhar's H- function in Radiative Transfer by one of the authors both for non-conservative and conservative cases for isotropic scattering in a semi-infinite plane parallel atmosphere are used to obtain exclusively new forms for the first and second derivatives of H-function . The numerics for evaluation of zero of dispersion function, for evaluation of H-function and its derivatives and its zeroth, the first and second moments are outlined. Those are used to get ready and accurate extensive tables of H-function and its derivatives, pole and moments for different albedo for scattering by iteration and Simpson's one third rule . The schemes for interpolation of H-function for any arbitrary value of the direction parameter for a given albedo are also outlined. Good agreement has been observed in checks with the available results within one unit of ninth decimal
