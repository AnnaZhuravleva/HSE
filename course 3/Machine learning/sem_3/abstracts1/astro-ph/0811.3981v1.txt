One of the main uncertainties in evolutionary calculations of massive stars is the efficiency of internal mixing. It changes the chemical profile inside the star and can therefore affect the structure and further evolution.   We demonstrate that eclipsing binaries, in which the tides synchronize the rotation period of the stars and the orbital period, constitute a potentially strong test for the efficiency of rotational mixing. We present detailed stellar evolutionary models of massive binaries assuming the composition of the Small Magellanic Cloud. In these models we find enhancements in the surface nitrogen abundance of up to 0.6 dex.
