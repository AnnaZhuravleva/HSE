We present time-series photometry of nine cataclysmic variables: EI UMa, V844Her, V751 Cyg, V516 Cyg, GZ Cnc, TY Psc, V1315 Aql, ASAS J002511+1217.12, V1315 Aql and LN UMa. The observations were conducted at various observatories, covering 170 hours and comprising 7,850 data points in total.   For the majority of targets we confirm previously reported periodicities and for some of them we give, for the first time, their spectroscopic orbital periods. For those dwarf-nova systems which we observed during both quiescence and outburst, the increase in brightness was followed by a decrease in the amount of flickering. Quasi-periodic oscillations have either been discovered, or were confirmed. For the eclipsing system V1315 Aql we have covered 9 eclipses, and obtained a refined orbital ephemeris. We find that, during its long baseline of observations, no change in the orbital period of this system has occurred. V1315 Aql also shows eclipses of variable depth.
