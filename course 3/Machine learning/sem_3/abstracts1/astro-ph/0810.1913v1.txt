During the 2007/2008 season, VERITAS was used for observations at E>200 GeV of several extragalactic non-blazar objects such as galaxy clusters, starburst and interacting galaxies, dwarf galaxies, and nearby galaxies. In these proceedings, we present preliminary results from our observations of dwarf galaxies and M87. Results from observation of other non-blazar sources are presented in separate papers in the proceedings.
