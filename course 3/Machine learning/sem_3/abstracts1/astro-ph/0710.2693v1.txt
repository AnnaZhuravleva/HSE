Recently, we have developed a method useful for mapping large-scale horizontal velocity fields in the solar photosphere. The method was developed, tuned and calibrated using the synthetic data. Now, we applied the method to the series of Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) dopplergrams covering almost one solar cycle in order to get the information about the long-term behaviour of surface flows. We have found that our method clearly reproduces the widely accepted properties of mean flow field components, such as torsional oscillations and a pattern of meridional circulation. We also performed a periodic analysis, however due to the data series length and large gaps we did not detect any significant periods. The relation between the magnetic activity influencing the mean zonal motion is studied. We found an evidence that the emergence of compact magnetic regions locally accelerates the rotation of supergranular pattern in their vicinity and that the presence of magnetic fields generally decelerates the rotation in the equatorial region. Our results show that active regions in the equatorial region emerge exhibiting a constant velocity (faster by 60 +/- 9 m/s than Carrington rate) suggesting that they emerge from the base of the surface radial shear at 0.95 R_sun, disconnect from their magnetic roots, and slow down during their evolution.
