We present radio continuum polarimetry observations of the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC 253 which possesses a very bright radio halo. Using the vertical synchrotron emission profiles and the lifetimes of cosmic-ray electrons, we determined the cosmic-ray bulk speed as (300+/-30) km/s, indicating the presence of a galactic wind in this galaxy. The large-scale magnetic field was decomposed into a toroidal axisymmetric component in the disk and a poloidal component in the halo. The poloidal component shows a prominent X-shaped magnetic field structure centered on the nucleus, similar to the magnetic field observed in other edge-on galaxies. Faraday rotation measures indicate that the poloidal field has an odd parity (antisymmetric). NGC 253 offers the possibility to compare the magnetic field structure with models of galactic dynamos and/or galactic wind flows.
