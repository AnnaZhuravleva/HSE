Formation of circumstellar lines of Na I and Ca II in type Ia supernovae is studied for the case, when supernova explodes in a binary system with a red giant. The model suggests a spherically-symmetric wind and takes into account ionization and heating of the wind by X-rays from the shock wave and by gamma-quanta of ^{56}Ni radioactive decay. For the wind density typical of the red giant the expected optical depth of the wind in Na I lines turnes out too low (\tau<0.001}) to detect the absorption. For the same wind densities the predicted optical depth of Ca II 3934 \AA is sufficient for the detection (\tau>0.1). I conclude that the absorption lines detected in SN 2006X cannot form in the red giant wind; they are rather related to clouds at distances larger than the dust evaporation radius (r>10^{17} cm). From the absence in SN 2006X of Ca II absorption lines not related with the similar Na I components I derive the upper limit of the mass loss rate by the wind with velocity u: \dot{M}<10^{-8}(u/10 km/s) M_{\odot} yr^{-1}.
