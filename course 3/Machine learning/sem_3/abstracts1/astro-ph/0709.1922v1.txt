We have found that the expansion of the universe has immense consequences on our local systems. We present a model based on cosmic expansion that fits well with observation. The close approach problem inflicting tidal theory is averted in this model. We have shown that the astronomical and geological changes of our local systems are of the order of Hubble constant.
