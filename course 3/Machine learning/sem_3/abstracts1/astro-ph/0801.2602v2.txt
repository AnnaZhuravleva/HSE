Pulsar winds shocked in the ambient medium produce spectacular nebulae observable from the radio through gamma-rays. The shape and the spectrum of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) depend on the angular distribution, magnetization and energy spectrum of the wind streaming from the pulsar magnetosphere, as well as on the pulsar velocity and the properties of the ambient medium. The advent of Chandra, with its unprecedented angular resolution and high sensitivity, has allowed us not only to detect many new PWNe, but also study their spatial and spectral structure and dynamics, which has significantly advanced our understanding of these objects. Here we overview recent observational results on PWNe, with emphasis on Chandra observations.
