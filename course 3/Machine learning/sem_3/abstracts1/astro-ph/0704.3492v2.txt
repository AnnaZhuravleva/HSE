Unsustained matter distributions unescapely collapse unless fragmentation and centrifugal or pressure support take place. Starting from the above evidence, supermassive compact objects at the centre of large-mass galaxies are conceived as the end-product of the gravitational collapse of local density maxima around which overdensities are located. At the beginning of evolution, local density maxima are idealized as homogeneous peaks, while the surrounding envelopes are described by a power-law density profile. The dependence of the density profile on a second parameter, chosen to be the ratio between peak and total mass, is analysed. Overdensity evolution is discussed in the context of quintessence cosmological models and further investigation is devoted to a special case with the aim to describe the central collapse. An empirical relation between hole and dark halo mass is translated into a dependence of the fractional hole mass on the overdensity mass. Computations are performed up to the end of central collapse, and density profiles of related configurations are determined together with additional parameters. The central collapse is completed in early times, no longer than a few hundredths of Gyr, which implies hole formation when proto-haloes, proto-bulges, and proto-disks are still expanding or contracting. No appreciable change in evolution is found with regard to different mean peak heights related to equal masses. On the other hand, it is recognized that homogeneous peaks collapse ``faster'' with respect to surroundings envelopes, in low-mass than in large-mass overdensities. In conclusion, it is inferred that gravitational collapse of homogeneous peaks within overdensities may be a viable mechanism for hole generation.
