We report the mid- and far-infrared properties of nearby M dwarfs. Spitzer/MIPS measurements were obtained for a sample of 62 stars at 24 um, with subsamples of 41 and 20 stars observed at 70 um and 160 um respectively. We compare the results with current models of M star photospheres and look for indications of circumstellar dust in the form of significant deviations of K-[24 um] colors and 70 um / 24 um flux ratios from the average M star values. At 24 um, all 62 of the targets were detected; 70 um detections were achieved for 20 targets in the subsample observed; and no detections were seen in the 160 um subsample. No clear far-infrared excesses were detected in our sample. The average far infrared excess relative to the photospheric emission of the M stars is at least four times smaller than the similar average for a sample of solar-type stars. However, this limit allows the average fractional infrared luminosity in the M-star sample to be similar to that for more massive stars. We have also set low limits for the maximum mass of dust possible around our stars.
