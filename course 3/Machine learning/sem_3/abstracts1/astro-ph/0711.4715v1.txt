Here we describe the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey which is the largest, systematic, galaxy-wide search for massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) yet undertaken. Mid-IR bright point sources from the MSX satellite survey have been followed-up with ground-based radio, millimetre, and infrared observations to identify the contaminating sources and characterise the MYSOs and UCHII regions. With the initial classification now complete the distribution of sources in the galaxy will be discussed, as well as some programmes being developed to exploit our sample.
