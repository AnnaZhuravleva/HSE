We assess the potential of nuclear starburst disks to obscure the Seyfert-like AGN that dominate the hard X-ray background at z~1. Over 1200 starburst disk models, based on the theory developed by Thompson et al., are calculated for five input parameters: the black hole mass, the radial size of the starburst disk, the dust-to-gas ratio, the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the disk, and the gas fraction at the outer disk radius. We find that a large dust-to-gas ratio, a relatively small starburst disk, a significant gas mass fraction, and efficient angular momentum transport are all important to produce a starburst disk that can potentially obscure an AGN. The typical maximum star-formation rate in the disks is ~10 solar masses per year. Assuming no mass-loss due to outflows, the starburst disks feed gas onto the black hole at rates sufficient to produce hard X-ray luminosities of 10^{43}-10^{44} erg s^{-1}. The starburst disks themselves should be detectable at mid-infrared and radio wavelengths; at z=0.8, the predicted fluxes are ~1 mJy at 24microns and ~10-30 microJy at 1.4GHz. Thus, we predict a large fraction of radio/X-ray matches in future deep radio surveys. The starburst disks should be easily distinguished from AGN in future 100microns surveys by Herschel with expected fluxes of ~5 mJy. Any AGN-obscuring starbursts will be associated with hot dust, independent of AGN heating, resulting in observable signatures for separating galactic and nuclear star-formation. Finally, because of the competition between gas and star-formation, nuclear starbursts will be associated with lower-luminosity AGN. Thus, this phenomenon is a natural explanation for the observed decrease in the fraction of obscured AGN with luminosity.
