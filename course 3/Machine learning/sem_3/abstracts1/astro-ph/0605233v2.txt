Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is pervasive in astrophysical systems. Recent high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the energy spectrum of strong incompressible MHD turbulence is $E(k_{\perp})\propto k_{\perp}^{-3/2}$. So far, there has been no phenomenological theory that simultaneously explains this spectrum and satisfies the exact analytic relations for MHD turbulence due to Politano & Pouquet. Indeed, the Politano-Pouquet relations are often invoked to suggest that the spectrum of MHD turbulence instead has the Kolmogorov scaling -5/3. Using geometrical arguments and numerical tests, here we analyze this seeming contradiction and demonstrate that the -3/2 scaling and the Politano-Pouquet relations are reconciled by the phenomenon of scale-dependent dynamic alignment that was recently discovered in MHD turbulence.
