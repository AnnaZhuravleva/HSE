INTEGRAL observations provide a large amount of data on accreting binary systems. The interpretation of the spectral emission of these sources needs timing analysis and phase resolved spectroscopy, which are really cumbersome tasks if performed with tools based on the imaging extraction methods usually used for coded mask instruments. Here we present a software for the ISGRI instrument which allows to extract in a fast way, light curves, pulse profiles, and phase resolved spectra, making data reduction a much easier task.
