Observations give strong support for the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei. The scheme is premised on toroidal obscuration of the central engine by dusty clouds that are individually very optically thick. These lectures summarize the torus properties, describe the handling and implications of its clumpy nature and present speculations about its dynamic origin.
