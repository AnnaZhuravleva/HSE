We describe the anisotropy of dark matter clump distribution caused by tidal destruction of clumps in the Galactic disk. A tidal destruction of clumps with orbit planes near the disk plane occurs more efficiently as compared with destruction of clumps at near-polar orbits. A corresponding annihilation of dark matter particles in small-scale clumps produces the anisotropic gamma-ray signal with respect to the Galactic disk. This anisotropy is rather small, 9%, and superimposed on that due to off-centering position of the Sun in the Galaxy. The anisotropy of annihilation signal with respect to the Galactic disk provides a possibility to discriminate dark matter annihilation from the diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds of other origin.
