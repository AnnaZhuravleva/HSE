We present measurements of the color and luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering at z~1 in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. Using volume-limited subsamples in bins of both color and luminosity, we find that: 1) The clustering dependence is much stronger with color than with luminosity and is as strong with color at z~1 as is found locally. We find no dependence of the clustering amplitude on color for galaxies on the red sequence, but a significant dependence on color for galaxies within the blue cloud. 2) For galaxies in the range L/L*~0.7-2, a stronger large-scale luminosity dependence is seen for all galaxies than for red and blue galaxies separately. The small-scale clustering amplitude depends significantly on luminosity for blue galaxies, with brighter samples having a stronger rise on scales r_p<0.5 Mpc/h. 3) Redder galaxies exhibit stronger small-scale redshift-space distortions ("fingers of god"), and both red and blue populations show large-scale distortions in xi(r_p,pi) due to coherent infall. 4) While the clustering length, r_0, increases smoothly with galaxy color (in narrow bins), its power-law exponent, gamma, exhibits a sharp jump from the blue cloud to the red sequence. The intermediate color `green' galaxy population likely includes transitional galaxies moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence; on large scales green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies but show infall kinematics and a small-scale correlation slope akin to the blue galaxy population. 5) We compare our results to a semi-analytic galaxy formation model applied to the Millenium Run simulation. Differences between the data and the model suggest that in the model star formation is shut down too efficiently in satellite galaxies.
