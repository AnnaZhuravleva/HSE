A snapshot is presented of the present status of our knowledge of the TeV gamma-ray universe. Emphasis is put on observations made using the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique. The capabilities of the present generation of telescopes is listed. Progress has been dramatic and several features have been different from what was anticipated. The catalog of sources includes some 78 objects and these are tabulated as extragalactic sources (24), supernovae remnants (11), pulsar wind nebulae (10), binaries (4), miscellaneous (9), diffuse high energy sources (3) and unidentified sources (20). Some comments are made on the factors influencing the past and future development of the field.
