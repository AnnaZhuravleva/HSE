We report the discovery of a probable new globular cluster in the disk of the Milky Way. Visible in 2MASS and the GLIMPSE survey, it has an estimated foreground extinction of A_V ~ 24 mag. The absolute magnitude of the cluster and the luminosity function of the red giant branch are most consistent with that of an old globular cluster with a mass of a few times 10^5 solar masses at a distance of 4-8 kpc.
