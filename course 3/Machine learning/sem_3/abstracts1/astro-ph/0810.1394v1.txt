GRBs are the most energetic events in the Universe, associated with the death of massive stars (core-collapse supernovae) or the merging of neutron stars or black holes. Discovered in the early 1970s, their cosmological origin was demonstrated only in 1997, when the first distance was measured. Theoretical models predict that the very energetic processes at work in GRBs accelerate charged particles to such energies that they could contribute to the observed high energy neutrinos.   These processes will be discussed and the observational consequences, in particular for current and forthcoming neutrino telescopes, presented.
