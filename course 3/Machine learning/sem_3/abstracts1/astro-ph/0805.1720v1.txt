The MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars) satellite has discovered SPBe (Slowly Pulsating Be) oscillations in the stars HD 127756 (B1/B2 Vne) and HD 217543 (B3 Vpe). For HD 127756, 30 significant frequencies are identified from 31 days of nearly continuous photometry; for HD 217543, up to 40 significant frequencies from 26 days of data. In both cases, the oscillations fall into three distinct frequency ranges, consistent with models of the stars. The variations are caused by nonradial g-modes (and possibly r-modes) distorted by rapid rotation and excited by the opacity mechanism near the iron opacity bump. A comparison of pulsation models and observed frequency groups yields a rotation frequency for each star, independently of vsini. The rotation rates of these stars, as well as those of the SPBe stars previously discovered by MOST, HD 163868 and $\beta$ CMi, are all close to their critical values.
