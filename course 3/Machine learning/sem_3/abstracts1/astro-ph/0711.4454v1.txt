Stellar parameters and abundances of Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Eu are determined for four very metal-poor stars (-2.66 < [Fe/H] < -2.15) based on non-LTE line formation and analysis of high-resolution (R ~60000 and 90000) high signal-to-noise (S/N > 200) observed spectra. A model atom for H I is presented. An effective temperature was obtained from the Balmer Halpha and Hbeta line wing fits, the surface gravity from the Hipparcos parallax if available and the non-LTE ionization balance between Ca I and Ca II. Based on the hyperfine structure affecting the Ba II resonance line, the fractional abundance of the odd isotopes of Ba was derived for HD 84937 and HD 122563 from a requirement that Ba abundances from the resonance line and subordinate lines of Ba II must be equal. For each star, non-LTE leads to a consistency of Teff from two Balmer lines and to a higher temperature compared to the LTE case, by up to 60 K. Non-LTE effects are important in spectroscopic determination of surface gravity from Ca I/Ca II. For each star with a known trigonometric gravity, non-LTE abundances from the lines of two ionization stages agree within the error bars, while a difference in the LTE abundances consists of 0.23 dex to 0.40 dex for different stars. Departures from LTE are found to be significant for the investigated atoms, and they strongly depend on stellar parameters. For HD 84937, the Eu/Ba ratio is consistent with the relative solar system r-process abundances, and the fraction of the odd isotopes of Ba, f_odd, equals 0.43+-0.14. The latter can serve as a constraint on r-process models. The lower Eu/Ba ratio and f_odd = 0.22+-0.15 found for HD 122563 suggest that the s-process or the unknown process has contributed significantly to the Ba abundance in this star.
