Taking into account the Pierre Auger Observatory limits on the photon fraction among the highest energy cosmic rays, we show that the models based on the decay of super-heavy dark matter in the halo of our Galaxy are essentially excluded from being the sources of UHECRs unless their contribution becomes significant only above 100 EeV. Some top-down models based on topological defects are however compatible with the current data and may be best constrained in the future by the high-energy neutrino flux limit.
