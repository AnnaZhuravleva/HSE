General relativity marked the beginning of modern cosmology and it has since been at the centre of many of the key developments in this field. In the present review, we discuss the general-relativistic dynamics and perturbations of the standard cosmological model, the Friedmann-Lemaitre universe, and how these can explain and predict the properties of the observable universe. Our aim is to provide an overview of the progress made in several major research areas, such as linear and non-linear cosmological perturbations, large-scale structure formation and the physics of the cosmic microwave background radiation, in view of current and upcoming observations. We do this by using a single formalism throughout the review, the 1+3 covariant approach to cosmology, which allows for a uniform and balanced presentation of technical information and physical insight.
