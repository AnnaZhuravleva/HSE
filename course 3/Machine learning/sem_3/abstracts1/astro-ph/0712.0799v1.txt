Inspired by recent work on feedback in disk galaxies (Efstathiou 2000, Silk 2003) and on the angular momentum distribution in simulated gas halos (Sharma and Steinmetz 2005), a fully dynamic model of disk galaxy formation and evolution has been developed. This is used to demonstrate how observed galactic systems could have formed from halos similar to those found in simulations and applies physically motivated models of star formation and feedback to explore whether the true nature of these processes would be manifest from local and cosmological observables. This is made possible by computational integration with the galaxy formation model developed originally by the group at Durham University (Cole et al. 2000).
