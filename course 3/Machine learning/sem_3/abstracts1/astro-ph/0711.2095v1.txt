We present observations of the occultation of Umbriel by Oberon on 4 May, 2007. We believe this is the first observed mutual event between satellites of Uranus. Fitting a simple geometric model to the lightcurve, we measure the mid-event time with a precision of 4 seconds. We assume previously measured values for the albedos of the two satellites (Karkoschka 2001), and measure the impact parameter to be 500 +/- 80 km. These measurements are more precise than estimates based on current ephemerides for these satellites. Therefore observations of additional mutual events during the 2007-2008 Uranian equinox will provide improved estimates of their orbital and physical parameters.
