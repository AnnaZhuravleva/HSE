The phenomenology of accretion disc, coronnae and jets in X-ray binaries is rather well established. However the structure of the accretion flow in the various spectral states is still debated and the connection between the hot flow and compact jet is far from being understood. Simbol-X should address these two important questions in several ways. First, it will provide us with the capability of producing high sensivity, broad band spectra and therefore constrain simultaneously the shape and luminosity of all spectral components (iron line, reflection bump, thermal disc and comptonised emission) which in turn provides information on the geometry of the accretion flow. It will also determine the exact contribution of jets to the X-ray band both in bright and quiescent states. Finally it will shed new lights on the underlying mechanisms triggering spectral state transitions by allowing us to follow in exquisite details the rapid spectral evolution and its correlation with the radio jet emission during those transitions.
