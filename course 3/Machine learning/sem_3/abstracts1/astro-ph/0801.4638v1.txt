We discuss short wavelength (inertial wave) instabilities present in the standard two-fluid neutron star model when there is sufficient relative flow along the superfluid neutron vortex array. We demonstrate that these instabilities may be triggered in precessing neutron stars, since the angular velocity vectors of the neutron and proton fluids are misaligned during precession. The presence of such an instability would render the standard, solid body rotation, model for free precession inconsistent. Our results suggest that the standard (Eulerian) slow precession that results for weak drag between the vortices and the charged fluid (protons and electrons) is not seriously constrained by the existence of the instability. In contrast, the fast precession, which results when vortices are strongly coupled to the charged component, is generally unstable. This implies that fast precession may not be realised in astrophysical systems
