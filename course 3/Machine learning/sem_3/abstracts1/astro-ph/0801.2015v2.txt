SN 2006jc is a peculiar supernova (SN), in which the formation of dust has been confirmed at an early epoch of ~50 days after the explosion. We investigate the possibility of such an earlier formation of dust grains in the expanding ejecta of SN 2006jc, applying the Type Ib SN model that is developed to reproduce the observed light curve. We find that the rapid decrease of the gas temperature in SN 2006jc enables the condensation of C grains in the C-rich layer at 40-60 days after the explosion, which is followed by the condensation of silicate and oxide grains until ~200 days. The average radius of each grain species is confined to be less than 0.01 micron due to the low gas density at the condensation time. The calculated total dust mass reaches ~1.5 Msun, of which C dust shares 0.7 Msun. On the other hand, based on the calculated dust temperature, we show that the dust species and mass evaluated to reproduce the spectral energy distribution observed by AKARI and MAGNUM at day 200 are different from those obtained by the dust formation calculations; the dust species contributing to the observed flux are hot C and FeS grains with masses of $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$ Msun and $2.0 \times 10^{-3}$ Msun, respectively, though we cannot defy the presence of a large amount of cold dust such as silicate and oxide grains up to 0.5 Msun. One of the physical processes responsible for the difference between calculated and evaluated masses of C and FeS grains could be considered to be the destruction of small-sized clusters by energetic photons and electrons prevailing within the ejecta at the earlier epoch.
