We have returned to our previous Bianchi VII_h analysis in light of the Cruz et al. 2007 suggestion that the cold spot observed near the southern Galactic pole may be a remnant temperature perturbation of a cosmic texture. In Bridges et al. 2006b we found two favoured left handed Bianchi VII_h templates with restricted prior probabilities so that the template was centred close to the cold spot. Using WMAP data `corrected' for the texture fit we have now reexamined both models to assess any changes to these conclusions. We find that both models are left almost entirely unconstrained by the data and consequently exhibit significantly reduced Bayesian evidences. Both models are now disfavoured by the data. This result reinforces our previous suggestion that the cold spot was likely to be driving any Bianchi VII_h detection.
