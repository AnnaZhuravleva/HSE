I review the theory of angular momentum acquisition of galaxies by tidal torquing, the resulting angular momentum distribution, the angular momentum correlation function and discuss the implications of angular momentum alignments on weak lensing measurements: Starting from linear models for tidal torquing I summarise perturbative approaches and the results from n-body simulations of cosmic structure formation. Then I continue to discuss the validity of decompositions of the tidal shear and inertia fields, the effects of angular momentum biasing, the applicability of parameterised angular momentum correlation models and the consequences of angular momentum correlations for shape alignments. I compile the result of observations of shape alignments in recent galaxy surveys as well as in n-body simulations. Finally, I review the contamination of weak lensing surveys by spin-induced shape alignments and methods for suppressing this contamination.
