How do T Tauri disks accrete? The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) supplies one means, but protoplanetary disk gas is typically too poorly ionized to be magnetically active. Here we show that the MRI can, in fact, explain observed accretion rates for the sub-class of T Tauri disks known as transitional systems. Transitional disks are swept clean of dust inside rim radii of ~10 AU. Stellar coronal X-rays ionize material in the disk rim, activating the MRI there. Gas flows from the rim to the star, at a rate limited by the depth to which X-rays ionize the rim wall. The wider the rim, the larger the surface area that the rim wall exposes to X-rays, and the greater the accretion rate. Interior to the rim, the MRI continues to transport gas; the MRI is sustained even at the disk midplane by super-keV X-rays that Compton scatter down from the disk surface. Accretion is therefore steady inside the rim. Blown out by radiation pressure, dust largely fails to accrete with gas. Contrary to what is usually assumed, ambipolar diffusion, not Ohmic dissipation, limits how much gas is MRI-active. We infer values for the transport parameter alpha on the order of 0.01 for GM Aur, TW Hyd, and DM Tau. Because the MRI can only afflict a finite radial column of gas at the rim, disk properties inside the rim are insensitive to those outside. Thus our picture provides one robust setting for planet-disk interaction: a protoplanet interior to the rim will interact with gas whose density, temperature, and transport properties are definite and decoupled from uncertain initial conditions. Our study also supplies half the answer to how disks dissipate: the inner disk drains from the inside out by the MRI, while the outer disk photoevaporates by stellar ultraviolet radiation.
