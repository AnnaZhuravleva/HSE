We present and interpret new spectropolarimetric observations of the magnetic white dwarf WD 1953-011. Circular polarization and intensity spectra of the H$\alpha$ spectral line demonstrate the presence of two-component magnetic field in the photosphere of this star. The geometry consists of a weak, large scale component, and a strong, localized component. Analyzing the rotationally modulated low-field component, we establish a rotation period $P_{rot} = 1.4480 \pm 0.0001$ days. Modeling the measured magnetic observables, we find that the low-field component can be described by the superposition of a dipole and quadrupole. According to the best-fit model, the inclination of the stellar rotation axis with respect to the line of sight is $i \approx 20^\circ$, and the angle between the rotation axis and the dipolar axis is $\beta \approx 10^\circ$. The dipole strength at the pole is about 180 kG, and the quadrupolar strength is about 230 kG. These data suggest a fossil origin of the low-field component. In contrast, the strong-field component exhibits a peculiar, localized structure (``magnetic spot'') that confirms the conclusions of Maxted and co-workers. The mean field modulus of the spot ($|B_{spot}| = 520 \pm 7$ kG) together with its variable longitudinal magnetic field having a maximum of about +400 kG make it difficult to describe it naturally as a high-order component of the star's global poloidal field. Instead, we suggest that the observed strong-field region has a geometry similar to a magnetic flux tube.
