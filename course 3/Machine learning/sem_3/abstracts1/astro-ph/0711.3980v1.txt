Three eclipsing binary systems with astrometric orbit have been studied. For a detailed analysis two circular-orbit binaries (VW Cep and HT Vir) and one binary with an eccentric orbit (zeta Phe) have been chosen. Merging together astrometry and the analysis of the times of minima, one is able to describe the orbit of such a system completely. The O-C diagrams and the astrometric orbits of the third bodies were analysed simultaneously for these three systems by the least-squares method. The introduced algorithm is useful and powerful, but also time consuming, due to many parameters which one is trying to derive. The new orbits for the third bodies in these systems were found with periods 30, 221, and 261 yr, and eccentricities 0.63, 0.37, and 0.64 for VW Cep, zeta Phe, and HT Vir, respectively. Also an independent approach to compute the distances to these systems was used. The use of this algorithm to VW Cep gave the distance d=(27.90 +/- 0.29) pc, which is in excellent agreement with the previous Hipparcos result.
