Close examination of so-called "pseudobulges" in several early-type disk galaxies indicates that they are actually composite structures consisting of both a flattened, kinematically cool disklike structure ("disky pseudobulge") and a rounder, kinematically hot spheroidal structure ("classical bulge"). This indicates that pseudobulges, thought to form from internal secular evolution, and classical bulges, thought to form from rapid mergers, are not exclusive phenomena: some galaxies can have both.
