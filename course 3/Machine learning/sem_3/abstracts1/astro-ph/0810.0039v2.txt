We examine the linear density contrast at collapse time, $\delta_c$ for large-scale structure in dynamical dark energy cosmologies, including models with early dark energy. Contrary to previous results, we find that as long as dark energy is homogeneous on small scales, $\delta_c$ is insensitive to dark energy properties for parameter values fitting current data, including the case of early dark energy. This is significant since using the correct $\delta_c$ is crucial for accurate Press-Schechter prediction of the halo mass function. Previous results have found an apparent failing of the extended Press-Schechter approach (Sheth-Tormen) for early dark energy. Our calculations demonstrate that with the correct $\delta_c$ the accuracy of this approach is restored. We discuss the significance of this result for the halo mass function and examine what dark energy physics would be needed to cause significant change in $\delta_c$, and the observational signatures this would leave.
