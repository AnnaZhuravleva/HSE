In May 2008 the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1627-41 resumed its bursting activity after nearly a decade of quiescence. After detection of a bright burst, Swift pointed its X-ray telescope in the direction of the source in less than five hours and followed it for over five weeks. In this paper we present an analysis of the data from these Swift observations and an XMM-Newton one performed when SGR 1627-41 was still in a quiescent state. The analysis of the bursts detected with Swift/BAT shows that their temporal and spectral properties are similar to those found in previous observations of SGR 1627-41 and other soft gamma-ray repeaters. The maximum peak luminosity of the bursts was about 2E+41 erg/s. Our data show that the outburst was accompanied by a fast flux enhancement and by a hardening of the spectrum with respect to the persistent emission.
