We reexamine the limits on charged dark matter particles. We show that if their mass and charge fall in the range 100(q_X/e)^2< m_X < 10^8(q_X/e) TeV, then magnetic fields prevent particles in the halo from entering the galactic disk, while those initially trapped inside are accelerated through the Fermi mechanism and ejected within about 0.1-1 Gyrs. Consequently, previous constraints on charged dark matter based on terrestrial non-observation are invalid within that range. Further, we find that charged massive particles may simultaneously solve several long-standing astrophysical problems, including the underabundance of dwarf galaxies, the shallow density profiles in the cores of the LSB galaxies, the absence of cooling flows in the cores of galaxy clusters, and several others.
