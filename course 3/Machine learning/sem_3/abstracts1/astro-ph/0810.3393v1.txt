The primary challenge of GOLF-NG (Global Oscillations at Low Frequency New Generation) is the detection of the low-frequency solar gravity and acoustic modes, as well as the possibility to measure the high-frequency chromospheric modes. On June 8th 2008, the first sunlight observations with the multichannel resonant GOLF-NG prototype spectrometer were obtained at the Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife). The instrument performs integrated (Sun-as-a-star), Doppler velocity measurements, simultaneously at eight different heights in the D1 sodium line profile, corresponding to photospheric and chromospheric layers of the solar atmosphere. In order to study its performances, to validate the conceived strategy, and to estimate the necessary improvements, this prototype has been running on a daily basis over the whole summer of 2008 at the Observatorio del Teide. We present here the results of the first GOLF-NG observations, clearly showing the characteristics of the 5-minute oscillatory signal at different heights in the solar atmosphere. We compare these signals with simultaneous observations from GOLF/SOHO and from the Mark-I instrument -- a node of the BiSON network, operating at the same site.
