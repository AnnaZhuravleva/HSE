In the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approach to model the Universe the violation of the so-called energy conditions is related to some important properties of the Universe as, for example, the current and the inflationary accelerating expansion phases. The energy conditions are also necessary in the formulation and proofs of Hawking-Penrose singularity theorems. In two recent articles we have derived bounds from energy conditions and made confrontations of these bounds with supernovae data. Here, we extend these results in following way: first, by using our most recent statistical procedure for calculating new q(z) estimates from the \emph{gold} and \emph{combined} type Ia supernovae samples; second, we use these estimates to obtain a new picture of the energy conditions fulfillment and violation for the recent past ($z\leq 1 $) in the context of the standard cosmology.
