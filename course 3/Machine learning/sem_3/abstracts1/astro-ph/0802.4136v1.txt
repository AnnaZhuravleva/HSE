Rotating accretion flow may undergo centrifugal pressure mediated shock transition even in presence of various dissipative processes, such as viscosity and cooling mechanism. The extra thermal gradient force along the vertical direction in the post shock flow drives a part of the accreting matter as bipolar outflows which are believed to be the precursor of relativistic jets. We compute mass loss rates from a viscous accretion disc in presence of synchrotron cooling in terms of the inflow parameters. We show cooling significantly affects the mass outflow rate, to the extent that, jets may be generated from flows with higher viscosity. We discuss that our formalism may be employed to explain observed jet power for a couple of black hole candidates. We also indicate that using our formalism, it is possible to connect the spectral properties of the disc with the rate of mass loss.
