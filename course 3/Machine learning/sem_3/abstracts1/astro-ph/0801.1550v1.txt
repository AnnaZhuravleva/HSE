The kinematics of galactic rings were studied with a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer mounted in the multi-mode focal reducer SCORPIO (Afanasiev & Moiseev 2005) at the SAO RAS 6-m telescope. The analysis of the ionized gas velocity fields allows us to understand the nature of the ring formation in several galaxies. The different types of the rings in the presented objects (resonanced, collisional, polar) were caused by the various sorts of interactions: merging, head-on collisions.
