We have searched for pulsation of the anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP) 4U 0142+61 in the K' band ($\lambda_{\rm eff} = 2.11$ $\mu$m) using the fast-readout mode of IRCS at the Subaru 8.2-m telescope. We found no significant signal at the pulse frequency expected by the precise ephemeris obtained by the X-ray monitoring observation with RXTE. Nonetheless, we obtained a best upper limit of 17% (90% C.L.) for the root-mean-square pulse fraction in the K' band. Combined with i' band pulsation (Dhillon et al. 2005), the slope of the pulsed component ($F_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$) was constrained to $\alpha > -0.87$ (90% C.L.) for an interstellar extinction of $A_{V} = 3.5$.
