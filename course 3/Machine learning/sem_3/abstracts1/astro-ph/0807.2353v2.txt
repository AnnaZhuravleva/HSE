We obtain full information on the orbital parameters by combining radial velocity and astrometric measurements by means of Bayesian inference. We sample the parameter probability densities of orbital model parameters with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) method in simulated observational scenarios to test the detectability of planets with orbital periods longer than the observational timelines. We show that, when fitting model parameters simultaneously to measurements from both sources, it is possible to extract much more information from the measurements than when using either source alone. We demonstrate this by studying the orbit of recently found extra-solar planet HD 154345 b.
