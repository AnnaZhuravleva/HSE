New HI images from the VLA Galactic Plane Survey (VGPS) show clear absorption features associated with the supernova remnant (SNR) G18.8+0.3. High-resolution $^{13}$CO images reveal that molecular clouds overlap the radio filaments of G18.8+0.3. The $^{13}$CO emission spectrum over the full velocity range in the direction of G18.8+0.3 shows two molecular components with high brightness-temperatureand three molecular components with low brightness-temperature, all with respective HI absorption. This implies that these clouds are in front of G18.8+0.3. In the HI images, the highest velocity absorption feature seen against the continuum image of G18.8+0.3 is at 129 km s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to the tangent point in this direction. This yields a lower distance limit of 6.9 kpc for G18.8+0.3. Absence of absorption at negative velocities gives an upper distance limit of 15 kpc. The broadened profile at 20$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ in the $^{13}$CO emission spectra is a strong indicator of a possible SNR/CO cloud interaction. Thus, G18.8+0.3 is likely to be at the distance of about 12 kpc. The upper mass limit and mean density of the giant CO cloud at 20$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ are \sim 6 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot} and \sim 2 \times 10^{2} cm^{-3}. We find an atomic hydrogen column density in front of G18.8+0.3 of $N_{HI}$ \sim 2 \times 10^{22} cm^{-2}. The ROSAT PSPC observations show a diffuse X-ray enhancement apparently associated with part of the radio shell of G18.8+0.3. Assuming an association, the unabsorbed flux is 2.2 \times10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, suggesting an intrinsic luminosity of 3.6 \times 10^{34} erg s^{-1} for G18.8+0.3.
