The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search experiment (CDMS) employs low-temperature Ge and Si detectors to detect WIMPs via their elastic scattering interaction with the target nuclei. The current analysis of 397.8 kg-days Ge exposure resulted in zero observed candidate events, setting an upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section of 6.6 x 10^{-44} cm^2 (4.6 x 10^{-44} cm^2, when previous CDMS Soudan data is included) at the 90 % confidence level for a WIMP mass of 60 GeV. To increase the sensitivity, new one inch thick detectors have been developed which will be used in the SuperCDMS phase. SuperCDMS 25kg will be operated at SNOLAB with an expected sensitivity on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross-section of 1 x 10^{-45} cm^2.
