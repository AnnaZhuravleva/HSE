Dust has been detected in the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi on several occassions. I model the historical mid-infrared photometry and a recent Spitzer Space Telescope spectrum taken only half a year after the 2006 eruption. The dust envelope is little affected by the eruptions. I show evidence that the eruptions and possibly the red giant wind of RS Oph may sculpt the interstellar medium, and show similar evidence for the recurrent dwarf nova T Pyxidis.
