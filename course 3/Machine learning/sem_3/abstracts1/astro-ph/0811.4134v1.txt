We present catalogs of QSO candidates selected using photometry from GALEX combined with SDSS in the Stripe 82 region and Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) near declination -55 degrees. The SDSS region contains ~700 objects with magnitude i < 20 and ~3600 objects with i < 21.5 in a ~60 square degree sky region, while the BCS region contains ~280 objects with magnitude i < 20 and ~2000 objects with i < 21.5 for a 11 square degree sky region that is being observed by three current microwave Sunyaev-Zeldovich surveys. Our QSO catalog is the first one in the BCS region. Deep GALEX exposures (~2000 seconds in FUV and NUV, except in three fields) provide high signal-to-noise photometry in the GALEX bands (FUV, NUV < 24.5 mag). From this data, we select QSO candidates using only GALEX and optical r-band photometry, using the method given by Atlee and Gould (2008). In the Stripe 82 field, 60% (30%) of the GALEX selected QSO's with optical magnitude i<20 (i<21.5) also appear in the Richards et al. (2008) QSO catalog constructed using 5-band optical SDSS photometry. Comparison with the same catalog by Richards et al. shows that the completeness of the sample is approximately 40%(25%). However, for regions of the sky with very low dust extinction, like the BCS 23hr field and the Stripe 82 between 0 and 10 degrees in RA, our completeness is close to 95%, demonstrating that deep GALEX observations are almost as efficient as multi-wavelength observations at finding QSO's. GALEX observations thus provide a viable alternate route to QSO catalogs in sky regions where u-band optical photometry is not available.
