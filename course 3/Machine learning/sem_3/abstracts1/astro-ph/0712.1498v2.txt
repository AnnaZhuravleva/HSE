I provide estimates of the ultraviolet and visible light luminosity density at z~6 after accounting for the contribution from faint galaxies below the detection limit of deep Hubble and Spitzer surveys. I find the rest-frame V-band luminosity density is a factor of ~2-3 below the ultraviolet luminosity density at z~6. This implies that the maximal age of the stellar population at z~6, for a Salpeter initial mass function, and a single, passively evolving burst, must be <100 Myr. If the stars in z~6 galaxies are remnants of the star-formation that was responsible for ionizing the intergalactic medium, reionization must have been a brief process that was completed at z<7. This assumes the most current estimates of the clumping factor and escape fraction and a Salpeter slope extending up to 200 M_{\sun} for the stellar initial mass function (IMF; dN/dM \propto M^{\alpha}, \alpha=-2.3). Unless the ratio of the clumping factor to escape fraction is less than 60, a Salpeter slope for the stellar IMF and reionization redshift higher than 7 is ruled out. In order to maintain an ionized intergalactic medium from redshift 9 onwards, the stellar IMF must have a slope of \alpha=-1.65 even if stars as massive as ~200 M_{\sun} are formed. Correspondingly, if the intergalactic medium was ionized from redshift 11 onwards, the IMF must have \alpha~-1.5. The range of stellar mass densities at z~6 straddled by IMFs which result in reionization at z>7 is 1.3+/-0.4\times10^{7} Msun/Mpc^3.
