Models of the universe with arbitrary (non gravitational) interaction between the components of the cosmic fluid: the phantom energy and the background, are investigated. A general form of the interaction that is inspired in scalar-tensor theories of gravity is considered. No specific model for the phantom fluid is assumed. We concentrate our investigation on solutions that are free of the coincidence problem. We found a wide region in the parameter space where the solutions are free of the big rip singularity also. Physical arguments, together with arguments based on the analysis of the observational evidence, suggest that phantom models without big rip singularity might be preferred by Nature.
