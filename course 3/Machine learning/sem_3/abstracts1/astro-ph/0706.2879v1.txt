Using three XMM-Newton observations we study the X-ray emission of RU Lup, a accreting and wind-driving CTTS. In comparison with other bright CTTS we study possible signatures of accretion and winds in their X-ray emission. Results: We find three levels of activity among the observations of RU Lup, clearly of magnetic origin due to the corresponding high plasma temperatures. Density analysis with the OVII triplet indicates high densities in the cool plasma, suggesting accretion shocks to be a significant contributor to the soft X-ray emission. No strong overall metal depletion is observed. Excess emission at 6.4 keV during the more active phase suggest the presence of iron fluorescence. In accreting stars we find an excess of cool plasma as evidenced by lower OVIII/OVII line ratios compared to main-sequence stars. High density plasma appears to be only present in low-mass CTTS, while accreting stars with intermediate masses (> 2 M_Sun) have lower densities. Conclusions: In all investigated CTTS the characteristics of the cooler X-ray emitting plasma are influenced by the accretion process. We suspect different accretion rates and amount of funneling, possibly linked to stellar mass and radius, to be mainly responsible for the different properties of their cool plasma component. The exceptional strong X-ray absorption in RU Lup and other CTTS is probably related to accretion flows and an optically transparent wind emanating from the star or the disk.
