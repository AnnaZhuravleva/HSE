We investigate the linear theory of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the interface between a partially ionized dusty outflow and the ambient material analytically. We model the interaction as a multifluid system in a planar geometry. The unstable modes are independent from the charge polarity of the dust particles. Although our results show a stabilizing effect for charged dust particles, the growth time scale of the growing modes gradually becomes independent of the mass or charge of the dust particles when the magnetic field strength increases. We show that growth time scale decreases with increasing the magnetic field. Also, as the mass of the dust particles increases, the growth time scale of the unstable mode increases.
