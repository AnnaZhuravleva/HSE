The "1st Workshop of Astronomy and Astrophysics for Students" was organized with the purpose of bringing togheter scientific Institutions involved in Astrophysical researches, of the Campania region and beyond. In this context the expression "Astronomy and Astrophysics" was used in its broadest meaning, i.e. including all topics related to the study of the Universe: the Sun and the Solar system, Stars, Galaxies, Cosmology, Astroparticles and Astronomical Technologies, with the belief that all scientific areas would benefit from interaction with related, if not strictly connected, research environments. The goal of the Workshop was to offer Students (undergraduate, graduate, PhD and Post-Docs) the opportunity to share their expertise with colleagues studying and working in other Universities and/or Research Institutes involved in research programs of astrophysical interests. At the same time the Workshop was intended to be a place were the partecipants could, possibly for the first time, promote the work done at any level of their educational and/or professional growth.
