Some part of the relic Dark Matter is distributed in small-scale clumps which survived structure formation in inflation cosmological scenario. The annihilation of DM inside these clumps is a strong source of stable charged particles which can have a substantial density near the clump core. The streaming of the annihilation products from the clump can enhance irregularities in the galactic magnetic field. This can produce small scale variations in diffusion coefficient affecting propagation of Cosmic Rays.
