This is a report on the findings of the technology working group for the white paper on the status and future of TeV gamma-ray astronomy. The white paper is an APS commissioned document, and the overall version has also been released and can be found on astro-ph. This detailed section of the white paper discusses different technology opportunities and the technical feasibility for substantially improving IACTS and ground based particle detectors to achieve an order of magnitude better sensitivity than the instruments employed today as well as their planned upgrades. A technology roadmap for improving IACTS and ground based particle detectors is presented.
