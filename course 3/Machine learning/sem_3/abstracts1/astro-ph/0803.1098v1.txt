The search for a luminosity function for galaxies both alternative or companion to a Schechter function is a key problem in the reduction of data from catalogs of galaxies. Two luminosity functions for galaxies can be built starting from two distributions of mass as given by the fragmentation. A first overall distribution function is the Kiang function that represents a useful description of the area and volume distribution of the Poisson Voronoi diagrams. The second distribution, that covers the case of low mass galaxies, is the truncated Pareto distribution : in this model we have a natural bound due to the minimum mass/luminosity observed and an upper bound (function of the considered environment) represented by the boundary with the observed mass/luminosity overall behaviour. The mass distribution is then converted into a luminosity distribution through a standard mass-luminosity relationship.
