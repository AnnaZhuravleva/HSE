We present our attempt to characterise the frequency spectrum of the bright V 361 Hya star PG1605$+$072 from atmospheric parameter and radial velocity variations through a spectroscopic approach. Therefore we used time resolved spectroscopy ($\approx$9000 spectra) to detect line profile variations from which variations of the effective temperature and gravity, together with their phases, are extracted by means of a quantitative spectral analysis. The theoretical modelling of adequate pulsation modes with the \textit{BRUCE} and \textit{KYLE} codes allows to derive constraints on the mode's degree and order from the observed frequencies.
