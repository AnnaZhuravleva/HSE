We report on the high-precision astrometric observations of maser sources around the Galactic Center in the SiO J=1--0 v=1 and 2 lines with the VLBA during 2001 -- 2004. With phase-referencing interferometry referred to the radio continuum source Sgr A*, accurate positions of masers were obtained for three detected objects: IRS 10 EE (7 epochs), IRS 15NE (2 epochs), and SiO 6 (only 1 epoch). Because circumstellar masers of these objects were resolved into several components, proper motions for the maser sources were derived with several different methods. Combining our VLBA results with those of the previous VLA observations, we obtained the IRS 10EE proper motion of 76+-3 km s^{-1} (at 8 kpc) to the south relative to Sgr A*. Almost null proper motion of this star in the east--west direction results in a net transverse motion of the infrared reference frame of about 30+-9 km s^{-1} to the west relative to Sgr A*. The proper-motion data also suggests that IRS 10EE is an astrometric binary with an unseen massive companion.
