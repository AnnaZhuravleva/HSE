Observations with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory obtained with the MPFS integral-field spectrograph and a longslit spectrograph with the SCORPIO focal reducer are used to analyze the emission spectrum of the ionized gas in a star-forming region in the BCD galaxy VII Zw 403. We present images of the galactic central region in the H-alpha, H-beta, [SII], and [OIII] emission lines, together with maps of the relative [OIII]/H-beta and [SII]/H-alpha intensities. We have determined the parameters of the gas in bright ionized supershells, and estimated the relative abundances of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur; a low relative N/O abundance was detected.
