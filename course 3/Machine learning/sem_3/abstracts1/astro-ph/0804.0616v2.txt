Inflation driven by a single dark spinor field is discussed. We define the notion of a dark spinor field and derive the cosmological field equations for such a matter source. The conditions for inflation are determined and an exactly solvable model is presented. We find the power spectrum of the quantum fluctuation of this field and compare the results with scalar field inflation.
