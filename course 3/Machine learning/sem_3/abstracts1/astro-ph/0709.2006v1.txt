In the present work, the effect of near-degeneracy on rotational Petersen diagrams (RPD) is analysed. Seismic models are computed considering rotation effects on both equilibrium models and adiabatic oscillation frequencies (including second-order near-degeneracy effects). Contamination of coupled modes and coupling strength on the first radial modes are studied in detail. Analysis of relative intrinsic amplitudes of near-degenerate modes reveals that the identity of the fundamental radial mode and its coupled quadrupole pair are almost unaltered once near-degeneracy effects are considered. However, for the first overtone, a mixed radial/quadrupole identity is always predicted. The effect of near-degeneracy on the oscillation frequencies becomes critical for rotational velocities larger than 15-20 km/s, for which large wriggles in the evolution of the period ratios are obtained (up $10^{-2}$). Such wriggles imply uncertainties, in terms of metallicity determinations using RPD, reaching up to 0.50 dex, which can be critical for Pop. I HADS (High Amplitude \dss). In terms of mass determinations, uncertainties reaching up to 0.5 M_sun are predicted. The location of such wriggles is found to be independent of metallicity and rotational velocity, and governed mainly by the avoided-crossing phenomenon.
