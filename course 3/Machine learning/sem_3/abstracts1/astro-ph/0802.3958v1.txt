We present the results of deep near-infrared imaging observations of the z=3.1 proto-cluster region in the SSA22a field taken by MOIRCS mounted on the Subaru Telescope. We observed a 21.7 arcmin^2 field to the depths of J=24.5, H=24.3, and K=23.9 (5 sigma). We examine the distribution of the K-selected galaxies at z~3 by using the simple color cut for distant red galaxies (DRGs) as well as the photometric-redshift selection technique. The marginal density excess of DRGs and the photo-z selected objects are found around the two most luminous Ly alpha blobs (LABs). We investigate the correlation between the K-selected objects and the LABs, and find that several galaxies with stellar mass M_* = 10^9-10^11 M_solar exist in vicinity of LABs, especially around the two most luminous ones. We also find that 7 of the 8 LABs in the field have plausible K_s-band counterparts and the sum of the stellar mass possibly associated with LABs correlates with the luminosity and surface brightness of them, which implies that the origin of Ly alpha emission may be closely correlated with their stellar mass or their previous star formation phenomena.
