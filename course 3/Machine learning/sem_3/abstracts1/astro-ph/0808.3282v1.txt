One Population III dud supernova produces enough oxygen to enable ten million solar masses of primordial gas to bind into M dwarfs. This is possible because radiation from other Population III stars implodes the mixture of oxygen ejecta and primordial gas into a globular cluster. Model atmosphere calculations for oxygen dwarfs show that water blocks most of the infrared flux. The flux is redistributed into the visible to produce an unfamiliar, distinctive energy distribution. One million dud supernovae in a large protogalaxy are sufficient to produce the "dark matter" halo.
