Recent interferometric observations of the young stellar object(YSO) HH 30 have revealed a low velocity outflow in the $^{12}$CO J=1-2 molecule line (Pety et al. 2006). We present here two models of the low velocity disc winds with the aim of investigating an origin of this molecular outflow. Following Andlada et al. (2006) we treated HH 30 as a binary system. Two cases have been considered: i) the orbital period $P$ = 53 yrs and ii) $P \le$ 1 yr. Calculations showed that in the first case the outflow cone had a spiral-like structure due to summing the velocities of the orbital motion and the disc wind. Such a structure contradicts the observations. In the second case, the outflow cone demonstrates a symmetry relatively to the system axis and agrees well with the observations.
