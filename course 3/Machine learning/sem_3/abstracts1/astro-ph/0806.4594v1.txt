We study higher curvature corrections to the scalar spectral index, the tensor spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the polarization of gravitational waves. We find that the higher curvature corrections can not be negligible in the dynamics of the scalar field, although they are energetically negligible. Indeed, it turns out that the tensor-to-scalar ratio could be enhanced and the tensor spectral index could be blue due to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We estimate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves generated during the slow-roll inflation. We argue that the circular polarization can be observable with the help both of the Gauss-Bonnet and parity violating terms. We also present several examples to reveal observational implications of higher curvature corrections for chaotic inflationary models.
