Using the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue we quantify the dependency of the disc and bulge luminosity functions on galaxy inclination. Using a contemporary dust model we show that our results are consistent with galaxy discs being optically thick in their central regions (tau_B^f=3.8+/-0.7). As a consequence the measured B-band fluxes of bulges can be severely attenuated by 50% to 95% depending on disc inclination. We argue that a galaxy's optical appearance can be radically transformed by simply removing the dust, e.g. during cluster infall, with mid-type galaxies becoming earlier, redder, and more luminous. Finally we derive the mean photon escape fraction from the integrated galaxy population over the 0.1micron to 2.1 micron range, and use this to show that the energy of starlight absorbed by dust (in our model) is in close agreement with the total far-IR emission.
