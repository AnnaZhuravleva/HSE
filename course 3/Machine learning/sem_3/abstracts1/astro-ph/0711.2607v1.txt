If active galaxies are defined as extragalactic objects with appreciably non thermal spectra then a continuity exists in redshift from the highest redshift quasars to low redshift Seyferts, AGNs and allied galaxies.   Evidence is discussed for this sequence to be an evolutionary track with objects evolving from high to low intrinsic redshift with time. At the end of this evolution the objects are nearly the same age as our own galaxy and they come to rest on the traditional Hubble relation.
