In real telescopes, the optical parameters evolve with time, and the degradation is often not uniform. This introduces variations in the image profile and therefore photo-centre displacements which, unless corrected, may result in astrometric errors. The effects induced on individual telescopes and interferometric arrays are derived by numerical implementation of a range of cases. The results are evaluated with respect to the potential impact on the most relevant experiments for high precision astrometry in the near future, i.e. Gaia, PRIMA and SIM, and to mitigation techniques applicable from design stage to calibrations.
