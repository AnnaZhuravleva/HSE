I review some of the important and exciting recent advances that were presented at the 2007 conference on Extragalactic Jets in Girdwood, Alaska, using as a framework the scientific challenges presented by R. Blandford at the beginning of the meeting. Sprinkled throughout are thoughts about the marvelous prospects for jets in the next several years, as a host of new observatories mature and simulations reach new levels of sophistication.
