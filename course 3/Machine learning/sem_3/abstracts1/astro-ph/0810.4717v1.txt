We have studied the inner regions of the LINER galaxy NGC1052 since the mid 1990s at high resolution with 15 GHz very-long-baseline interferometry observations. A compact, two-sided jet structure is revealed, with multiple sub-parsec scale features moving outward from the central region with typical speeds of 0.26 c. Complementary to this, since early 2005 we are performing a multi-mission campaign of observations of this source, including X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray, and radio flux density monitoring, and VLBA observations at 22 GHz and 43 GHz. X-ray variability is present at time scales of weeks, comparable with the structural changes observed by VLBI. Here we present first results of the high-resolution imaging observations and discuss these findings in the context of the multi-band campaign.
