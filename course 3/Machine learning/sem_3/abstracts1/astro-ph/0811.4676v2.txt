We use a dynamical systems approach to study thawing quintessence models, using a multi-parameter extension of the exponential potential which can approximate the form of typical thawing potentials. We impose observational constraints using a compilation of current data, and forecast the tightening of constraints expected from future dark energy surveys, as well as discussing the relation of our results to analytical constraints already in the literature.
