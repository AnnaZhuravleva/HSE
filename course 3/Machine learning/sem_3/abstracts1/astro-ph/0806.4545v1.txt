We report CO observations towards MS0735.6+7421 a distant cooling core galaxy, and towards M87, the nearest cooling core in the center of the Virgo cluster. Both galaxies contain radio cavities that are thought to be responsible for the heating that can regulate or stop the cooling of the surrounding gas. In this feedback process, there could still be some gas cooling along filaments, along the borders of the radio cavities. Molecular gas is known to exist in clusters with cooling cores, in long and thin filaments that can be formed behind the rising bubbles inflated by the central AGN. CO emission was searched for at several locations along the radio lobes of those two galaxies, but only upper limits were found. These correspond to cold gas mass limits of a few 10^9 Msol for each pointing in MS0735.6+7421, and a few 10^6 Msol in M87. This non detection means that either the cooling is strongly reduced by the AGN feedback or that the gas is cooling in very localized places like thin filaments, possibly diluted in the large beam for MS0735.6+7421. For M87, the AGN heating appears to have stopped the cooling completely.
