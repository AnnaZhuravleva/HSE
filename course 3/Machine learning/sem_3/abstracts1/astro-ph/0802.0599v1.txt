The parameters of cosmological model with cold dark matter and cosmological constant (Lambda CDM) have been determined on a basis of three-year cosmic microwave background observations by space mission WMAP, as well as the data on the large-scale structure of the Universe. The data cover scales from 1 up to 10000 Mpc. The best-fit values of LambdaCDM model parameters were found by minimization of chi^2 using the Levenberg-Markquardt approach (Omega_Lambda=0.736+-0.065, Omega_m=0.238+-0.080, Omega_b=0.05+-0.011, h=0.68+- 0.09, sigma_8=0.73+-0.08 and n_s=0.96+-0.015). It is shown that the LambdaCDM model with these values of the parameters agrees well with the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background and with power spectra of the density perturbations, estimated from spatial distributions of galaxies, rich galaxy clusters and from statistics of Ly_alpha absorption lines in spectra of distant quasars as well. The accordance of modeled characteristics of the large-scale structure with observable ones was analyzed, and possible reasons of significant discrepancies between some of them were considered.
