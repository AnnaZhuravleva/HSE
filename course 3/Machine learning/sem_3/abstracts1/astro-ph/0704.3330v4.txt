In this note, we extend our previous work [Phys. Lett. B 644, 7 (2007), astro-ph/0609597], and compare eleven interacting dark energy models with different couplings to the observational $H(z)$ data. However, none of these models is better than the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model. This implies that either more exotic couplings are needed in the cosmological models with interaction between dark energy and dust matter, or {\em there is no interaction at all}. We consider that this result is disadvantageous to the interacting dark energy models studied extensively in the literature.
