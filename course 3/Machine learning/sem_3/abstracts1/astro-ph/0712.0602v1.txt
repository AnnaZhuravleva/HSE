We present deep and accurate photometry (F435W, F625W, F658N) of the Galactic Globular Cluster Omega Cen collected with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We identified ~ 6,500 white dwarf (WD)candidates and compared their radial distribution with that of Main Sequence (MS) stars. We found a mild evidence that young WDs (0.1 < t < 0.6 Gyr) are less centrally concentrated when compared to MS stars in the magnitude range 25 < F435W < 26.5.
