Our ignorance of the dark energy is generally described by a two-parameter equation of state. In these approaches a particular {\it ad hoc} functional form is assumed, and only two independent parameters are incorporated. We propose a model-independent, multi-parameter approach to fitting the dark energy, and show that next-generation surveys will constrain the equation of state in three or more independent redshift bins to better than 10%. Future knowledge of the dark energy will surpass two numbers (e.g., [$w_0$,$w_1$] or [$w_0$,$w_a$]), and we propose a more flexible approach to the analysis of present and future data.
