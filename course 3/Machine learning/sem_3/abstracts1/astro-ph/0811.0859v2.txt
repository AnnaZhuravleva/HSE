We present a unified rotation curve of the Galaxy re-constructed from the existing data by re-calculating the distances and velocities for a set of galactic constants R_0=8 kpc and V_0=200 km/s. We decompose it into a bulge with de Vaucouleurs-law profile of half-mass scale radius 0.5 kpc and mass 1.8 x 10^{10}M_{sun}, an exponential disk of scale radius 3.5 kpc of 6.5 x 10^{10}M_{sun}, and an isothermal dark halo of terminal velocity 200 km/s. The r^{1/4}-law fit was obtained for the first time for the Milky Way's rotation curve. After fitting by these fundamental structures, two local minima, or the dips, of rotation velocity are prominent at radii 3 and 9 kpc. The 3-kpc dip is consistent with the observed bar. It is alternatively explained by a massive ring with the density maximum at radius 4 kpc. The 9-kpc dip is clearly exhibited as the most peculiar feature in the galactic rotation curve. We explain it by a massive ring of amplitude as large as 0.3 to 0.4 times the disk density with the density peak at radius 11 kpc. This great ring may be related to the Perseus arm, while no peculiar feature of HI-gas is associated.
