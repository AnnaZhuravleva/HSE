For the initial fields of the density contrast and peculiar velocity, we theoretically calculate the differential and integral length scales, i.e., statistical measures that respectively characterize the small- and large-scale fluctuations of a random field. These length scales and the associated mass scales explain the length and mass scales observed for (1) halos of young galaxies at z > 5, (2) halos of galaxies at z = 0, and (3) the largest structures in the galaxy distribution at z = 0. We thereby discuss that such observed scales are fossil imprints of the characteristic scales of the initial fields.
