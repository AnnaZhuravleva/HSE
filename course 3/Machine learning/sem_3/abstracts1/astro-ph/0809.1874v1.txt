We speculate that a new generation of particle astrophysics instrumentation will reveal the enigmatic sources of cosmic rays prior to the one hundredth anniversary of their discovery by Hess in 1912. While only a "smoking gun'' is missing for the case that the galactic component of the cosmic ray spectrum originates in supernova remnants, deciphering the origin of the extragalactic component is still at a level of reading tea leaves.
