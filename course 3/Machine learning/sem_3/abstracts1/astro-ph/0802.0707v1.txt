We present high spectral resolution optical spectra of three young intermediate mass stars, in all of which we spectrally resolve the 6300 Angstrom [OI] emission line. Two of these have a double peaked line profile. We fit these data with a simple model of the [OI] emission caused by photo-dissociation of OH molecules in the upper layer of a circumstellar disk by stellar UV radiation and thus translate the Doppler broadened [OI] emission profile into an amount of emission as a function of distance from the central star. The resulting spectra are in agreement with the expected disk shapes as derived from their spectral energy distribution. We find evidence for shadowing by an inner rim in the disk surrounding HD101412 and see a flaring disk structure in HD179218 while the [OI] spectrum of HD135344 is more complex. The [OI] emission starts for all three targets at velocities corresponding to their dust sublimation radius and extends up to radii of 10 -- 90 AU. This shows that this method can be a valuable tool in the future investigation of circumstellar disks.
