The knowledge of mass loss rates due to thermal winds in cool dwarfs is of crucial importance for modeling evolution of physical parameters of main sequence single and binary stars. Very few, sometimes contradictory, measurements of such mass loss rates exist up to now. We present a new, independent method of measuring an amount of mass lost by a star during its past life. It is based on the comparison of the present mass distribution of solar type stars in an open cluster with the calculated distribution under an assumption that stars with masses lower than M(lim) have lost an amount of mass equal to DeltaM. The actual value of DeltaM or its upper limit is found from the best fit. Analysis of four clusters: Pleiades, NGC 6996, Hyades and Praesepe gave upper limits for DeltaM in three of them and the inconclusive result for Pleiades. The most restrictive limit was obtained for Praesepe indicating that the average mass loss rate of cool dwarfs in this cluster was lower than 6x10^{-11} M(sun)/yr. With more accurate mass determinations of the solar type members of selected open clusters, including those of spectral type K, the method will provide more stringent limits for mass loss of cool dwarfs.
