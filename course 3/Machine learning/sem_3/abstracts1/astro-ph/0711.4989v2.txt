To study the local Hubble flow, we have run constrained dark matter   (DM) simulations of the Local Group (LG) in the concordance LCDM and OCDM cosmologies, with identical cosmological parameters apart from the Lambda term. The simulations were performed within a computational box of 64 h^{-1}Mpc centred on the LG. The initial conditions were constrained by the observed peculiar velocities of galaxies and positions of X-ray nearby clusters of galaxies. The simulations faithfully reproduce the nearby large scale structure, and in particular the Local Supercluster and the Virgo cluster. LG-like objects have been selected from the DM halos so as to closely resemble the dynamical properties of the LG. Both the LCDM and OCDM simulations show very similar local Hubble flow around the LG-like objects. It follows that, contrary to recent statements, the dark energy (DE) does not manifest itself in the local dynamics.
