We present the results of relic density calculations for cold dark matter candidates coming from a model of dark energy and dark matter, which is described by an asymptotically free gauge group SU(2)_Z (QZD) with a coupling constant alpha_Z ~ 1 at very low scale of Lambda_Z ~ 10^(-3) eV while alpha_Z ~ weak coupling at high energies. The dark matter candidates of QZD are two fermions in the form of weakly interacting massive particles. Our results show that for masses between 50 and 285 GeV, they can account for either a considerable fraction or the entire dark matter of the Universe.
