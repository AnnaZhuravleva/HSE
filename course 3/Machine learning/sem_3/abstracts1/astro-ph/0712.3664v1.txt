New determinations of effective temperatures of 23 magnetic, chemically peculiar (mCP) stars were obtained from a fit of metal enhanced model atmospheres to the observed spectral energy distributions (SED) from UV to red. The root-mean-square (RMS) method was used to fit the theoretical SED to the observations corrected for reddening if necessary, with metallicity and effective temperature as the fitting parameters. Gravity was assumed to be equal to log g = 4 for main sequence stars and to log g = 3 for two giants in the considered sample. Equal weights were given to the UV part and visual part of SED. Independently of the formal quality of fit resulting from the RMS method applied to the whole SED, the quality of fit was additionally checked for each star by determination of the temperature from the best fitting model atmosphere to the UV part and the visual part of SED separately. Both temperatures should be close to one another if the global best fitting model satisfactorily describes the full observed SED. This is the case for about a half of the investigated stars but the difference exceeds 750 K for the remaining stars with the extreme values above 2000 K. Possible reasons for such discrepancies are discussed. New, revised calibrations of effective temperature and bolometric corrections of mCP stars in terms of reddening free Stromgren indices are given.
