(ABRIDGED) Studies of debris disks have shown that most systems are analogous to the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt. However a rare subset of sun-like stars possess dust which lies in the terrestrial planet region. In this study we aim to determine how many sources with apparent mid-IR excess are truly hosts of warm dust, and investigate where the dust must lie. We observed using mid-IR imaging with TIMMI2, VISIR and MICHELLE a sample of FGK main sequence stars reported to have hot dust. A new modelling approach was developed to determine the constraints that can be set on the radial extent of excess emission. We confirm the presence of warm dust around 3 of the candidates (eta Corvi, HD145263 and HD202406), and present constraints on the emitting dust regions. Of 2 alternative models for the eta Corvi excess emission, we find that a model with 1 hot dust component at <3 AU (combined with the known submm dust population) fits the data better at the 2.6sigma level than an alternative model with 2 populations of dust in the mid-IR. We identify several systems which have a companion (HD65277 and HD79873) or background object (HD53246, HD123356 and HD128400) responsible for their mid-infrared excess, and for 3 other systems we were able to rule out a point-like source near the star at the level of excess observed in lower resolution observations (HD12039, HD69830 and HD191089). Hot dust sources are either young and possibly primordial or transitional, or have relatively small radius steady-state planetesimal belts, or they are old and luminous with transient emission. High resolution imaging can be used to constrain the location of the disk and help to discriminate between different models of disk emission. For some small disks, interferometry is needed to resolve the disk location.
