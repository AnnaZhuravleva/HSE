We describe a scenario for large-scale magnetic field generation and particle acceleration in a collisionless collision of cold plasma clouds. A first-principle (i.e. using particles) numerical simulation of this process might be possible. Our scenario is essentially 3D. We argue that {\it large-scale} magnetic fields are not generated in 2D, even in collisionless plasma.   We calculate and numerically simulate magnetic field generation by relativistic collisionless Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in 2D. Collisionless tangential discontinuity might be more important than collisionless shock, because tangential discontinuity remains unstable even in the hydro limit, when the shock stabilizes.
