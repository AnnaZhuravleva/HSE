We present computational results showing eccentricity growth in the inner portions of a protoplanetary disc. We attribute this to the evolving surface density of the disc. The planet creates a gap, which adjusts the balance between the 3:1 (eccentricity exciting) and 2:1 (eccentricity damping) resonances. The eccentricity of the inner disc can rise as high as 0.3, which is sufficient to cause it to be accreted onto the star. This offers an alternative mechanism for producing the large holes observed in the discs of CoKu Tau/4, GM Aur and DM Tau.
