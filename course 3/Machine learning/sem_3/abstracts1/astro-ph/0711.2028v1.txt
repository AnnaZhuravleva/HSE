We report the discovery of five new millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster NGC 6440 and three new ones in NGC 6441; each cluster has one previously known pulsar. Four of the new pulsars are found in binary systems. One of the new pulsars, PSR J1748-2021B in NGC 6440, is notable for its eccentric (e = 0.57) and wide (P_b = 20.5 days) orbit. If the rate of advance of periastron is due solely to general relativity, we can estimate of the total mass of this binary system: 2.92 +/- 0.20 solar masses. This would imply an anomalously large mass for this pulsar, which could introduce important constraints in the study of the equation of state for cold neutron matter.
