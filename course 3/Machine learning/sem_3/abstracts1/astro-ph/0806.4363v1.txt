The next decade can be considered the "golden age" of the Gamma Ray Astronomy with the two satellites for Gamma Ray Astronomy (AGILE and GLAST) in orbit. Therefore, thanks to many other X-ray experiments already in orbit (e.g. Swift, Chandra, NewtonXMM, etc.) it will be possible to image the Universe for the first time all over the electromagnetic spectrum almost contemporarily. The new generations of ground-based very high gamma-ray instruments are ready to extend the observed band also to the very high frequencies. Scientists from the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) are involved in many, both space- and ground- based gamma ray experiments, and recently such an involvement has been largely improved in the field of the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). INAF is now member of the MAGIC collaboration and is participating to the realization of the second MAGIC telescope. MAGIC, as well other IACT experiments, is not operated as an observatory so a proper guest observer program does not exist. A consortium of European scientists (including INAF scientists) is thus now thinking to the design of a new research infrastructure: the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). CTA is conceived to provide 10 times the sensitivity of current instruments, combined with increased flexibility and increased coverage from some 10 GeV to some 100 TeV. CTA will be operated as an observatory to serve a wider community of astronomer and astroparticle physicists.
