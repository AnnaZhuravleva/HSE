FERMI (formely GLAST) will shortly provide crucial information on relativistic particles in galaxy clusters. We discuss non-thermal emission in the context of general calculations in which relativistic particles (protons and secondary electrons due to proton-proton collisions) interact with MHD turbulence generated in the cluster volume during cluster mergers. Diffuse cluster-scale radio emission (Radio Halos) and hard X-rays are produced during massive mergers while gamma ray emission, at some level, is expected to be common in galaxy clusters.
