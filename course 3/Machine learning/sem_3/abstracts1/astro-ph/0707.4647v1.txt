Explicitly time-dependent, nonlinear kinetic theory of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) has been employed to investigate the properties of SNR RX J1713.7-3946. Observations of the nonthermal radio and X-ray emission spectra as well as earlier H.E.S.S. measurements of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission were used to constrain the astronomical and the particle acceleration parameters of the system. The model assumes that the object was a core collapse supernova (SN) with a massive progenitor, has an age of $\approx 1600$ yr and is at a distance of $\approx 1$ kpc. It is shown that an efficient production of nuclear CRs, leading to strong shock modification and a large downstream magnetic field strength $B_{\mathrm{d}}\sim100$ $\mu$G, can reproduce the observed synchrotron emission from radio to X-ray frequencies together with the \gr spectral characteristics as observed by the H.E.S.S. telescopes. Small-scale filamentary structures observed in nonthermal X-rays provide empirical confirmation for this field amplification scenario which leads to a strong depression of the inverse Compton and Bremsstrahlung fluxes. The results are compared with the latest H.E.S.S. observations.
