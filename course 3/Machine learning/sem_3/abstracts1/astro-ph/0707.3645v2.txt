We study the physical processes that affect the alignment of grains subject to radiative torques (RATs). To describe the action of RATs, we use the analytical model (AMO) of RATs introduced in Paper I. We focus our discussion on the alignment by anisotropic radiation flux with respect to magnetic field, which defines the axis of grain Larmor precession. Such an alignment does not invoke paramagnetic dissipation (i.e. Davis-Greenstein mechanism), but, nevertheless, grains tend to be aligned with long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field. When we account for thermal fluctuations within grain material, we show that for grains, which are characterized by a triaxial ellipsoid of inertia, the zero-$J$ attractor point obtained in our earlier study develops into a low-$J$ attractor point. We study effects of stochastic gaseous bombardment and show that gaseous bombardment can drive grains from low-$J$ to high-$J$ attractor points in cases when the high-$J$ attractor points are present. As the alignment of grain axes with respect to angular momentum is higher for higher values of $J$, counter-intuitively, gaseous bombardment can increase the degree of grain alignment in respect to the magnetic field. We also study the effects of torques induced by H$_2$ formation and show that they can change the value of angular momentum at high-$J$ attractor point, but marginally affect the value of angular momentum at low-$J$ attractor points. We compare the AMO results with those obtained using the direct numerical calculations of RATs acting upon irregular grains and validate the use of the AMO for realistic situations of RAT alignment.
