MOJAVE is a long term VLBA program to investigate the kinematics and polarization evolution of a complete sample of 133 active galactic nuclei selected on the basis of compact, relativistically beamed jet emission at 15 GHz. By fitting to the apparent distributions of superluminal speed and jet luminosity, we can constrain the Lorentz factor distribution and intrinsic luminosity function of the radio-selected blazar parent population. These low-energy peaked blazars formed a significant fraction of all EGRET detections, and should figure prominently in the GLAST source catalog. Using simple models, we investigate the predicted distribution of GLAST blazars in the gamma-ray/radio flux density plane, and describe an extension of the MOJAVE survey that will provide extensive parsec-scale jet information in complete regions of this plane. We find that if a population of intrinsically radio bright yet gamma-ray weak blazars exists, its signal will be largely wiped out by the large gamma-ray flux scatter associated with Doppler beaming.
