We have analysed the 24um properties of a radio-selected sample in the Subaru-XMM/Newton Deep Field in order to explore the behaviour of the FIR/radio relation at high redshifts. Statistically, the correlation is described by q24, the ratio between the observed flux densities at 24um and 1.4GHz, respectively. Using 24um data results in considerably more scatter in the correlation than previous work using data at 60-70um. Nevertheless, we do observe a steady correlation as a function of redshift, up to z~3.5, suggesting its validity back to primeval times. We find q24 = 0.30 +/- 0.56 for the observed and q24 = 0.71 +/- 0.47 for the k-corrected radio sample, based on sources with 300uJy < S(1.4GHz) < 3.2mJy and 24um detections. A suitable k-correction given by a M82-like mid-IR template suggests no extreme silicate absorption in the bulk of our radio sample. Using thresholds in q24 to identify radio-excess sources, we have been able to characterise the transition from radio-loud AGN to star-forming galaxies and radio-quiet AGN at faint (<1mJy) radio flux densities. Our results are in broad agreement with previous studies which show a dominant radio-loud AGN population at >1mJy. The rest-frame U-B colours of the expected radio-excess population have redder distribution than those that follow the correlation. This is therefore a promising way to select obscured Type-2 AGN, with a radio loud nature, missed by deep X-ray observations. Spectroscopic follow-up of these sources is required to fully test this method.
