We present the status and the recent measurements from the Pierre Auger Observatory. The energy spectrum will be described and its steepening discussed. The mass composition is addressed with the measurements of the variation of the depth of shower maximum with energy. We also report on upper limits in the primary photon fraction. And finally, searches for anisotropies of cosmic rays arrival directions are reported.
