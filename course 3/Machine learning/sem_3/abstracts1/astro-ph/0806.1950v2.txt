We forecast constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity achievable from forthcoming surveys by exploiting the scale-dependent halo bias introduced on large scales by non-Gaussian initial conditions. We explore the performance of exploiting both the shape of the galaxy power-spectrum on large scales and the cross-correlation of galaxies with Cosmic Microwave Background maps through the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect. We find that future surveys can detect primordial non-Gaussianity of the local form with a non-Gaussianity parameter $|f_{\rm NL}|$ of order unity. This is particularly exciting because, while the simplest single-field slow-roll models of inflation predict a primordial $|f_{\rm NL}|\ll 1$, this signal sources extra contributions to the effective $f_{\rm NL}$ of large-scale structures that are expected to be above our predicted detection threshold.
