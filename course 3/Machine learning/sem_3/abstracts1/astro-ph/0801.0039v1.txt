Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are thought to be magnetars, which are neutron stars with ultra strong magnetic field of $10^{14}$-- $10^{15}$ G. Their energy spectra below $\sim$10 keV are modeled well by two components consisting of a blackbody (BB) ($\sim$0.4 keV) and rather steep power-law (POW) function (photon index $\sim$2-4). Kuiper et al.(2004) discovered hard X-ray component above $\sim$10 keV from some AXPs. Here, we present the Suzaku observation of the AXP 1E 1841-045 at the center of supernova remnant Kes 73. By this observation, we could analyze the spectrum from 0.4 to 50 keV at the same time. Then, we could test whether the spectral model above was valid or not in this wide energy range. We found that there were residual in the spectral fits when fit by the model of BB + POW. Fits were improved by adding another BB or POW component. But the meaning of each component became ambiguous in the phase-resolved spectroscopy. Alternatively we found that NPEX model fit well for both phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra. In this case, the photon indices were constant during all phase, and spectral variation seemed to be very clear. This fact suggests somewhat fundamental meaning for the emission from magnetars.
