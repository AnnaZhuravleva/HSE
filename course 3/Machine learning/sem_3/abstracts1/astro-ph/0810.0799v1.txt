VERITAS observed the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and IC 443 during 2007, resulting in strong TeV detections of both sources. Cas A is a young remnant, and bright in both the radio and nonthermal X-rays, both tracers of cosmic-ray electrons. IC 443 is a middle-aged composite remnant interacting with a molecular cloud; the molecular cloud provides an enhanced density of target material for hadronic cosmic rays to produce TeV gamma rays via pion decay. The TeV morphology - point-like for Cas A and extended for IC 443 - will be discussed in the context of existing multiwavelength data on the remnants.
