We report here on the discovery of a red quasar, J004929.4+351025.7 at a redshift of z = 2.48, situated within a large Lya emission-line halo. The radio spectral energy distribution implies that the radio jets were triggered < 10^4 years prior to the time at which the object is observed, suggesting that the jet triggering of the active galactic nucleus is recent. The loosely biconical structure of the emission-line halo suggests that it is ionised by photons emitted by the central quasar nucleus and that the central nucleus is obscured by a dusty torus with Av ~ 3.0. The large spatial extent of the Lya halo relative to the radio emission means this could only have occurred if the radio jets emerged from an already established highly-accreting black hole. This suggests that the radio-jet triggering is delayed with respect to the onset of accretion activity on to the central supermassive black hole.
