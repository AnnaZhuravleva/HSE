A detailed general relativistic (GR) calculation of the neutrino path for a general metric describing a rotating star is studied. We have calculated the neutrino path along a plane, with the consideration that the neutrino does not at any time leave the plane. The expression for the minimum photosphere radius (MPR) is obtained and matched with the Schwarzschild limit. The MPR is calculated for the stars with two different equations of state (EOS) each rotating with two different velocities. The results shows that the MPR for the hadronic star is much greater than the quark star and the MPR increases as the rotational velocity of the star decreases. The MPR along the polar plane is larger than that along the equatorial plane.
