In this paper we consider $\phi^2$ scalar field potential as a candidate to dark matter. If it is an ultralight boson particle, it condensates like a Bose-Einstein system at very early times and forms the basic structure of the Universe. Real scalar fields collapse in equilibrium configurations that oscillate in space-time (oscillatons).The cosmological behavior of the field equations are solved using the dynamical system formalism. We use the current cosmological parameters as constraints for the present value of the scalar field. We reproduce the cosmological predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model with this model. Therefore, scalar field dark matter seems to be a good alternative to cold dark matter nature.
