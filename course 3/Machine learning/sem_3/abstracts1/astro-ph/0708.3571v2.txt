MAGIC, 17 meters of diameter, is the world's largest single dish Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope, and reaches in the analysis the lowest energy threshold (60 GeV) among the VHE gamma detectors. Completed in September 2004, MAGIC started full operation with its first cycle of data taking in February 2005. MAGIC observations in the galaxy cover, among others, supernova remnants, the Galactic Center and binary systems. The low threshold makes of MAGIC the IACT looking deepest in the Universe: the record of extragalactic sources detected includes Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at z > 0.2. Here we discuss the present performance of MAGIC and the policy for the use of MAGIC data in multiwavelength campaigns. After a review of some recent highlights from MW studies, including the discovery of the most distant source ever detected (the AGN 3C279 at z = 0.54), we present the expected performance of MAGIC after the inauguration of the second telescope, scheduled for September 21st, 2008. Multiwavelength studies are a key for the study of emission mechanisms from galactic and extragalactic sources, and Very-High Energy photon detectors are becoming crucial as the GLAST era approaches.
