There is ${}^3P_2$ neutron superfluid region in NS (neutron star) interior. For a rotating NS, the ${}^3P_2$ superfluid region is like a system of rotating magnetic dipoles. It will give out electromagnetic radiation, which may provides a new heating mechanism of NSs. This heating mechanism plus some cooling agent may give sound explanation to NS glitches.
