If galaxy clusters contain intracluster dust, the spectra of galaxies lying behind clusters should show attenuation by dust absorption. We compare the optical (3500 - 7200 \AA) spectra of 60,267 luminous, early-type galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to search for the signatures of intracluster dust in z ~ 0.05 clusters. We select massive, quiescent (i.e., non-star-forming) galaxies using an EW(Halpha) <= 2 \AA cut and consider galaxies in three bins of velocity dispersion, ranging from 150 to 300 km s^{-1}. The uniformity of early-type galaxy spectra in the optical allows us to construct inverse-variance-weighted composite spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio (ranging from 10^2-10^3). We compare the composite spectra of galaxies that lie behind and adjacent to galaxy clusters and find no convincing evidence of dust attenuation on scales ~ 0.15-2 Mpc; we derive a generic limit of E(B-V) < 3 x 10^{-3} mag on scales ~ 1-2 Mpc at the 99% confidence level, using conservative jackknife error bars, corresponding to a dust mass <~ 10^8 $M_{\odot}$. On scales smaller than 1 Mpc this limit is slightly weaker, E(B-V) < 8 x 10^{-3} mag.
