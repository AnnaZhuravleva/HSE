We calculate the GeV spectra of GRB afterglows produced by inverse Compton scattering of the sub-MeV emission of these objects. We improve on earlier treatments by using refined afterglow parameters and new model developments motivated by recent Swift observations. We present time-dependent GeV spectra for standard, constant parameter models, as well as for models with energy injection and with time-varying parameters, for a range of burst parameters. We evaluate the limiting redshift to which such afterglows can be detected by the GLAST LAT, as well as AGILE.
