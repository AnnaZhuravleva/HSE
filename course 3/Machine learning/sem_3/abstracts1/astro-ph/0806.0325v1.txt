We present a morphological study of the two richest superclusters from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (SCL126, the Sloan Great Wall, and SCL9, the Sculptor supercluster). We use Minkowski functionals, shapefinders, and galaxy group information to study the substructure of these superclusters as formed by different populations of galaxies. We compare the properties of grouped and isolated galaxies in the core region and in the outskirts of superclusters. The fourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ and the morphological signature $K_1$- $K_2$ show a crossover from low-density morphology (outskirts of supercluster) to high-density morphology (core of supercluster) at mass fraction $m_f \approx 0.7$. The galaxy content and the morphology of the galaxy populations in supercluster cores and outskirts is different. The core regions contain a larger fraction of early type, red galaxies, and richer groups than the outskirts of superclusters. In the core and outskirt regions the fine structure of the two prominent superclusters as delineated by galaxies from different populations also differs. Our results suggest that both local (group/cluster) and global (supercluster) environments are important in forming galaxy morphologies and colors (and determining the star formation activity). The differences between the superclusters indicate that these superclusters have different evolutional histories (Abridged).
