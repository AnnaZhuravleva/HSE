Context: Evershed clouds (ECs) represent the most conspicuous variation of the Evershed flow in sunspot penumbrae. Aims: We determine the physical properties of ECs from high spatial and temporal resolution spectropolarimetric measurements. Methods: The Stokes profiles of four visible and three infrared spectral lines are subject to inversions based on simple one-component models as well as more sophisticated realizations of penumbral flux tubes embedded in a static ambient field (uncombed models). Results: According to the one-component inversions, the EC phenomenon can be understood as a perturbation of the magnetic and dynamic configuration of the penumbral filaments along which these structures move. The uncombed inversions, on the other hand, suggest that ECs are the result of enhancements in the visibility of penumbral flux tubes. We conjecture that the enhancements are caused by a perturbation of the thermodynamic properties of the tubes, rather than by changes in the vector magnetic field. The feasibility of this mechanism is investigated performing numerical experiments of thick penumbral tubes in mechanical equilibrium with a background field. Conclusions: While the one-component inversions confirm many of the properties indicated by a simple line parameter analysis (Paper I of this series), we tend to give more credit to the results of the uncombed inversions because they take into account, at least in an approximate manner, the fine structure of the penumbra.
