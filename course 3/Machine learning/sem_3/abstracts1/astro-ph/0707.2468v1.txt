The problem of extinction is the most important issue to be dealt with in the process of obtaining true absolute magnitudes of core-collapse supernovae (SNe). The plane-parallel model which gives absorption dependent on galaxy inclination, widely used in the past, was shown not to describe extinction adequately. We try to apply an alternative model which introduces radial ependence of extinction. A certain trend of dimmer SNe with decreasing radius from the center of a galaxy was found, for a chosen sample of stripped-envelope SNe.
