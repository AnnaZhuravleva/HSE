The expansion rate of `Intermediate inflation' lies between the exponential and power law expansion but corresponding accelerated expansion does not start at the onset of cosmological evolution. Present study of `Intermediate inflation' reveals that it admits scaling solution and has got a natural exit form it at a later epoch of cosmic evolution, leading to late time acceleration. The corresponding scalar field responsible for such feature is also found to be a tracker field for both gravity with canonical and some non-canonical form of kinetic term. Thus the so called Intermediate inflation should be considered as yet another dark energy model with asymptotic de-Sitter expansion.
