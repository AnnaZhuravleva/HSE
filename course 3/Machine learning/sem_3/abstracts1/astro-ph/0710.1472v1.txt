Very recently, J 1128+5925 was found to show strong intraday variability at radio wavelengths and may be a new source with annual modulation of the timescale of its radio variability. Therefore, its radio variability can be best explained via interstellar scintillation. Here we present the properties of its optical variability for the first time after a monitoring program in 2007 May. Our observations indicate that in this period J 1128+5925 only showed trivial optical variability on internight timescale, and did not show any clear intranight variability. This behavior is quite different from its strong radio intraday variability. Either this object was in a quiescent state in optical in this period, or it is intrinsically not so active in optical as it is in radio regimes.
