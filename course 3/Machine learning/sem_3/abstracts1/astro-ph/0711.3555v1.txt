Presuming weak collisional interactions to exchange the kinetic energy between dark matter and baryonic matter in a galaxy cluster, we re-examine the effectiveness of this process in several `cooling flow' galaxy clusters using available X-ray observations and infer an upper limit on the heavy dark matter particle (DMP)$-$proton cross section $\sigma_{\rm xp}$. With a relative collisional velocity $V-$dependent power-law form of $\sigma_{\rm xp}=\sigma_0(V/10^3 {\rm km s^{-1}})^a$ where $a\leq 0$, our inferred upper limit is $\sigma_0/m_{\rm x}\lsim 2\times10^{-25} {\rm cm}^2 {\rm GeV}^{-1}$ with $m_{\rm x}$ being the DMP mass. Based on a simple stability analysis of the thermal energy balance equation, we argue that the mechanism of DMP$-$baryon collisional interactions is unlikely to be a stable nongravitational heating source of intracluster medium (ICM) in inner core regions of `cooling flow' galaxy clusters.
