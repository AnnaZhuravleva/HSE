Possibilities of an experimental search for gamma-ray bursts from primordial black hole (PBH) evaporations in space are reconsidered. It is argued that the corresponding constraints which can be obtained in experiments with cosmic ray detectors strongly depend on theoretical approach used for a description of the PBH evaporation process. Predictions of several theoretical models for gamma-ray spectra from final stages of PBH life (integrated over time) are given.
