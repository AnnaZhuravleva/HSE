The EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays shows all the features expected from dark matter annihilation (DMA): a spectral shape given by the fragmentation of mono-energetic quarks, which is the same in all sky directions and an intensity distribution of the excess expected from a standard dark matter halo, predicted by the rotation curve. From the EGRET excess one can predict the flux of antiprotons from DMA. However, how many antiprotons arrive at the detector strongly depends on the propagation model. The conventional isotropic propagation models trap the antiprotons in the Galaxy leading to a local antiproton flux far above the observed flux. According to Bergstrom et. al. this excludes the DMA interpretation of the EGRET excess. Here it is shown that more realistic anisotropic propagation models, in which most antiprotons escape by fast transport in the z-direction, are consistent with the B/C ratio, the antiproton flux and the EGRET excess from DMA.
