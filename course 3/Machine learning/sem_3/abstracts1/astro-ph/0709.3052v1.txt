A great effort is being made by the international Virtual Observatory community to build tools ready to be used by scientists. Presently, providing access to theoretical spectra in general, and synthetic spectra of galaxies in particular, is a matter of current interest in the Virtual Observatory. Several ways of accessing such spectra are available. We present two of them for accessing PEGASE.HR evolutionary synthesis models: HTTP-access to a limited number of parameters using Simple Spectral Access Protocol (SSAP), and full-featured WEB-service based access using Common Execution Architecture (CEA).
