We present semi-analytic models of galactic outflows, constrained by available observations on high redshift star formation and reionization. Galactic outflows are modeled in a manner akin to models of stellar wind blown bubbles. Large scale outflows can generically escape from low mass halos (M<10^9 M_sun) for a wide range of model parameters but not from high mass halos (M> 10^{11} M_sun). The gas phase metallicity of the outflow and within the galaxy are computed. Ionization states of different metal species are calculated and used to examine the detectability of metal lines from the outflows. The global influence of galactic outflows is also investigated. Models with only atomic cooled halos significantly fill the IGM at z~3 with metals (with -2.5>[Z/Z_sun]>-3.7), the actual extent depending on the efficiency of winds, the IMF, the fractional mass that goes through star formation and the reionization history of the universe. In these models, a large fraction of outflows at z~3 are supersonic, hot (T> 10^5 K) and have low density, making metal lines difficult to detect. They may also result in significant perturbations in the IGM gas on scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest. On the contrary, models including molecular cooled halos with a normal mode of star formation can potentially volume fill the universe at z> 8 without drastic dynamic effects on the IGM, thereby setting up a possible metallicity floor (-4.0<[Z/Z_sun]<-3.6). Interestingly, molecular cooled halos with a ``top-heavy'' mode of star formation are not very successful in establishing the metallicity floor because of the additional radiative feedback, that they induce.
