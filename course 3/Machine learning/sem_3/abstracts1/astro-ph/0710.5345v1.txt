We extend and apply a model-independent analysis method developed earlier by Daly & Djorgovski to new samples of supernova standard candles, radio galaxy and cluster standard rulers, and use it to constrain physical properties of the dark energy as functions of redshift. Similar results are obtained for the radio galaxy and supernova data sets. The first and second derivatives of the distance are compared directly with predictions in a standard model based on General Relativity. The good agreement indicates that General Relativity provides an accurate description of the data on look-back time scales of about ten billion years. The first and second derivatives are combined to obtain the acceleration parameter, assuming only the validity of the Robertson-Walker metric, independent of a theory of gravity and of the physical nature of the dark energy. The acceleration of the universe at the current epoch is indicated by the analysis. The effect of non-zero space curvature on q(z) is explored. We solve for the pressure, energy density, equation of state, and potential and kinetic energy of the dark energy as functions of redshift assuming that General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity, and the results indicate that a cosmological constant in a spatially flat universe provides a good description of each of these quantities over the redshift range from zero to about one. We define a new function, the dark energy indicator, in terms of the first and second derivatives of the coordinate distance and show how this can be used to measure deviations of w from -1 and to obtain a new and independent measure of Omega.
