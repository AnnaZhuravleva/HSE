Before 2004, nearly all GRB afterglow data could be understood in the context of the external shocks model. This situation has changed in the past two years, when it became clear that some afterglow components should be attributed to the activity of the central engine; i.e., the {\it central engine afterglow}. We review here the afterglow emission that is directly related to the GRB central engine. Such an interpretation proposed by Katz, Piran & Sari, peculiar in pre-{\it Swift} era, has become generally accepted now.
