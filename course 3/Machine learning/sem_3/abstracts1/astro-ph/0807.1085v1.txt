The solar analogues are fundamental targets for a better understanding of our Sun and Solar System. Notwithstanding the efforts, this research is usually limited to field stars. The open cluster M67 offers a unique opportunity to search for solar analogues because its chemical composition and age are very similar to those of our star. In this work, we analyze FLAMES@VLT spectra of about one hundred of M67 main sequence stars with the aim to identify solar analogues. We first determine cluster members which are likely not binaries, by combining both proper motions and radial velocity measurements. Then, we concentrate our analysis on the determination of stellar effective temperature, using the analyzes of line-depth ratios and Halpha wings. Finally, we also compute lithium abundance for all the stars. Thanks to the our analysis, we find ten solar analogues, which allow us to derive a solar color (B-V)=0.649+/-0.016 and a cluster distance modulus of 9.63+/-0.08, very close to values found by previous authors. Among them, five are the best solar twins with temperature determinations within 60 K from the solar values. Our results lead us to do further spectroscopic investigations because the solar analogues candidates are suitable for planet search.
