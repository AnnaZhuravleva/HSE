This chapter describes the Galactic star forming regions in the constellation Cassiopeia, in the Galactic coordinate range 120 deg < l < 130 deg, -5 deg < b < +15 deg. At b > 10 deg the nearby clouds L1333 and L1340 are found in this region. The local arm of the Galaxy in Cassiopeia contains only a few star forming regions, smaller and less active than the OB associations of the neighboring Cepheus. Five members of this system, LkHalpha 198 and its environment, L1287, L1293, L1302 / NGC 255, and S187 are discussed. Several more distant OB associations and giant star forming regions in Cassiopeia are associated with the Perseus arm at 2.0-3.0 kpc. Among these, the Herbig Be star MWC 1080 is discussed in this chapter.
