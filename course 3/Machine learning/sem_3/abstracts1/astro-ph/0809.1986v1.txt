For many years modeling of double-mode pulsation of classical pulsators was a challenging problem. Inclusion of turbulent convection into pulsation hydrocodes finally led to stable double-mode models. However, it was never analysed, which factor of turbulent convection is crucial. We show that the double-mode behaviour displayed in the computed models results from incorrect assumptions adopted in some of the pulsation hydrocodes, namely from the neglect of buoyant forces in convectively stable layers. This leads to significant turbulent energies and consequently to strong eddy-viscous damping in deep, convectively stable layers of the model. Resulting differential reduction of fundamental and first overtone amplitudes favours the occurrence of double-mode pulsation. Once buoyant forces in convectively stable regions are taken into account (as they should), no stable double-mode behaviour is found. The problem of modeling double-mode behaviour of classical pulsators remains open.
