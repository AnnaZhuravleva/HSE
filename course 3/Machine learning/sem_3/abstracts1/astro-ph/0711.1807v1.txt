The Faint Irregular Galaxies GMRT Survey (FIGGS) is a large program aimed at providing a comprehensive and statistically robust characterisation of the neutral ISM properties of faint (M_B > -14.5), nearby, gas rich, dwarf irregular galaxies using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Here we briefly describe the survey and discuss some of the science that we anticipate can be done with this data set.
