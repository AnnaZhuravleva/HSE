We analyze the evolution of nitrogen resulting from a set of spiral and irregular galaxy models computed for a large number of input mass radial distributions and with various star formation efficiencies. We show that our models produce a nitrogen abundance evolution in good agreement with the observational data. Differences in the star formation histories of the regions and galaxies modeled are essential to reproduce the observational data in the N/O-O/H plane and the corresponding dispersion.
