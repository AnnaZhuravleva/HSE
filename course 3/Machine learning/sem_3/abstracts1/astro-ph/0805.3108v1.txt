We present the Chandra ACIS-S3 data of the old classical nova RR Pic (1925). The source has a count rate of 0.067+/-0.002 c/s in the 0.3-5.0 keV energy range. We detect the orbital period of the underlying binary system in the X-ray wavelengths. We also find that the neutral Hydrogen column density differs for orbital minimum and orbital maximum spectra with values 0.25(+0.23-0.18)x10^22 cm^-2 and 0.64(+0.13-0.14)x10^22 cm^-2 at 3sigma confidence level. The X-ray spectrum of RR Pic can be represented by a composite model of bremsstrahlung with a photoelectric absorption, two absorption lines centered around 1.1-1.4 keV and 5 Gaussian lines centered at emission lines around 0.3-1.1 keV corresponding to various transitions of S, N, O, C, Ne and Fe . The bremsstrahlung temperature derived from the fits range from 0.99 to 1.60 keV and the unabsorbed X-ray flux is found to be 2.5(+0.4-1.2)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.3-5.0 keV range with a luminosity of (1.1\pm0.2)x10^31 erg s^-1 at 600 pc. We also detect excess emission in the spectrum possibly originating from the reverse shock in the ejecta.
