Photometric and spectral evolution of the Type Ic supernova SN 2007ru until around 210 days after maximum are presented. The spectra show broad spectral features due to very high expansion velocity, normally seen in hypernovae. The photospheric velocity is higher than other normal Type Ic supernovae. It is lower than SN 1998bw at $\sim$ 8 days after the explosion, but is comparable at later epochs. The light curve evolution of SN 2007ru indicates a fast rise time of 8$\pm$3 days to $B$ band maximum and post-maximum decline more rapid than other broad-line Type Ic supernovae. With an absolute $V$ magnitude of -19.06, SN 2007ru is comparable in brightness with SN 1998bw and lies at the brighter end of the observed Type Ic supernovae. The ejected mass of \Nifs is estimated to be $\sim0.4\Msun$. The fast rise and decline of the light curve and the high expansion velocity suggest that SN 2007ru is an explosion with a high kinetic energy/ejecta mass ratio ($E_{\rm K}/M_{\rm {ej}}$). This adds to the diversity of Type Ic supernovae. Although the early phase spectra are most similar to those of broad-line SN 2003jd, the [OI] line profile in the nebular spectrum of SN 2007ru shows the singly-peaked profile, in contrast to the doubly-peaked profile in SN 2003jd. The singly-peaked profile, together with the high luminosity and the high expansion velocity, may suggest that SN 2007ru could be an aspherical explosion viewed from the polar direction. Estimated oxygen abundance 12 + log(O/H) of $\sim$8.8 indicates that SN 2007ru occurred in a region with nearly solar metallicity.
