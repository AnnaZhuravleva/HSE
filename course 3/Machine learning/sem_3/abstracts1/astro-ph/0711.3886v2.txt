Formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) on astrophysical mass scales is a natural consequence of inflationary cosmology if the primordial perturbation spectrum has a large and negative running of the spectral index as observationally inferred today, because double inflation is required to explain it and fluctuations on some astrophysical scales are enhanced in the field oscillation regime in between. It is argued that PBHs thus produced can serve as intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) which act as the observed ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) by choosing appropriate values of the model parameters in their natural ranges. Our scenario can be observationally tested in near future because the mass of PBHs is uniquely determined once we specify the values of the spectral index and its running on large scales.
