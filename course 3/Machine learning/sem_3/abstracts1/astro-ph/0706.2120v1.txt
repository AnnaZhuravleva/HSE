One of the puzzling findings in the study of the chemical evolution of (post-)AGB stars is why very similar stars (in terms of metallicity, spectral type, infrared properties, etc...) show a very different photospheric composition. We aim at extending the still limited sample of s-process enriched post-AGB stars, in order to obtain a statistically large enough sample that allows us to formulate conclusions concerning the 3rd dredge-up occurrence. We selected two post-AGB stars on the basis of IR colours indicative of a past history of heavy mass loss: IRAS08281-4850 and IRAS14325-6428. They are cool sources in the locus of the Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the IRAS colour-colour diagram. Abundances of both objects were derived for the first time on the basis of high-quality UVES and EMMI spectra, using a critically compiled line list with accurate log(gf) values, together with the latest Kurucz model atmospheres. Both objects have very similar spectroscopically defined effective temperatures of 7750-8000K. They are strongly carbon and s-process enriched, with a C/O ratio of 1.9 and 1.6, and an [ls/Fe] of +1.7 and +1.2, for IRAS08281 and IRAS14325 resp. Moreover, the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) point to heavy mass-loss during the preceding AGB phase. IRAS08281 and IRAS14325 are prototypical post-AGB objects in the sense that they show strong post 3rd dredge-up chemical enrichments. The neutron irradiation has been extremely efficient, despite the only mild sub-solar metallicity. This is not conform with the recent chemical models. The existence of very similar post-AGB stars without any enrichment emphasizes our poor knowledge of the details of the AGB nucleosynthesis and dredge-up phenomena. We call for a very systematic chemical study of all cool sources in the PN region of the IRAS colour-colour diagram.
