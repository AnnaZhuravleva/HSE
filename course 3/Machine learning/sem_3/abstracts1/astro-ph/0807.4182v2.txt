We report the discovery of three new triple-mode classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, two of them with the fundamental, first overtone and second overtone excited, and one pulsating simultaneously in the first three overtones. Thus, the number of triple-mode Cepheids in the LMC is increased to five. We also present two objects belonging probably to a new type of double-mode Cepheids having the first and third overtones excited. We measure the rates of period change in these stars and detect decrease of periods in two of them, what is in conflict with theoretical predictions.
