The operation of an interface dynamo (as has been suggested for the Sun and other stars with convective envelopes) relies crucially upon the effective transport of magnetic flux between two spatially disjoint generation regions. In the simplest models communication between the two regions is achieved solely by diffusion. Here we incorporate a highly simplified anisotropic transport mechanism in order to model the net effect of flux conveyance by magnetic pumping and by magnetic buoyancy. We investigate the influence of this mechanism on the efficiency of kinematic dynamo action. It is found that the effect of flux transport on the efficiency of the dynamo is dependent upon the spatial profile of the transport. Typically, transport hinders the onset of dynamo action and increases the frequency of the dynamo waves. However, in certain cases there exists a preferred magnitude of transport for which dynamo action is most efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the imposition of boundary conditions in drawing conclusions on the role of transport.
