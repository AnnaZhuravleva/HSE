The spatial distribution of the SMC stellar component is investigated from 2MASS data. The morphology of the different age populations is presented. The center of the distribution is calculated and compared with previous estimations. The rotation of the stellar content and possible consequence of dark matter presence are discussed. The different stellar populations are identified through a CMD diagram of the 2MASS data. Isopleth contour maps are produced in every case, to reveal the spatial distribution. The derived density profiles are discussed. The older stellar population follows an exponential profile at projected diameters of about 5 kpc (~5 deg) for the major axis and ~4 kpc for the minor axis, centred at RA: 0h:51min, Dec: -73deg 7' (J2000.0). The centre coordinates are found the same for all the different age population maps and are in good accordance with the kinematical centre of the SMC. However they are found considerably different from the coordinates of the centre of the gas distribution. The fact that the older population found on an exponential disk, gives evidence that the stellar content is rotating, with a possible consequence of dark matter presence. The strong interactions between the MCs and the MilkyWay might explain the difference in the distributions of the stellar and gas components. The lack in the observed velocity element, that implies absence of rotation, and contradicts with the consequences of exponential profile of the stellar component, may also be a result of the gravitational interactions.
