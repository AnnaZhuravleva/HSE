We present "On The Fly" maps of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission covering a 10' X 10' region of the NGC 6946. Using our CO maps and archival VLA HI observations we create a total gas surface density map, Sigma_gas, for NGC 6946. The predominantly molecular inner gas disk transitions smoothly into an atomic outer gas disk, with equivalent atomic and molecular gas surface densities at R = 3.5' (6 kpc). We estimate that the total H2 mass is 3 X 10^9 Mo, roughly 1/3 of the interstellar hydrogen gas mass, and about 2% of the dynamical mass of the galaxy at our assumed distance of 6 Mpc. The value of the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio ranges from 0.35 to 2; 50% of the map is covered by very high ratio, >1, gas. The very high ratios are predominantly from interarm regions and appear to indicate the presence of wide-spread optically thin gas. Star formation tracers are better correlated with the total neutral gas disk than with the molecular gas by itself implying SFR is proportional to Sigma_gas. Using the 100 FIR and 21 cm continuum from NGC 6946 as star formation tracers, we arrive at a gas consumption timescale of 2.8 Gyr, which is relatively uniform across the disk. The high star formation rate at the nucleus appears to be due to a large accumulation of molecular gas rather than a large increase in the star formation efficiency. The mid-plane gas pressure in the outer (R > 10 kpc) HI arms of NGC 6946 is close to the value at the radial limit (10 kpc) of our observed CO disk. If the mid-plane gas pressure is a factor for the formation of molecular clouds, these outer HI gas arms should contain molecular gas which we do not see because they are beyond our detection limit.
