Magnetic fields are an important component of the interstellar medium, especially in low-mass galaxies like irregulars where the magnetic pressure may be significant. However, few irregular galaxies have observed magnetic field structures. Using the VLA, the GBT, and the ATCA, we have observed several irregular galaxies in the radio continuum to determine their magnetic field structures. Here we report on our results for the galaxies NGC 4214 and NGC 1569.
