We have performed $p$-process simulations with the most recent stellar $(n,\gamma)$ cross sections from the "Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis in Stars" project (version v0.2, http://nuclear-astrophysics.fzk.de/kadonis). The simulations were carried out with a parametrized supernova type II shock front model (``$\gamma$ process'') of a 25 solar mass star and compared to recently published results. A decrease in the normalized overproduction factor could be attributed to lower cross sections of a significant fraction of seed nuclei located in the Bi and Pb region around the $N$=126 shell closure.
