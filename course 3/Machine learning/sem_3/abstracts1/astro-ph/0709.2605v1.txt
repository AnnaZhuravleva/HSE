The MAGIC 17m diameter Cherenkov telescope will be upgraded with a second telescope with advanced photon detectors and ultra fast readout within the year 2007. The sensitivity of MAGIC-II, the two telescope system, will be improved by a factor of 2. In addition the energy threshold will be reduced and the energy and angular resolution will be improved. The design, status and expected performance of MAGIC-II is presented here.
