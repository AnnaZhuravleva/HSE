We present the X-ray source catalog in the Subaru/XMM-Newton deep survey. A continuous area of 1.14 deg^2 centered at R.A. = 02h18m and Dec. = -05d is mapped by seven pointings with XMM-Newton covering the 0.2-10 keV band. From the combined images of the EPIC pn and MOS cameras, we detect 866, 1114, 645, and 136 sources with sensitivity limits of 6x10^{-16}, 8x10^{-16}, 3x10^{-15}, and 5x10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 0.5-2, 0.5-4.5, 2-10, and 4.5-10 keV bands, respectively, with detection likelihood >= 7 (corresponding to a confidence level of 99.91%). The catalog consists of 1245 sources in total including 32 extended-source candidates. The averaged log N-log S relations are in good agreement with previous results, bridging the flux range between Chandra deep surveys and brighter surveys. The log N-log S relations show significant spatial variation among pointings on a scale of 0.2 deg^2. Analyzing the auto correlation function, we detect significant clustering signals from the 0.5-2 keV band sample, which can be fit with a power law form (\theta/\theta_c)^{-0.8} with a correlation length of \theta_c=5.9^{+1.0}_{-0.9} arcsec when the integral constraint term is included. In the 2-10 keV band, however, the clustering is not significant with a 90% upper limit of \theta_c < 1.5 arcsec.
