We study the correlation between the radio, mid-infrared and far-infrared properties for a sample of 28 blue compact dwarf (BCD) and low metallicity star-forming galaxies observed by Spitzer. We find that these sources extend the same far-infrared to radio correlation typical of star forming late type alaxies to lower luminosities. In BCDs, the 24um (or 22um) mid-infrared to radio correlation is similar to starburst galaxies, though there is somewhat larger dispersion in their q_24 parameter compared to their q_FIR. No strong correlations between the q parameter and galaxy metallicity or effective dust temperature have been detected, though there is a hint of decreasing q_24 at low metallicities. The two lowest metallicity dwarfs in our sample, IZw18 and SBS0335-052E, despite their similar chemical abundance, deviate from the average q$_{24}$ ratio in opposite manners, displaying an apparent radio excess and dust excess respectively.
