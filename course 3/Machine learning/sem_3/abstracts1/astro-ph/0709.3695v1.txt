Observations of the blazars 1ES 0647+250 and 1ES 0806+524 with VERITAS are reported here. These objects are among the favoured candidate extragalactic sources in the very high-energy regime due to the presence of high-energy electrons and adequate seed photons. The presence of high-energy electrons is established from the location of the synrchrotron peak in the spectral energy distribution of the blazars. The presence of adequate seed photons is determined by the flux in the radio-through-optical wavebands. These are the key ingredients for very high-energy gamma-ray emission in the context of the synchrotron self-Compton model. The redshift of 1ES 0647+250 has been tentatively reported as 0.203 and the redshift of 1ES 0806+524 is 0.138, thus the detection of very high-energy gamma-ray emission from these objects could make significant contributions to the understanding of the extragalactic infrared background light. The analysis of these data relies on standard techniques in very high-energy gamma-ray astronomy, and the results are compared to previously reported upper limits and to theoretical predictions.
