The multiverse is a hierarchy in the number of universes, increasing stepwise towards infinity. It is an evolutionary system, in which universes survive only near critical mass. That mass is actually a factor of 1.94 less than the critical mass, and this is found to be consistent with the baryon density inferred from nucleosynthesis in our universe; it is also precisely verified as a cosmological effect. That factor seems to have originated in the multiverse for causing intersecting expansions of its universes, such that mixing occurs of debris from aging galaxies (over proton-decaying time scales). It follows that there is an inter-universal medium (IUM), probably having the demand of new universes in balance with the supply of dark radiation and sub-atomic particles from the decaying galaxies. The mixing causes the universes to have the same quantum, relativity, gravity, and particle physics as our universe. The making of a universe from the radiation and sub-atomic particles occurs through re-vitalizing the protons, and other particles as well, by gravitational energy obtained in accretion of the IUM. This process therefore begins wherever the IUM space density reaches proton density, near 10 E18 kg m E-3. The process continues quietly as the sweeping-up and gravitational accretion proceeds, until the near-critical mass is reached. Some of the IUM debris must also be pervading our present universe, steadily or in partially accreted lumps. The model therefore predicts that the IUM sub-atomic particles appear as our dark matter, and its radiation component as our dark energy, both near 0 K temperatures. The dark energy may cause expansion phenomena, in addition to the above non-flatness expansion, from an accretion lump that arrived at our universe at age near 9 x 10 E9 y.
