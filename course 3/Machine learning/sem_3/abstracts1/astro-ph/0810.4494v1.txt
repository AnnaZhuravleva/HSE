LS 5039 is an X-ray binary detected at very high energies. Along the orbit, there is a significant detection even during the superior conjunction of the compact object, when very large gamma-ray opacities are expected. Electromagnetic cascades, which may make the system more transparent to gamma-rays, are hardly efficient for reasonable magnetic fields in the massive star surroundings. A jet-like flow could transport energy to regions where the photon-photon absorption is much lower and the TeV radiation is not so severely absorbed. Otherwise, in the standard pulsar scenario for LS 5039, the emitter would be located between the star and the compact object, which would imply the violation of the observational constraints at X-rays.
