Correlations in the properties of the static compact stars (CSs) and the ones rotating with the highest observed frequency of 1122Hz are studied using a large set of equations of state (EOSs). These EOSs span various approaches and their chemical composition vary from the nucleons to hyperons and quarks in $\beta$-equilibrium. It is found that the properties of static CS, like, the maximum gravitational mass $M_{\rm max}^{\rm stat}$ and radius $R_{1.4}^{\rm stat}$ corresponding to t he canonical mass and supramassive or non-supramassive nature of the CS rotating at 1122 Hz are strongly correlated. In particular, only those EOSs yield the CS rotating at 1122Hz to be non-supramassive for which $\left (\frac{M_{\rm max}^{\rm stat}}{M_\odot}\right )^{1/2} \left (\frac{10{\rm km}}{R_{1.4}^{\rm stat}})^{3/2} $ is greater than unity. Suitable parametric form which can be used to split the $M_{\rm max}^{\rm stat}$ $-$ $R_{1.4}^{\rm stat}$ plane into the regions of different supramassive nature of the CS rotating at 1122Hz is presented. Currently measured maximum gravitational mass 1.76$M_\odot$ of PSR J0437-4715 suggests that the CS rotating at 1122Hz can be non-supramassive provided $R_{1.4}^{\rm stat} \leqslant 12.4$ km.
