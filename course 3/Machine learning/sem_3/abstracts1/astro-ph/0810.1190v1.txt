Rotation is a key parameter in the evolution of stars. From 1 Myr (the age of the ONC) to 4.5 Gyr (the age of the Sun), solar-like stars lose about 1-2 orders of specific angular momentum. The main agents for this rotational braking are believed to be star-disk interaction and magnetically powered stellar winds. Over the last decade, the observational fundament to probe the stellar spindown has dramatically improved. Significant progress has been made in exploring the underlying physical causes of the rotational braking. Parameterized models combining the effects of star-disk interaction, winds, and pre-main sequence contraction are able to reproduce the main features of the rotational data for stars spanning more than 3 orders of magnitude in age. This has allowed us to constrain stellar ages based on the rotation rates ('gyrochronology'). One main challenge for future work is to extend this type of analysis to the substellar mass range, where the rotational database is still sparse. More theoretical and observational work is required to explore the physics of the braking processes, aiming to explain rotational evolution from first principles. In this review for Cool Stars 15, I will summarize the status quo and the recent developments in the field.
