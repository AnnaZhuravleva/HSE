The new EAS Cherenkov array TUNKA-133, with about 1 km**2 sensitive area, is being installed in the Tunka Valley. The investigated energy range is 10**15-10**18 eV. It will consist of 133 optical detectors based on EMI9350 PMTs. Optical detectors are grouped into 19 clusters with 7 detectors each. The detectors are connected to the cluster box with RG-58 cables. Every PMT signal is digitized in the cluster box with 200 MHz FADC. The cluster boxes are connected to the data acquisition center with a 1 Gb/s optical link. A detailed description of the data acquisition system (DAQ) is presented.
