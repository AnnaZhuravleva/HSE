Large-scale accretion shocks around massive clusters of galaxies, generically expected in the cold dark matter scenario of cosmological structure formation, are shown to be plausible sources of the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by accelerating a mixture of heavy nuclei including the iron group elements. Current observations can be explained if the source composition at injection for the heavier nuclei is somewhat enhanced from simple expectations for the accreting gas. The proposed picture should be clearly testable by current and upcoming facilities in the near future through characteristic features in the UHECR spectrum, composition and anisotropy, in particular the rapid increase of the average mass composition with energy from $10^{19}$ to $10^{20}$ eV.
