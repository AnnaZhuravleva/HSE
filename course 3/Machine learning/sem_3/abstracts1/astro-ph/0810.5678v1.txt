Coronagraphic techniques are required to detect exoplanets with future Extremely Large Telescopes. One concept, the Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC), is combining an apodizer in the entrance aperture and a Lyot opaque mask in the focal plane. This paper presents the manufacturing and tests of a microdots apodizer optimized for the near IR.   The intent of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of binary apodizers for the APLC. This study is also relevant for any coronagraph using amplitude pupil apodization.   A binary apodizer has been designed using a halftone dot process, where the binary array of pixels with either 0% or 100% transmission is calculated to fit the required continuous transmission, i.e. local transmission control is obtained by varying the relative density of the opaque and transparent pixels. An error diffusion algorithm was used to optimize the distribution of pixels that best approximates the required field transmission. The prototype was tested with a coronagraphic setup in the near IR.   The transmission profile of the prototype agrees with the theoretical shape within 3% and is achromatic. The observed apodized and coronagraphic images are consistent with theory. However, binary apodizers introduce high frequency noise that is a function of the pixel size. Numerical simulations were used to specify pixel size in order to minimize this effect, and validated by experiment.   This paper demonstrates that binary apodizers are well suited for being used in high contrast imaging coronagraphs. The correct choice of pixel size is important and must be adressed considering the scientific field of view.
