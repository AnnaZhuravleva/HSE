We have constructed the mass function of globular star clusters in the Sombrero galaxy in bins of different internal half-mass density rho_h and projected galactocentric distance R. This is based on the published measurements of the magnitudes and effective radii of the clusters by Spitler et al. (2006) in BVR images taken with the ACS on HST. We find that the peak of the mass function M_p increases with rho_h by a factor of about 4 but remains nearly constant with R. Our results are almost identical to those presented recently by McLaughlin & Fall (2007) for globular clusters in the Milky Way. The mass functions in both galaxies agree with a simple, approximate model in which the clusters form with a Schechter initial mass function and evolve subsequently by stellar escape driven by internal two-body relaxation. These findings therefore undermine recent claims that the present peak of the mass function of globular clusters must have been built into the initial conditions.
