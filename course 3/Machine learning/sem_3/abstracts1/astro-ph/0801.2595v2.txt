We present the SCUBA Legacy Catalogues, two comprehensive sets of continuum maps (and catalogues) using data at 850 microns and 450 microns of the various astronomical objects obtained with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA). The Fundamental Map Dataset contains data only where superior atmospheric opacity calibration data were available. The Extended Map Dataset is comprised of data regardless of the quality of the opacity calibration. Each Dataset contains 1.2 degree x 1.2 degree maps at locations where data existed in the JCMT archive, imaged using the matrix inversion method. The Fundamental Dataset is comprised of 1423 maps at 850 microns and 1357 maps at 450 microns. The Extended Dataset is comprised of 1547 maps at 850 microns. Neither Dataset includes high sensitivity, single chop SCUBA maps of "cosmological fields" nor solar system objects. Each Dataset was used to determine a respective Object Catalogue, consisting of objects identified within the respective 850 micron maps using an automated identification algorithm. The Fundamental and Extended Map Object Catalogues contain 5061 and 6118 objects respectively. Objects are named based on their respective J2000 position of peak 850 micron intensity. The Catalogues provide for each object the respective maximum 850 micron intensity, estimates of total 850 micron flux and size, and tentative identifications from the SIMBAD Database. Where possible, the Catalogues als provide for each object its maximum 450 micron intensity and total 450 micron flux, and flux ratios.
