We analyze WMAP 3 year data using the one-point distribution functions to probe the non-Gaussianity in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropy data. Computer simulations are performed to determine the uncertainties of the results. We report the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL is constrained to 26<f_NL<82 for Q-band, 12<f_NL<67 for V-band, 7<f_NL<64 for W-band and 23<f_NL<75 for Q+V+W combined data at 95% confidence level (CL).
