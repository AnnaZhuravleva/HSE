We present Spitzer high-resolution spectra of off-nuclear regions in the central cluster galaxies NGC 1275 and NGC 4696 in the Perseus and Centaurus clusters, respectively. Both objects are surrounded by extensive optical emission-line filamentary nebulae, bright outer parts of which are the targets of our observations. The 10-37um spectra show strong pure rotational lines from molecular hydrogen revealing a molecular component to the filaments which has an excitation temperature of ~300-400K. The flux in the 0-0S(1) molecular hydrogen line correlates well with the strength of the optical lines, having about 3 per cent of the Halpha+[NII] emission. The 11.3um PAH feature is seen in some spectra. Emission is also seen from both low and high ionization fine structure lines. Molecular hydrogen cooler than ~400K dominates the mass of the outer filaments; the nebulae are predominantly molecular.
