We study the dependence of the galaxy contents within halos on the halo formation time using two galaxy formation models, one being a semianalytic model utilizing the halo assembly history from a high resolution N-body simulation and the other being a smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation including radiative cooling, star formation, and energy feedback from galactic winds. We confirm the finding by Gao et al. that at fixed mass, the clustering of halos depends on the halo formation time, especially for low-mass halos. This age dependence of halo clustering makes it desirable to study the correlation between the occupation of galaxies within halos and the halo age. We find that, in halos of fixed mass, the number of satellite galaxies has a strong dependence on halo age, with fewer satellites in older halos. The youngest one-third of the halos can have an order of magnitude more satellites than the oldest one-third. For central galaxies, in halos that form earlier, they tend to have more stars and thus appear to be more luminous, and the dependence of their luminosity on halo age is not as strong as that of stellar mass. The results can be understood through the star formation history in halos and the merging of satellites onto central galaxies. The age dependence of the galaxy contents within halos would constitute an important ingredient in a more accurate halo-based model of galaxy clustering.
