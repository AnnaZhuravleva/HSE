Influence of shower fluctuations on the shape of lateral distribution of electrons in EAS of fixed size measured by scintillation counters is analyzed in framework of scaling formalism. Correction factors for the mean square radius of electrons are calculated for the experimental conditions of KASCADE array. Possible improvement of the primary mass discrimination by analysis of lateral distribution of EAS electrons is discussed in detail.
