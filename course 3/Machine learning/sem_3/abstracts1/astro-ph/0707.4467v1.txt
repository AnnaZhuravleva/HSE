A new approach to Gamma/Hadron separation algorithms is proposed. The differences between Gamma and Hadron showers are notorious in two main aspects. The first is the wideness of the shower, and the second is the distribution of the angles of emission of Cherenkov photons in respect to the shower main axis. Using more than one IAC telescope, and their respective bi-dimensional images of arrival directions of the Cherenkov photons, the 3D geometrical characteristics of the shower can be reconstructed.
