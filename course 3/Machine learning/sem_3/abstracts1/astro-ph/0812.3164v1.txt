We present three 43 GHz images and a single 86 GHz image of Markarian 501 from VLBA observations in 2005. The 86 GHz image shows a partially resolved core with a flux density of about 200 mJy and a size of about 300 Schwarzschild radii, similar to recent results by Giroletti et al. Extreme limb-brightening is found in the inner parsec of the jet in the 43 GHz images, providing strong observational support for a `spine-layer' structure at this distance from the core. The jet is well resolved transverse to its axis, allowing Gaussian model components to be fit to each limb of the jet. The spine-layer brightness ratio and relative sizes, the jet opening angle, and a tentative detection of superluminal motion in the layer are all discussed.
