We have carried out the observations of the OMC-2 FIR 3/4 region with the NMA and ASTE in the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1--0), $^{12}$CO (3--2, 1--0), SiO ($v$=0, $J$=2--1), CS (2--1), and CH$_3$OH ($J_K$=7$_K$--6$_K$) lines and in the 3.3 mm continuum emission. Our NMA observations in the H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ emission have revealed 0.07 pc-scale dense gas associated with FIR 4. The $^{12}$CO (3--2,1--0) emission shows high-velocity blue and red shifted components at the both north-east and south-west of FIR 3, suggesting a molecular outflow nearly along the plane of the sky driven by FIR 3. The SiO and the CH$_{3}$OH emission are detected around the interface between the outflow and the dense gas. Furthermore, the $^{12}$CO (1--0) emission shows an L-shaped structure in the P-V diagram. These results imply presence of the shock due to the interaction between the molecular outflow driven by FIR 3 and the dense gas associated with FIR 4. Moreover, our high angular-resolution observations of FIR 4 in the 3.3 mm continuum emission have first found that FIR 4 consists of eleven dusty cores. The separation among these cores is on the same order of the Jeans length, suggesting that the fragmentation into these cores has been caused by the gravitational instability. The time scale of the fragmentation is similar to the time scale of the interaction between the molecular outflow and the dense gas. We suggest that the interaction between the molecular outflow from FIR 3 and the dense gas associated with FIR 4 triggered the fragmentation into these dusty cores, and hence the next generation the cluster formation.
