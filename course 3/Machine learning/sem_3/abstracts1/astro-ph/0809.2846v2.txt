A general framework for tests of Lorentz invariance with electromagnetic waves is presented, allowing for operators of arbitrary mass dimension. Signatures of Lorentz violations include vacuum birefringence, vacuum dispersion, and anisotropies. Sensitive searches for violations using sources such as active galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and the cosmic microwave background are discussed. Direction-dependent dispersion constraints are obtained on operators of dimension 6 and 8 using gamma-ray bursts and the blazar Markarian 501. Stringent constraints on operators of dimension 3 are found using 5-year data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. No evidence appears for isotropic Lorentz violation, while some support at one sigma is found for anisotropic violation.
