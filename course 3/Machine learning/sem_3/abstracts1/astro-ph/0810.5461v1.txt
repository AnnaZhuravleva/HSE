In this study we consider the relationship between the survival time and the Lyapunov time for 3-body systems. It is shown that the Sitnikov problem exhibits a two-part power law relationship as demonstrated previously for the general 3-body problem. Using an approximate Poincare map on an appropriate surface of section, we delineate escape regions in a domain of initial conditions and use these regions to analytically obtain a new functional relationship between the Lyapunov time and the survival time for the 3-body problem. The marginal probability distributions of the Lyapunov and survival times are discussed and we show that the probability density function of Lyapunov times for the Sitnikov problem is similar to that for the general 3-body problem.
