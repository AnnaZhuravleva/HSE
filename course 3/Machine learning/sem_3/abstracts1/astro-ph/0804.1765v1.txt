The structure of a vortex in the inner crust of neutron stars is calculated within the framework of quantum mean field theory taking into account the interaction with the nuclei composing the Coulomb lattice. Making use of the results obtained with different nuclear interactions, the pinning energy, relevant in the study of glitches, is worked out. Quantal size and density dependent effects are found to be important.
