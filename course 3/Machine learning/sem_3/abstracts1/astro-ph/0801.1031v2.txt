We present a phase-coherent timing analysis of the intermittent accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. A new timing solution for the pulsar spin period and the Keplerian binary orbital parameters was achieved by phase connecting all episodes of intermittent pulsations visible during the 2001 outburst. We investigate the pulse profile shapes, their energy dependence and the possible influence of Type I X-ray bursts on the time of arrival and fractional amplitude of the pulsations. We find that the timing solution of SAX J1748.9-2021 shows an erratic behavior when selecting different subsets of data, that is related to substantial timing noise in the timing post-fit residuals. The pulse profiles are very sinusoidal and their fractional amplitude increases linearly with energy and no second harmonic is detected. The reason why this pulsar is intermittent is still unknown but we can rule out a one-to-one correspondence between Type I X-ray bursts and the appearance of the pulsations.
