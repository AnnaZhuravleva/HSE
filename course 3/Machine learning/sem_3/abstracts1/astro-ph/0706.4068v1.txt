We report the detection of dark energy near the Milky Way made with precision observations of the local Hubble flow of expansion. We estimate the local density of dark energy and find that it is near, if not exactly equal to, the global dark energy density. The result is independent of, compatible with, and complementary to the horizon-scale observations in which dark energy was first discovered. Together with the cosmological concordance data, our result forms direct observational evidence for the Einstein antigravity as a universal phenomenon -- in the same sense as the Newtonian universal gravity.
