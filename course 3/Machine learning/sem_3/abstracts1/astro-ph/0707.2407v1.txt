We explore the possibility that the transit signature of an Earth-size planet can be detected in spectroscopic velocity shifts via the Rossiter effect. Under optimistic but not unrealistic conditions, it should be possible to detect a large terrestrial-size planet. While not suitable for discovering planets, this method can be used to confirm suspected planets.
