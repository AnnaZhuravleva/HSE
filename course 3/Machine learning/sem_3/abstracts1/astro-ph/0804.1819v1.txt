The formation of a neutrino pulse emitted during the relativistic collapse of a spherical supermassive star is considered. The free collapse of a body with uniform density in the absence of rotation and with the free escape of the emitted neutrinos can be solved analytically by quadrature. The light curve of the collapsing star and the spectrum of the emitted neutrinos at various times are calculated.
