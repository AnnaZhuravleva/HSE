We solve dynamical equations of motion to determine the conditions under which an over-dense region in the early universe will lead to collapse to a black hole, starting from horizon crossing of the over-dense region to the point of gravitational instability. Here we focus on the sensitivity to QCD and electroweak phase transitions. We then solve rate equations to determine the mass distribution of black holes in the present universe. A second order phase transition or rapid crossover would have significant consequences only if the index of primordial density fluctuations n > 1.25. However, a first order transition would lead to a black hole dominated universe for any realistic value of n including n=1.
