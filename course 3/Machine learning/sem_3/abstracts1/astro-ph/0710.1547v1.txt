We present our new advanced model for population synthesis of close-by cooling NSs. Detailed treatment of the initial spatial distribution of NS progenitors and a detailed ISM structure up to 3 kpc give us an opportunity to discuss the strategy to look for new isolated cooling NSs. Our main results in this respect are the following: new candidates are expected to be identified behind the Gould Belt, in directions to rich OB associations, in particular in the Cygnus-Cepheus region; new candidates, on average, are expected to be hotter than the known population of cooling NS. Besides the usual approach (looking for soft X-ray sources), the search in 'empty' $\gamma$-ray error boxes or among run-away OB stars may yield new X-ray thermally emitting NS candidates.
