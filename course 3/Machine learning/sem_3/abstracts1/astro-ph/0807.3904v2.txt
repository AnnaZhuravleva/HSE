In this series of four lectures, I discuss four important aspects of AGN host galaxies. In Lecture #1, I address the starburst-AGN connection. First, I briefly review the primary diagnostic tools that are used to quantify and distinguish star formation and nuclear activity. Next I describe the best evidence for a connection between these two processes, first at low luminosity and then at high luminosity. In the last section, I summarize the main results and offer possible explanations. In Lecture #2, I discuss our current understanding of ultraluminous infrared galaxies. First, I describe the general properties of ULIRGs, comparing the local sample with their distant counterparts. Then I discuss the role of ULIRGs in the formation and evolution of spheroids and their massive black holes. The discussion of their possible role in the metal enrichment of the IGM through superwinds is postponed until Lecture #3. In this third lecture, I discuss the importance of feedback processes in the local and distant universe. The emphasis is on mechanical feedback. I describe the basic physics of winds, a few classic examples of winds in the local universe, the statistical properties of winds, near and far, and their impact on galaxy formation and evolution. A list of potential thesis projects is given at the end. The fourth and final lecture is on elemental abundances as tracers of star formation. First, I explain the basic principles behind chemical evolution, and describe three simple models whose predictions are compared with observations in the Milky Way. Next I discuss and give an interpretation of the results of abundance determinations in local quiescent and starburst galaxies before discussing elemental abundances in the more distant universe.
