Experiments on the hydrogenation of CO on crystalline and amorphous ice at 15 K were carried out to investigate the structural effects of the ice surface. The effective rate of H atom addition to CO on the amorphous ice was found to be larger than that on the crystalline ice, while CO depletion on crystalline ice became larger after long exposure.We demonstrated that the CO-coverage on the ice surfaces dominates the effective reaction rate rather than the surface structure. The larger depletion of CO on crystalline ice, as compared to amorphous ice, suggests easier desorption of CO and/or products by the heat of the reaction.
