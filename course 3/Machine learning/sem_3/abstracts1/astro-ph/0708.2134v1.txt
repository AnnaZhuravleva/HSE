We have used the VLA at 43 GHz to image the radio continuum emission from o Ceti, R Leo, and W Hya and to precisely locate their SiO maser emission with respect to the star. The radio continuum emission region for all three stars has a diameter close to 5.6 AU. These diameters are similar to those measured at infrared wavelengths in bands containing strong molecular opacity and about twice those measured in line-free regions of the infrared spectrum. Thus, the radio photosphere and the infrared molecular layer appear to be coextensive. The 43 GHz continuum emission is consistent with temperatures near 1600 K and opacity from H-minus free-free interactions. While the continuum image of o Ceti appears nearly circular, both R Leo and W Hya display significant elongations. The SiO masers for all three stars show partial rings with diameters close to 8 AU.
