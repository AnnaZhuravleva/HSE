The AMIGA project (Analysis of the interstellar Medium of Isolated GAlaxies) is an international collaboration led from the Instituto de Astrof\'isica de Andaluc\'ia (CSIC). The group's experience in radio astronomy databases turned, as a natural evolution, into an active participation in the development of data archives and radio astronomy software. The contributions of the group to the VO have been mostly oriented towards the deployment of large VO compliant databases and the development of access interfaces (IRAM 30m Pico Veleta, DSS-63 70m in Robledo de Chavela). We also have been working in the development of an API for VO tools that will ease access to VO registries and communication between different VO software. A collaboration with the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute has started recently in order to perform a complete renovation of the only existing high-level software (GIPSY) for the analysis of datacubes, allowing its fully integration in the VO.
