New wide-field near-infrared (NIR) imaging observations of M33 were obtained from UKIRT. These show a large population of intermediate-age stars considerably improving on previous NIR data. The spatial distribution of super giant stars, carbon-rich (C-rich or C stars) and oxygen-rich (O-rich or M stars) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars distinguished from the NIR colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) have been studied as well as the C/M ratio. The Ks magnitude distribution has been interpreted using theoretical models to derive the mean age and the mean metallicity across M33.
