On the basis of a large scale 'adiabatic', namely non-radiative and non-dissipative, cosmological smooth particle hydrodynamic simulation we compare the entropy profiles of the gas and the dark matter (DM) in galaxy clusters. The quantity K_g = T_g \rho_g^{-2/3} provides a measure for the entropy of the intra-cluster gas. By analogy with the thermodynamic variables of the gas the velocity dispersion of the DM is associated with a formal temperature and thereby K_DM = \sigma_DM^2 \rho_DM^{-2/3} is defined. This DM entropy is related to the DM phase space density by K_DM \propto Q_DM^{-2/3}. In accord with other studies the DM phase space density follows a power law behaviour, Q_DM \propto r^{-1.82}, which corresponds to K_DM \propto r^{1.21}. The simulated intra-cluster gas has a flat entropy core within (0.8 \pm 0.4) R_s, where R_s is the NFW scale radius. The outer profile follows the DM behaviour, K_g \propto r^{1.21}, in close agreement with X-ray observations. Upon scaling the DM and gas densities by their mean cosmological values we find that outside the entropy core a constant ratio of K_g / K_{DM} = 0.71 \pm 0.18 prevails. By extending the definition of the gas temperature to include also the bulk kinetic energy the ratio of the DM and gas extended entropy is found to be unity for r > 0.8 R_s. The constant ratio of the gas thermal entropy to that of the DM implies that observations of the intra-cluster gas can provide an almost direct probe of the DM.
