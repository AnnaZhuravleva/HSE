We use deep far-IR, submm, radio and X-ray imaging and mid-IR spectroscopy to explore the nature of a sample of Spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) in GOODS-N. A sample of 79 galaxies satisfy the criteria R-[24]>14 (Vega) down to S24>100 microJy. Twelve of these galaxies have IRS spectra available which we use to measure redshifts and classify these objects as being dominated by star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the mid-IR. The IRS spectra and Spitzer photometric redshifts confirm that the DOGs lie in a tight redshift distribution around z~2. Based on mid-IR colors, 80% of DOGs are likely dominated by star formation; the stacked X-ray emission from this sub-sample of DOGs is also consistent with star formation. Since only a small number of DOGs are individually detected at far-IR and submm wavelengths, we use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects and plot a composite IR (8-1000 microns) spectral energy distribution (SED). The average luminosity of these star forming DOGs is LIR~1e12 Lsun. We compare the average star forming DOG to the average bright (S850>5 mJy) submillimeter galaxy (SMG); the S24>100 microJy DOGs are 3 times more numerous but 8 times less luminous in the IR. The far-IR SED shape of DOGs is similar to that of SMGs (average dust temperature of around 30 K) but DOGs have a higher mid-IR to far-IR flux ratio. The average star formation-dominated DOG has a star formation rate of 200 Msun/yr which, given their space density, amounts to a contribution of 0.01 Msun/yr/Mpc3 (or 5-10%) to the star formation rate density at z~2. We use the composite SED to predict the average flux of DOGs in future Herschel/PACS 100 micron and SCUBA-2 450 micron surveys and show that the majority of them will be detected.
