(Context) In a Universe dominated by dark matter, halos are continuously accreting mass (violently or not) and such mechanism affects their dynamical state. (Aims) The evolution of dark matter halos in phase-space, and using the phase-space density indicator Q=rho/sigma^3 as a tracer, is discussed. (Methods) We have performed cosmological N-body simulations from which we have carried a detailed study of the evolution of ~35 dark halos in the interval 0<z<10. (Results)The follow up of individual halos indicates two distinct evolutionary phases. First, an early and fast decrease of Q associated to virialization after the gravitational collapse takes place. The nice agreement between simulated data and theoretical expectations based on the spherical collapse model support such a conjecture. The late and long period where a slow decrease of the phase-space density occurs is related to accretion and merger episodes. The study of some merger events in the phase-space (radial velocity versus radial distance) reveals the formation of structures quite similar to caustics generated in secondary infall models of halo formation. After mixing in phase-space, halos in quasi-equilibrium have flat-topped velocity distributions (negative kurtosis) with respect to Gaussians. The effect is more noticiable for captured satellites and/or substructures than for the host halo.
