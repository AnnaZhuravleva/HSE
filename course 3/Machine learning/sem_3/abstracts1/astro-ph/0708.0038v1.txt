The High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) SMC X-1 demonstrates an orbital variation of 3.89 days and a super-orbital variation with an average length of 55 days. As we show here, however, the length of the super-orbital cycle varies by almost a factor of two, even across adjacent cycles. To study both the orbital and super-orbital variation we utilize lightcurves from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All Sky Monitor (RXTE-ASM). We employ the orbital ephemeris from Wojdowski et al. (1998) to obtain the average orbital profile, and we show that this profile exhibits complex modulation during non-eclipse phases. Additionally, a very interesting ``bounceback'' in X-ray count rate is seen during mid-orbital eclipse phases, with a softening of the emission during these periods. This bounceback has not been previously identified in pointed observations. We then define a super-orbital ephemeris (the phase of the super-orbital cycle as a function of date) based on the ASM lightcurve and analyze the trend and distribution of super-orbital cycle lengths. SMC X-1 exhibits a bimodal distribution of these lengths, similar to what has been observed in other systems (e.g., Her X-1), but with more dramatic changes in cycle length. There is some hint, but not conclusive evidence, for a dependence of the super-orbital cycle length upon the underlying orbital period, as has been observed previously for Her X-1 and Cyg X-2. Using our super-orbital ephemeris we are also able to create an average super-orbital profile over the 71 observed cycles, for which we witness overall hardening of the spectrum during low count rate times. We combine the orbital and super-orbital ephemerides to study the correlation between the orbital and super-orbital variations in the system.
