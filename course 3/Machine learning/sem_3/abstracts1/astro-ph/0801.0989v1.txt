We have used the RXTE and INTEGRAL satellites simultaneously to observe the High Mass X-ray binary IGR J19140+0951. The spectra obtained in the 3-80 keV range have allowed us to perform a precise spectral analysis of the system along its binary orbit. The spectral evolution confirms the supergiant nature of the companion star and the neutron star nature of the compact object. Using a simple stellar wind model to describe the evolution of the photoelectric absorption, we were able to restrict the orbital inclination angle in the range 37-75 degrees. This analysis leads to a wind mass-loss rate from the companion star of ~ 10e-7 Msun/year, consistent with its expected spectral type. We have detected a soft excess in at least three observations, for the first time for this source. Such soft excesses have been reported in several HMXBs in the past. We discuss the possible origin of this excess, and suggest, based on its spectral properties and occurrences prior to the superior conjunction, that it may be explained as the reprocessing of the X-ray emission originating from the neutron star by the surrounding ionised gas.
