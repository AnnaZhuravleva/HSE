In a previous paper the spectrum of positrons produced by matter initially at rest falling onto a massive compact object was calculated. In this paper this calculation is generalized to obtain both the spectrum of in-flight positron annihilation and pi0 decay gamma rays produced when protons with a cosmic ray-like spectrum hit the surface. The resulting pi0 decay gamma ray spectrum reflects the high energy proton energy spectrum, and is largely independent of the mass of the compact object. One notable prediction for all compact objects is a dip in the spectrum below 70 MeV. As applied to the 10^6 solar mass massive compact object near to the center of our galaxy, our theory shows promise for explaining the gamma rays coming from the galactic center as observed by both the Compton satellite and HESS ground based array.
