We derive deep luminosity functions (to $M_z=-15$) for galaxies in Abell 1835 ($z=0.25$) and AC 114 ($z=0.31$) and compare these with the local $z'$ luminosity function for 69 clusters. The data show that the faint-end upturn, the excess of galaxies above a single Schechter function at $M_z < -17$, does not exist in the higher redshift clusters. This suggests that the faint-end upturn galaxies have been created recently, by infall into clusters of star-forming field populations or via tidal disruption of brighter objects.^M
