This paper presents the results of a Spitzer IRAC 3-8 micron photometric search for warm dust orbiting 17 nearby, metal-rich white dwarfs, 15 of which apparently have hydrogen dominated atmospheres (type DAZ). G166-58, G29-38, and GD 362 manifest excess emission in their IRAC fluxes and the latter two are known to harbor dust grains warm enough to radiate detectable emission at near-infrared wavelengths as short as 2 micron. Their IRAC fluxes display differences compatible with a relatively larger amount of cooler dust at GD 362. G166-58 is presently unique in that it appears to exhibit excess flux only at wavelengths longer than about 5 micron. Evidence is presented that this mid-infrared emission is most likely associated with the white dwarf, indicating that G166-58 bears circumstellar dust no warmer than T~400 K. The remaining 14 targets reveal no reliable mid-infrared excess, indicating the majority of DAZ stars do not have warm debris disks sufficiently opaque to be detected by IRAC.
