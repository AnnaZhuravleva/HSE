As a by-product of beta Cephei and delta Cephei radiative model surveys we have found interesting cases of multimode pulsation. In case of beta Cephei stars, we found two multimode domains with two or three modes being involved. The origin of the multimode pulsation can be traced to one of the two different mechanisms: either to the non-resonant coupling of the two excited modes (double-mode pulsation) or to the 2omega_1 = omega_0 + omega_2 parametric resonance (triple-mode pulsation). In case of delta Cephei models, a triple-mode pulsation domain, connected with the 2:1 resonance, 2omega_0 = omega_2, is found. These models are of theoretical interest only, since they do not obey a proper mass-luminosity relation.
