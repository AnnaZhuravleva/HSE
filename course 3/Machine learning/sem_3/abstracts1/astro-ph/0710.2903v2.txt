We use the kinetic theory of nucleation to explore the properties of dust nucleation in sub-saturated vapors. Due to radiation losses, the sub-critical clusters have a smaller temperature compared to their vapor. This alters the dynamical balance between attachment and detachment of monomers, allowing for stable nucleation of grains in vapors that are sub-saturated for their temperature. We find this effect particularly important at low densities and in the absence of a strong background radiation field. We find new conditions for stable nucleation in the n-T phase diagram. The nucleation in the non-LTE regions is likely to be at much slower rate than in the super-saturated vapors. We evaluate the nucleation rate, warning the reader that it does depend on poorly substantiated properties of the macro-molecules assumed in the computation. On the other hand, the conditions for nucleation depend only on the properties of the large stable grains and are more robust. We finally point out that this mechanism may be relevant in the early universe as an initial dust pollution mechanism, since once the interstellar medium is polluted with dust, mantle growth is likely to be dominant over non-LTE nucleation in the diffuse medium.
