By a few but important examples as models of combined radiative and wind-driven HII regions and galactic winds we demonstrate the importance of refined small-to-medium scale studies of chemo-dynamical effects. These processes determine the internal dynamics and energetic of the ISM and affect its observational signatures, e.g. by abundance contributions, but are not yet reliably and satisfactorily explored.
