In this review, we give an overview of some of the major aspects of data reduction and analysis for the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Since its prediction and discovery in the last century, the CMB radiation has proven itself to be one of our most valuable tools for precision cosmology. Recently, and especially when combined with complementary cosmological data, measurements of the CMB anisotropies have provided us with a wealth of quantitive information about the birth, evolution and structure of our Universe. We begin with a simple, general introduction to the physics of the CMB, including a basic overview of the experiments which record CMB data. The focus, however, will be the data analysis treatment of CMB data sets.
