In the framework of a program for the monitoring of Supernovae in the Near-Infrared (NIR) carried out by the Teramo, Rome and Pulkovo observatories with the AZT-24 telescope, we observed the Supernova SN2006jc in the J,H,K photometric bands during a period of 7 months, starting ~36 days after its discovery. Our observations evidence a NIR re-brightening, peaking ~70 days after discovery, along with a reddening of H-K and J-H colors until 120 days from discovery. After that date, J-H seems to evolve towards bluer colors. Our data, complemented by IR, optical, UV and X-ray observations found in the literature, show that the re-brightening is produced by hot dust surrounding the supernova, formed in the interaction of the ejecta with dense circumstellar matter.
