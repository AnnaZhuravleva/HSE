There are four less prominent compact sources east of IRS5, the natures of which were unclear until now. We present near-infrared K-band long slit spectroscopy of the four sources east of IRS5 obtained with the ISAAC spectrograph at the ESO VLT in July 2005. We interpret the data in combination with high angular resolution NIR and MIR images obtained with ISAAC and NACO at the ESO VLT.
