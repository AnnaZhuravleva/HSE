We develop a new approach to study the nonlinear evolution in the large-scale structure of the Universe both in real space and in redshift space, extending the standard perturbation theory of gravitational instability. Infinite series of terms in standard Eulerian perturbation theory are resummed as a result of our starting from a Lagrangian description of perturbations. Delicate nonlinear effects on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations are more accurately described by our method than the standard one. Our approach differs from other resummation techniques recently proposed, such as the renormalized perturbation theory, etc., in that we use simple techniques and thus resulting equations are undemanding to evaluate, and in that our approach is capable of quantifying the nonlinear effects in redshift space. The power spectrum and correlation function of our approach are in good agreement with numerical simulations in literature on scales of baryon acoustic oscillations. Especially, nonlinear effects on the baryon acoustic peak of the correlation function are accurately described both in real space and in redshift space. Our approach provides a unique opportunity to analytically investigate the nonlinear effects on baryon acoustic scales in observable redshift space, which is requisite in constraining the nature of dark energy, the curvature of the Universe, etc., by redshift surveys.
