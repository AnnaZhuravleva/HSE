In the classical relativistic regime, the accretion of phantom-like dark energy onto a stationary black hole reduces the mass of black hole. Here we have investigated the accretion of phantom energy onto a stationary charged black hole and have determined the condition under which this accretion is possible. This condition restricts the mass to charge ratio in a narrow limit. This condition also challenges the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture since a naked singularity is eventually produced as magnitude of charge increases compared to mass of black hole.
