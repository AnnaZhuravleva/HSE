[WC]-type CSPNs are hydrogen-deficient Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae showing strong stellar winds and a carbon-rich chemistry. We have analyzed new high-resolution spectra of [WC]-type CSPNs with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) non-LTE expanding atmosphere models, using upgraded model atoms and atomic data. Previous analyses are repeated on the basis of the current models which account for iron-line blanketing. We especially focus on determining the chemical composition, including some trace elements like nitrogen which are of key importance for understanding the evolutionary origin of the hydrogen-deficient Central Stars.
