Variability is a common characteristic of magnetically active stars. Flaring variability is usually interpreted as the observable consequence of transient magnetic reconnection processes happening in the stellar outer atmosphere. Stellar flares have been observed now across 11 decades in wavelength/frequency/energy; such a large span implies that a range of physical processes takes place during such events. Despite the fact that stellar radio flares have long been recognized and studied, key unanswered questions remain. I will highlight what, in my opinion, are some of these questions. I will also describe recent results on stellar flare emissions at radio wavelengths, discussing the nature of coherent and incoherent emissions and the prospects of wide-field radio imaging telescopes for studying such events.
