We explore and compare the performances of two nonlinear correction and scale-dependent biasing models for the extraction of cosmological information from galaxy power spectrum data, especially in the context of beyond-LCDM cosmologies. The first model is the well known Q model, first applied in the analysis of 2dFGRS data. The second, the P model, is inspired by the halo model, in which nonlinear evolution and scale-dependent biasing are encapsulated in a single non-Poisson shot noise term. We find that while both models perform equally well in providing adequate correction for a range of galaxy clustering data in standard LCDM cosmology and in extensions with massive neutrinos, the Q model can give unphysical results in cosmologies containing a subdominant free-streaming dark matter whose temperature depends on the particle mass, e.g., relic thermal axions, unless a suitable prior is imposed on the correction parameter. This last case also exposes the danger of analytic marginalisation, a technique sometimes used in the marginalisation of nuisance parameters. In contrast, the P model suffers no undesirable effects, and is the recommended nonlinear correction model also because of its physical transparency.
