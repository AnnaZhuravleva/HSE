Energetics considerations imply that the broad-line region (BLR) has a high covering factor. The absence of absorption from the BLR means that the BLR has to have a flattened distribution and be seen through a polar hole. The BLR is the inward extension of the torus and they have similar geometries and covering factors. Reconciling velocity-resolved reverberation mapping, spectropolarimetry, and the increasing blueshifting of BLR lines with decreasing distance from the centre, implies that the BLR has a significant inflow component. This inflow provides the mass inflow rate needed to power the AGN. We suggest that the mechanism producing the outward transport of angular momentum necessary for the net inflow of the BLR is the magneto-rotational instability, and that the BLR and outer accretion disc are one and the same.
