Model of supermassive black holes formation inside the clusters of primordial black holes is developed. Namely, it is supposed, that some mass fraction of the universe ~10^-3 is composed of the compact clusters of primordial (relic) black holes, produced during phase transitions in the early universe. These clusters are the centers of dark matter condensation. We model the formation of protogalaxies with masses about 2*10^8M_sun at the redshift z=15. These induced protogalaxies contain central black holes with mass ~10^5M_sun and look like dwarf spheroidal galaxies with central density spike. The subsequent merging of induced protogalaxies and ordinary dark matter haloes corresponds to the standard hierarchical clustering scenario of large-scale structure formation. The coalescence of primordial black holes results in formation of supermassive black holes in the galactic centers. As a result, the observed correlation between the masses of central black holes and velocity dispersion in the galactic bulges is reproduced.
