Abridged. It is important for the star formation process to understand the collapse of a prestellar dense core. We investigate the effect of the magnetic field during the first collapse up to the formation of the firstcore, focusing particularly on the magnetic braking and the launching of outflows. We perform 3D AMR high resolution numerical simulations of a magnetically supercritical collapsing dense core using the RAMSES MHD code and develop semi-analytical models that we compare with the numerical results. We study in detail the various profiles within the envelope of the collapsing core for various magnetic field strengths. Even modest values of magnetic field strength modify the collapse significantly. This is largely due to the amplification of the radial and toroidal components of the magnetic field by the differential motions within the collapsing core. For a weak magnetic intensity corresponding to an initial mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux ratio, $\mu$ equals to 20, a centrifugally supported disk forms. The strong differential rotation triggers the growth of a slowly expanding magnetic tower. For a higher magnetic field strengths corresponding to $\mu=2$, the collapse occurs primarily along the field lines, therefore delivering weaker angular momentum in the inner part whereas at the same time, strong magnetic braking occurs. As a consequence no centrifugally supported disk forms. An outflow is launched from the central thermally supported core. Detailed comparisons with existing analytical predictions indicate that it is magneto-centrifugally driven. For cores having a mass-to-flux over critical mass-to-flux radio $\mu < 5$, the magnetic field appears to have a significant impact.....
