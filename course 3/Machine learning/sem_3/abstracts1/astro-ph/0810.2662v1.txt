In his famous monographs, Einar Tandberg-Hanssen writes that "the single, physically most important parameter to study in prominences may be the magnetic field. Shapes, motions, and in fact the very existence of prominences depend on the nature of the magnetic field threading the prominence plasma". Hereafter we sumarize recent contributions and advances in our knowledge about the magnetic field of solar prominences. It mostly relies on high resolution and high sensitivity spectropolarimetry made both in the visible and in the near infrared.
