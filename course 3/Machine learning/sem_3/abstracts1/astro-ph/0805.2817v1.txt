We present a search for star-forming satellite galaxies that are close enough to their parent galaxies to be considered analogues of the Magellanic Clouds. Our search technique relied on the detection of the satellites in continuum-subtracted narrow-band H alpha imaging of the central galaxies, which removes most of the background and foreground line-of-sight companions, thus giving a high probability that we are detecting true satellites. The search was performed for 119 central galaxies at distances between 20 and 40 Mpc, although spatial incompleteness means that we have effectively searched 53 full satellite-containing volumes. We find only 9 probable star-forming satellites, around 9 different central galaxies, and 2 possible satellites. After incompleteness correction, this is equivalent to 0.17/0.21 satellites per central galaxy. The Small Magellanic Cloud is just below the median values of both star formation rate and R-band luminosity of the 9 probable satellites. The Large Magellanic Cloud, however, has a higher R-band luminosity than any of the 9 and is only exceeded in star formation rate by the one satellite that appears to be undergoing a tidally-induced starburst. Thus the Milky Way appears to be quite unusual, both in having two star-forming satellite galaxies and in the high luminosity of the Large Magellanic Cloud.
