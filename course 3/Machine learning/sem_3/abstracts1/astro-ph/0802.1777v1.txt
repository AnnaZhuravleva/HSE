Context. Due to its great mass and its rapid formation, Jupiter has played a crucial role in shaping the Solar System. The knowledge of its internal structure would strongly constrain the solar system formation mechanism. Seismology is the most efficient way to probe directly the internal structure of giant planets. Aims. SYMPA is the first instrument dedicated to the observations of free oscillations of Jupiter. Principles and theoretical performance have been presented in paper I. This second paper describes the data processing method, the real instrumental performance and presents the first results of a Jovian observation run, lead in 2005 at Teide Observatory. Methods. SYMPA is a Fourier transform spectrometer which works at fixed optical path difference. It produces Doppler shift maps of the observed object. Velocity amplitude of Jupiter's oscillations is expected below 60 cm/s. Results Despite light technical defects, the instrument demonstrated to work correctly, being limited only by photon noise, after a careful analysis. A noise level of about 12 cm/s has been reached on a 10-night observation run, with 21 % duty cycle, which is 5 time better than previous similar observations. However, no signal from Jupiter is clearly highlighted.
