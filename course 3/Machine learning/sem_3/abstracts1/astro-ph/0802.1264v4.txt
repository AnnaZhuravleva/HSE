We investigate the effects of the accretion of phantom energy with non-zero bulk viscosity onto a Schwarzschild black hole and show that black holes accreting viscous phantom energy will lose mass rapidly compared to the non-viscous case. When matter is incorporated along with the phantom energy, the black holes meet with the same fate as bulk viscous forces dominate matter accretion. If the phantom energy has large bulk viscosity, then the mass of the black hole will reduce faster than in the small viscosity case.
