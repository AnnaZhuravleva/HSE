A complete map of the 3D distribution of molecular (CO) gas was constructed using a realistic dynamical model of the gas flow in the barred potential of the Milky Way. The map shows two prominent spiral arms starting at the bar ends connecting smoothly to the 4-armed spiral pattern observed in the atomic hydrogen gas in the outer Galaxy. Unlike previous attempts, our new map uncovers the gas distribution in the bar region of the Galaxy and the far side of the disk. For the first time, we can follow spiral arms in gas as they pass behind the galactic centre.
