A generic feature of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter models is the emission of photons over a broad energy band resulting from the stable yields of dark matter pair annihilation. Inverse Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons of energetic electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilation is expected to produce significant diffuse X-ray emission. Dwarf galaxies are ideal targets for this type of dark matter search technique, being nearby, dark matter dominated systems free of any astrophysical diffuse X-ray background. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of X-ray observations of local dwarf galaxies aimed at the search for WIMP dark matter. We outline the optimal energy and angular ranges for current telescopes, and analyze the systematic uncertainties connected to electron/positron diffusion. We do not observe any significant X-ray excess, and translate this null result into limits on the mass and pair annihilation cross section for particle dark matter. Our results indicate that X-ray observations of dwarf galaxies currently constrain dark matter models at the same level or even more strongly than gamma-ray observations of the same systems, although at the expenses of introducing additional assumptions and related uncertainties in the modeling of diffusion and energy loss processes. The limits we find constrain portions of the supersymmetric parameter space, particularly if the effect of dark matter substructures is included. Finally, we comment on the role of future X-ray satellites (e.g. Constellation-X, XEUS) and on their complementarity with GLAST and other gamma-ray telescopes in the quest for particle dark matter.
