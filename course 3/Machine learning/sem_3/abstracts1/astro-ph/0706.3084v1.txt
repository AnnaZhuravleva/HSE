We present observations in the H53alpha line and radio continuum at 43 GHz carried out with the VLA in the D array (2'' angular resolution) toward the starburst galaxy NGC 5253. VLA archival data have been reprocessed to produce a uniform set of 2, 1.3 and 0.7 cm high angular (0.''2 X 0.''1) radio continuum images. The RRL H53alpha, a previously reported measurement of the H92alpha RRL flux density and the reprocessed high angular resolution radio continuum flux densities have been modeled using a collection of HII regions. Based on the models, the ionized gas in the nuclear source has an electron density of ~6 X 10^4 cm^-3 and an volume filling factor of 0.05. A Lyman continuum photon production rate of 2 X 10^52 s^-1 is necessary to sustain the ionization in the nuclear region. The number of required O7 stars in the central 1.5 pc of the supernebula is ~ 2000. The H53alpha velocity gradient 10 km s^-1 arcsec^-1) implies a dynamical mass of ~3X10^5 Msun; this mass suggests the supernebula is confined by gravity.
