We report the discovery of six new substellar companions of main-sequence stars, detected through multiple Doppler measurements with the instrument HARPS installed on the ESO 3.6m telescope, La Silla, Chile. These extrasolar planets are orbiting the stars BD -17 0063, HD 20868, HD 73267, HD 131664, HD 145377, HD 153950. The orbital characteristics which best fit the observed data are depicted in this paper, as well as the stellar and planetary parameters. Masses of the companions range from 2 to 18 Jupiter masses, and periods range from 100 to 2000 days. The observational data are carefully analysed for activity-induced effects and we conclude on the reliability of the observed radial-velocity variations as of exoplanetary origin. Of particular interest is the very massive planet (or brown-dwarf companion) around the metal-rich HD 131664 with M2sini= 18.15 MJup, and a 5.34-year orbital period. These new discoveries reinforces the observed statistical properties of the exoplanet sample as known so far.
