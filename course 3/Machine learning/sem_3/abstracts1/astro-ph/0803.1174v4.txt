We present reduced and calibrated high resolution Lyman-alpha (Lya) images for a sample of 6 local star forming galaxies. Targets were selected to represent a range in luminosity and metallicity and to include both known Lya emitters and non-emitters. Far ultraviolet imaging was carried out with the Solar Blind Channel of the ACS on HST in the F122M (Lya on-line) and F140LP (continuum) filters. The resulting Lya images are the product of careful modeling of both the stellar and nebular continua, facilitated by supporting HST imaging in Ha and 5 continuum bands, combined with Starburst99 evolutionary synthesis models, and prescriptions for dust extinction on the continuum. In all, the resulting morphologies in Lya, Ha, and UV-continuum are qualitatively very different and we show that the bulk of Lya emerges in a diffuse component resulting from resonant scattering events. Lya escape fractions, computed from integrated Ha luminosities and recombination theory, are found never to exceed 14%. Internal dust extinction is estimated in each pixel and used to correct Lya fluxes. However, the extinction corrections are far too small (factors from 2.6 to infinity) to reconcile the global Lya luminosities with recombination theory. Surprisingly, when comparing the global equivalent widths of Lya and Ha, the two quantities appear anti-correlated, which may be due to the evolution of mechanical feedback. This calls for caution in the interpretation of Lya observations. The images presented have a physical resolution 3 orders of magnitude better than attainable at high-z from the ground with current instrumentation and our images may therefore serve as useful templates for comparing with observations and modeling of primeval galaxy formation. We therefore provide the reduced Lya, Ha, and continuum images to the community.
