We study the capability of the MAGIC telescope to observe under moderate moonlight. TeV gamma-ray signals from the Crab nebula were detected with the MAGIC telescope during periods when the Moon was above the horizon and during twilight. This was accomplished by increasing the trigger discriminator thresholds. No change is necessary in the high voltage settings since the camera PMTs were especially designed to avoid high currents. We characterize the telescope performance by studying the effect of the moonlight on the gamma-ray detection efficiency and sensitivity, as well as on the energy threshold.
