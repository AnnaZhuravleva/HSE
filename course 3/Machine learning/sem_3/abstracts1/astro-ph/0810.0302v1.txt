Clusters of galaxies are one of the few prominent classes of objects predicted to emit gamma rays not yet detected by satellites like EGRET or ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The detection of Very High Energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV) gamma rays from galaxy clusters would provide insight into the morphology of non-thermal particles and fields in clusters. VERITAS, an array of four 12-meter diameter IACTs, is ideally situated to observe the massive Coma cluster, one of the best cluster candidates in the Northern Hemisphere. This contribution details the results of VERITAS observations of the Coma cluster of galaxies during the 2007-2008 observing season.
