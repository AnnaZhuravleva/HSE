At present, ten years after they were first discovered, ten accreting millisecond pulsars are known. I present a study of the aperiodic X-ray variability in three of these systems, which led to the discovery of simultaneous kHz quasi periodic oscillations in XTE J1807-294 and extremely strong broadband noise at unusually low variability frequencies in IGR J00291+5934. Furthermore, we classified SWIFT J1756.9-2508 as an atoll source and measured in its 2007 outburst spectral and variability properties typical of the extreme island state. I also give detailed estimates of the total fluence during the studied outbursts.
