We investigate the third-order density perturbation and the one-loop correction to the linear power spectrum in the dark-energy cosmological model. Our main interest is to understand the dark-energy effect on baryon acoustic oscillations in a quasi-nonlinear regime ($k \approx 0.1h$/Mpc). Analytical solutions and simple fitting formulae are presented for the dark-energy model with the general time-varying equation of state $w(a)$. It turns out that the power spectrum coincides with the approximate result based on the EdS (Einstein de-Sitter) model within 1% for $k<0.4h/$Mpc at $z=0$ in the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) 5yr best-fitting cosmological model, which suggests that the cosmological dependence is very small.
