I review several issues related to statistical description of gravitating systems in both static and expanding backgrounds. After briefly reviewing the results for the static background, I concentrate on gravitational clustering of collisionless particles in an expanding universe. In particular, I describe (a) how the non linear mode-mode coupling transfers power from one scale to another in the Fourier space if the initial power spectrum is sharply peaked at a given scale and (b) the asymptotic characteristics of gravitational clustering which are independent of the initial conditions. Numerical simulations as well as analytic work shows that power transfer leads to a universal power spectrum at late times, somewhat reminiscent of the existence of Kolmogorov spectrum in fluid turbulence.
