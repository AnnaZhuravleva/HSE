During June 2007 the first confirmed superoutburst of the eclipsing dwarf nova SDSS J122740.83+513925.9 was observed using CCD photometry. The outburst amplitude was at least 4.7 magnitudes. The orbital period was measured as 0.06296(5) d from times of the 31 observed eclipses. Time series photometry also revealed superhumps with a period of 0.0653(3) d, thereby establishing it to be a UGSU-type system. The superhump period excess was 3.7% and the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the superhumps was 0.35 magnitudes. The eclipse duration declined from a maximum of 23 min at the peak of the outburst to about 12 mins towards the end. The depth of the eclipses was correlated with the beat period between the orbital and superhump periods.
