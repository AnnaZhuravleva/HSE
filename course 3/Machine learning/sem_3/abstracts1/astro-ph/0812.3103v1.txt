A reanalysis of the fluorine abundance in three Galactic AGB carbon stars (TX Psc, AQ Sgr and R Scl) has been performed from the molecular HF (1-0) R9 line at 2.3358 $\mu$m. High-resolution (R$\sim 50000$) and high signal to noise spectra obtained with the CRIRES spectrograph and the VLT telescope or from the NOAO archive (for TX Psc) have been used. Our abundance analysis uses the latest generation of MARCS model atmospheres for cool carbon rich stars. Using spectral synthesis in LTE we derive for these stars fluorine abundances that are systematically lower by $\sim 0.8$ dex in average with respect to the sole previous estimates by Jorissen, Smith & Lambert (1992). The possible reasons of this discrepancy are explored. We conclude that the difference may rely on the blending with C-bearing molecules (CN and C$_2$) that were not properly taken into account in the former study. The new F abundances are in better agreement with the prediction of full network stellar models of low mass AGB stars. These models also reproduce the $s$-process elements distribution in the sampled stars. This result, if confirmed in a larger sample of AGB stars, might alleviate the current difficulty to explain the largest [F/O] ratios found by Jorissen et al. In particular, it may not be necessary to search for alternative nuclear chains affecting the production of F in AGB stars.
