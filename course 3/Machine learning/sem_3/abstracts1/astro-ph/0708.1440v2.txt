We derive the disk masses of 18 spiral galaxies of different luminosity and Hubble Type, both by mass modelling their rotation curves and by fitting their SED with spectro-photometric models. The good agreement of the estimates obtained from these two different methods allows us to quantify the reliability of their performance and to derive very accurate stellar mass-to-light ratio vs color (and stellar mass) relationships.
