The big trip can be describe with the help of the Wheeler-DeWitt wave equation ${\hat H}\psi(w,a)=0$. The probability to find the universe after big trip in the state with $w=w_0$ will be maximal if $\partial\psi(w,a)/\partial w|_{w=w_0}=0$ for any values of the scale factor $a$. It is shown that this will be the case if and only if $w_0=-1/3$. This fact allows one to suggest that vast majority of universes in multiverse must be in this state after their big trips.
