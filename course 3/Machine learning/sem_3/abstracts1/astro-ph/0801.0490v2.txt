I discuss the status of the Soft X-ray Transient model. First, I discuss and then compare with observations the assumption that the geometrically thin disc evaporates into an ADAF. Second, I address the problems created by the recent determinations of the distance to SS Cyg, according to which the Disc Instability Model does not apply to this famous dwarf-nova, thus casting doubt on the application of this model to any system at all.
