Cherenkov Telescopes (as Magic, Hess and Veritas), while pointing horizontally should reveal also the fluorescence flare tails of nearby down-going air-showers. Such air-showers, born at higher (tens km) altitudes, are growing and extending up to lowest atmospheres (EeVs) or up to higher (few km) quotas (PeVs). Viceversa, as it has been foreseen and only recently observed, the opposite takes place. Fluorescence Telescopes made for UHECR detection may be blazed by inclined Cherenkov lights. The geomagnetic splitting may tag the energy as well as the inclined shower footprint as seen in a recent peculiar event in AUGER. Additional stereoscopic detection may define the event origination distance and its consequent primary composition, extending our understanding on UHECR composition, while unveling a novel tau Neutrino Astronomy.
