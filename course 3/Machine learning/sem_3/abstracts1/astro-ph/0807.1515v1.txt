We have computed theoretical models of circumstellar disks for the classical Be stars $\kappa$ Dra, $\beta$ Psc, and $\upsilon$ Cyg. Models were constructed using a non-LTE radiative transfer code developed by \citet{sig07} which incorporates a number of improvements over previous treatments of the disk thermal structure, including a realistic chemical composition. Our models are constrained by direct comparison with long baseline optical interferometric observations of the H$\alpha$ emitting regions and by contemporaneous H$\alpha$ line profiles. Detailed comparisons of our predictions with H$\alpha$ interferometry and spectroscopy place very tight constraints on the density distributions for these circumstellar disks.
