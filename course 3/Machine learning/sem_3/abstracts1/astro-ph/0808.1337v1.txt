We present our analysis on the clustering properties of star-forming galaxies selected by narrow-band excesses in the Subaru Deep Field. Specifically we focus on Halpha emitting galaxies at z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 in the same field, to investigate possible evolutionary signatures of clustering properties of star-forming galaxies. Based on the analysis on 228 Halpha emitting galaxies with 39.8 < log L(Halpha) < 40.8 at z = 0.40, we find that their two-point correlation function is estimated as xi = (r/1.62^{+0.64}_{-0.50} Mpc)^{-1.84 +/- 0.08}. This is similar to that of Halpha emitting galaxies in the same Halpha luminosity range at z = 0.24, xi = (r/1.88^{+0.60}_{-0.49} Mpc)^{-1.89 +/- 0.07}. These correlation lengths are smaller than those for the brighter galaxy sample studied by Meneux et al. (2006) in the same redshift range. The evolution of correlation length between z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 is interpreted by the gravitational growth of the dark matter halos.
