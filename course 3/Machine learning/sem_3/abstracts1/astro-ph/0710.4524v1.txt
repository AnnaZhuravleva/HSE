It is well know that the coronagraphic observations of halo CMEs are subject to projection effects. Viewing in the plane of the sky does not allow us to determine the crucial parameters defining geoeffectivness of CMEs, such as the velocity, width or source location. We assume that halo CMEs at the beginning phase of propagation have constant velocities, are symmetric and propagate with constant angular widths. Using these approximations and determining projected velocities and difference between times when CME appears on the opposite sides of the occulting disk we are able to get the necessary parameters. We present consideration for the whole halo CMEs from SOHO/LASCO catalog until the end of 2000. We show that the halo CMEs are in average much more faster and wider than the all CMEs from the SOHO/LASCO catalog.
