According to the recent astronomical data, the most part of energy in the Universe is in the 'dark' form, which is effectively described by Lambda-term in Einstein equations. All arguments in favor of the dark energy were obtained so far from the observational data related to very large (intergalactic) scales. Is it possible to find a manifestation of the dark energy at much less scales (e.g. inside the Solar system)?
