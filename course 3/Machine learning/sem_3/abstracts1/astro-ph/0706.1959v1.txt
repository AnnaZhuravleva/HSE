Two brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), namely Abell 1836-BCG and Abell 3565-BCG, were observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope. By modeling the available photometric and kinematic data, it resulted that the mass of Abell 1836-BCG and Abell 3565-BCG are M_bh=4.8(+0.8,-0.7)x10^9 M_sun and M_bh=1.3(+0.3,-0.4)x10^9 M_sun at 1 sigma confidence level, respectively.
