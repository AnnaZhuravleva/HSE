The dual axion model (DAM), yielding bot DM and DE form a PQ-like scalar field solving the strong CP problem, is known to allow a fair fit of CMB data. Recently, however, it was shown that its transfer function exhibits significant anomalies, causing difficulties to fit deep galaxy sample data. Here we show how DAM can be modified to agree with the latter data set. The modification follows the pattern suggested to reconcile any PQ-like approach with gravity. Modified DAM allows precise predictions which can be testable against future CMB and/or deep sample data.
