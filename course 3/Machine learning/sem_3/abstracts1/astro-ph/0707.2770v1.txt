We report on neon abundances derived from {\it Spitzer} high resolution spectral data of eight Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars using the forbidden line of [\ion{Ne}{3}] 15.56 microns. Our targets include four WN stars of subtypes 4--7, and four WC stars of subtypes 4--7. We derive ion fraction abundances $\gamma$ of Ne^{2+} for the winds of each star. The ion fraction abundance is a product of the ionization fraction $Q_{\rm i}$ in stage i and the abundance by number ${\cal A}_E$ of element E relative to all nuclei. Values generally consistent with solar are obtained for the WN stars, and values in excess of solar are obtained for the WC stars.
