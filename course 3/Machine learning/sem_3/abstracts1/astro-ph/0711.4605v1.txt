We review the evidence for a constant star formation rate per unit mass in dense molecular gas in the Milky Way and the extragalactic correlations of L_IR with L' from observations of dense molecular gas. We discuss the connection between the constant SFR/M interpretation in dense gas and the global Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation law.
