Sequences of Doppler images of the young, rapidly rotating late-type stars AB Dor and LQ Hya show that their equatorial angular velocity and the amplitude of their surface differential rotation vary versus time. Such variations can be modelled to obtain information on the intensity of the azimuthal magnetic stresses within stellar convection zones. We introduce a simple model in the framework of the mean-field theory and discuss briefly the results of its application to those solar-like stars.
