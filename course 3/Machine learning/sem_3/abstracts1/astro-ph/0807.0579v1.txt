We report on X-ray observations of the supernova remnant 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud with XMM-Newton X-ray observatory. We use the imaging spectroscopy (EPIC) and Reflective Grating Spectrometer (RGS) data to investigate properties of the remnant and its environment. The X-ray spectra were analyzed with SPEX software package. In addition to this we performed a numerical hydrodynamic simulation of the remnant. The EPIC data show prominent Fe K line emission, but the deduced overall amount of iron in the shocked ejecta is low. The data also show that the remnant has an asymmetric ejecta structure: the bright southwest region of the remnant shows an overabundance of metals. The analysis of the RGS spectrum shows that the remnant has a high lines velocity broadening of ~5000 km/s. We found a hydrodynamical model for the remnant with basic hydrodynamical and spectral parameters similar to the observed ones. The data analysis show that the reverse shock just recently reached iron layers of the ejecta. The brightness enhancement in the southwest region could be a sign of an asymmetric explosion or it could be the result of a density enhancement of the interstellar medium. We constructed numerical models which are in good agreement with the observations, with circumstellar density of 3e-25 g/cm^3, age of ~400 years, velocities of ~5000 km/s and an electron to ion temperature ratio of 0.01.
