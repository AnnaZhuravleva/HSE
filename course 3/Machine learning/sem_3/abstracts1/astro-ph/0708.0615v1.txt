We present compelling evidence for confirmation of a Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) candidate, G332.5-5.6, based initially on identification of new, filamentary, optical emission line nebulosity seen in the arcsecond resolution images from the AAO/UKST HAlpha survey. The extant radio observations and X-ray data which we have independently re-reduced, together with new optical spectroscopy of the large-scale fragmented nebulosity, confirms the identification. Optical spectra, taken across five different, widely separated nebula regions of the remnant as seen on the HAlpha images, show average ratios of [NII]/HAlpha =2.42, [SII]/HAlpha = 2.10, and [SII] 6717/6731 = 1.23, as well as strong [OI] 6300, 6364A and [OII] 3727A emission. These ratios are firmly within those typical of SNRs. Here, we also present the radio-continuum detection of the SNR at 20/13cm from observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Radio emission is also seen at 4850 MHz, in the PMN survey (Griffith and Wright 1993) and at 843 MHz from the SUMSS survey (Bock, Large and Sadler 1999). We estimate an angular diameter of ~30 arcmin and obtain an average radio spectral index of alpha = -0.6 +- 0.1 which indicates the non-thermal nature of G332.5-5.6. Fresh analysis of existing ROSAT X-ray data in the vicinity also confirms the existence of the SNR. The distance to G332.5-5.6 has been independently estimated by Reynoso and Green (2007) as 3.4 kpc based on measurements of the HI lambda21 cm line seen in absorption against the continuum emission. Our cruder estimates via assumptions on the height of the dust layer (3.1 kpc) and using the Sigma-D relation (4 kpc) are in good agreement.
