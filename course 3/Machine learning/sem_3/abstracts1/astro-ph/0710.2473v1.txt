In order to study the process of cooling in dark-matter (DM) halos and assess how well simple models can represent it, we run a set of radiative SPH hydrodynamical simulations of isolated halos, with gas sitting initially in hydrostatic equilibrium within Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) potential wells. [...] After having assessed the numerical stability of the simulations, we compare the resulting evolution of the cooled mass with the predictions of the classical cooling model of White & Frenk and of the cooling model proposed in the MORGANA code of galaxy formation. We find that the classical model predicts fractions of cooled mass which, after about two central cooling times, are about one order of magnitude smaller than those found in simulations. Although this difference decreases with time, after 8 central cooling times, when simulations are stopped, the difference still amounts to a factor of 2-3. We ascribe this difference to the lack of validity of the assumption that a mass shell takes one cooling time, as computed on the initial conditions, to cool to very low temperature. [...] The MORGANA model [...] better agrees with the cooled mass fraction found in the simulations, especially at early times, when the density profile of the cooling gas is shallow. With the addition of the simple assumption that the increase of the radius of the cooling region is counteracted by a shrinking at the sound speed, the MORGANA model is also able to reproduce for all simulations the evolution of the cooled mass fraction to within 20-50 per cent, thereby providing a substantial improvement with respect to the classical model. Finally, we provide a very simple fitting function which accurately reproduces the cooling flow for the first ~10 central cooling times. [Abridged]
