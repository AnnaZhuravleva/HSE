Astrophysical neutrinos in the EeV range (particularly those generated by the interaction of cosmic rays with the cosmic microwave background) promise to be a valuable tool to study astrophysics and particle physics at the highest energies. Much could be learned from temporal, spectral, and angular distributions of ~100 events, which could be collected by a detector with ~100 km^3 effective volume in a few years. Scaling the optical Cherenkov technique to this scale is prohibitive. However, using the thick ice sheet available at the South Pole, the radio and acoustic techniques promise to provide sufficient sensitivity with sparse instrumentation. The best strategy may be a hybrid approach combining all three techniques. A new array of acoustic transmitters and sensors, the South Pole Acoustic Test Setup, was installed in three IceCube holes in January 2007. The purpose of SPATS is to measure the attenuation length, background noise, and sound speed for 10-100 kHz acoustic waves. Favorable results would pave the way for a large hybrid array. SPATS is the first array to study the possibility of acoustic neutrino detection in ice, the medium expected to be best for the purpose. First results from SPATS are presented.
