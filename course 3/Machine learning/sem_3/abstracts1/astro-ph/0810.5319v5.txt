In the past, the isolated, radio-quiet neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 showed variations in the spectral parameters (apparent radius, temperature of the emitting area and equivalent width of the absorption feature) seen in the X-ray spectra, not only during the spin period of 8.39s, but also over time scales of years. New X-ray observations of RX J0720.4-3125 with XMM Newton extend the coverage to about 7.5 years with the latest pointing performed in November 2007. Out of a total of fourteen available EPIC-pn datasets, eleven have been obtained with an identical instrumental setup (full frame read-out mode with thin filter), and are best suited for a comparative investigations of the spectral and timing properties of this enigmatic X-ray pulsar.   We analysed the new XMM Newton observations together with archival data in order to follow the spectral and temporal evolution of RX J0720.4-3125   All XMM-Newton data were reduced with the standard XMM-SAS software package. A systematic and consistent data reduction of all these observations was emphasised in order to reduce systematic errors as far as possible.   We investigate the phase residuals derived from data from different energy bands using different timing solutions for the spin period evolution and confirm the phase lag between hard and soft photons. The phase shift in the X-ray pulses between hard and soft photons varies with time and changes sign around MJD=52800 days, regardless of the chosen timing solution. The phase residuals[abridge]
