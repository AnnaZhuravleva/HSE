A binary supermassive black hole leaves an imprint on a galactic nucleus in the form of a "mass deficit," a decrease in the mass of the nucleus due to ejection of stars by the binary. The magnitude of the mass deficit is in principle related to the galaxy's merger history, but the relation has never been quantified. Here, high-accuracy N-body simulations are used to calibrate this relation. Mass deficits are shown to be approximately 0.5M_{12}, with M_{12} the total mass of the binary; the coefficient in this relation depends only weakly on the binary mass ratio or on the galaxy's pre-existing density profile. Hence, after N mergers, the mass deficit is ~0.5 N M_h with M_h the final (current) black hole mass. When compared with observed mass deficits, this result implies between 1 and 3 mergers for most galaxies, in accord with hierarchical galaxy formation models. Implications for binary stalling radii, the origin of hyper-velocity stars, and the distribution of dark matter at the centers of galaxies are discussed.
