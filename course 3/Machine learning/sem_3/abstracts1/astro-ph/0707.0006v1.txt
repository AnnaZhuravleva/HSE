We list and analyze H I absorption lines at redshifts 2 < z < 4 with column density (12 < log(N_HI) < 19) in 40 high-resolutional (FWHM = 8.0 km/s) quasar spectra obtained with the Keck+HIRES. We de-blend and fit all H I lines within 1,000 km/s of 86 strong H I lines whose column densities are log(N_HI/[cm^-2]) > 15. Unlike most prior studies, we use not only Lya but also all visible higher Lyman series lines to improve the fitting accuracy. This reveals components near to higher column density systems that can not be seen in Lya. We list the Voigt profile fits to the 1339 H I components that we found. We examined physical properties of H I lines after separating them into several sub-samples according to their velocity separation from the quasars, their redshift, column density and the S/N ratio of the spectrum. We found two interesting trends for lines with 12 < log(N_HI) < 15 which are within 200-1000 km/s of systems with log(N_HI) > 15. First, their column density distribution becomes steeper, meaning relatively fewer high column density lines, at z < 2.9. Second, their column density distribution also becomes steeper and their line width becomes broader by about 2-3 km/s when they are within 5,000 km/s of their quasar.
