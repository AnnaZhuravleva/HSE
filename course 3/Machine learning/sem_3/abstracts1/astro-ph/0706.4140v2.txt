According to recent observational and theoretical progresses, the DUrca process (direct Urca process) may be excluded from the category of neutron star cooling mechanisms. This result combined with the latest nuclear symmetry energy experiments, will provide us an independent way of testing the EOS (equation of state) for supranormal density. For example, soft EOSs such as FPS will probably be excluded.
