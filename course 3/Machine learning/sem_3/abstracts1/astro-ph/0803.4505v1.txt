We have measured fragmentation branching ratios of neutral CnH and CnH+ cations produced in high velocity (4.5 a.u) collisions between incident CnH+ cations and helium atoms. Electron capture gives rise to excited neutral species CnH and electronic excitation to excited cations CnH+. Thanks to a dedicated set-up, based on coincident detection of all fragments, the dissociation of the neutral and cationic parents were recorded separately and in a complete way. For the fragmentation of CnH, the H-loss channel is found to be dominant, as already observed by other authors. By contrast, the H-loss and C-loss channels equally dominate the two-fragment break up of CnH+ species. For these cations, we provide the first fragmentation data (n > 2). Results are also discussed in the context of astrochemistry.
