Flux-dominated solar dynamo models have demonstrated to reproduce the main features of the large scale solar magnetic cycle, however the use of a solar like differential rotation profile implies in the the formation of strong toroidal magnetic fields at high latitudes where they are not observed. In this work, we invoke the hypothesis of a thin-width tachocline in order to confine the high-latitude toroidal magnetic fields to a small area below the overshoot layer, thus avoiding its influence on a Babcock-Leighton type dynamo process. Our results favor a dynamo operating inside the convection zone with a tachocline that essentially works as a storage region when it coincides with the overshoot layer.
