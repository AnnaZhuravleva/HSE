We present the results of a deep, wide-field search for transiting `Hot Jupiter (HJ)' planets in the globular cluster omega Centauri. As a result of a 25-night observing run with the ANU 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, a total of 109,726 stellar time series composed of 787 independent data points were produced with differential photometry in a 52x52' (0.75 deg^2) field centered on the cluster core, but extending well beyond. Taking into account the size of transit signals as a function of stellar radius, 45,406 stars have suitable photometric accuracy (<=0.045 mag to V=19.5) to search for transits. Of this sample, 31,000 stars are expected to be main sequence cluster members. All stars, both cluster and foreground, were subjected to a rigorous search for transit signatures; none were found. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on our actual data set allows us to determine the sensitivity of our survey to planets with radii ~1.5R_Jup, and thus place statistical upper limits on their occurrence frequency 'F'. Smaller planets are undetectable in our data. At 95% confidence, the frequency of Very Hot Jupiters (VHJs) with periods P satisfying 1d<P<3d can be no more than F_VHJ < 1/1040 in omega Cen. For HJ and VHJ distributed uniformly over the orbital period range 1d<P<5d, F_VHJ+HJ < 1/600. Our limits on large, short-period planets are comparable to those recently reported for other Galactic fields, despite being derived with less telescope time.
