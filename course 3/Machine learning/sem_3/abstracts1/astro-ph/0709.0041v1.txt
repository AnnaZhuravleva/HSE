Spectral analysis by means of NLTE model atmospheres has presently arrived at a high level of sophistication. High-resolution spectra of central stars of planetary nebulae can be reproduced in detail from the infrared to the X-ray wavelength range.   In the case of LSV +4621, the exciting star of Sh 2-216, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art in the determination of photospheric properties like, e.g., effective temperature, surface gravity, and abundances of elements from hydrogen to nickel. From such detailed model atmospheres, we can reliably predict the ionizing spectrum of a central star which is a necessary input for the precise analysis of its ambient nebula.   NLTE model-atmosphere spectra, however, are not only accessible for specialists. In the framework of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO), we provide pre-calculated grids of tables with synthetic spectra of hot, compact stars as well as a tool to calculate individual model-atmosphere spectra in order to make the use of synthetic stellar spectra as easy as the use of blackbody flux distributions had been in the last century.
