In order to contribute to the general effort aiming at the improvement of our knowledge about the physical conditions within the Broad Line Region (BLR) of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), here we present the results achieved by our analysis of the spectral properties of a sample of 90 broad line emitting sources, collected at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database. By focusing our attention mainly onto the Balmer series of hydrogen emission lines, which is the dominant feature in the optical wavelength range of many BLR spectra, we extracted several flux and profile measurements, which we related to other source properties, such as optical continuum luminosities, inferred black hole masses, and accretion rates. Using the Boltzmann Plot method to investigate the Balmer line flux ratios as a function of the line profiles, we found that broader line emitting AGN typically have larger H_alpha / H_beta and smaller H_gamma / H_beta and H_delta / H_beta line ratios. With the help of some recent investigations, we model the structure of the BLR and we study the influence of the accretion process on the properties of the BLR plasma.
