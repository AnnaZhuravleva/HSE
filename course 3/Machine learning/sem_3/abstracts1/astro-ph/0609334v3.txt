Results are presented from a detailed analysis of optical and X-ray observations of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology (CNOC) subsample of the EMSS. The combination of extensive optical and deep X-ray observations of these clusters make them ideal candidates for multiwavelength mass comparison studies. X-ray surface brightness profiles of 14 clusters with 0.17<z<0.55 are constructed from Chandra observations and fit to single and double beta-models. Spatially resolved temperature analysis is performed, indicating that five of the clusters in this sample exhibit temperature gradients within their inner 60-200 kpc. Integrated spectra extracted within R_2500 provide temperature, abundance, and luminosity information. Under assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, we derive gas and total masses within R_2500 and R_200. We find an average gas mass fraction within R_200 of 0.136 +/- 0.004, resulting in Omega_m=0.28 +/- 0.01 (formal error). We also derive dynamical masses for these clusters to R_200. We find no systematic bias between X-ray and dynamical methods across the sample, with an average M(dyn)/M(X-ray) = 0.97 +/- 0.05. We also compare X-ray masses to weak lensing mass estimates of a subset of our sample, resulting in a weighted average of M(lens)/M(X-ray) of 0.99 +/- 0.07. We investigate X-ray scaling relationships and find powerlaw slopes which are slightly steeper than the predictions of self-similar models, with an E(z)^(-1) Lx-Tx slope of 2.4 +/- 0.2 and an E(z) M_2500-Tx slope of 1.7 +/- 0.1. Relationships between red-sequence optical richness (B_gc,red) and global cluster X-ray properties (Tx, Lx and M_2500) are also examined and fitted.
