We use Vector Spectromagnetograph (VSM) chromospheric full-disk magnetograms, from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) project, to study the distribution of magnetic field flux concentrations within the polar caps. We find that magnetic flux elements preferentially appear toward lower latitudes within the polar caps away from the poles. This has implications on numerous solar phenomena such as the formation and evolution of fine polar coronal structures (i.e., polar plumes). Our results also have implications for the processes carrying the magnetic flux from low to high latitudes (e.g., meridional circulation).
