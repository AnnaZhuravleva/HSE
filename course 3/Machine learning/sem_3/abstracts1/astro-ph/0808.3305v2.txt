In this paper, we review some of the properties of dense molecular cloud cores. The results presented here rely on three-dimensional numerical simulations of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent, and self-gravitating molecular clouds (MCs) in which dense core form as a consequence of the gravo-turbulent fragmentation of the clouds. In particular we discuss issues related to the mass spectrum of the cores, their lifetimes and their virial balance.
