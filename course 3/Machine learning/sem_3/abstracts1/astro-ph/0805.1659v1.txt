About 10TeV gamma-ray emission within 10 pc region from the Galactic Center had been reported by 4 independent groups. Considering that this TeV gamma-ray emission is produced via a hadronic model, and the relativistic protons came from the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes, we investigate the spectral nature of the injected relativistic protons required by the hadronic model. The calculation was carried on the tidal disruption of the different types of stars and the different propagation mechanisms of protons in the interstellar medium. Compared with the observation data from HESS, we find for the best fitting that the power-law index of the spectrum of the injected protons is about -1.9, when a red giant star is tidally disrupted, and the effective confinement of protons diffusion mechanism is adopted.
