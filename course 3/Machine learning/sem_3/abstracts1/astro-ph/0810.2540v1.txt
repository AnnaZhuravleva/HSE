As one of the lowest metallicity star forming galaxies, with a nucleus of several super star clusters, SBS0335-052E is the subject of substantial current study. We present new insights on this galaxy based on new and archival high spatial resolution NICMOS and ACS images. We provide new measurements and limits on the size of several of the SSCs. The images have sufficient resolution to divide the star formation into compact regions and newly discovered extended regions, indicating a bi-modal form of star formation. The star formation regions are dated via the equivalent width of the Pa alpha emission and we find that two of the extended regions of star formation are less than 10 million years old. Our previous finding that stellar winds confine the photo-ionizing flux to small regions around individual stars is consistent with the new observations. This may allow planet formation in what would traditionally be considered a harsh environment and has implications for the number of planets around globular cluster stars. In addition the images pinpoint the regions of H2 emission as located in, but not at the center of the two star forming super star clusters, S1 and S2.
