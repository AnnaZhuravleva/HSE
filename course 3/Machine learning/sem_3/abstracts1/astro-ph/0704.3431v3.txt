The environmental influence on the 1.4 GHz continuum radio emission of galaxies is analyzed in a 600 deg2 region of the local Universe containing the Shapley Supercluster (SSC). Galaxies in the FLASH and 6dFGS redshift surveys are cross-identified with NVSS radio sources, selected in a subsample doubly complete in volume and luminosity. Environmental effects are studied through a smoothed density field (normalized with random catalogs with the same survey edges and redshift selection function) and the distance to the nearest cluster (R/r200, where r200 is the virial radius, whose relation to the aperture velocity dispersion is quantified). The fraction of high radio loudness (R_K=L_radio/L_K) galaxies in the 10 Mpc Abell 3558 cluster complex at the core of the SSC (SSC-CR) is half as large than elsewhere. In the SSC-CR, R_K is anti-correlated with the density of the large-scale environment and correlated with R/r200: central brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the SSC-CR are 10x less radio-loud than BCGs elsewhere, with signs of suppressed radio loudness in the SSC-CR also present beyond the BCGs, out to at least 0.3 r200. This correlation is nearly as strong as the tight correlation of L_K with R/r200 (K-luminosity segregation), inside the SSC-CR. The suppression of radio loudness in SSC-CR BCGs can be attributed to cluster-cluster mergers that destroy the cool core and thus the supply of gas to the central AGN. We analytically demonstrate that the low radio loudness of non-BCG galaxies within SSC-CR clusters cannot be explained by direct major galaxy mergers or rapid galaxy flyby collisions, but by the loss of gas supply through the enhanced ram pressure felt when these galaxies cross the shock front between the 2 merging clusters and are later subjected to the stronger wind from the 2nd cluster.
