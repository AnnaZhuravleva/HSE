Although dark matter makes up 80% of the gravitational mass of our Galaxy, its composition is not known. One hypothesis is that dark matter consists of massive particles called WIMPs. WIMPs are expected to accumulate and coannihilate in the cores of stars, but the only signature of this accumulation has been thought to be hard- to-observe high-energy neutrinos. Here we propose an entirely new observable signature. WIMP coannihilations in the core of a very low-mass star, brown dwarf, or planetary-mass object should alter the star's chemical composition via spallation reactions. Very close to the Galactic center, these stars may acquire extremely high lithium, beryllium, and boron abundances, even for models with otherwise- undetectable WIMP-nucleon cross sections. These abundances should be measurable in certain stellar systems and phenomena.
