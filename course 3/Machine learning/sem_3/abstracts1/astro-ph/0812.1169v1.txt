The sunspot solar cycle has been usually explained as the result of a dynamo process operating in the sun. This is a classical problem in Astrophysics that until the present is not fully solved. Here we discuss current problems and limitations with the solar dynamo modeling and their possible solutions using a kinematic dynamo model within the Babcock-Leighton approximation as a tool. In particular, we discuss the importance of the turbulent magnetic pumping versus the meridional flow circulation in the dynamo operation.
