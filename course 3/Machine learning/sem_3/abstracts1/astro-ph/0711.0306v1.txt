The soft gamma-ray repeater SGR 1806-20 has been attracting a lot of attention owing to the fact that in December 2004 it emitted the most powerful giant flare ever observed. Here we present the results of the first Suzaku observation of SGR 1806-20, that seems to have reached a state characterized by a flux close to the pre-flare level and by a relatively soft spectrum. Despite this, the source remained quite active, as testified by several short bursts observed by Suzaku. We discuss the broadband spectral properties of SGR 1806-20 in the context of the magnetar model, considering its recent theoretical developments.
