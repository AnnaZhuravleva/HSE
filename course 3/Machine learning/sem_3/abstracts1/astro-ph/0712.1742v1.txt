Historically, the magnetic field geometries of the chemically peculiar Ap stars were modelled in the context of a simple dipole field. However, with the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic data, it has become clear that the large-scale field topologies exhibit important departures from this simple model. Recently, new high-resolution circular and linear polarisation spectroscopy has even hinted at the presence of strong, small-scale field structures, which were completely unexpected based on earlier modelling. This project investigates the detailed structure of these strong fossil magnetic fields, in particular the large-scale field geometry, as well as small scale magnetic structures, by mapping the magnetic and chemical surface structure of a selected sample of Ap stars. These maps will be used to investigate the relationship between the local field vector and local surface chemistry, looking for the influence the field may have on the various chemical transport mechanisms (i.e., diffusion, convection and mass loss). This will lead to better constraints on the origin and evolution, as well as refining the magnetic field model for Ap stars. Mapping will be performed using high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio time-series of spectra in both circular and linear polarisation obtained using the new-generation ESPaDOnS and NARVAL spectropolarimeters at the CFHT and Pic du Midi Observatory. With these data we will perform tomographic inversion of Doppler-broadened Stokes IQUV Zeeman profiles of a large variety of spectral lines using the INVERS10 magnetic Doppler imaging code, simultaneously recovering the detailed surface maps of the vector magnetic field and chemical abundances.
