The models of star formation function and of dissipation of turbulent energy of interstellar medium are proposed. In star formation model the feedback of supernovae is taken into account. It is shown that hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation with proposed models is able to explain the observable star formation pause in the Galaxy.
