The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for black hole quasinormal mode sources of low-frequency gravitational waves is estimated using a Monte Carlo approach that replaces the all-sky average approximation. We consider an eleven dimensional parameter space that includes both source and detector parameters. We find that in the black-hole mass range $M\sim 4$-$7\times 10^6M_{\odot}$ the SNR is significantly higher than the SNR for the all-sky average case, as a result of the variation of the spin parameter of the sources. This increased SNR may translate to a higher event rate for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We also study the directional dependence of the SNR, show at which directions in the sky LISA will have greater response, and identify the LISA blind spots.
