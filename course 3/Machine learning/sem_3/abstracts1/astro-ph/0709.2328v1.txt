All the observations performed with the IBIS telescope aboard the INTEGRAL observatory during the first 2.5 years of its in-orbit operation have been analyzed to find X-ray bursts. There were 1788 statistically confident events with a duration from 5 to 500 s revealed in time records of the 15-25 keV count rate of the IBIS/ISGRI detector, 319 of them were localized and, with one exception, identified with persistent X-ray sources. The known bursters were responsible for 215 of the localized events. One burst was detected from AXJ1754.2-2754, the source previously unknown as a burster, and another burst - from a new source. There was duality in determining its position - its name could be either IGR J17364-2711 or IGR J17380-3749. Curiously enough, the 138 bursts were detected from one X-ray burster - GX 354-0.
