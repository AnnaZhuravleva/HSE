We present 0.2" resolution near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of H-alpha emission from six star forming galaxies at z~1.6 (look-back time of ~9.6 Gyr). These observations were obtained with OSIRIS using the Keck Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics system. All sources have a compact spatial extent of ~1", with an average half light radius of r=2.9 kpc and average dereddened star formation rate of 22 Msolar per year. Based on H-alpha kinematics we find that these six galaxies are dynamically distinguishable, and we classify them as either merger or disk candidate systems. We find three merger systems (HDF-BX1287, HDF-BX1315, and Q1623-BX491) with varying geometries and dynamical properties. Three galaxies (HDF-BMZ1299, Q2343-BX344, and Q2343-BM145) are well-fit by an inclined-disk model with low velocity residuals (20 to 46 km/sec). An average plateau velocity of v_p=185 km/sec is achieved within 1.0 kpc. The majority of observed velocity dispersions (~88 km/sec) can be explained by the residual seeing halo, and are not intrinsic to our sources. However, one merger and one disk candidate have high velocity dispersions (> 200 km/sec) that cannot be solely explained by beam smearing. For two disk candidates, we detect [NII] emission and are able to map the [NII]/H-alpha ratio on kiloparsec scales. In both cases, [NII] emission is more concentrated than H-alpha emission (< 0.2"), and peak ratios are best explained by the presence of an AGN. These are among the weakest known AGN at high redshift, however their emission is strong enough to impact high redshift metallicity studies that use nebular ratios. All disk candidates have likely completed only a few orbital periods, and if left unperturbed are excellent candidates to become present-day spiral galaxies.
