We compute the 3-point correlation function for a general model of inflation driven by a single, minimally coupled scalar field. Our approach is based on the numerical evaluation of both the perturbation equations and the integrals which contribute to the 3-point function. Consequently, we can analyze models where the potential has a "feature", in the vicinity of which the slow roll parameters may take on large, transient values. This introduces both scale and shape dependent non-Gaussianities into the primordial perturbations. As an example of our methodology, we examine the ``step'' potentials which have been invoked to improve the fit to the glitch in the $<TT>$ $C_l$ for $l \sim 30$, present in both the one and three year WMAP data sets. We show that for the typical parameter values, the non-Gaussianities associated with the step are far larger than those in standard slow roll inflation, and may even be within reach of a next generation CMB experiment such as Planck. More generally, we use this example to explain that while adding features to potential can improve the fit to the 2-point function, these are generically associated with a greatly enhanced signal at the 3-point level. Moreover, this 3-point signal will have a very nontrivial shape and scale dependence, which is correlated with the form of the 2-point function, and may thus lead to a consistency check on the models of inflation with non-smooth potentials.
