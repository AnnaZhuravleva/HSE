Herbig Ae/Be stars are a class of young pre-main sequence stellar objects of intermediate mass and are known to have varying amounts of natal cloud material still present in their direct vicinity. We characterise the IR emission bands, due to fluorescence by PAH molecules, in the spectra of Herbig Ae/Be stars and link observed variations to spatial aspects of the mid-IR emission. We analysed two PAH dominated spectra from a sample of 15 Herbig Ae/Be stars observed with Spitzer and derive profiles of the major PAH bands. The shape and the measured band characteristics show pronounced variations between the two Spitzer spectra. Those variations parallel those found between three ISO spectra of other, well-studied, Herbig Ae/Be stars. The derived profiles are compared to those from a broad sample of sources. The Spitzer and ISO spectra exhibit characteristics commonly interpreted respectively as interstellar matter-like (ISM), non-ISM-like, or a combination of the two. We argue that the PAH emission detected from the sources exhibiting a combination of ISM-like and non-ISM-like characteristics indicates the presence of two dissimilar, spatially separated, PAH families. As the shape of the individual PAH band profiles reflects the composition of the PAH molecules involved, this demonstrates that PAHs in subsequent, evolutionary linked stages of star formation are different from those in the general ISM, implying active chemistry. None of the detected PAH emission can be associated with the (unresolved) disk and is thus associated with the circumstellar cloud. This implies that chemical changes may already occur in the natal cloud and not necessarily in the disk.
