The HST/ACS Survey of Galactic globular clusters (GGCs) is a HST Treasury project aimed at obtaining high precision photometry in a large sample of globular clusters. The homogeneous photometric catalogs that has been obtained from these data by Anderson et al. (2008) represents a golden mine for a lot of astrophysical studies.   In this paper we used the catalog to analyse the properties of MS-MS binary systems from a sample of fifty GGCs. We measured the fraction of binaries (divided in different groups), studied their radial distribution and constrained the mass ratio distribution. We investigated possible relations between the fraction of binaries and the main parameters of their host GGCs.   We found a significant anti-correlation between the binary fraction in a cluster and its absolute luminosity (mass).
