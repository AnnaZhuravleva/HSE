We study the complementarity between the indirect detection of dark matter with gamma-rays in H.E.S.S. and the supersymmetry searches with ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider in the Focus Point region within the mSUGRA framework. The sensitivity of the central telescope of the H.E.S.S. II experiment with an energy threshold of ~ 20 GeV is investigated. We show that the detection of gamma-ray fluxes of O(10^-12) cm-2s-1 with H.E.S.S. II covers a substantial part of the Focus Point region which may be more difficult for LHC experiments. Despite the presence of multi-TeV scalars, we show that LHC will be sensitive to a complementary part of this region through three body NLSP leptonic decays. This interesting complementarity between H.E.S.S. II and LHC searches is further highlighted in terms of the gluino mass and the two lightest neutralino mass difference.
