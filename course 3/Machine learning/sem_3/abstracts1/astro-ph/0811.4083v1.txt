We study turbulent convection during the core helium flash close to its peak by comparing the results of two and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.   We use a multidimensional Eulerian hydrodynamics code based on state-of-the-art numerical techniques to simulate the evolution of the helium core of a $1.25 M_{\odot}$ Pop I star.   Our three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of a star during the peak of the core helium flash do not show any explosive behavior. The convective flow patterns developing in the three-dimensional models are structurally different from those of the corresponding two-dimensional models, and the typical convective velocities are smaller than those found in their two-dimensional counterparts. Three-dimensional models also tend to agree better with the predictions of mixing length theory. Our hydrodynamic simulations show the presence of turbulent entrainment that results in a growth of the convection zone on a dynamic time scale. Contrary to mixing length theory, the outer part of the convection zone is characterized by a sub-adiabatic temperature gradient.
