We present a set of {\it Spitzer} 24$\mu$m MIPS time series observations of the M-dwarf eclipsing binary star GU Bo\"otis. Our data cover three secondary eclipses of the system: two consecutive events and an additional eclipse six weeks later. The study's main purpose is the long wavelength (and thus limb darkening-independent) characterization of GU Boo's light curve, allowing for independent verification of the results of previous optical studies. Our results confirm previously obtained system parameters. We further compare GU Boo's measured 24$\mu$m flux density to the value predicted by spectral fitting and find no evidence for circumstellar dust. In addition to GU Boo, we characterize (and show examples of) light curves of other objects in the field of view. Analysis of these light curves serves to characterize the photometric stability and repeatability of {\it Spitzer's} MIPS 24\micron array over short (days) and long (weeks) timescales at flux densities between approximately 300--2,000$\mu$Jy. We find that the light curve root mean square about the median level falls into the 1--4% range for flux densities higher than 1mJy. Finally, we comment on the fluctuations of the 24\micron background on short and long timescales.
