We present extensive tables of bolometric corrections and interstellar extinction coefficients for the WFPC2 and ACS (both WFC and HRC) photometric systems. They are derived from synthetic photometry applied to a database of spectral energy distributions covering a large range of effective temperatures, surface gravity, and metal content. Carbon stars are also considered. The zero-points take into consideration the new high-accuracy Vega fluxes from Bohlin. These tables are employed to transform Padova isochrones into WFPC2 and ACS photometric systems using interstellar extinction coefficients on a star-to-star basis. All data are available either in tabular form or via an interactive web interface in the case of the isochrones. Preliminary tables for the WFC3 camera are also included in the database.
