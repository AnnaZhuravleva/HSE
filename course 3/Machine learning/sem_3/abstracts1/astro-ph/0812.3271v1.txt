We report on our time-resolved CCD photometry during the 2005 June superoutburst of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova candidate, ASAS 160048-4846.2. The ordinary superhumps underwent a complex evolution during the superoutburst. The superhump amplitude experienced a regrowth, and had two peaks. The superhump period decreased when the superhump amplitude reached to the first maximum, successively gradually increased until the second maximum of the amplitude, and finally decreased again. Investigating other SU UMa-type dwarf novae which show an increase of the superhump period, we found the same trend of the superhump evolution in superoutbursts of them. We speculate that the superhump regrowth in the amplitude has a close relation to the increase of the superhump period, and all of SU UMa-type dwarf novae with a superhump regrowth follow the same evolution of the ordinary superhumps as that of ASAS 160048-4846.2.
