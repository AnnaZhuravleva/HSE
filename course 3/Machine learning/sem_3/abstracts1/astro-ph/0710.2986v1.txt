We consider disk accretion resulting purely from the loss of angular momentum due to the outflow of plasma from a magnetized disk. In this limiting case, the dissipation due to the viscosity and finite electrical conductivity of the plasma can be neglected. We have obtained self-consistent, self-similar solutions for dissipationless disk accretion. Such accretion may result in the formation of objects whose bolometric luminosities are lower than the flux of kinetic energy in the ejected material.
