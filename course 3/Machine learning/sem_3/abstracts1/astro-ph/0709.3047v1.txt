We present a novel approach for simultaneous extraction of stellar population parameters and internal kinematics from the spectra integrated along a line of sight. We fit a template spectrum into an observed one in a pixel space using a non-linear $\chi^2$ minimization in the multidimensional parameter space, including characteristics of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) and parametrized star formation history (SFH). Our technique has been applied to IFU and multi-object spectroscopy of low-luminosity early type galaxies.
