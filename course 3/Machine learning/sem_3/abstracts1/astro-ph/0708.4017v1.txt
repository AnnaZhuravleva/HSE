Using detailed spectral energy distribution fits we present evidence that submillimeter- and radio-bright gamma-ray burst host galaxies are hotter counterparts to submillimeter galaxies. This hypothesis makes them of special interest since hotter submm galaxies are difficult to find and are believed to contribute significantly to the star formation history of the Universe.
