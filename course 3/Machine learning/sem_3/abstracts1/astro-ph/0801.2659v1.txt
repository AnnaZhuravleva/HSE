Based on the data from the ''Pi of the Sky'' project we made a catalog of the variable stars with periods from 0.1 to 10 days. We used data collected during a period of two years (2004 and 2005) and classified 725 variable stars. Most of the stars in our catalog are eclipsing binaries - 464 (about 64%), while the number of pulsating stars is 125 (about 17%). Our classification is based on the shape of the light curve, as in the GCVS catalog. However, some stars in our catalog were classified as of different type than in the GCVS catalog. We have found periods for 15 stars present in the GCVS catalog with previously unknown period.
