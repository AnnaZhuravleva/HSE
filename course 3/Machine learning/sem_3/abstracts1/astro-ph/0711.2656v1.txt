Maps of the radio source 3C 120 obtained from VLBA+ observations at 8.4 GHz at five epochs in January - September 2002 are presented. The images were reconstructed using the maximum entropy method and the Pulkovo VLBImager software package for VLBI mapping. Apparent superluminal motions of the brightest jet knots have been estimated. The speeds of jet knots decreases with distance from the core, changing from 5.40+-0.48c $ to 2.00+-0.48c over 10 mas (where c is the speed of light) for a Hubble constant of 65 km/s/Mpc. This can be explained by interaction of the jet with the medium through which it propagates.
