The improved data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy allow a better determination of the adiabaticity of the primordial perturbation. Interestingly, we find that recent CMB data seem to favor a contribution of a primordial isocurvature mode where the entropy perturbation is positively correlated with the primordial curvature perturbation and has a large spectral index (niso ~ 3). With 4 additional parameters we obtain a better fit to the CMB data by Delta chi^2 = 9.7 compared to an adiabatic model. For this best-fit model the nonadiabatic contribution to the CMB temperature variance is 4%. According to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis the nonadiabatic contribution is positive at more than 95% C.L. The exact C.L. depends somewhat on the choice of priors, and we discuss the effect of different priors as well as additional cosmological data.
