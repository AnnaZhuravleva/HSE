We review the properties of carbon-sequence ([WC]) Wolf-Rayet central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe). Differences between the subtype distribution of [WC] stars and their massive WC cousins are discussed. We conclude that [WO]-type differ from early-type [WC] stars as a result of weaker stellar winds due to high surface gravities, and that late- and early-type [WC] and [WO] stars generally span a similar range in abundances, X(He) ~ X(C) >> X(O), consistent with a late thermal pulse, and likely progenitors to PG1159 stars.
