Regenerated high-energy emissions from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are studied in detail. If the intrinsic primary spectrum extends to the TeV range, these very high-energy photons are absorbed by the cosmic infrared background (CIB). Created high-energy electron-positron pairs up-scatter mainly cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, and secondary photons are generated in the GeV-TeV range. These secondary delayed photons may be observed in the near future, which are useful for a consistency check of the intrinsic primary spectrum. In this paper, we focus on effects of the CIB on delayed secondary emissions. In particular, we show that not only up-scattered CMB photons but also up-scattered CIB ones are important, especially for low redshift bursts. They also give us additional information on the CIB, whose photon density is not definitely determined so far.
