The application of multi-wavelength selection techniques is crucial for discovering a complete and unbiased set of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Here, we select a sample of 72 AGN candidates in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) using deep radio and mid-infrared data from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Spitzer Space Telescope, and analyze their properties across other wavelengths. Only 30% of these sources are detected in deep 200 ks Chandra X-ray Observatory pointings. The X-ray detected sources demonstrate moderate obscuration with column densities of N_H > 10^22 cm^-2. A stacked image of sources undetected by Chandra shows low levels of X-ray activity, suggesting they may be faint or obscured AGNs. Less than 40% of our sample are selected as AGNs with optical broad lines, mid-infrared power laws, or X-ray detections. Thus, if our candidates are indeed AGNs, the radio/mid-infrared selection criteria we use provide a powerful tool for identifying sources missed by other surveys.
