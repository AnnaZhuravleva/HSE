The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) is applied to quantify the degree of randomness (stochasticity) in the temperature maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation maps. It is shown that, the KSP for the WMAP5 maps is about twice higher than that of the simulated maps for the concordance \LambdaCDM cosmological model, implying the existence of a randomizing effect not taken into account in the model. As was revealed recently, underdense regions in the large scale matter distributions, i.e the voids, possess hyperbolic and hence randomizing properties. The degree of randomness for the Cold Spot appears to be about twice higher than the average over the mean temperature level spots in the sky, which supports the void nature of the Cold Spot. Kolmogorov's parameter then acts as a quantitative tracer of the voids via CMB.
