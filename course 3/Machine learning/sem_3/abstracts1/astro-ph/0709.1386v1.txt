During its cycle-1 observation period, between April 2005 and March 2006, the MAGIC telescope was able to observe nine Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) events since their early beginning. Other observations were performed during the following months in the cycle-2 observation period. The observations, with an energy threshold spanning from 80 to 200 GeV, did not reveal any gamma ray emission. The computed upper limits are compatible with a power law extrapolation, where intrinsic fluxes are evaluated taking into account the attenuation due to the scattering in the metagalactic radiation field.
