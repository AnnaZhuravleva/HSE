Using the large emission line galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we show that Star forming galaxies, Seyferts, and low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates these emission-line galaxies, using strong optical emission lines. Using this classification we identify a few distinguishing host galaxy properties of each class, which, along with the emission line analysis, suggest continuous evolution from one class to another. As a final note, we introduce models of both Starforming galaxies and AGN narrow line regions which can explain the distribution of galaxies on standard emission line ratio diagrams, and possibly suggest new diagnostics across the emission spectrum.
