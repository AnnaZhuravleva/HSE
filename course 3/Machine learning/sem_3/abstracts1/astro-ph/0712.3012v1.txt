The photometry data base of the second phase of the OGLE microlensing experiment, OGLE-II, is a rich source of information about the kinematics and structure of the Galaxy. In this work we use the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue to identify candidate stars which have high proper motions. 521 stars with proper motion mu > 50 mas/yr in the OGLE-II proper motion catalogue (Sumi 2004) were cross-identified with stars in the MACHO high proper motion catalogue, and the DENIS and 2MASS infra-red photometry catalogues. Photometric distances were computed for stars with colours consistent with G/K and M type stars. 6 stars were newly identified as possible nearby (< 50 pc) M dwarfs.
