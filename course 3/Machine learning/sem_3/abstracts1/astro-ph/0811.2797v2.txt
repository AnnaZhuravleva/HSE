We examine the class of barotropic fluid models of dark energy, in which the pressure is an explicit function of the density, p = f(\rho). Through general physical considerations we constrain the asymptotic past and future behaviors and show that this class is equivalent to the sum of a cosmological constant and a decelerating perfect fluid, or "aether", with w_{AE}\ge0. Barotropic models give substantially disjoint predictions from quintessence, except in the limit of \LambdaCDM. They are also interesting in that they simultaneously can ameliorate the coincidence problem and yet "predict" a value of w\approx-1.
