We introduce the Dichroic-Mirror Camera (DMC), an instrument developed at the University of Tokyo which is capable of performing simultaneous imaging in fifteen bands. The main feature of the DMC is the dichroic mirrors, which split incoming light into red and blue components. Combination of dichroic mirrors split light from the telescope focus into fifteen intermediate-width bands across 390 -- 950 nm. The fifteen bands of DMC provide measurements of the object's spectral energy distribution (SED) at fifteen wavelength points. During May -- June 2007 and March 2008, observing run of the DMC was carried out at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory, Japan. We observed several objects i.e. planets, asteroids, standard stars & star clusters, planetary nebulae, galaxies, and supernovae. We describe several early scientific results from the DMC.
