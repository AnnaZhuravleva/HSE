Within the frame of the NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA) project, we have determined the distribution and kinematics of the molecular gas within the central kpc with high spatial resolution (100-150pc), for a sample of active galaxies. The goal is to study the gas-fueling mechanisms in AGN. We present interferometric observations of 12CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1) line emission from the Seyfert2 galaxy NGC6574, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). These data have been combined with 30m mapping data in these lines to correct for the flux resolved by the interferometer. At an angular resolution of 0.7'' (about 110pc), the 12CO(2-1) emission is resolved into an inner disk with a radius of 300pc.
