The connection between mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) morphology in globular clusters (GCs) has long been acknowledged but the mechanisms governing mass loss remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective. The present study uses synthetic HB models to demonstrate for the first time that alpha-enhancement and a simple relation between mass loss and metallicity can explain the entire range of HB morphology (characterized by the HB type index) observed in old, coeval GCs. The mass loss-metallicity relation accounts naturally for the fact that the most metal poor GCs ([Fe/H] < -2) have redder HBs than is typical of GCs with -2 < [Fe/H] < -1.5 without invoking younger ages. These results may prove useful in studying the contribution of HB stars to integrated light via stellar population synthesis.
