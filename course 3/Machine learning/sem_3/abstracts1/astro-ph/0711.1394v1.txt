We present the chemical compositions for eight bright giants in the globular cluster NGC 1851. Our analysis reveals large star-to-star abundance variations and correlations of the light elements O, Na, and Al, a feature found in every well studied globular cluster. However, NGC 1851 also exhibits large star-to-star abundance variations of the s-process elements Zr and La. These s-process elements are correlated with Al, and anticorrelated with O. Furthermore, the Zr and La abundances appear to cluster around two distinct values. A recent study revealed a double subgiant branch in NGC 1851. Our data reinforce the notion that there are two stellar populations in NGC 1851 and indicate that this cluster has experienced a complicated formation history with similarities to omega Centauri.
