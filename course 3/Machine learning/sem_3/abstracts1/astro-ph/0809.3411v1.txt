We present several corrections for point source photometry to be applied to data from the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. These corrections are necessary because of characteristics of the IRAC arrays and optics and the way the instrument is calibrated in-flight. When these corrections are applied, it is possible to achieve a ~2% relative photometric accuracy for sources of adequate signal to noise in an IRAC image.
