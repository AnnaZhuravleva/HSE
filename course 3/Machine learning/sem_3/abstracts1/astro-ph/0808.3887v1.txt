We review the properties of the very young (2 Myr) open cluster NGC6383. The cluster is dominated by the massive binary HD159176 (O7V + O7V). The distance to NGC6383 is consistently found to be 1.3 +- 0.1 kpc and the average reddening is determined to be E(B-V) = 0.32 +- 0.02. Several pre-main sequence candidates have been identified using different criteria relying on the detection of emission lines, infrared excesses, photometric variability and X-ray emission.
