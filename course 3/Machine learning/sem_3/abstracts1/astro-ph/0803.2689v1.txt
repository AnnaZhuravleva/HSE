(abridged) Photometry and long-slit spectroscopy are presented for a sample of 6 galaxies with a low surface brightness stellar disc and a bulge. The stellar and ionised-gas kinematics were measured along the major and minor axis in half of the sample galaxies, whereas the other half was observed only along two diagonal axes. Spectra along two diagonal axes were obtained also for one of the objects with major and minor axis spectra. The kinematic measurements extend in the disc region out to a surface-brightness level mu_R~24mag/arcsec^2 reaching in all cases the flat part of the rotation curve. The stellar kinematics turns out to be more regular and symmetric than the ionised-gas kinematics, which often shows the presence of non-circular, off-plane, and non-ordered motions. This raises the question about the reliability of the use of the ionised gas as the tracer of the circular velocity in the modeling of the mass distribution, in particular in the central regions of low surface brightness galaxies.
