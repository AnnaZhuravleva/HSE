We examine the possibility to extend leap second extrapolation for a near future based on some periodic terms in the Earth's rotation changes. The IERS data, covering the interval from 1962.15 to 2006.95, are analyzed. The difference $\Delta T$ is extrapolated till to 2035 and compared with the IERS extrapolated values to the 2012. It can be seen that for the interval from 2006 to 2024 only 1 leap seconds (negative) will be operated.
