We present results of time evolution of oblique MHD plane shocks including diffusive cosmic ray acceleration with backreaction on the plasma flows. The simulations include self-consistent effects of finite Alfven wave propagation and dissipation. From the computed cosmic ray particle phase space distributions we calculate expected leptonic and hadronic emissions resulting from interactions between the cosmic rays, magnetic fields, the thermal particle population and relevant astrophysical photon fields.
