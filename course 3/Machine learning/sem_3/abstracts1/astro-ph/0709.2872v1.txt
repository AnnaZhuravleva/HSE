We have developed a macroscopic description of coherent electro-magnetic radiation from air showers initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays due to the presence of the geo-magnetic field. This description offers a simple and direct insight in the relation between the properties of the air shower and the time-structure of the radio pulse.
