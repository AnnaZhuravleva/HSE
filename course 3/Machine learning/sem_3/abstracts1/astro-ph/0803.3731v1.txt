Near-infrared (NIR) and optical polarimetric observations of a selection of X-ray binaries are presented. The targets were observed using the Very Large Telescope and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. We detect a significant level (3 sigma) of linear polarisation in four sources. The polarisation is found to be intrinsic (at the > 3 sigma level) in two sources; GRO J1655-40 (~ 4-7% in H and Ks-bands during an outburst) and Sco X-1 (~ 0.1-0.9% in H and K), which is stronger at lower frequencies. This is likely to be the signature of optically thin synchrotron emission from the collimated jets in these systems, whose presence indicates a partially-ordered magnetic field is present at the inner regions of the jets. In Sco X-1 the intrinsic polarisation is variable (and sometimes absent) in the H and K-bands. In the J-band (i.e. at higher frequencies) the polarisation is not significantly variable and is consistent with an interstellar origin. The optical light from GX 339-4 is also polarised, but at a level and position angle consistent with scattering by interstellar dust. The other polarised source is SS 433, which has a low level (0.5-0.8%) of J-band polarisation, likely due to local scattering. The NIR counterparts of GRO J0422+32, XTE J1118+480, 4U 0614+09 and Aql X-1 (which were all in or near quiescence) have a linear polarisation level of < 16% (3 sigma upper limit, some are < 6%). We discuss how such observations may be used to constrain the ordering of the magnetic field close to the base of the jet in such systems.
