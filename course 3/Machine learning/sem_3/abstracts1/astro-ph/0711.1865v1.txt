Young stars are expected to gain most of their mass by accretion from a disk that forms around them as a result of angular momentum conservation in the collapsing protostellar cloud. Accretion initially proceeds at high rates of 10^{-6}-10^{-5} M_Sun/yr resulting in strong irradiation of the stellar surface by the hot inner portion of the disk and leading to the suppression of the intrinsic stellar luminosity. Here we investigate how this luminosity suppression affects evolution of the protostellar properties. Using simple model based on the energy balance of accreting star we demonstrate that disk irradiation causes only a slight increase of the protostellar radius, at the level of several per cent. Such a weak effect is explained by a minor role played by the intrinsic stellar luminosity (at the time when it is significantly altered by irradiation) in the protostellar energy budget compared to the stellar deuterium burning luminosity and the inflow of the gravitational potential energy brought in by the freshly accreted material. Our results justify the neglect of irradiation effects in previous studies of the protostellar growth via disk accretion. Evolution of some other actively accreting objects such as young brown dwarfs and planets should also be only weakly sensitive to the effects of disk irradiation.
