The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, an HST Treasury Project, will deliver high quality, homogeneous photometry of 65 globular clusters. This paper introduces a new collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones suitable for analyzing the ACS Survey data. Stellar evolution models were computed at [Fe/H]= -2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, and 0; [alpha/Fe]= -0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8; and three initial He abundances for masses from 0.1 to 1.8 Msun and ages from 2 to 15 Gyr. Each isochrone spans a wide range in luminosity from Mv~14 up to the tip of the red giant branch. These are complemented by a set of He-burning tracks that extend from the zero age horizontal branch to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giant branch. In addition, a set of computer programs are provided that make it possible to interpolate the isochrones in [Fe/H], generate luminosity functions from the isochrones, and create synthetic horizontal branch models. The tracks and isochrones have been converted to the observational plane with two different color-Teff transformations, one synthetic and one semi-empirical, in ground-based B, V, and I, and F606W and F814W for both ACS-WFC and WFPC2 systems.
