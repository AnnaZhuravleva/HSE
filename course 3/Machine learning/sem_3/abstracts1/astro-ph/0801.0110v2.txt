We explore the abundance of light clusters in core-collapse supernovae at post-bounce stage in a quantum statistical approach. Adopting the profile of a supernova core from detailed numerical simulations, we study the distribution of light bound clusters up to alpha particles (A=2-4) as well as heavy nuclei (A > 4) in dense matter at finite temperature. Within the frame of a cluster-mean field approach, the abundances of light clusters are evaluated accounting for self-energy, Pauli blocking and effects of continuum correlations. We find that deuterons and tritons, in addition to 3He and 4He, appear abundantly in a wide region from the surface of the proto-neutron star to the position of the shock wave. The appearance of light clusters may modify the neutrino emission in the cooling region and the neutrino absorption in the heating region, and, thereby, influence the supernova mechanism.
