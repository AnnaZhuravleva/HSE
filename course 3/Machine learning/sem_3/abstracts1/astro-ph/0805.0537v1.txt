(abridged) We present an analysis of the deepest hard X-ray survey to date of about 2500 deg^2 performed by the IBIS instrument on board INTEGRAL in the 20-60 keV band, with a total exposure time of 4 Ms. We find 34 candidate sources. The ratio of Seyfert 1 to Seyfert 2 is significantly more than the ratio found in the optical, which may be evidence for a receding torus, but could also be due to absorption columns > 10^{25} cm^{-2}. None of the predicted Compton-thick objects is detected unambiguously; when taking lower limits on Nh into account, the fraction of these objects is found to be lower than 24%. We do not see, but cannot exclude, a relationship between absorption and luminosity similar to what is seen in the 2-10 keV band. Our data suggests the possibility of a lack of objects with 10^{21} < Nh < 10^{22} cm^{-2}, as expected if absorption originates either in a torus-like structure or in the host galaxy. We find that the Log N-Log S diagram of our sources is compatible with those obtained in other surveys in hard X-rays. Compared to models of the AGN population selected in the 2-10 keV band, the Log N-Log S diagram is generally in good agreement, but the Nh distribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbed sources (Nh<10^{22} cm^{-2}) at a given flux limit compared to the models. We resolve here about 2.5% of the cosmic X-ray background. We also study the local hard X-ray luminosity function, which is compatible with what is found in other recent hard X-ray surveys. The characteristic luminosity Log L*_{20-60 keV}=43.66 is found to be a factor about 5 lower than the value observed in the 2-10 keV band. We find a space density of 10^{-3} AGN with L>10^{41} per Mpc^3 and a corresponding luminosity density of 0.9 10^{39} erg s^{-1} Mpc^{-3}.
