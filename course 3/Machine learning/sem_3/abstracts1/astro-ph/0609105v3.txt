A new numerical code, called SFUMATO, for solving self-gravitational magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is presented. A block-structured grid is adopted as the grid of the AMR hierarchy. The total variation diminishing (TVD) cell-centered scheme is adopted as the MHD solver, with hyperbolic cleaning of divergence error of the magnetic field also implemented. The self-gravity is solved by a multigrid method composed of (1) full multigrid (FMG)-cycle on the AMR hierarchical grids, (2) V-cycle on these grids, and (3) FMG-cycle on the base grid. The multigrid method exhibits spatial second-order accuracy, fast convergence, and scalability. The numerical fluxes are conserved by using a refluxing procedure in both the MHD solver and the multigrid method. The several tests are performed indicating that the solutions are consistent with previously published results.
