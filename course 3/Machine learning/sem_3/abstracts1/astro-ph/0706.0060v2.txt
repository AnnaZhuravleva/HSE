In this paper we present a new result, namely that the primal magnetic field of the collapsed core during a supernova explosion will, as a result of the conservation of magnetic flux, receive a massive boost to more than 90 times its original value by the Pauli paramagnetization of the highly degenerate relativistic electron gas just after the formation of the neutron star. Thus, the observed super-strong magnetic field of neutron stars may originate from the induced Pauli paramagnetization of the highly degenerate relativistic electron gas in the interior of the neutron star. We therefore have an apparently natural explanation for the surface magnetic field of a neutron star.
