Asteroseismic observations from space can provide us with long time series of uninterrupted high quality data for many stars at the same time. The CoRoT satellite (Convection Rotation and planetary Transits) was launched successfully in December 2006 and provides high precision photometery for a large number of stars. Here we present our research on (late G and K) red giant stars observed during the first long run (150 days) of CoRoT with the 'eye' dedicated to exo-planet research.
