V445 Pup (2000) is a unique object identified as a helium nova. Color indexes during the outburst are consistent with those of free-free emission. We present a free-free emission dominated light curve model of V445 Pup on the basis of the optically thick wind theory. Our light curve fitting shows that (1) the white dwarf (WD) mass is very massive (M_WD \gtrsim 1.35 M_\sun), and (2) a half of the accreted matter remains on the WD, both of which suggest that the increasing WD mass. Therefore, V445 Pup is a strong candidate of Type Ia supernova progenitor. The estimated distance to V445 Pup is now consistent with the recent observational suggestions, 3.5 < d < 6.5 kpc. A helium star companion is consistent with the brightness of m_v=14.5 mag just before the outburst, if it is a little bit evolved hot (\log T (K) \gtrsim 4.5) star with the mass of M_He \gtrsim 0.8 M_\sun. We then emphasize importance of observations in the near future quiescent phase after the thick circumstellar dust dissipates away, especially its color and magnitude to specify the nature of the companion star. We have also calculated helium ignition masses for helium shell flashes against various helium accretion rates and discussed the recurrence period of helium novae.
