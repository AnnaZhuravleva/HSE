We describe a method for constructing mock galaxy catalogues which are well suited for use in conjunction with large photometric surveys. We use the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of Bower et al. implemented in the Millennium simulation. We apply our method to the specific case of the surveys soon to commence with PS1, the first of 4 telescopes planned for the Pan-STARRS system. PS1 has 5 photometric bands (grizy), and will carry out an all-sky 3pi survey and a medium deep survey (MDS) over 84 sq.deg. We calculate the expected magnitude limits for extended sources in the two surveys. We find that, after 3 years, the 3pi survey will have detected over 10^8 galaxies in all 5 bands, 10 million of which will lie at redshift z>0.9, while the MDS will have detected over 10^7 galaxies with 0.5 million lying at z>2. These numbers at least double if detection in the shallowest band, y is not required. We then evaluate the accuracy of photometric redshifts estimated using an off-the-shelf photo-z code. With the grizy bands alone it is possible to achieve an accuracy in the 3pi survey of Delta z/(1+z)~0.06 for 0.25<z<0.8, which could be reduced by about 15% using near infrared photometry from the UKIDDS survey, but would increase by about 25% for the deeper sample without the y band photometry. For the MDS an accuracy of Delta z/(1+z)~0.05 is achievable for 0.02<z<1.5 using grizy. A dramatic improvement in accuracy is possible by selecting only red galaxies. In this case, Delta z/(1+z)~0.02-0.04 is achievable for ~100 million galaxies at 0.4<z<1.1 in the 3pi survey and for 30 million galaxies in the MDS at 0.4<z<2. We investigate the effect of using photo-z in the estimate of the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale. We find that PS1 will achieve a similar accuracy in this estimate as a spectroscopic survey of 20 million galaxies.
