The Petersen diagram is a frequently used tool to constrain model parameters such as metallicity of radial double-mode pulsators. In this diagram the period ratio of the radial first overtone to the fundamental mode, P_1/P_0, is plotted against the period of the fundamental mode. The period ratio is sensitive to the chemical composition as well as to the rotational velocity of a star. In the present study we compute stellar pulsation models to demonstrate the sensitivity of the radial period ratio to the opacity data (OPAL and OP tables) and we also examine the effect of different relative abundances of heavy elements. We conclude that the comparison with observed period ratios could be used successfully to test the opacity data.
