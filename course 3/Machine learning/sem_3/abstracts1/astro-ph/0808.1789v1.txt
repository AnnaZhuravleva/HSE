(Abridged): We present U, B, V, R, I, H-alpha and NUV photometry of 14 galaxies in the very local Universe (within 10 Mpc that are dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrr), are at low redshift (51<v<610 km/s), and appear as a six degree long linear filament.. We examine the star formation (SF) properties of individual objects with the current SF rate (SFR) derived directly from the H-alpha line flux and compare the multi-band photometry with results of galaxy evolution assuming short SF bursts separated by long quiescence periods. Most objects contain at least one "old" stellar population (>1-10 Gyr) and one "young" population (<30 Myr) with the recent SF bursts occurring a few to a few 10s of Myr ago, arguing for synchronicity in star formation in these objects. We propose that the ~synchronous star formation in all objects is caused by the accretion of cold gas from intergalactic space onto dark matter haloes arranged along a filament threading the void where these dwarf galaxies reside and point out this galaxy sample as an ideal target to study hierarchical clustering and galaxy formation among very nearby objects.
