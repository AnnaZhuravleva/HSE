The spin parameter of the black hole in M33 X-7 has recently been measured to be a*=0.77+-0.05 (Liu et al. 2008). It has been proposed that the spin of the 15.65 M_sun black hole is natal. We show that this is not a viable evolutionary path given the observed binary orbital period of 3.45 days since the explosion that would produce a black hole with the cited spin parameter and orbital period would disrupt the binary. Furthermore, we show that the system has to be evolved through the hypercritical mass transfer of about 5 M_sun from the secondary star to the black hole.
