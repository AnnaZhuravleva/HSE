We present molecular line observations of the massive star forming region IRAS 17233-3606 aimed at studying the molecular core associated with the source. The observations were made using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope in the CO (3-2) and HCO^+ (4-3) transitions, and in the CH_3OH (6_K-5_K), (7_K-6_K) and CH_3CN (16_K-15_K) bands. For the CO(3-2) and HCO^+ (4-3) transitions, we obtained maps with a size of 70''\times 70''. The typical angular resolution of the data is ~18''. Our observations reveal an exceptionally rich molecular spectrum, a signpost of hot core activity. Comparisons with two other prominent southern hot cores were made through observations in the same frequency setups. We also detected a bipolar outflow in CO (3-2) and HCO^+ (4-3) lines. Modelling reveals a hot core of size ~3'' and a temperature of 150 K in the IRAS17233-3606 region. The parameters of the molecular outflow are derived through the analysis of the CO (3-2) emission, and are typical of outflows driven by high-mass young stellar objects.
