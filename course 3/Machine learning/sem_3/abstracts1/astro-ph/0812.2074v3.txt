A new diagnostic method, $Om$ is applied to generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model as the unification of dark matter and dark energy. On the basis of the recently observed data: the Union supernovae, the observational Hubble data, the SDSS baryon acoustic peak and the five-year WMAP shift parameter, we show the discriminations between GCG and $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, it is calculated that the current equation of state of dark energy $w_{0de}=-0.964$ according to GCG model.
