The linear and non-linear evolution of a relativistic current sheet of pair ($e^{\pm}$) plasmas is investigated by three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. In a Harris configuration, it is obtained that the magnetic energy is fast dissipated by the relativistic drift kink instability (RDKI). However, when a current-aligned magnetic field (the so-called "guide field") is introduced, the RDKI is stabilized by the magnetic tension force and it separates into two obliquely-propagating modes, which we call the relativistic drift-kink-tearing instability (RDKTI). These two waves deform the current sheet so that they trigger relativistic magnetic reconnection at a crossover thinning point. Since relativistic reconnection produces a lot of non-thermal particles, the guide field is of critical importance to study the energetics of a relativistic current sheet.
