I present polarization modelling of Active Galactic Nuclei in the optical/UV range. The modelling is conducted using the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code Stokes, which self-consistently models the polarization signature of a complex model arrangement for an active nucleus. In this work I include three different scattering regions around the central source: an equatorial electron scattering disk, an equatorial obscuring dusty torus, and polar electron scattering cones. I investigate the resulting dependencies of the V-band polarization for different optical depths of the scattering cones, different dust compositions inside the torus, and various half-opening angles of the torus/polar cones. The observed polarization dichotomy can be successfully reproduced by the model.
