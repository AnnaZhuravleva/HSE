A single parameter, the gravitational growth index \gamma, succeeds in characterizing the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime separately from the effects of the cosmic expansion. The parameter is restricted to a very narrow range for models of dark energy obeying the laws of general relativity but takes on distinctly different values in models of beyond-Einstein gravity. In analogy to the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism for testing gravity, we extend and motivate the gravitational growth index, or Minimal Modified Gravity, approach to parameterizing beyond-Einstein cosmology. Using a simple analytic formalism, we show how the growth index parameter applies to early dark energy, time-varying gravity, DGP braneworld gravity, and scalar-tensor gravity.
