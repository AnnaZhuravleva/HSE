Gravity whose nature is fundamental to the understanding of solar system, galaxies and the structure and evolution of the Universe, is theorized by the assumption of curved spacetime, according to Einstein`s general theory of relativity (EGR). Particles move on curved spacetime along straight lines (geodesics). In the last year, I proposed the mirrored version of EGR, the flat-spacetime general relativity (FGR), in which particles move along curved lines on flat spacetime. This puts gravitational study back to the traditional Lagrangian formulation. In fact, all claimed accurate verification of general relativity is the verification of FGR, because people when confronting GR to observational data, calculate time, distance, or angle by directly using the coordinates in Schwarzschild solution or in post Newtonian formulation. For example, people calculate the angles by directly using the coordinate $\phi$. However, only when spacetime is flat does there exists one coordinate system which has direct meaning of time, distance, angle, and vice verse. This is the famous Riemann theorem. Therefore, the more claims are made that classical tests of general relativity fit data with great accuracy, the more falsified is the curved-spacetime assumption. People made three such specious claims to EGR as collected in the present paper. However, FGR predicts observationally verified results consistently for solar system, galaxies, and the universe on the whole. I show that the possibility of curved spacetime, black holes, and big bang is less than one billionth. An experiment is proposed whose results will completely decide the fate of curved spacetime assumption. with the original article `Einstein`s Geometrization vs. Holonomic Cancellation of Gravity via Spatial Coordinate-rescale` attached.
