Stellar pulsations in main-sequence B-type stars are driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism due to the Fe-group opacity bump. The current models do not predict the presence of instability strips in the B spectral domain at very low metallicities. As the metallicity of the Magellanic Clouds (MC) has been measured to be around $Z=0.002$ for the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and $Z=0.007$ for the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), they constitute a very suitable objects to test these predictions.   The aim of this work is to investigate the existence of B-type pulsators at low metallicities, searching for short-term periodic variability in a large sample of B and Be stars from the MC with accurately determined fundamental astrophysical parameters.
