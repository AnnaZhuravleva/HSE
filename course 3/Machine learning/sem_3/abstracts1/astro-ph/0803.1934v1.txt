We study a small sample of z=0.1-0.6 core-collapse supernova (CCSN) host galaxies. Continuum observations at 250GHz have been performed with MAMBO at the IRAM-30m telescope. None of these sources has been detected and the error-weighted mean flux is 0.25+/-0.32 mJy. Upper limits on their dust masses are derived and the corresponding sample mean corresponds to 1.4 +/- 2.2 x 10^8 Msol. These results are comparable with previous submillimetre observations of SN-Ia hosts performed by Farrah et al. and by Clements et al. We conclude that CCSN hosts are not extreme at millimetre wavelengths, and as confirmed with the optical luminosities of a subset of our sample, they are typical of the local galaxy population.
