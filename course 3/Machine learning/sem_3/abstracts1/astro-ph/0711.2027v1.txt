The onset of the thermonuclear runaway in a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf, leading to the explosion as a type Ia supernova, is studied with hydrodynamical simulations. We investigate the evolution of temperature fluctuations (``bubbles'') in the WD's convective core by means of 2D numerical simulations. We show how the occurrence of the thermonuclear runaway depends on various bubble parameters. The relevance of the progenitor's composition for the ignition process is also discussed.
