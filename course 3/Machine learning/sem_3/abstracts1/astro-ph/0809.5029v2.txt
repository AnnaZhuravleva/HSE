We present multicolour photometry and modelling of the active eclipsing binary star V405 And. The components of 0.2 and 0.5 solar masses are just below and above the theoretical limit of the full convection, that is thought to be around 0.3 solar mass. The light curves are compositions of constant and variable features: the distorted shape of the components (about 25%), a small eclipse, and mainly of spots (about 75%) and flares.
