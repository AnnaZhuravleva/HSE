We present both numerical and semi-analytical results on test-particle acceleration in multiple parallel shocks. We apply a kinetic Monte Carlo code and an eigenfunction expansion method to calculate the distribution functions for electron populations accelerated in subsequent parallel shocks with speeds ranging from non- to fully-relativistic. We examine the levels of particle anisotropy at the shocks and discuss the implications for AGN and microquasar jets.
