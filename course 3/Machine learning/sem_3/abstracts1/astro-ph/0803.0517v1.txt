We report the properties of a new young double stellar cluster in the region towards IRAS 07141-0920 contained in the HII region Sh2-294. High-resolution optical UBVRI and Halpha images, near-infrared JHKs and H2 filter images were used to make photometric and morphological studies of the point sources and the nebula seen towards Sh2-294. The optical images reveal an emission nebula with very rich morphological details, composed mainly of UV scattered light and of Halpha emission. Contrasting with the bright parts of the nebula, opaque, elongated patches are seen. Our optical photometry confirms that the illuminator of the nebula is likely to be a B0.5V star located at a distance of about 3.2 kpc. Our near-IR images reveal an embedded cluster, extending for about 2 pc and exhibiting sub-clustering: a denser, more condensed, sub-cluster surrounding the optical high-mass B0.5V illuminator star; and a more embedded, optically invisible, sub-cluster located towards the eastern, dark part of the nebula and including the luminous MSX source G224.1880+01.2407, a massive protostellar candidate that could be the origin of jets and extended features seen at 2.12 micron. The double cluster appears to be clearing the remaining molecular material of the parent cloud, creating patches of lower extinction and allowing some of the least reddened members to be detected in the optical images. We find 12 MS and 143 PMS members using 3 different methods: comparison with isochrones in optical colour-magnitude diagrams, detection of near-IR excess, and presence of Halpha emission. The most massive star fits a 4 Myr post-MS isochrone. The age of the optically selected PMS population is estimated to be 7-8 Myr. The IR-excess population shows sub-clustering on scales as small as 0.23 pc and is probably much younger.
