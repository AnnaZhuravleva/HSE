M 87 is the first extragalactic source detected in the Very High Energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray domain that is not a blazar, its large scale jet not being aligned to the line of sight. Slight modification of standard emission models of TeV blazars allows to account for the gamma-ray spectra obtained with H.E.S.S. We present a multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton model taking explicitly into account large viewing angles and moderate values of the Lorentz factor as inferred from MHD simulations of jet formation. Predictions of the VHE emission for the nearby radiogalaxy Cen A and an interpretation of the broadband radiation of M 87 are presented.
