An accretion flow is necessarily transonic around a black hole. However, around a neutron star it may or may not be transonic, depending on the inner disk boundary conditions influenced by the neutron star. I will discuss various transonic behavior of the disk fluid in general relativistic (or pseudo general relativistic) framework. I will address that there are four types of sonic/critical point possible to form in an accretion disk. It will be shown that how the fluid properties including location of sonic points vary with angular momentum of the compact object which controls the overall disk dynamics and outflows.
