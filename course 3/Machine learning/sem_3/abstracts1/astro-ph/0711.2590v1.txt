Granada oscillation code (GraCo) is a software constructed to compute adiabatic and non-adiabatic oscillation eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. The adiabatic version gives the standard numerical resolution, and also the Richardson extrapolation, different sets of eigenfunctions, different outer mechanical boundary conditions or different integration variables. The non-adiabatic version can include the atmosphere-pulsation interaction. The code has been used for intensive studies of \delta Scuti, \gamma Doradus, \beta Ceph., SdO and, SdB stars. The non adiabatic observables ``phase-lag'' (the phase between the effective temperature variations and the radial displacement) and \delta T_{eff}/ T_{eff} (relative surface temperature variation) can help to the modal identification. These quantities together with the energy balance (``growth rate'') provide useful additional information to the adiabatic resolution (eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions).
