Dark matter annihilations in the Sun to neutrino-antineutrino pairs have striking signatures in neutrino detectors such as IceCube and KM3. We make a model independent study of the signals after propagation of the neutrinos from the center of the Sun to the Earth. A large spin-dependent DM capture cross section in the Sun make the discovery prospects robust.
