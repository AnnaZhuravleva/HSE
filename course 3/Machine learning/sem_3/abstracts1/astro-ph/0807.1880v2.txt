We study a scalar phi field that unifies inflation and dark energy with a long period of a hot decelerating universe in between these two stages of inflation. A key feature is that the transition between the intermediate decelerated phase to the dark energy phase is related to a quantum regeneration of the scalar field phi instead to purely classical dynamics. The interaction V_int(phi,varphi) between phi and a second scalar field varphi allows not only for phi to decay at a high energy E_I, even though phi does not oscillate around the minimum of its potential, but it also regenerates phi at an energy E_{BD} \simeq E_I^2 close to present time. It predicts extra relativistic energy and an interacting dark energy which may account for a w<-1. In the model presented here we have E_I \simeq 100 TeV and E_{BD} \simeq 1 eV. The low value of the back decay energy E_{BD} gives an explanation of the coincidence problem.
