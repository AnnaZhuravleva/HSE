The DA white dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as analyzed in the papers for Data Releases 1 and 4, show an increase in surface gravity towards lower effective temperatures below 11500 K. We study the various possible explanations of this effect, from a real increase of the masses to uncertainties or deficiencies of the atmospheric models. No definite answer is found but the tentative conclusion is that it is most likely the current description of convection in the framework of the mixing-length approximation, which leads to this effect.
