Recent observations support the idea that nuclear black holes grew by gas accretion while shining as luminous quasars at high redshift, and they establish a relation of the black hole mass with the host galaxy's spheroidal stellar system. We develop an analytic model to calculate the expected impact of mergers on the masses of black holes in massive clusters of galaxies. We use the extended Press-Schechter formalism to generate Monte Carlo merger histories of halos with a mass 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun. We assume that the black hole mass function at z=2 is similar to that inferred from observations at z=0 (since quasar activity declines markedly at z<2), and we assign black holes to the progenitor halos assuming a monotonic relation between halo mass and black hole mass. We follow the dynamical evolution of subhalos within larger halos, allowing for tidal stripping, the loss of orbital energy by dynamical friction, and random orbital perturbations in gravitational encounters with subhalos, and we assume that mergers of subhalos are followed by mergers of their central black holes. Our analytic model reproduces numerical estimates of the subhalo mass function. We find that the most massive black holes in massive clusters typically grow by a factor ~ 2 by mergers after gas accretion has stopped. In our ten realizations of 10^{15} h^{-1} Msun clusters, the highest initial (z=2) black hole masses are 5-7 x 10^9 Msun, but four of the clusters contain black holes in the range 1-1.5 x 10^{10} Msun at z=0. Satellite galaxies may host black holes whose mass is comparable to, or even greater than, that of the central galaxy. Thus, black hole mergers can significantly extend the very high end of the black hole mass function.
