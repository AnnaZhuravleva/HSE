The supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 75/PSR J1846-0258 association can be regarded as certain due to the accurate location of young PSR J1846-0258 at the center of Kes 75 and the detected bright radio/X-ray synchrotron nebula surrounding the pulsar. We provide a new distance estimate to the SNR/pulsar system by analyzing the HI and $^{13}$CO maps, the HI emission and absorption spectra, and the $^{13}$CO emission spectrum of Kes 75. No absorption features at negative velocities strongly argue against the widely-used large distance of 19 to 21 kpc for Kes 75, and show that Kes 75 is within the Solar circle, i.e. a distance $d<$13.2 kpc. Kes 75 is likely at distance of 5.1 to 7.5 kpc because the highest HI absorption velocity is at 95 km/s and no absorption is associated with a nearby HI emission peak at 102 km/s in the direction of Kes 75. This distance to Kes 75 gives a reasonable luminosity of PSR J1846-0258 and its PWN, and also leads to a much smaller radius for Kes 75. So the age of the SNR is consistent with the spin-down age of PSR J1846-0258, confirming this pulsar as the second-youngest in the Galaxy.
