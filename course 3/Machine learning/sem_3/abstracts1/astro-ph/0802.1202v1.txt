We present Arecibo time-aligned, total intensity profiles for 46 pulsars over an unusually wide range of radio frequencies and multi-frequency, polarization-angle density diagrams and/or polarization profiles for 58 pulsars pulsars at some or all of the frequencies 50, 111/130, 430 and 1400 MHz. The frequency-dependent dispersion delay has been removed In order to align the profiles for study of their spectral evolution and wherever possible the profiles of each pulsar are displayed on the same longitude scale. Most of the pulsars within Arecibo's declination range that are sufficiently bright for such spectral or single pulse analysis are included in this survey--and the calibrated pulse sequences are available by web download for further study.
