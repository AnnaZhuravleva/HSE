With a goal of understanding the conditions under which jets might be produced in novae and related objects, I consider the conditions under which jets are produced from other classes of accreting compact objects. I give an overview of accretion disk spectral states, including a discussion of in which states these jets are seen. I highlight the differences between neutron stars and black holes, which may help give us insights about when and how the presence of a solid surface may help or inhibit jet production.
