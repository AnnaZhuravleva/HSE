IceCube is a cubic kilometer-scale neutrino telescope under construction at the South Pole since the austral summer 2004/2005. At the moment it is taking data with 22 deployed strings. The full detector is expected to be completed in 2011 with up to 80 strings each holding 60 digital optical modules. The progenitor detector AMANDA has been operating at the same site since 1997 and is still running as an integral part of IceCube. A summary of AMANDA science for its 10 years of standalone operations is presented, as well as the status and first physics results of the IceCube project.
