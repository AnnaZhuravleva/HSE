We discuss combining gravitational lensing of galaxies and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by clusters to measure cosmographic distance ratios, and hence dark energy parameters. Advantages to using the CMB as the second source plane, instead of galaxies, include: a well-determined source distance, a longer lever arm for distance ratios, typically up to an order of magnitude higher sensitivity to dark energy parameters, and a decreased sensitivity to photometric redshift accuracy of the lens and galaxy sources. Disadvantages include: higher statistical errors, potential systematic errors, and the need for disparate surveys that overlap on the sky. Ongoing and planned surveys, such as the South Pol Telescope in conjunction with the Dark Energy Survey, can potentially reach the statistical sensitivity to make interesting consistency tests of the standard cosmological constant model. Future measurements that reach 1% or better precision in the convergences can provide sharp tests for future supernovae distance measurements.
