I represent results three-dimensional numerical simulation of solar surface convection on scales local supergranulation with realistic model physics. I study thermal structure of convective motions in photosphere, the range of convection cell sizes and the penetration depths of convection. A portion of the solar photosphere extending 100 x 100 Mm horizontally and from 0 Mm down to 20 Mm below the visible surface is considered. I take equation of state and opacities of stellar matter and distribution with radius of all physical variables from Solar Standard Model. The equations of fully compressible radiation hydrodynamics with dynamical viscosity and gravity are solved. The high order conservative PPML difference scheme for the hydrodynamics, the method of characteristic for the radiative transfer and dynamical viscosity from subgrid scale modeling are applied. The simulations are conducted on a uniform horizontal grid of 1000 x 1000, with 168 nonuniformly spaced vertical grid points, on 256 processors with distributed memory multiprocessors on supercomputer MVS5000 in Computational Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences.
