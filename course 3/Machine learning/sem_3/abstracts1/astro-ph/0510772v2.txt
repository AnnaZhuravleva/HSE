Current spacecraft missions such as Wind and ACE can be used to determine magnetic correlation functions in the solar wind. Data sets from these missions can, in principle, also be used to compute so-called Eulerian correlation functions. These temporal correlations are essential for understanding the dynamics of solar wind turbulence. In the current article we calculate these dynamical correlations by using well-established methods. These results are very useful for a comparison with Eulerian correlations obtained from space craft missions.
