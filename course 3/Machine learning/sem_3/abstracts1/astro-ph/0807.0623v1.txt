Systematic search for multiperiodicity in the LMC Cepheids (Moskalik, Kolaczkowski & Mizerski 2004) has led to discovery of low amplitude nonradial modes in a substantial fraction of overtone pulsators. We present detailed discussion of this new type of multimode Cepheid pulsators and compare them to similar nonradial pulsators discovered among RR Lyrae stars. Finally, we show first detections of secondary nonradial modes in FU/FO double-mode Cepheids.
