The lensing cross section of triaxial halos depends on the relative orientation between a halo's principal axes and its line of sight. Consequently, a lensing subsample of randomly oriented halos is not, in general,randomly oriented. Using an isothermal mass model for the lensing galaxies and their host halos, we show that the lensing subsample of halos that produces doubles is preferentially aligned along the lines of sight, whereas halos that produce quads tend to be projected along their middle axes. These preferred orientations result in different projected ellipticity distributions for quad, doubles, and random galaxies. We show that ~300 lens systems must be discovered to detect this effect at the 95% confidence level. We also investigate the importance of halo shape for predicting the quad-to-double ratio and find that the latter depends quite sensitively on the distribution of the short-to-long axis ratio, but is otherwise nearly independent of halo shape. Finally, we estimate the impact of the preferred orientation of lensing galaxies on their projected substructure mass fraction, and find that the observed alignment between the substructure distribution and the mass distribution of halos result in a negligible bias.
