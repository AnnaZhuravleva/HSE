Dark energy models with a single scalar field cannot cross the equation of state divide set by a cosmological constant. More general models that allow crossing require additional degrees of freedom to ensure gravitational stability. We show that a parameterized post-Friedmann description of cosmic acceleration provides a simple but accurate description of multiple scalar field crossing models. Moreover the prescription provides a well controlled approximation for a wide range of "smooth" dark energy models. It conserves energy and momentum and is exact in the metric evolution on scales well above and below the transition scale to relative smoothness. Standard linear perturbation tools have been altered to include this description and made publicly available for studies of the dark energy involving cosmological structure out to the horizon scale.
