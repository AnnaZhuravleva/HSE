The observation of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources would substantially improve our knowledge and understanding of the non-thermal processes in these sources, and would in particular pinpoint the accelerators of cosmic rays. The sensitivity of different design options for a future cubic-kilometre scale neutrino telescope in the Mediterranean Sea is investigated for generic point sources and in particular for some of the galactic objects from which TeV gamma emmission has recently been observed by the H.E.S.S. atmospheric Cherenkov telescope. The effect of atmospheric background on the source detection probabilities has been taken into account through full simulation. The estimated event rates are compared to previous results and limits from present neutrino telescopes.
