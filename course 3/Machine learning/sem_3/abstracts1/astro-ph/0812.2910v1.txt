Stars in globular clusters (GCs) exhibit a peculiar chemical pattern with strong abundance variations in light elements along with a constant abundance in heavy elements. These abundance anomalies can be explained by a primordial pollution due to a first generation of fast rotating massive stars which released slow winds into the ISM from which a second generation of chemically anomalous stars can be formed. In particular the observed ratio of anomalous and standard stars in clusters can be used to constrain the dynamical evolution of GCs as around 95% of the standard stars need to be lost by the clusters. We show that both residual gas expulsion during the cluster formation and long term evolution are needed to achieve this ratio.
