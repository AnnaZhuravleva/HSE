We perform evolutionary calculations of binary stars to find progenitors of system with parameters similar to the eclipsing binary system V228. We show that a V228 binary system may be formed starting with an initial binary system which has a low main sequence star as an accretor. The initial parameters for the evolutionary model are as follow: $M_{1,i} = 0.88 M_\odot $, $M_{2,i} = 0.85 M_\odot $, $P_i=1.35 $days, $f_1$=0.05, $f_2$=4.65 and Z=0.006 ([Fe/H]=--0.67). We also show that the best fitting model implies loss of about 50 per cent of initial total orbital momentum but only 5 per cent of initial total mass. The less massive component have a small helium core of mass 0.12--0.17$ M_\odot $ and exchange mass in the nuclear time scale.
