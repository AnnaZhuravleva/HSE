The Track Imaging Cerenov Experiment (TrICE) is an air Cerenkov prototype telescope designed to use multi-anode photomultiplier to acheive a high angular resolution for measuring cosmic-ray composition at TeV-PeV energies. The TrICE camera, composed of 16 Hamamatsu R8900 16-channel multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, achieves 0.086 degree angular width per pixel over 1.5 degree wide field of view. We present a description of the TrICE camera design, calibration and performance.
