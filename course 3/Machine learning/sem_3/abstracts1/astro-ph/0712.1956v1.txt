We present the results of photometric observations of SDSS J080434.20+510349.2 in its low state and during an outburst and spectroscopy during the outburst. We found such peculiarities as a long-term outburst with amplitude probably not less than 6m, rarity of the outbursts, eleven rebrightenings, and a short (0.059713(7) d) superhump period. We conclude that this star belongs to the WZ Sge-type subclass of cataclysmic variables. The spectrum shows both emission and absorption lines of H and He superimposed on the blue continuum. We also found 8 -- 9 min. brightness variations during the end of the super-outburst plateau that could be related to pulsations of the white dwarf in the binary.
