We investigate magnetic field amplification in a turbulent velocity field with nonzero helicity, in the framework of the kinematic Kazantsev-Kraichnan model. We present the numerical solution of the model for the practically important case of Kolmogorov distribution of velocity fluctuations, with a large magnetic Reynolds number. We find that in contrast to the nonhelical case where growing magnetic fields are described by a few bound eigenmodes concentrated inside the inertial interval of the velocity field, in the helical case the number of bound eigenmodes considerably increases; moreover, new unbound eigenmodes appear. Both bound and unbound eigenmodes contribute to the large-scale magnetic field. This indicates a limited applicability of the conventional alpha model of a large-scale dynamo action, which captures only unbound modes.
