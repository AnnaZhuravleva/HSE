As part of an ongoing study to determine the distribution of orbital parameters for massive binaries in the Cygnus OB2 Association, we present the orbital solutions for two new single-lined spectroscopic binaries, MT059 (O8V) & MT258 (O8V), and one double-lined eclipsing binary (Schulte 3). We also constrain the orbital elements of three additional double-lined systems (MT252, MT720, MT771). Periods for all systems range from 1.5-19 days and eccentricities range from 0-0.11. The six new OB binary systems bring the total number of multiple systems within the core region of Cyg OB2 to 11. The current sample does not show evidence for a ``twin-heavy'' binary distribution.
