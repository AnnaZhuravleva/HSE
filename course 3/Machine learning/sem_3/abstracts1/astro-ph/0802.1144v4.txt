We have investigated constraints on the coupling between dark matter and the interacting Chaplygin gas. Our results indicate that the coupling constant $c$ between these two entities can take arbitrary values, which can be either positive or negative, thus giving arbitrary freedom to the inter-conversion between Chaplygin gas and dark matter. Thus our results indicate that the restriction $0<c<1$ on the coupling constant occurs as a very special case. Our analysis also supports the existence of phantom energy under certain conditions on the coupling constant.
