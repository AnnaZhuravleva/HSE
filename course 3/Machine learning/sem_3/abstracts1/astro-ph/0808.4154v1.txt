We have studied the relationship between the high- and low-ionization [O IV] lambda 25.89 micron, [Ne III] lambda 15.56 micron and [Ne II] lambda 12.81 micron emission lines with the aim of constraining the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation contributions for a sample of 103 Seyfert galaxies. We used the [O IV] and [Ne II] emission as tracers for the AGN power and star formation to investigate the ionization state of the emission-line gas. We find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have, on average, lower [O IV]/[Ne II] ratios than those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This result suggests two possible scenarios: 1) Seyfert 2 galaxies have intrinsically weaker AGN, or 2) Seyfert 2 galaxies have relatively higher star formation rates than Seyfert 1 galaxies. We estimate the fraction of [Ne II] directly associated with the AGN and find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have a larger contribution from star formation, by a factor of ~1.5 on average, than what is found in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Using the stellar component of [Ne II] as a tracer of the current star formation we found similar star formation rates in Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. We examined the mid- and far-infrared continua and find that [Ne II] is well correlated with the continuum luminosity at 60 micron and that both [Ne III] and [O IV] are better correlated with the 25 micron luminosities than with the continuum at longer wavelengths, suggesting that the mid-infrared continuum luminosity is dominated by the AGN, while the far-infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation. Overall, these results test the unified model of AGN, and suggest that the differences between Seyfert galaxies cannot be solely due to viewing angle dependence.
