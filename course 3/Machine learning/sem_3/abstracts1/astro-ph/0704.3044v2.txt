One interpretation of the unexplained signature observed in the PVLAS experiment invokes a new axion-like particle (ALP) with a two-photon vertex, allowing for photon-ALP oscillations in the presence of magnetic fields. In the range of masses and couplings suggested by PVLAS, the same effect would lead to a peculiar dimming of high-energy photon sources. For typical parameters of the turbulent magnetic field in the galaxy, the effect sets in at E_gamma >~ 10 TeV, providing an ALP signature in the spectra of TeV gamma sources that can be probed with Cherenkov telescopes. A dedicated search will be strongly motivated if the ongoing photon regeneration experiments confirm the PVLAS particle interpretation.
