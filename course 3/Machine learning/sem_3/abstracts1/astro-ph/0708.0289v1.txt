We present detailed analysis of the vertical pulsation mode cross-section in ten rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars based on spectroscopic time-series observations. The aim of this analysis is to derive from observations a complete picture of how the amplitude and phase of magnetoacoustic waves depend on depth. We find common features in the pulsational behaviour of roAp stars. Within a sample of representative elements the lowest amplitudes are detected for Eu II (and Fe in 33 Lib and in HD 19918), then pulsations go through the layers where Halpha core, Nd, and Pr lines are formed. There RV amplitude reaches its maximum, and after that decreases in most stars. The maximum RV of the second REE ions is always delayed relative to the first ions. The largest phase shifts are detected in Tb III and Th III lines. Pulsational variability of the Th III lines is detected here for the first time. The Y II lines deviate from this picture, showing even lower amplitudes than Eu II lines but half a period phase shift relative to other weakly pulsating lines. The roAp stars exhibit similarity in the depth-dependence of pulsation phase and amplitude, indicating similar chemical stratification and comparable vertical mode cross-sections. In general, pulsations waves are represented by a superposition of the running and standing wave components. In the atmospheres of roAp stars with the pulsation frequency below the acoustic cut-off frequency, pulsations have a standing-wave character in the deeper layers and behave like a running wave in the outer layers. Cooler roAp stars develop a running wave higher in the atmosphere. In stars with pulsation frequency close to the acoustic cut-off one, pulsation waves have a running character starting from deep layers. (Abridged)
