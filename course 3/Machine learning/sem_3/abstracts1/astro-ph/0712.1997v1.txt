The properties of outflows powered by massive stars are reviewed with an emphasis on the nearest examples, Orion and Cepheus-A. The Orion OMC1 outflow may have been powered by the dynamical decay of a non-hierarchical massive star system that resulted in the ejection of the BN object, and poossibly radio soruces I and n from the OMC1 core. This interaction must have produced at least one massive binary whose gravitational binding energy ejected the stars and powered the outflow. A specific model for the coupling of this energy to the gas is proposed. The radio source HW2 in the Cep-A region appears to drive a pulsed, precessing jet that may be powered by a moderate-mass companion in an eccentric and inclined orbit. This configuration may be the result of binary formation by capture. These outflows demonstrate that dynamical interactions among massive stars are an important feature of massive star formation.
