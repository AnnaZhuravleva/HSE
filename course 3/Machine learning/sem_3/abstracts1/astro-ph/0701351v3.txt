We examine the origin and evolution of correlations between properties of supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies using simulations of major galaxy mergers, including the effects of gas dissipation, cooling, star formation, and BH accretion and feedback. We demonstrate that the simulations predict the existence of a BH 'fundamental plane' (BHFP), of the form M_BH sigma^(3.0+-0.3)*R_e^(0.43+-0.19) or M_BH M_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations found observationally. The simulations indicate that the BHFP can be understood roughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding energy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven outflow. While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters, progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and other parameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed M_bulge, and therefore changes in the M_BH-sigma or M_BH-M_bulge relations, the BHFP is robust. Given the empirical trend of decreasing R_e for a given M_bulge at high redshift, the BHFP predicts that BHs will be more massive at fixed M_bulge, in good agreement with recent observations. This evolution in the structural properties of merger remnants, to smaller R_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger M_BH, conserving the BHFP) at a given M_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulge progenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts. Adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, our simulations predict the observed trends in both R_e(M_bulge) and M_BH(M_bulge).
