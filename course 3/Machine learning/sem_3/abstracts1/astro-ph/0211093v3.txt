The calibration of the in-flight antenna beam shape and possible beamdegradation is one of the most crucial tasks for the upcoming Planck mission. We examine several effects which could significantly influence the in-flight main beam calibration using planet transit: the problems of the variability of the Jupiter's flux, the antenna temperature and passing of the planets through the main beam. We estimate these effects on the antenna beam shape calibration and calculate the limits on the main beam and far sidelobe measurements, using observations of Jupiter and Saturn. We also discuss possible effects of degradation of the mirror surfaces and specify corresponding parameters which can help us to determine these effects.
