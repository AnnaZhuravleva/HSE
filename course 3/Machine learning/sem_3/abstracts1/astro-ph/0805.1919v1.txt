(ABRIDGED) We investigate here the XLF of absorbed (Nh between 4E21 and E24 cm-2) and unabsorbed (Nh < 4E21 cm-2) AGN, the fraction of absorbed AGN as a function of Lx (and z), the intrinsic Nh distribution of the AGN population, and the XLF of Compton Thick (Nh > E24 cm-2) AGN. To carry out this investigation we have used the XMM-Newton Hard Bright Serendipitous Sample (HBSS) a complete sample of bright X-ray sources (fx > 7E-14 cgs) at high galactic latitude (|b| > 20 deg) selected in the 4.5-7.5 keV energy band. The HBSS sample is now almost completely identified (97% spectroscopic ID) and it can be safely used for a statistical investigation. The HBSS contains 62 AGN out of which 40 are unabsorbed (or marginally absorbed; Nh < 4E21 cm-2) and 22 are absorbed (Nh between 4E21 and E24 cm-2). Absorbed and unabsorbed AGN are characterized by two different XLF with the absorbed AGN population being described by a steeper XLF, if compared with the unabsorbed ones, at all luminosities. The intrinsic fraction F of absorbed AGN with L(2-10 keV) > 3E42 cgs is 0.57+/-0.11; we find that F decreases with the intrinsic luminosity, and probably, increases with the redshift. Our data are consistent with a flat Log Nh distribution for Nh between E20 and E24 cm-2. Finally, by comparing the results obtained here with those obtained using an optically selected sample of AGN we derive, in an indirect way, the XLF of Compton Thick AGN. The density ratio between Compton Thick AGN (Nh > E24 cm-2) and Compton Thin AGN (Nh < E24 cm-2) decreases from 1.08+/-0.44 at Lx E43 cgs to 0.23+/-0.15 at Lx E45 cgs.
