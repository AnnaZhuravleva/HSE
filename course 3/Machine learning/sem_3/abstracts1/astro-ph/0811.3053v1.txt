A distribution of the meter-wave luminous objects, which are bright at frequency 74 MHz (a wavelength of 4 m) but not detectable at 1.4 GHz (21 cm) in the VLA surveys, shows a notable concentration in a scale of a few degrees toward Monoceros [(l, b)=(225, 4)]. We argue that it is a part of giant radio relics associated with a nearby cluster of galaxies with cz~2400$ km s^{-1} centered on the spiral galaxy NGC 2377. The angular separation of these objects from the clustering center is consistent with the separation of distant relics to the cluster center if scaled by distance. This fact implies that the concentrations of meter-wave luminous objects can be used as a tracer of the structure of the Local Supercluster and it's vicinity.
