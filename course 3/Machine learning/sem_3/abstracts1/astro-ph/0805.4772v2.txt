We associate 132 low-mass ultracool dwarfs in the southern hemisphere as candidate members of five moving groups using photometric and astrometric selection techniques. Of these objects, we present high resolution spectroscopy for seven candidates and combine these with previous measurements from the literature to determine spectral types and radial velocities. We thus constrain distance and space motion spectroscopically, allowing the kinematic membership of the moving groups to be assessed. Possible membership of moving groups has allowed ages and metallicities to be constrained for these objects and evolutionary models have been used to estimate their mass. We estimate that up to ~75 of our candidate moving group members should be genuine, and discuss future work that will confirm and exploit this major new sample.
