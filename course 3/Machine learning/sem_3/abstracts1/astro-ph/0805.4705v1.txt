The CRESST-II experiment is introduced. It uses scintillating crystals as a target to search for elastic scatterings of dark matter particles. The detectors are operated in a dilution cryostat at temperatures below 30mK, and for each particle interaction, the phonon signal as well as the scintillation light signal are recorded. Recent results from a commissioning run following a major upgrade are presented. The current limit that can be placed on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-section is below 6x10-7 pb for WIMPs in the mass range from about 40 to 90 GeV/c2.
