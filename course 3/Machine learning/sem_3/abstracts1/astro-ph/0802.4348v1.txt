Thanks to the ever increasing computational power and the development of more sophisticated algorithms, numerical N-body simulations are now uncovering several phenomenological relations between the physical properties of dark matter haloes in position and velocity space. It is the aim of the present work to investigate in detail the dynamical structure of dark matter haloes, as well as its possible dependence on mass and its evolution with redshift up to z=5. We use high-resolution cosmological simulations of individual objects to compute the radially-averaged profiles of several quantities, scaled by the radius Rmax at which the circular velocity attains its maximum value, Vmax. No systematic dependence on mass or cosmic epoch are found within Rmax, and all the different radial profiles are well fit by simple analytical models. However, our results suggest that several properties are not `universal' outside this radius. [Abridged]
