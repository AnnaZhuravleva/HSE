We consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). Current models for the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will be reionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitors of massive lower-redshift galaxies. As a result, the stellar populations observed in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hence brighter in overdense regions of the Universe. Galaxy surveys would therefore be sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdense regions. The corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxies can be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. We model this process using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. Our model demonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clustering properties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formation properties. The bias correction in Lyman-break galaxies (including those in proposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z<1) is at the level of 10-20% for a halo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in the halo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. The reionization of helium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxy correlation function at z~3. We find that the reionization bias is approximately independent of scale and halo mass. However since the traditional galaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively more important for lower mass systems. The correction to the bias due to reionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z<1.
