For the last 25 years, the 21 cm line has been used productively to investigate the large-scale structure of the Universe, its peculiar velocity field and the measurement of cosmic parameters. In February 2005 a blind HI survey that will cover 7074 square degrees of the high latitude sky was started at Arecibo, using the 7-beam feed L-band feed array (ALFA). Known as the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) Survey, the program is producing a census of HI-bearing objects over a cosmologically significant volume of the local Universe. With respect to previous blind HI surveys, ALFALFA offers an improvement of about one order of magnitude in sensitivity, 4 times the angular resolution, 3 times the spectral resolution, and 1.6 times the total bandwidth of HIPASS. ALFALFA can detect 7 X 10**4 D**2 solar masses of HI, where D is the source distance in Mpc. As of mid 2007, 44% of the survey observations and 15% of the source extraction are completed. We discuss the status of the survey and present a few preliminary results, in particular with reference to the proposed "dark galaxy" VirgoHI21.
