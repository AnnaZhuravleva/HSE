Direct detection of a planet around a star in the mid-IR, requires a nulling interferometer featuring an achromatic phase shift of pi on broad range. A new concept for designing such an achromatic phase shifter is presented here. The major interest of this solution is that it allows a simple design, with essentially one device per beam. The heart of the system consists in two cellular mirrors where each cell has a thickness introducing for the central wavelength, a phase shift of (2k+1)pi or of 2k pi on the fraction of the wave it reflects. Each mirror is put in one of the collimated beams of the interferometer. Because of the odd/even distribution, when recombining the two beams, a destructive interference is produced on axis for the central wavelength . If the distribution of cells thickness follows a rather simple law, based on the Pascal's triangle, then the nulling is also efficient for a wavelength not too far from the central wavelength. For instance, with two mirrors of 64x64 cells, one reaches a nulling of 1.e-6 on more than one complete octave. This could satisfy the specifications of space mission as Darwin. We also show the way to distribute the cells in the plane of the pupil for the optimum isolation of the planet image from the residual. We present the nulling performances of those various configurations.
