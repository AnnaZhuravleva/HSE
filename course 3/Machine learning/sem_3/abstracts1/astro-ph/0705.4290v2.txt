We present the results of the Gemini Deep Planet Survey, a near-infrared adaptive optics search for giant planets and brown dwarfs around nearby young stars. The observations were obtained with the Altair adaptive optics system at the Gemini North telescope and angular differential imaging was used to suppress the speckle noise of the central star. Detection limits for the 85 stars observed are presented, along with a list of all faint point sources detected around them. Typically, the observations are sensitive to angular separations beyond 0.5" with 5-sigma contrast sensitivities in magnitude difference at 1.6 micron of 9.5 at 0.5", 12.9 at 1", 15.0 at 2", and 16.5 at 5". For the typical target of the survey, a 100 Myr old K0 star located 22 pc from the Sun, the observations are sensitive enough to detect planets more massive than 2 Mjup with a projected separation in the range 40-200 AU. Second epoch observations of 48 stars with candidates (out of 54) have confirmed that all candidates are unrelated background stars. A detailed statistical analysis of the survey results, yielding upper limits on the fractions of stars with giant planet or low mass brown dwarf companions, is presented. Assuming a planet mass distribution dN/dm m^{-1.2} and a semi-major axis distribution dN/da a^{-1}, the 95% credible upper limits on the fraction of stars with at least one planet of mass 0.5-13 Mjup are 0.28 for the range 10-25 AU, 0.13 for 25-50 AU, and 0.093 for 50-250 AU. The 95% credible interval for the fraction of stars with at least one brown dwarf companion having a semi-major axis in the range 25-250 AU is 0.019 (-0.015/+0.083), irrespective of any assumption on the mass and semi-major axis distributions. The stars HD 14802, HD 166181, and HD 213845 have been resolved into binaries for the first time.
