In the previous parts of the discussion on the same topic, various aspects of the very early universe were discussed. We discussed how inclusion of large dark energy term compensates for the net gravity. Here the discussion is taken further including the effects of charge, magnetic fields and rotation. The role of large extra dimensions under the extreme initial conditions is discussed and possible connection with the cyclic brane theory is explored. We constrain various cosmic quantities like the net charge, number density of magnetic monopoles, primordial magnetic fields, size of the extra dimensions,etc.
