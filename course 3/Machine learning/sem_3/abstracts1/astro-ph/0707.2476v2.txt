We interest in the case of a main-sequence star deeply penetrating within the tidal radius of a massive black hole. We focus on the compression phase leading to a so-called pancake configuration of the star at the instant of maximal compression. The aim is to study the tidal compression process paying particular attention to the development of shock waves;to deduce reliable estimates of the thermodynamical quantities involved in the pancake star; and to solve a controversy about whether or not thermonuclear reactions can be triggered in the core of a tidally compressed star. We have set up a one-dimensional hydrodynamical model well-adapted to the geometry of the problem. Based on the high-resolution shock-capturing Godunov-type approach, it allows to study the compression phase undergone by the star in the direction orthogonal to its orbital plane. We show the existence of two regimes depending on whether shock waves develop before or after the instant of maximal core compression. In both cases we confirm high compression and heating factors in the stellar core able to trigger a thermonuclear explosion. Moreover, we show that the shock waves carry outwards a brief but very high peak of temperature from the centre to the surface of the star. We tentatively conclude that the phenomenon could give rise to hard electromagnetic radiation, to be compared to some X-ray flares already observed in some galactic nuclei harbouring massive black holes. Finally, we estimate that the rate of pancake stars should be about $10^{-5}$ per galaxy per year. If generated in hard X- or $\gamma$-ray band, several events of this kind per year should be detectable within the full observable universe.
