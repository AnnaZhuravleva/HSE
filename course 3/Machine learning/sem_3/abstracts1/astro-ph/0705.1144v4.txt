The Self-Similar Secondary Infall Model (SSIM) is modified to simulate a merger event. The model encompass spherical versions of tidal stripping and dynamical friction that agrees with the Syer & White merger paradigm's behaviour. The SSIM shows robustness in absorbing even comparable mass perturbations and returning to its original state. It suggests the approach to be invertible and allows to consider accretion as smooth mass inflow merging and mergers as intermittent mass inflow accretion.
