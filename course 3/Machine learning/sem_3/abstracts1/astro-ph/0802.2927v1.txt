Based on a model for the emission of high energy cosmic rays from AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) that has been proposed by the author, he reviews the status of the GZK cutoff and the correlation of high energy cosmic ray sources with AGN locations in the existing data. The determination of mass for the incident particles seems to be a key factor, and a suggestion for doing that has been made in this article.
