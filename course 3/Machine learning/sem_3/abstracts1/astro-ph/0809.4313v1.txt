In our previous paper (Masiero et al. 2007) we presented the design and initial calibrations of the Dual-Beam Imaging Polarimeter (DBIP), a new optical instrument for the University of Hawaii's 2.2 m telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. In this followup work we discuss our full-Stokes mode commissioning including crosstalk determination and our typical observing methodology.
