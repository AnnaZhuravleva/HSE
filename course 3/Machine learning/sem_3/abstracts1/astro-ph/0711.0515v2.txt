We present a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the thermal composite supernova remnant Kes 27 with Chandra. The X-ray spectrum of Kes 27 is characterized by K lines from Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca. The X-ray emitting gas is found to be enriched in sulphur and calcium. The broadband and tri-color images show two incomplete shell-like features in the northeastern half and brightness fading with increasing radius in the southwest. There are over 30 unresolved sources within the remnant. None show characteristics typical of young neutron stars. The maximum diffuse X-ray intensity coincides with a radio bright region along the eastern border. In general, gas in the inner region is at higher temperature and emission is brighter than from the outer region. The gas in the remnant appears to approach ionization equilibrium. The overall morphology can be explained by the evolution of the remnant in an ambient medium with a density enhancement from west to east. We suggest that the remnant was born in a pre-existing cavity and that the inner bright emission is due to the reflection of the initial shock from the dense cavity wall. This scenario may provide a new candidate mechanism for the X-ray morphology of other thermal composite supernova remnants.
