We summarise some basic issues relevant to the optimisation and design of space-based experiments for the observation of the Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Particles interacting with the atmosphere. A number of basic relations is derived and discussed with a twofold goal: defining requirements for the experimental apparatus and estimating the exptected performance.
