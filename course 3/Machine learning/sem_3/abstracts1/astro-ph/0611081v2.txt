GRB061007 is the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) to be detected by Swift and is accompanied by an exceptionally luminous afterglow that had a V-band magnitude <11.1 at 80s after the prompt emission. From the start of the Swift observations the afterglow decayed as a power law with a slope of \alpha_X=1.66+/-0.01 in the X-ray and \alpha_{opt}=1.64+/-0.01 in the UV/optical, up to the point that it was no longer detected above background in the optical or X-ray bands. The brightness of this GRB and the similarity in the decay rate of the X-ray, optical and gamma-ray emission from 100s after the trigger distinguish this burst from others and present a challenge to the fireball model. The lack of a cooling or jet break in the afterglow up to \~10^5s constrains any model that can produce the large luminosity observed in GRB061007, which we found to require either an excessively large kinetic energy or highly collimated outflow. Analysis of the multi-wavelength spectral and high-resolution temporal data taken with Swift suggest an early time jet-break to be a more plausible scenario. This must have occurred within 80s of the prompt emission, which places an upper limit on the jet opening angle of \theta_j=0.8deg. Such a highly collimated outflow resolves the energy budget problem presented in a spherical emission model, reducing the isotropic equivalent energy of this burst to E_{\gamma}^{corr}=10^{50} ergs; consistent with other GRBs.
