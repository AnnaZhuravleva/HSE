The properties of the brightest resolved stars in an arc that was originally identified by Sun et al. (2005) and is located in the extraplanar regions of M82 are discussed. The stars form an elongated structure that is traced over a projected area of 3.0 x 0.8 kpc. The integrated brightness is M_V ~ -11, while the total stellar mass is between 3 x 10^5 and 2 x 10^6 solar masses. If there is only foreground extinction then the youngest stars have a metallicity Z > 0.008 and an age log(tyears) ~ 7.75; thus, the youngest stars formed at roughly the same time as stars in tidal features that are associated with other M81 Group galaxies. If the arc is dispersing then it will deposit young, chemically enriched stars into the M82 halo.
