While testing a Stromgren spectrophotometer attached to the 1.5-m telescope at the San Pedro Martir observatory, Mexico, a number of A-type stars were observed, one of which, HD 207331, presented clear indications of photometric variability. CCD photometric data acquired soon after, confirmed its variability. In order to determine its pulsation behaviour more accurately, uvby differential photoelectric photometry was carried out for three nights. As a result of the period analysis of the light curves we have found a dominant pulsation mode at 21.1 c/d with an amplitude of 6 mmag. This strongly suggests that HD 207331 is a new Delta Scuti-type pulsating star.
