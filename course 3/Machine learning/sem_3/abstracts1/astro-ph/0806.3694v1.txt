Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources are probably the precursors of local radio galaxies.Existing GPS source samples are small (<200). It is necessary to extend the availabe sample of the Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and High Frequency Peaker (HFP) sources in order to study their nature with greater details and higher statistical significance. A sample of 214 radio sources, which were extracted from the SPECFIND catalog and show an inverted radio spectrum, were observed quasi-simultaneously at 4.85, 10.45, and 32GHz with the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope. Using the VLBA calibrator survey (VCS) we have investigated the parsec-scale morphology of the sources. About 45% of the sources in our sample are classified as GPS or HFP candidates. We add 65 new GPS/HFP candidates to existing samples. We confirm the expected tendency that HFP are more compact on milliarcsecond scale than the 'classical' GPS sources, which peak at lower frequencies. The data mining of the SPECFIND database represents a promising tool for the discovery of new GPS/HFP sources.
