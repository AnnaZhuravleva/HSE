The orbital eccentricity of a single planet around a component of a stellar binary system with a sufficiently large mutual inclination angle is known to oscillate on a secular timescale through the Kozai mechanism. We have investigated the effects of the Kozai mechanism on double-planet systems in binaries. The evolutionary sequence of a pair of planets under the influence of a binary companion is fairly complex. Various dynamical outcomes are seen in numerical simulations. One interesting outcome is the rigid rotation of the planetary orbits in which the planetary orbital planes secularly precess in concert, while the orbital eccentricities oscillate synchronously. In such cases the outer planet acts as a propagator of the perturbation from the binary companion to the inner planet and drives the inner planetary orbit to precess at a rate faster than what is predicted by the Kozai mechanism.
