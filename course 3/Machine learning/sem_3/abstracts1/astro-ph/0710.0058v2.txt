The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) three year results are used to constraint non-minimal inflation models. Two different non-minimally coupled scalar field potentials are considered to calculate corresponding slow-roll parameters of non-minimal inflation. The results of numerical analysis of parameter space are compared with WMAP3 data to find appropriate new constraints on the values of the non-minimal coupling. A detailed comparison of our results with previous studies reveals the present status of the non-minimal inflation model after WMAP3.
