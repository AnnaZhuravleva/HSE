Neutron star matter is investigated in a hadronic chiral model approach using the lowest flavor-SU(3) multiplets for baryons and mesons. The parameters are determined to yield consistent results for saturated nuclear matter as well as for finite nuclei. The influence of baryonic resonances is discussed. The global properties of a neutron star such as its mass and radius are determined. Proto-neutron star properties are studied by taking into account trapped neutrinos, temperature and entropy effects.
