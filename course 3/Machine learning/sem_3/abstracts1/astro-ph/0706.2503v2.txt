The inflationary flow equations are a frequently used method of surveying the space of inflationary models. In these applications the infinite hierarchy of differential equations is truncated in a way which has been shown to be equivalent to restricting the set of models considered to those characterized by polynomial inflaton potentials. This paper explores a different method of solving the flow equations, which does not truncate the hierarchy and in consequence covers a much wider class of models while retaining the practical usability of the standard approach.
