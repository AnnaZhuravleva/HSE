An important question about Be stars is whether Be stars are born as Be stars or not. It is necessary to observe young clusters to answer this question. Observations of stars in NGC6611 and the star-formation region of Eagle Nebula have been carried out with the ESO-WFI in slitless spectroscopic mode and at the VLT-GIRAFFE. The targets for the GIRAFFE observations were pre-selected from the literature and our catalogue of emission-line stars (ELS) based on the WFI study. GIRAFFE observations allowed us to study accurately the population of the early-type stars with and without emission lines. For this study, we determined the fundamental parameters of OBA stars. We also studied the status of the objects (main sequence or pre-main sequence stars) by using IR data, membership probabilities, and location in HR diagrams. The nature of the early-type ELS in M16 is derived. The slitless observations with the WFI clearly indicate a small number of ELS in M16. We observed with GIRAFFE 101 OBA stars, among them 9 are ELS with circumstellar emission in Halpha. We found that: W080 could be a new He-strong star, like W601. W301 is a possible classical Be star, W503 is a mass-transfer eclipsing binary with an accretion disk, and the other ones are possible Herbig Ae/Be stars. We also found that the rotational velocities of main sequence B stars are 18% lower than those of pre-main sequence B stars, in good agreement with theory about the evolution of rotational velocities. Combining different indications and technics, we found that 27% of the B-type stars are binaries. We also redetermined the age of NGC6611 found equal to 1.2--1.8 Myears in good agreement with the most recent determinations.
