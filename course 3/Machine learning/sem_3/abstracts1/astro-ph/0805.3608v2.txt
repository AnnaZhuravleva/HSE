SAX J1748.2$-$2808 is a unique X-ray object with a flat spectrum and strong emission lines at 6.4--7.0 keV. The Suzaku satellite resolved the emission lines into 3 K-shell lines from neutral and highly ionized irons. A clear coherent pulsation with a period of 593-sec was found from the Suzaku and XMM-Newton archives. These facts favor that SAX J1748.2$-$2808 isan intermediate polar, a subclass of magnetized white dwarf binary (cataclysmic variable: CV). This paper reports on details of the findings and discusses the origin of this source.
