One of the interesting features of Ultraluminous X-ray sources is that many of them are surrounded by luminous nebulae exhibiting diverse observational properties. In different cases the nebulae are photoionized or shock-powered. Generally, the two energy sources appear to coexist. ULX bubble nebulae may be considered a new class of shock-powered nebulae similar to upscaled versions of stellar wind bubbles. Their expansion rates support constant energy influx rather than single powerful events like Hypernova explosions.
