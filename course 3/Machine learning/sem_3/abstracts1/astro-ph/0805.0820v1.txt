Searching the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) and its northern extension, we detected a population of very compact high-velocity clouds (HVCs) with similar velocities in the Galactic standard-of-rest frame which appear to be arranged in several filaments aligned with the nearby Magellanic Stream. A comparison with published OVI/CaII absorption and HI emission line measurements suggests that the HVCs are condensations within an extended and mainly ionised component of the Magellanic Stream. They coincide in position with a faint gas stream predicted in numerical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds by Gardiner & Noguchi (1996). Consequently, the Magellanic Stream could be much more extended than generally believed.
