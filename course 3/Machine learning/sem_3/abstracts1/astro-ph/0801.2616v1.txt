We present a preliminary analysis of ASTRO-F data of a complete sample of ~150 EROs (R-K>5) down to K(Vega)<19, for which reliable photometric redshifts are available, in the range 0.8<z<2, selected over two fields (S7 and S2) of the MUNICS survey. The area covered is about 420 arcmin^2. We have imaged this area with AKARI telescope in N3 (3.4 micron), N60 (65 micron) and WL (150 micron) down to 12 microJy in the N3 filter, in order to detect the rest frame H or K-band emission, thus providing an excellent sampling of the SED of our EROs. From a first analysis we have an identification rate of ~63% in the N3 filter over the S7 field. These data allow us to distinguish starburst from passive early type phenomena, to meseaure the SFR of the starburst component and to constrain the mass assembly of early type galaxies.
