We demonstrate the feasibility of uncovering supermassive black holes in late-type, quiescent spiral galaxies by detecting signs of very low-level nuclear activity. We use a combination of x-ray selection and multi-wavelength follow-up. Here, we apply this technique to NGC 3184 and NGC 5457, both of type Scd, and show that strong arguments can be made that both host AGNs.
