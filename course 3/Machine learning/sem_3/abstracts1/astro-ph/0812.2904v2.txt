We present a comprehensive treatment of the spectrum of electric dipole emission from spinning dust grains, updating the commonly used model of Draine and Lazarian. Grain angular velocity distributions are computed using the Fokker-Planck equation; we revisit the drift and diffusion coefficients for the major torques on the grain, including collisions, grain-plasma interactions, and infrared emission. We use updated grain optical properties and size distributions. The theoretical formalism is implemented in the companion code, SPDUST, which is publicly available. The effect of some environmental and grain parameters on the emissivity is shown and analysed.
