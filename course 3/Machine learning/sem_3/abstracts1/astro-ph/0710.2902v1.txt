We report on our initial analysis of a deep 510 ks observation of the Galactic oxygen-rich supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 with the {\it Chandra X-ray Observatory}. Our new {\it Chandra} ACIS-I observation has a larger field of view and an order of magnitude deeper exposure than the previous {\it Chandra} observation, which allows us to cover the entire SNR and to detect new metal-rich ejecta features. We find a highly non-uniform distribution of thermodynamic conditions of the X-ray emitting hot gas that correlates well with the optical [O {\small III}] emission, suggesting the possibility that the originating supernova explosion of G292.0+1.8 was itself asymmetric. We also reveal spectacular substructures of a torus, a jet, and an extended central compact nebula all associated with the embedded pulsar J1124$-$5916.
