We report the detection of correlated anisotropies in the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background at 160 microns. We measure the power spectrum in the Spitzer/SWIRE Lockman Hole field. It reveals unambiguously a strong excess above cirrus and Poisson contributions, at spatial scales between 5 and 30 arcminutes, interpreted as the signature of infrared galaxy clustering. Using our model of infrared galaxy evolution we derive a linear bias b=1.74 \pm 0.16. It is a factor 2 higher than the bias measured for the local IRAS galaxies. Our model indicates that galaxies dominating the 160 microns correlated anisotropies are at z~1. This implies that infrared galaxies at high redshifts are biased tracers of mass, unlike in the local Universe.
