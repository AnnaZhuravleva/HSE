We have studied the relationship between the [O IV] lambda 25.89 micron emission line luminosities, obtained from Spitzer spectra, the X-ray continua in the 2-10 keV band, primarily from ASCA, and the 14-195 keV band obtained with the SWIFT/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), for a sample of nearby (z < 0.08) Seyfert galaxies. For comparison, we have examined the relationship between the [O III] 5007, the 2-10 keV and the 14-195 keV luminosities for the same set of objects. We find that both the [O IV] and [O III] luminosities are well-correlated with the BAT luminosities. On the other hand, the [O III] luminosities are better-correlated with 2-10 keV luminosities than are those of [O IV]. When comparing [O IV] and [O III] luminosities for the different types of galaxies, we find that the Seyfert 2's have significantly lower [O III] to [O IV] ratios than the Seyfert 1's. We suggest that this is due to more reddening of the narrow line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2's. Assuming Galactic dust to gas ratios, the average amount of extra reddening corresponds to a hydrogen column density of ~ few times 10^21 cm^-2, which is a small fraction of the X-ray absorbing columns in the Seyfert 2's. The combined effects of reddening and the X-ray absorption are the probable reason why the [O III] versus 2-10 keV correlation is better than the [O IV] versus 2-10 keV, since the [O IV] emission line is much less affected by extinction. Overall, we find the [O IV] to be an accurate and truly isotropic indicator of the power of the AGN. This suggests that it can be useful in deconvolving the contribution of the AGN and starburst to the spectrum of Compton-thick and/or X-ray weak sources.
