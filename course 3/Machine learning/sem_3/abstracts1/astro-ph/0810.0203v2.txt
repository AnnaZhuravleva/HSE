We study the global stability of non-axisymmetric p-modes (also called inertial-acoustic modes) trapped in the inner-most regions of accretion discs around black holes. We show that the lowest-order (highest-frequency) p-modes, with frequencies $\omega=(0.5-0.7) m\Omega_{\rm ISCO}$, can be overstable due to general relativistic effects, according to which the radial epicyclic frequency is a non-monotonic function of radius near the black hole. The mode is trapped inside the corotation resonance radius and carries a negative energy. The mode growth arises primarily from wave absorption at the corotation resonance, and the sign of the wave absorption depends on the gradient of the disc vortensity. When the mode frequency is sufficiently high, such that the slope of the vortensity is positive at corotation positive wave energy is absorbed at the resonance, leading to the growth of mode amplitude. We also study how the rapid radial inflow at the inner edge of the disc affects the mode trapping and growth. Our analysis of the behavior of the fluid perturbations in the transonic flow near the ISCO indicates that, while the inflow tends to damp the mode, the damping effect is sufficiently small under some conditions so that net mode growth can still be achieved. We further clarify the role of the Rossby wave instability and show that it does not operate for black hole accretion discs with smooth-varying vortensity profiles. Overstable non-axisymmetric p-modes driven by the corotational instability provide a plausible explanation for the high-frequency (> 100 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed from a number of black-hole X-ray binaries in the very high state. The absence of HFQPOs in the soft (thermal) state may result from mode damping due to the radial infall at the ISCO.
