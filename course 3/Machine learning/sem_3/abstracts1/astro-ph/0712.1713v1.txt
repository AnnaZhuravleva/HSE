An inflationary single field model with a non-trivial kinetic term for the inflaton is discussed. It is shown that it is possible to have large primordial non-gaussianities and large tensor-to-scalar ratio in a simple concrete model with just a scalar field and a generalized kinetic term for the inflaton field. This is potentially interesting in the prospect of new forthcoming observations.
