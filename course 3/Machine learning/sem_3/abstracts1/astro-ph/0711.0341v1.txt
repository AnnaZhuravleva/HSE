ASPID stands for the "Archive of Spectral, Photometric, and Interferometric Data". The world largest collection of raw 3D spectroscopic observations of galactic and extragalactic sources is provided. ASPID-SR is a prototype of an archive of heterogeneous science ready data, fed by ASPID, where we try to exploit all the power of the IVOA Characterisation Data Model. Multi-level Characterisation metadata is provided for every dataset. The archive provides powerful metadata query mechanism with access to every data model element, vital for the efficient scientific usage of a complex informational system. We provide a set of access interfaces: SIAP/SSAP, HTTP-based characterisation metadata query, Web-service accepting ADQL/x.
