We present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical spectra, for the normal type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005cf. From the well-sampled light curves, we find that SN 2005cf reached a B-band maximum at 13.63+/-0.02 mag, with an observed luminosity decline rate dm_15(B) = 1.05+/-0.03 mag. The correlations between the decline rate and various color indexes, recalibrated on the basis of an expanded SN Ia sample, yielded E(B-V)_host=0.09+/-0.03 mag for SN2005cf. The UV photometry was obtained with the HST and the Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, and the results match each other to within 0.1-0.2 mag. The UV light curves show similar evolution to the broadband U, with an exception in the 2000-2500 Angstrom spectral range (corresponding to the F220W/uvm2 filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainter than that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution). Combining the UV data with the ground-based optical and NIR data, we establish the generic UV-optical-NIR bolometric light curve for SN 2005cf and derive the bolometric corrections in the absence of UV and/or NIR data. The overall spectral evolution of SN 2005cf is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but with variety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines. The spectra at early times displayed strong, detached high-velocity (HV) features in the Ca II H&K doublet and NIR triplet. Similar HV features may exist in the SiII 6355 absorption line which evolved rapidly from a flat-bottomed feature in the earliest phase to a triangular shape one week before maximum, and may be common in other normal SNe Ia. The possible origin of the HV absorption features is briefly discussed (abridged).
