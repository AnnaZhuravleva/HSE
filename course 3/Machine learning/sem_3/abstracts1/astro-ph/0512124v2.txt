The Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) model has a self-accelerating solution, the positive branch, where the brane is asymptotically de Sitter. A de Sitter space-time can be seen as a boundary between quintessence-like behaviour and phantom-like behaviour. We show that in a 5D dilatonic bulk, where the dilaton has an exponential potential, with an induced gravity term on the brane, whose matter content corresponds only to vacuum energy, the positive branch solution undergoes a phantom-like stage where it faces a curvature singularity in its infinite future. The singularity can be interpreted as the ``big rip'' singularity pushed towards an infinite future cosmic time. The phantom-like behaviour on the brane occurs without violating the null energy condition. There is another solution, the negative branch, where the brane can undergo an early-epoch (transient) inflationary phase induced by the dilaton field.
