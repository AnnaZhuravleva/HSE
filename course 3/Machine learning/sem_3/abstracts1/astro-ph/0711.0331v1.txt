We present results from magneto-hydrodynamic jet simulations in the magnetically dominated regime and find that they inflate cavities into the intracluster medium. Mock Chandra X-ray observations of our simulations show a strong resemblance to real cavities observed in X-ray images of clusters, both in terms of their morphology and thermodynamic structure. An analysis of the evolution of bubble sizes in the multi-cavity system Hydra A, as well as in a large sample of 64 cavities in 32 clusters shows that bubbles tend to expand much faster than expected in the purely adiabatic regime. Instead, we find that the bubbles follow more closely a trend predicted by our current-carrying jet models.
