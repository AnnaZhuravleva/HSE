Using the infrared photometry data extracted from the 2MASS, IRAS and MSX databases, 50 suspected young stellar objects (YSOs) are selected from about 37500 infrared objects in the 3x3 deg area with the center at Galactic longitude 142.5 deg and latitude +1.0 deg, in the vicinity of the young stellar object GL 490 in the dark cloud DoH 942 (Dobashi et al. 2005). The spectral energy distributions between 700 nm and 100 mum suggest that most of the selected objects may be YSOs of classes I and II. In the color-magnitude diagram K_s vs. H-K_s the suspected YSOs occupy an area right of the main sequence what can be interpreted as being caused by the effects of luminosity, interstellar and circumstellar reddening and infrared thermal emission in circumstellar envelopes and disks.
