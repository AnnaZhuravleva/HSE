We present a study of the distribution of AGN in clusters of galaxies with a uniformly selected, spectroscopically complete sample of 35 AGN in eight clusters at z = 0.06 to 0.31. We find that the 12 AGN with L_X > 10^42 erg/s in galaxies more luminous than a rest-frame M_R < -20 mag are more centrally concentrated than typical cluster galaxies of this luminosity, although these AGN have comparable velocity and substructure distributions to other cluster members. In contrast, a larger sample of 30 cluster AGN with L_X > 10^41 erg/s do not show evidence for greater concentration than inactive members, nor evidence for a different kinematic or substructure distribution. As we do see clear differences in the spatial and kinematic distributions of the blue Butcher-Oemler and red galaxy populations, any difference in the AGN and inactive galaxy population must be less distinct than that between these two pairs of populations. Comparison of the AGN fraction selected via X-ray emission in this study to similarly-selected AGN in the field indicates that the AGN fraction is not significantly lower in clusters, contrary to AGN identified via visible-wavelength emission lines, but similar to the approximately constant radio-selected AGN fraction in clusters and the field. We also find significant evidence for variation between clusters and explore the dependence of cluster AGN fraction on redshift, velocity dispersion, cluster substructure, and Butcher-Oemler fraction. While we see weak evidence for several trends, correlations between these four parameters in our small sample precludes identification of which one(s) most strongly influence the cluster AGN fraction.
