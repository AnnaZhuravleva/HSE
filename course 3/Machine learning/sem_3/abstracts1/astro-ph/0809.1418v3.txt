We present an overview of the formation of Jupiter and its associated circumplanetary disk. Jupiter forms via a combination of planetesimal accretion and gravitational accumulation of gas from the surrounding solar nebula. The formation of the circumjovian gaseous disk, or subnebula, straddles the transitional stage between runaway gas accretion and Jupiter's eventual isolation from the solar disk. This isolation, which effectively signals the termination of Jupiter's accretion, takes place as Jupiter opens a deep gas gap in the solar nebula, or the solar nebula gas dissipates. We describe the conditions for accretion of the Galilean satellites, including the timescales for their formation, and mechanisms for their survival, all within the context of key constraints for satellite formation models. The environment in which the regular satellites form is tied to the timescale for circumplanetary disk dispersal, which depends on the nature and persistence of turbulence. In the case that subnebula turbulence decays as gas inflow wanes, we present a novel mechanism for satellite survival involving gap opening by the largest satellites. On the other hand, assuming that sustained turbulence drives subnebula evolution on a short timescale compared to the satellite formation timescale, we review a model that emphasizes collisional processes to explain satellite observations. We briefly discuss the mechanisms by which solids may be delivered to the circumplanetary disk. However, we expect that planetesimal delivery mechanisms likely provide the bulk of material for satellite accretion.
