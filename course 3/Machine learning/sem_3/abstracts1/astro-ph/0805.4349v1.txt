The study of transient and variable low-frequency radio sources is a key goal for LOFAR, with an extremely broad science case ranging from relativistic jets sources to pulsars, exoplanets, radio bursts at cosmological distances, the identification of gravitational wave sources and even SETI. In this paper we will very briefly summarize the science of the LOFAR Transients key science project, will outline the capabilities of LOFAR for transient studies, and introduce the LOFAR Radio Sky Monitor, a proposed mode in which LOFAR regularly scans 2 pi radians of sky.
