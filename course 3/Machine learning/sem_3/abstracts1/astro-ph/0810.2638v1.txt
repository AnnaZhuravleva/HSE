Accelerating cosmologies in extra dimensional spaces have been studied. These extra dimensional spaces are products of many spaces. The physical behaviors of accelerating cosmologies are investigated from Einstein's field equation in higher dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe and superstring/M theory points of view. It is found that if some assumptions of flatness are made for sector of the FRW universe, the remaining sector needs to be hyperbolic. These properties are in parallel with those found in the model of superstring/M theory. The extended product made for the superstring model did not show any more new features other than those already found. A similar accelerating phase of this product space cosmology was found with difference in numerical values of the accelerating period.
