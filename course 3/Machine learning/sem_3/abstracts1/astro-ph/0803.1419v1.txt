The possibility is examined that a model based on space noncommutativity of linear type can explain why photons from distant sources with multi-TeV energies can reach earth. In particular within a model in which space coordinates satisfy the algebra of SU(2) Lie group, it is shown that there is the possibility that the pair production through the reaction of CMB and energetic photons would be forbidden kinematically.
