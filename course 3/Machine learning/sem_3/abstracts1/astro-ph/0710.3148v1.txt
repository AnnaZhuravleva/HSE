In this paper, warm inflationary models on a brane scenario are studied. Here we consider slow-roll inflation and high-dissipation regime in a high-energy scenario. General conditions required for these models to be realizable are derived. We describe scalar and tensor perturbations for these scenarios. Specifically we study power-law potentials considering a dissipation parameter to be a constant on the one hand and $\phi$ dependent on the other hand. We use recent astronomical observations to restrict the parameters appearing in our model.
