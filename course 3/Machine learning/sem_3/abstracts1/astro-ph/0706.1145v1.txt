(ABRIDGED) Star-forming small galaxies made out of collisional debris have been found in a variety of merging systems. So far only a few of them are known in ULIRGs although they show clear signs of interactions. Whether external star formation may take place in such objects is an open question. The aim of this paper is to identify and characterise the physical and kinematic properties of the external star forming regions in a sample of ULIRGs, including TDG candidates, using optical IFS and high angular resolution HST imaging. We have found that the presence of external star-forming regions is common with 12 objects being identified in 5 ULIRGs. These regions show a large range of dynamical mass up to 1x10^{10} M_sun, with average sizes of ~750 pc. In addition, the line ratios, metallicities and H\alpha equivalent widths are typical of young bursts of star formation (age ~ 5-8 Myr), and similar to those of other TDG candidates. Their extinction corrected H\alpha luminosities lead to masses for the young stellar component of ~2x10^6 - 7x10^8 M_sun. The likelihood of survival of these regions as TDGs is discussed based on their structural and kinematic properties. Most of these systems follow the relation between effective radius and velocity dispersion found for globular clusters and Ellipticals, which suggests they are stable against internal motions. The stability against forces from the parent galaxy have been studied and a comparison of the data with the predictions of dynamical evolutionary models is also performed. Five regions out of twelve show High-Medium or High likelihood of survival. Our best candidate, which satisfy all the utilized criteria, is located in the advanced merger IRAS15250+3609 and presents a velocity field decoupled from the relatively distant parent galaxy.
