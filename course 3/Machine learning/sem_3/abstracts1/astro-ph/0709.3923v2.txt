We suggest a model for star formation function and a model for dissipation of the turbulent energy of interstellar medium. Star formation function takes into account the effect of turbulization of the ISM. It is shown that application of mentioned relations to the hierarchical scenario of formation of galaxies allows to explain the observed delay of star formation in the Galaxy that corresponds to the range of stellar ages from 8--9 to 10--12 Gyr.
