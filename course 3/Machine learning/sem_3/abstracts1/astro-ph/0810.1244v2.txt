SDSSJ092712.65+294344.0 was identified by the SDSS as a quasar, but has the unusual property of having two emission line systems offset by 2650 km/s. One of these contains the usual combination of broad and narrow lines, the other only narrow lines. In the first paper commenting on this system (Komossa et al. 2008), it was interpreted as a galaxy in which a pair of black holes had merged, imparting a several thousand km/s recoil to the new, larger black hole. In two other papers (Bogdanovic, Eracleous & Sigurdsson 2008; Dotti et al. 2008), it was interpreted as a small-separation binary black hole. We propose a new interpretation: that this system is a more distant analog of NGC1275, a large and a small galaxy interacting near the center of a rich cluster.
