The aim of the present work is to study the radio properties of double relics in Abell 1240 and Abell 2345 in the framework of double relic formation models. We present new Very Large Array observations at 20 and 90 cm for these two clusters. We performed spectral index and polarization analysis and compared our results with expectations from theoretical models. The presence of double relics in these two cluster is confirmed by these new observations. Double relics in Abell 1240 show radio morphology, spectral index and polarization values in agreement with "outgoing merger shocks" models. One of the relics of Abell 2345 shows a peculiar morphology and spectral index profile, that are difficult to reconcile with present scenarios. We suggest a possible origin for this peculiar relic.
