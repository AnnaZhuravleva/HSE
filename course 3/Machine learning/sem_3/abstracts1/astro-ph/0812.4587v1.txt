I discuss several scenarios to explain properties of the radio transient source GCRT J1745-3009. Namely, a highly magnetized neutron star on the propeller or georotator stage, a transient propeller, and an ejector in a binary system are discussed. Simple populational estimates favor the transient propeller model.
