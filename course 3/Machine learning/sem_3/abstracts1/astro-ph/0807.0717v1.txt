A line list of vibration-rotation transitions for 13C substituted HCN is presented. The line list is constructed using known experimental levels where available, calculated levels and ab initio line intensities originally calculated for the major isotopologue. Synthetic spectra are generated and compared with observations for cool carbon star WZ Cas. It is suggested that high resolution HCN spectra recorded near 14 micron should be particularly sensitive to the 13C to 12C ratio.
