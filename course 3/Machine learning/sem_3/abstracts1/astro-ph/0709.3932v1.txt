Using a spherical symmetric mean field alpha^2-dynamo model for Earth's magnetic field reversals, we show the coexistence of the noise-induced phenomena coherence resonance and stochastic resonance. Stochastic resonance has been recently invoked to explain the 100 kyr periodicity in the distribution of the residence time between reversals. The comparison of the resulting residence time distribution with the paleomagnetic one allows for some estimate of the effective diffusion time of the Earth's core which may be 100 kyr or slightly below rather than 200 kyr as it would result from the molecular resistivity.
