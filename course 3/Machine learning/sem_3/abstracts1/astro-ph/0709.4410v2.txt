In this work a general formalism for the accretion of dark energy onto astronomical objects, black holes and wormholes, is considered. It is shown that in models with four dimensions or more, any singularity with a divergence in the Hubble parameter may be avoided by a big trip, if it is assumed that there is no coupling between the bulk and this accreting object. If this is not the case in more than four dimensions, the evolution of the cosmological object depends on the particular model.
