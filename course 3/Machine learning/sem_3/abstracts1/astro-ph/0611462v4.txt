In this paper we present the results of the statistical analysis of high-latitude HI turbulence in the Milky Way. We have observed HI in the 21 cm line, obtained with the Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver at the Arecibo radio telescope. For recovering of velocity statistics we have used the Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) technique. In our analysis we have used direct fitting of the VCS model, as its asymptotic regimes are questionable for Arecibo's resolution and given the restrictions from thermal smoothing of the turbulent line. We have obtained a velocity spectral index $3.87 \pm 0.11$, an injection scale of $140 \pm 80$ pc, and an HI cold phase temperature of $52 \pm 11$ K. The spectral index is steeper than the Kolmogorov index and can be interpreted as being due to shock-dominated turbulence.
