EM Cygni is a Z Cam-subtype eclipsing dwarf nova. Its orbital period variations were reported in the past but the results were in conflict to each other while other studies allowed the possibility of no period variation. In this study we report accurate new times of minima of this eclipsing binary and update its O-C diagram. We also estimate the mass transfer rate in EM Cygni system and conclude that the mass transfer is far from the critical value. The mass transfer rate determined from the eclipse timings is in agreement with the spectroscopically determined value.
