We present preliminary calculations of electron scattering polarizations from models of structured cool star envelopes. We note that net polarizations from unresolved sources can result from non-spherical scattering envelopes and/or anisotropic illumination from a photosphere that has brightness variations. The resultant polarizations are quite small (hundreths of a percent); however, Rayleigh scattering from molecular opacity and/or dust scattering from the more extended envelope under similar considerations may produce higher polarizations.
