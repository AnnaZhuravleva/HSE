The present generation of ground-based Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observatories consist of arrays of up to four large (> 12m diameter) light collectors quite similar to those used by R. Hanbury Brown to measure stellar diameters by Intensity Interferometry in the late 60's. VHE gamma-ray observatories to be constructed over the coming decade will involve several tens of telescopes of similar or greater sizes. Used as intensity interferometers, they will provide hundreds of independent baselines. Now is the right time to re-assess the potential of intensity interferometry so that it can be taken into consideration in the design of these large facilities.
