We derive an expression for the mutual gravitational force and torque of two bodies having arbitrary shapes and mass distributions, as an expansion in power series of their products of inertia and of the relative coordinates of their centres of mass. The absolute convergence of all the power series developed is rigorously demonstrated. The absence of transcendental functions makes this formalism suitable for fast numerical applications. The products of inertia used here are directly related to the spherical harmonics coefficients, and we provide a detailed analysis of this relationship.
