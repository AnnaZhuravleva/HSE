We report the detection of the first two planets from the N2K Doppler planet search program at the Magellan telescopes. The first planet has a mass of M sin i = 4.96 M_Jup and is orbiting the G3 IV star HD154672 with an orbital period of 163.9 days. The second planet is orbiting the F7 V star HD205739 with an orbital period of 279.8 days and has a mass of M sin i = 1.37 M_Jup. Both planets are in eccentric orbits, with eccentricities e = 0.61 and e = 0.27, respectively. Both stars are metal rich and appear to be chromospherically inactive, based on inspection of their Ca II H and K lines. Finally, the best Keplerian model fit to HD205739b shows a trend of 0.0649 m/s/day, suggesting the presence of an additional outer body in that system.
