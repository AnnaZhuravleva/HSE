We present a search for point sources of high energy neutrinos using 3.8 years of data recorded by AMANDA-II during 2000-2006. After reconstructing muon tracks and applying selection criteria designed to optimally retain neutrino-induced events originating in the Northern Sky, we arrive at a sample of 6595 candidate events, predominantly from atmospheric neutrinos with primary energy 100 GeV to 8 TeV. Our search of this sample reveals no indications of a neutrino point source. We place the most stringent limits to date on $E^{-2}$ neutrino fluxes from points in the Northern Sky, with an average upper limit of $E^{2}\Phi_{\nu_{\mu} + \nu_{\tau}} \le$ 5.2 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ TeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the sum of $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ fluxes, assumed equal, over the energy range from 1.9 TeV to 2.5 PeV.
