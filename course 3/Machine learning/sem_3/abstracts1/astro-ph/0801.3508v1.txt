The action sphere method program is written. The initial conditions set at pericenter of planetocentric orbits. When action sphere radius is reached, the heliocentric orbit is calculated and data redirected to numeric integration program. The method is useful for capture and collision problem investigation. The very preliminary numeric results were obtained and discussed. A manifold in orbital elements space, leads to temporary capture about 50 year (4 Jupiter revolutions), was found.
