Aims. We aim to provide observational constraints on diffusion models that predict peculiar chemical abundances in the atmospheres of Am stars. We also intend to check if chemical peculiarities and slow rotation can be explained by the presence of a weak magnetic field.   Methods. We have obtained high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of eight previously-classified Am stars, two normal A-type stars and one Blue Straggler, considered to be members of the Praesepe cluster. For all of these stars we have determined fundamental parameters and photospheric abundances for a large number of chemical elements, with a higher precision than was ever obtained before for this cluster. For seven of these stars we also obtained spectra in circular polarization and applied the LSD technique to constrain the longitudinal magnetic field.   Results. No magnetic field was detected in any of the analysed stars. HD 73666, a Blue Straggler previously considered as an Ap (Si) star, turns out to have the abundances of a normal A-type star. Am classification is not confirmed for HD 72942. For HD 73709 we have also calculated synthetic Delta-a photometry that is in good agreement with the observations. There is a generally good agreement between abundance predictions of diffusion models and values that we have obtained for the remaining Am stars. However, the observed Na and S abundances deviate from the predictions by 0.6 dex and >0.25 dex respectively. Li appears to be overabundant in three stars of our sample.
