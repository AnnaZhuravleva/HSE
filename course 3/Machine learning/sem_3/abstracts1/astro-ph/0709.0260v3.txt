The propagation of shear Alfven wave packets in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, at the origin of their distortion, regardless of the occurrence of non-linear coupling, is considered. It is shown that the distortion mechanism can be regarded as mixing process and hence, standard "phase mixing" corresponds to the effect of an "Alfvenic" shear flow while enhanced dissipation at a magnetic X-point corresponds to mixing by an "Alfvenic" strain flow. The evolution of the global wave field is supposed to result from the dynamics of a superposition of wave packets and a kinetic equation for the wave energy is obtained following this eikonal (WKB) description. Since shear Alfven wave packets experience continuous shearing/straining while transported by an inhomogeneous Alfvenic flow $\mathbf{V}_{A}$, their mixing process, in physical space, is also a cascade of wave energy in k-space. The wave energy spectrum resulting from this linear mechanism of energy transfer is determined for the special case of waves propagating along chaotic magnetic field lines, the analog of a chaotic mixing process. The latter follows a $k^{-1}$ power-law, in the energy conserving range in $k$ space.
