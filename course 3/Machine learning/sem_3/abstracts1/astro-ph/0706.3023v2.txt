We explore the effect of the neutrino magnetic moment on neutrino scattering with matter in a core-collapse Supernova. We study the impact both on the neutrino fluxes and on the electron fraction. We find that sizeable modifications require very large magnetic moments both for Dirac and Majorana neutrinos.
