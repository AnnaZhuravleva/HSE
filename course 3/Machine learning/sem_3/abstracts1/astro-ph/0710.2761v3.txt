(Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies [(U)LIRGs] are much more numerous at cosmological distances than locally, and are likely precursors of elliptical galaxies. Our goal is to carry out an integral field spectroscopic survey of a representative sample of low redshift (z < 0.26) (U)LIRGs, covering different morphologies from spirals to mergers over the entire infrared luminosity range. The present study is based on optical IFS obtained with the VIMOS instrument on the VLT. The first results of this survey are presented here with the study of two galaxies representative of the two major morphological types observed in (U)LIRGs, interacting pairs and morphologically- regular, weakly-interacting spirals, respectively. We have found that IRAS 06076-2139 consists of two low-intermediate mass (0.15 and 0.4 m*) galaxies with relative velocities of ~ 550 km/s and, therefore, it is unlikely that they will merge. The VIMOS IFS has also discovered the presence of a rapidly expanding and rotating ring of gas in the southern galaxy (Gs), likely due to a nearly central head-on passage of an intruder about 140 million years ago. IRASF 12115-4656 is a spiral for which we have found a mass of 1.2 m*. The neutral gas (traced by the NaI doublet) and ionized gas components are spatially and kinematically decoupled. The analysis presented here illustrates the full potential of IFS in two important aspects: (i) the study of the kinematics and ionization structure of complex interacting/merging systems, and (2i) the study of the kinematics of the different gas phases, neutral (cool) and ionized (warm), traced by the NaD and Halpha lines, respectively.
