We explore tidal interactions of a galactic disk with Toomre parameter Q ~ 2 embedded in rigid halo/bulge with a point mass companion moving in a prescribed parabolic orbit. Tidal interactions produce well-defined spiral arms and extended tidal features such as bridge and tail that are all transient, but distinct in nature. In the extended disks, strong tidal force is able to lock the perturbed epicycle phases of the near-side particles to the perturber, shaping them into a tidal bridge that corotates with the perturber. A tidal tail develops at the opposite side as strongly-perturbed, near-side particles overtake mildly-perturbed, far-side particles. The tail is essentially a narrow material arm with a roughly logarithmic shape, dissolving with time because of large velocity dispersions. Inside the disks where tidal force is relatively weak, on the other hand, a two-armed logarithmic spiral pattern emerges due to the kinematic alignment of perturbed particle orbits. While self-gravity makes the spiral arms a bit stronger, the arms never become fully self-gravitating, wind up progressively with time, and decay after the peak almost exponentially in a time scale of ~ 1 Gyr. The arm pattern speed varying with both radius and time converges to Omega-kappa/2 at late time, suggesting that the pattern speed of tidally-driven arms may depend on radius in real galaxies. We present the parametric dependences of various properties of tidal features on the tidal strength, and discuss our findings in application to tidal spiral arms in grand-design spiral galaxies.
