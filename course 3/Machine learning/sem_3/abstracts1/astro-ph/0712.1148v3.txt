We present evidence for the detection of primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type (fNL), using the temperature information of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the WMAP 3-year data. We employ the bispectrum estimator of non-Gaussianity described in (Yadav et al. 2007) which allows us to analyze the entirety of the WMAP data without an arbitrary cut-off in angular scale. Using the combined information from WMAP's two main science channels up to lmax=750 and the conservative Kp0 foreground mask we find 27 < fNL < 147 at 95% C.L., with a central value of fNL=87. This corresponds to a rejection of fNL=0 at more than 99.5% significance. We find that this detection is robust to variations in lmax, frequency and masks, and that no known foreground, instrument systematic, or secondary anisotropy explains our signal while passing our suite of tests. We explore the impact of several analysis choices on the stated significance and find 2.5 sigma for the most conservative view. We conclude that the WMAP 3-year data disfavors canonical single field slow-roll inflation.
