We present the optical and infrared identifications of the 266 radio sources detected at 20 cm with the Very Large Array in the Chandra Deep Field South (Kellermann et al. 2008). Using deep i-band Advanced Camera for Surveys, R-band Wide Field Imager, K-band SOFI/NTT, K-band ISAAC/VLT and Spitzer imaging data, we are able to find reliable counterparts for 254 (~95%) VLA sources. Twelve radio sources remain unidentified and three of them are ``empty fields''. Using literature and our own data we are able to assign redshifts to 186 (~70%) radio sources: 108 are spectroscopic redshifts and 78 reliable photometric redshifts. Based on the rest frame colors and morphological distributions of the host galaxies we find evidences for a change in the submillijansky radio source population: a) above ~ 0.08 mJy early-type galaxies are dominating; b) at flux densities below ~0.08 mJy, starburst galaxies become dominant.
