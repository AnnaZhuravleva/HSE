The relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) found in their cores plays a key role in the formation and evolution of both of these major constituents of the universe, as well as the evolution of the intergalactic medium. Neither can be fully understood on their own, and studies of galaxy and SMBH co-formation and co-evolution are now among the central topics of research in cosmology. Yet the very origins, and the early growth phases of the SMBH are still not firmly established. We review our current understanding of the relevant processes and their astrophysical and cosmological context, with an emphasis on the observability of the SMBH growth mechanisms at high redshifts, and their leftover progeny at low redshifts.
