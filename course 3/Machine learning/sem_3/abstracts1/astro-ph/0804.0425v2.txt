We point out that a light scalar field fluctuating around a symmetry-enhaced point can generate large non-Gaussianity in density fluctuations. We name such a particle as an "ungaussiton", a scalar field dominantly produced by the quantum fluctuations,generating sizable non-Gaussianity in the density fluctuations. We derive a consistency relation between the bispectrum and the trispectrum, tau_NL = 10^3 f_NL^(4/3), which can be extended to arbitrary high order correlation functions. If such a relation is confirmed by future observations, it will strongly support this mechanism.
