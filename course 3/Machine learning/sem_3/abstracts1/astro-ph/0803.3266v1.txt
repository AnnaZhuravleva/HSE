The detection of radioactive decay line of 44Ti provides a unique evidence that the gamma-ray source is a young (< 1,000 yr) supernova remnant because of its short lifetime of about 90 yr. Only two Galactic remnants, Cassiopeia A and RX J0852.0-4622, are hitherto reported to be the 44Ti line emitter, although the detection from the latter has been debated. Here we report on an expansion measurement of the northwestern rim of RX J0852.0-4622 obtained with X-ray observations separated by 6.5 yr. The expansion rate is derived to be 0.023+/-0.006% that is about five times lower than those of young historical remnants. Such a slow expansion suggests that RX J0852.0-4622 is not a young remnant as has been expected. We estimate the age of 1,700-4,300 yr of this remnant depending on its evolutionary stage. Assuming a high shock speed of about 3000 km/sec, which is suggested by the detection of non-thermal X-ray radiation, the distance of about 750 pc to this remnant is also derived.
