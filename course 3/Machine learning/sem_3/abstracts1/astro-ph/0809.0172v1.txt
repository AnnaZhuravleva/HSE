Precision Doppler velocity measurements from the Anglo-Australian Tele- scope reveal a planet with a 9.4+/-0.4 year period orbiting the M1.5 dwarf GJ 832. Within measurement uncertainty the orbit is circular, and the minimum mass (m sin i) of the planet is 0.64+/-0.06 MJUP. GJ 832 appears to be depleted in met- als by at least 50% relative to the Sun, as are a significant fraction of the M dwarfs known to host exoplanets. GJ 832 adds another Jupiter-mass planet to the known census of M dwarf exoplanets, which currently includes a significant number of Neptune-mass planets. GJ 832 is an excellent candidate for astromet- ric orbit determination with alpha sin i = 0.95 mas. GJ 832b has the second largest angular distance from its star among radial velocity detected exoplanets (0.69 arc sec) making it a potentially interesting target for future direct detection.
