We conduct 2D axisymmetrical hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the interaction of a collimated fast wind (CFW; wide jets) with a spherical AGB wind. The code includes radiative cooling. We find that the shape of the planetary nebula (PN) is sensitive to the exact mass loss history of the AGB wind, and the opening angle of the CFW. Some typical PN morphologies are obtained, but many other observed morphologies seem to require more ingredients than what we assume in our present simulations, e.g., equatorial AGB wind, and ionization and fast wind during the PN phase. The hot bipolar bubble formed by the jets is an X-ray source.
