The Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers Phase II (CRESST-II) at the L.N.G.S in Italy is searching for Dark Matter using low-temperature calorimeters. These detectors allow to discriminate different particles by simultaneous measurement of phonons and scintillation light. The sensors used consist of superconducting tungsten thin-film thermometers, which measure the thermal effect of the phonons created in an attached absorber crystal. It has been observed that the scintillation of the CaWO4 absorber degrades during the process of depositing the tungsten film. In order to prevent this, a new technique for producing the detectors was investigated. This technique might also be valuable by expanding the range of scintillator materials suitable for producing a Dark Matter detector.
