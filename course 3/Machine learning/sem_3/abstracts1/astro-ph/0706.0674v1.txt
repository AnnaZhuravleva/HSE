We present a study of the host galaxy of the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) of May 5 2006 (GRB 060505). The host is spatially resolved in both imaging data and in a long slit spectrum including the GRB site. We find the galaxy to be a Sbc spiral, which is unusual for a long GRB host galaxy. The site of the GRB is considerably different from the rest of the galaxy with intense star formation, low metallicity and a young age. This suggest a massive stellar progenitor rather than a merger of compact objects which has been suggested based on the the relatively short duration of T_90=4s for the prompt emission.
