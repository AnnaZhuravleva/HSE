With the fundamental stress mechanism of accretion disks identified--correlated MHD turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability--it has become possible to make numerical simulations of accretion disk dynamics based on well-understood physics. A sampling of results from both Newtonian 3-d shearing box and general relativistic global disk MHD simulations is reported. Among other things, these simulations have shown that: contrary to long-held assumptions, stress is continuous through the marginally stable and plunging regions around black holes, so that rotating black holes can give substantial amounts of angular momentum electromagnetically to surrounding matter; the upper layers of accretion disks are primarily supported by magnetic pressure, potentially leading to interesting departures from local black-body emitted spectra; and initially local magnetic fields in accretion flows can, in some cases, spontaneously generate large-scale fields that connect rotating black holes to infinity and mediate strong relativistic jets.
