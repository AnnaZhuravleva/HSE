The ANTARES telescope has the opportunity to detect transient neutrino sources, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), core-collapse supernovae (SNe), flares of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)... To enhance the sensitivity to these sources, we are developing a new detection method based on the observation of neutrino bursts followed by an optical detection. The ANTARES Collaboration is implementing a fast on-line event reconstruction with a good angular resolution. These characteristics allow to trigger an optical telescope network in order to identify the nature of the neutrinos (and high energy cosmic-rays) sources. This follow-up can be done with a network of small automatic telescopes and required a small observation time. An optical follow-up of special events, such as neutrino doublets in coincidence in time and space or single neutrino having a very high energy, would not only give access to the nature of the sources but also improve the sensitivity for neutrino detection from SNe or GRBs.
