We propose a model of allocating galaxies in cosmological N-body simulations. we identify each subhalo with a galaxy, and assign luminosity and morphological type assuming that the galaxy luminosity is a monotonic function of its host subhalo mass. The morphology assignment is made by using two simple relations between subhalo mass and galaxy luminosity of different types. One is using a constant ratio in luminosity of early (E/SO) and late (S/Irr) type galaxies at a fixed subhalo mass. And the other assumes that galaxies of different morphological types but having an equal luminosity have a constant ratio in their subhalo masses. We made a series of comparisons of the properties of these simulated galaxies with those of the SDSS galaxies. The resulting simulated galaxy sample is found to successfully reproduce the observed local number density distribution except for in high density regions. The luminosity function is studied as a function of local density. It was found that the observed luminosity functions in different local density environments are overall well-reproduced by the simulated galaxies. Discrepancy is found at the bright end of the luminosity function of early types in the underdense regions and at the faint end of both morphological types in very high density regions. A significant fraction of the observed early type galaxies in voids seems to have undergone a relatively recent star formation and became brighter. The lack of faint simulated galaxies in dense regions may be due to the strong tidal force of the central halo which destroys less massive satellite subhalos around in the simulation. The mass-to-light ratio is found to depend on the local density in the way similar to that observed in the SDSS sample. (abridged)
