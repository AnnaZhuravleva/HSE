Observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) suggest that quasars reionize HeII in the IGM at z ~ 3. We have run a set of 190 and 430 comoving Mpc simulations of HeII being reionized by quasars to develop an understanding of the nature of HeII reionization and its potential impact on observables. We find that HeII reionization heats regions in the IGM by as much as 25,000 K above the temperature that is expected otherwise, with the volume-averaged temperature increasing by ~ 12,000 K and with large temperature fluctuations on ~ 50 Mpc scales. Much of the heating occurs far from QSOs by hard photons. We find a temperature-density equation of state of gamma -1 ~ 0.3 during HeII reionization, but with a wide dispersion in this relation having sigma ~ 10^4 K. HeII reionization by the observed population of quasars cannot produce an inverted relation (gamma - 1 < 0). Our simulations are consistent with the observed evolution in the mean transmission of the HeII Ly-alpha forest. We argue that the heat input due to HeII reionization is unable to cause the observed depression at z = 3.2 in the HI Ly-alpha forest opacity as has been suggested. We investigate how uncertainties in the properties of QSOs and of HeII Lyman-limit systems influence our predictions.
