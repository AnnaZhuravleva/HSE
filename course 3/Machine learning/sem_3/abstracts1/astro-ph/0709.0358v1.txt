In this proceeding we look at the relationship between the photometric nuclear properties of early-type galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope imaging and their overall kinematics as observed with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. We compare the inner slope of their photometric profiles and the Slow/Fast rotator classes, defined by the amplitude of a newly defined LambdaR parameter, to show that slow rotators tend to be more massive systems and display shallower inner profiles and fast rotators steper ones. It is important to remark, however, that there is not a one-to-one relationship between the two photometric and kinematic groups.
