We present new fully self-consistent models of the formation and evolution of isolated dwarf galaxies. We have used the publicly available N-body/SPH code HYDRA, to which we have added a set of star formation criteria, and prescriptions for chemical enrichment (taking into account contributions from both SNIa and SNII), supernova feedback, and gas cooling. The models follow the evolution of an initially homogeneous gas cloud collapsing in a pre-existing dark-matter halo. These simplified initial conditions are supported by the merger trees of isolated dwarf galaxies extracted from the milli-Millennium Simulation.   The star-formation histories of the model galaxies exhibit burst-like behaviour. These bursts are a consequence of the blow-out and subsequent in-fall of gas. The amount of gas that leaves the galaxy for good is found to be small, in absolute numbers, ranging between 3x10^7 Msol and 6x10^7 Msol . For the least massive models, however, this is over 80 per cent of their initial gas mass. The local fluctuations in gas density are strong enough to trigger star-bursts in the massive models, or to inhibit anything more than small residual star formation for the less massive models. Between these star-bursts there can be time intervals of several Gyrs.   We have compared model predictions with available data for the relations between luminosity and surface brightness profile, half-light radius, central velocity dispersion, broad band colour (B-V) and metallicity, as well as the location relative to the fundamental plane. The properties of the model dwarf galaxies agree quite well with those of observed dwarf galaxies.
