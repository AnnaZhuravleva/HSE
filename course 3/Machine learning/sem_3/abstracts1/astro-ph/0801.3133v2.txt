I review briefly different aspects of the MOND paradigm, with emphasis on phenomenology, epitomized here by many MOND laws of galactic motion--analogous to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. I then comment on the possible roots of MOND in cosmology, possibly the deepest and most far reaching aspect of MOND. This is followed by a succinct account of existing underlying theories. I also reflect on the implications of MOND's successes for the dark matter (DM) paradigm: MOND predictions imply that baryons alone accurately determine the full field of each and every individual galactic object. This conflicts with the expectations in the DM paradigm because of the haphazard formation and evolution of galactic objects and the very different influences that baryons and DM are subject to during the evolution, as evidenced, e.g., by the very small baryon-to-DM fraction in galaxies (compared with the cosmic value). All this should disabuse DM advocates of the thought that DM will someday be able to reproduce MOND: It is inconceivable that the modicum of baryons left over in galaxies can be made to determine everything if a much heavier DM component is present.
