UNIT (The Ukrainian synchronous Network of small Internet Telescopes) is a system of automated telescopes that search for simultaneous optical activity of transient objects associated with variable stars, small bodies of the Solar system, Near-Earth objects (NEOs), gamma ray bursts, etc. Their instruments are sensitive down to $M_{V} \approx 18$ and require an average of 60 seconds to obtain the first images of the transient events after the alarm or GCN notice. Telescopes of UNIT are equipped with fast CCD cameras to study astrophysics on the timescales up to tens Hz. UNIT will be operating by the middle of 2008.
