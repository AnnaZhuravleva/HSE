Nucleosynthesis in early neutrino winds is investigated. Presented is a brief overview of two recent problems of supernova nucleosynthesis. In the first part we investigate the effect of nuclear parameters on the synthesis of Mo92 and Mo94. Based on recent experimental results, we find that the proton rich winds of the model investigated here can not be the source of solar Mo92 and Mo94. In the second part we investigate the nucleosynthesis from neutron rich bubbles and show that they do not contribute to the overall nucleosynthesis.
