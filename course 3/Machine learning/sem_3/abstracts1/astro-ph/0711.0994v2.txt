We extend our earlier model of the small scale structure of cosmic string networks through an improved treatment of the separation of long and short scales. We find that the production of small loops (at the gravitational radiation scale) is a robust feature of string networks, in addition to a population of loops near the horizon scale. We obtain quantitative agreement with the scaling of loop production functions as found in simulations by two groups.
