We give the governing equations for multiple scalar fields in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background spacetime on all scales, allowing for metric and field perturbations up to second order. We then derive the Klein-Gordon equation at second order in closed form in terms of gauge-invariant perturbations of the fields in the uniform curvature gauge. We also give a simplified form of the Klein-Gordon equation using the slow-roll approximation.
