We summarize the main highlights from ISO observations towards Sgr B2 and Orion KL in the far-IR domain (~43 to 197 um). Both Star-Forming Regions are among the best sources to construct a template for more distant and unresolved regions (e.g., extragalactic). We stress some peculiarities in the interpretation (excitation and radiative transfer) of far-IR spectral lines and dust continuum emission.
