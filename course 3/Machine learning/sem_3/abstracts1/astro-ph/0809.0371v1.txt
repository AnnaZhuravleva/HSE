We based on 2MASS J and Ks photometry for the open star clusters King 14 and NGC 146, and using color magnitude diagrams with isochrones fit we have found an age of log(age) = 7.8 (63 $\pm$8 Myr) for King 14 and log(age) = 7.5 (32 $\pm$8 Myr) for NGC 146. Our age determination is bigger than given in Lynga [5] (log(age) = 7.2 for King 14 and log(age) = 7.1 for NGC 146) and less than Dias [6] (log(age) = 7.9 for King 14 and log(age) = 7.8 for NGC 146)
