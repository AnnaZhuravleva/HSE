We have studied the X-ray emission from four historical Type-II supernovae (the newly-discovered 1941C in NGC 4631 and 1959D in NGC 7331; and 1968D, 1980K in NGC 6946), using Chandra ACIS-S imaging. In particular, the first three are the oldest ever found in the X-ray band, and provide constraints on the properties of the stellar wind and circumstellar matter encountered by the expanding shock at more advanced stages in the transition towards the remnant phase. We estimate emitted luminosities ~ 5 x 10^{37} erg/s for SN 1941C, ~ a few x 10^{37} erg/s for SN 1959D, ~ 2 x 10^{38} erg/s for SN 1968D, and ~ 4 x 10^{37} erg/s for SN 1980K, in the 0.3-8 keV band. X-ray spectral fits to SN 1968D suggest the presence of a harder component, possibly a power law with photon index ~ 2, contributing ~ 10^{37} erg/s in the 2-10 keV band. We speculate that it may be evidence of non-thermal emission from a Crab-like young pulsar.
