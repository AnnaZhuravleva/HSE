We present a CCD BV photometry of the possible binary open star cluster NGC 7031/NGC 7086. The aim is to confirm or disprove their common nature on the grounds of their age and distance. An age of 224 $\pm$ 25 Myr and distance 831 $\pm$ 72 pc was determined for NGC 7031 and 178 $\pm$ 25 Myr, 955 $\pm$ 84 pc for NGC 7086, respectively. Based on these differences in age and distance we conclude that the two clusters are most likely not formed together from one and the same Giant Molecular Cloud and thus are not a true binary cluster.
