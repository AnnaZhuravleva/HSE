We have simulated a population of young spin-powered pulsars and computed the beaming pattern and lightcurves for the three main geometrical models: polar cap emission, two-pole caustic ("slot gap") emission and outer magnetosphere emission. The light curve shapes depend sensitively on the magnetic inclination alpha and viewing angle zeta. We present the results as maps of observables such as peak multiplicity and gamma-ray peak separation in the (alpha, zeta) plane. These diagrams can be used to locate allowed regions for radio-loud and radio-quiet pulsars and to convert observed fluxes to true all-sky emission.
