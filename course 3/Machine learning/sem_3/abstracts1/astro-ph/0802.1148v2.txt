B.M. Mirza \cite{1} presented a solution of coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations for a slowly rotating neutron star; however his derivations had some errors and implicit assumptions that rendered the solution invalid. We point out the errors and present a mathematically consistent solution. The resulting solution is also physically consistent as it remains finite in the no rotation limit, whereas Mirza's solution diverges for zero rotation.
