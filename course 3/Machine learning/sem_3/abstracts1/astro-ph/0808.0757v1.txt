We investigate the dependence of penumbral microjets inclination on the position within penumbra. The high cadence observations taken on 10 November 2006 with the Hinode satellite through the \ion{Ca}{ii} H and G--band filters were analysed to determine the inclination of penumbral microjets. The results were then compared with the inclination of the magnetic field determined through the inversion of the spectropolarimetric observations of the same region. The penumbral microjet inclination is increasing towards the outer edge of the penumbra. The results suggest that the penumbral microjet follows the opening magnetic field lines of a vertical flux tube that creates the sunspot.
