The magnetized induced Compton scattering off the particles of the ultrarelativistic electron-positron plasma of pulsar is considered. The main attention is paid to the transverse regime of the scattering, which holds in a moderately strong magnetic field. We specifically examine the problem on induced transverse scattering of the radio beam into the background, which takes place in the open field line tube of a pulsar. In this case, the radiation is predominantly scattered backwards and the scattered component may grow considerably. Based on this effect, we for the first time suggest a physical explanation of the interpulse emission observed in the profiles of some pulsars. Our model can naturally account for the peculiar spectral and polarization properties of the interpulses. Furthermore, it implies a specific connection of the interpulse to the main pulse, which may reveal itself in the consistent intensity fluctuations of the components at different timescales. Diverse observational manifestations of this connection, including the moding behavior of PSR B1822-09, the peculiar temporal and frequency structure of the giant interpulses in the Crab pulsar, and the intrinsic phase correspondence of the subpulse patterns in the main pulse and the interpulse of PSR B1702-19, are discussed in detail. It is also argued that the pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the scattering efficiency may lead to strong variability of the interpulse, which is yet to be studied observationally. In particular, some pulsars may exhibit transient interpulses, i.e. the scattered component may be detectable only occasionally.
