We present results from deep radio observations taken with the VLA at a center frequency of 1400 MHz cover a region of the SWIRE Spitzer Legacy survey, centered at 10 46 00, 59 01 00 (J2000). The reduction and cataloging of the radio sources are described. The survey presented is the deepest so far in terms of the radio source density on the sky. Perhaps surprisingly, the sources down to the bottom of the catalog have median angular sizes greater than 1 arcsecond, like their cousins 10-100 times stronger. If the log N - log S normalization remains constant at the lowest flux densities, there are about 6 sources per square arcminute down to 15 microJy at 20cm. Given the finite source sizes this implies we may reach the natural confusion limit near 1 microJy.
