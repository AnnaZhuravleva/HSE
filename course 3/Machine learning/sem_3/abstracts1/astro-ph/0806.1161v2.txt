Based on CORSIKA and REAS2 simulations, we investigate the dependence of geosynchrotron radio emission from extensive air showers on the energy of the primary cosmic ray and the depth of the shower maximum. It is found that at a characteristic lateral distance, the amplitude of the bandpass-filtered radio signal is directly proportional to the energy deposited in the atmosphere by the electromagnetic cascade, with an RMS uncertainty due to shower-to-shower fluctuations of less than 3%. In addition, the ratio of this radio amplitude and that at a larger lateral distance is directly related to the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, with an RMS uncertainty of ~15-20 g cm-2. By measuring these quantities, geosynchrotron radio emission from cosmic ray air showers can be used to infer the energy of the primary particle and the depth of the air shower maximum on a shower-to-shower basis.
