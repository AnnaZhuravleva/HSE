The MAGIC collaboration has been performing Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations whenever alerted that known or potential very high energy gamma-ray emitting extragalactic sources were in a high flux state in the optical, X-ray band or/and in the TeV energy range. Here we report on MAGIC observations performed after such triggers, results of the analysis, and a possible optical-TeV correlation seen in the data. Detections as well as spectral and temporal characterestics of Mkn 180, PKS 2155-304, and 1ES 1011+496 are reported.
