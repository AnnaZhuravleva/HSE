Aims: We determine the nature of the intermediate polar candidates XSS J00564+4548, IGR J17195-4100, and XSS J12270-4859.   Methods: Pointed RXTE observations searched for intermediate polar characteristics in these candidate systems.   Results: XSS J00564+4548 exhibits a period of 465.68+-0.07 s, which we interpret as the spin period, an energy dependent modulation depth, and a spectrum that is fit by a 22 keV photoelectrically absorbed bremsstrahlung with an iron line profile. IGR J17195-4100 shows several candidate periodicities and a spectrum that is fit by a power law with an iron line. XSS J12270-4859 exhibits a candidate spin period of 859.57+-0.64 s and a spectrum that is fit by a power law with no evidence of an iron line.   Conclusions: XSS J00564+4548 is confirmed to be an intermediate polar. IGR J17195-4100 and XSS J12270-4859 both show some properties of intermediate polars, but cannot be confirmed as definite members of the class here.
