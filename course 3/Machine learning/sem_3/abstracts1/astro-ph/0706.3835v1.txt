We present and analyze high-resolution optical spectra of the Algol binaries S Equ and KO Aql. New accurate radial velocities for the hotter primary components are obtained. Thanks to the cross-correlation procedure, we were able to measure, for the first time to our knowledge, radial velocities also for the cool secondary components of S Equ and KO Aql. By combining the parameters obtained from the solution of the radial velocity curves with those obtained from the light curve analysis, reliable absolute parameters of the systems have been derived. The rotational velocity of the hotter components of S Equ and KO Aql has been measured and it is found that the gainers of both systems rotate about 30 % faster than synchronously. This is likely due to mass transfer across the Lagrangian L1 point from the cooler to the hotter component. The lower luminosity of the mass-gaining components of these systems compared to normal main-sequence stars of the same mass can be also an effect of the mass transfer. The H-alpha profiles reveal clear evidence of mass transfer and accretion structures. In both systems we clearly observed extra-absorption lines. From the integrated absorption and the radial velocity variations of these features, we found that the mass accretion is very dense around the impact region of the hotter components. A double-peaked emission in the spectra of S Equ was seen outside the eclipses. One of these peaks is likely originated in a region between the center of mass and the cooler component, which is occupied by the flowing matter. Furthermore, the H-alpha difference spectra of S Equ and KO Aql display also emission features, which should be arising from the magnetic activity of the cooler components.
