To understand the fundamental physical processes important for the evolution of solar rotation and distribution of chemical species, we provide theoretical predictions for particle mixing and momentum transport in the stably stratified tachocline. By envisioning that turbulence is driven externally in the tachocline (e.g. by plume penetration), we compute the amplitude of turbulent flow, turbulent particle diffusivities, and eddy viscosity, by incorporating the effect of a strong radial differential rotation and stable stratification. We identify the different roles that the shear flow and stable stratification play in turbulence regulation and transport. Particle transport is found to be severely quenched due to stable stratification as well as radial differential rotation, especially in the radial direction with an effectively more efficient horizontal transport. The eddy viscosity is shown to become negative for parameter values typical of the tachocline, suggesting that turbulence in the stably stratified tachocline leads to a non-uniform radial differential rotation. Similar results also hold in the radiative interiors of stars, in general.
