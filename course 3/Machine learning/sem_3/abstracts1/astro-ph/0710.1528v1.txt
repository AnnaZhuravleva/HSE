We present the general relativistic calculation of the energy release associated with a first order phase transition (PT) at the center of a rotating neutron star (NS). The energy release, E_rel, is equal to the difference in mass-energies between the initial (normal) phase configuration and the final configuration containing a superdense matter core, assuming constant total baryon number and the angular momentum. The calculations are performed with the use of precise pseudo-spectral 2-D numerical code; the polytropic equations of state (EOS) as well as realistic EOSs (Skyrme interactions, Mean Field Theory kaon condensate) are used. The results are obtained for a broad range of metastability of initial configuration and size of the new superdense phase core in the final configuration. For a fixed ``overpressure'', dP, defined as the relative excess of central pressure of a collapsing metastable star over the pressure of the equilibrium first-order PT, the energy release up to numerical accuracy does not depend on the stellar angular momentum and coincides with that for nonrotating stars with the same dP. When the equatorial radius of the superdense phase core is much smaller than the equatorial radius of the star, analytical expressions for the E_rel can be obtained: E_rel is proportional to dP^2.5 for small dP. At higher dP, the results of 1-D calculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating stars reproduce with very high precision exact 2-D results for fast-rotating stars. The energy release-angular momentum independence for a given overpressure holds also for the so-called ``strong'' PTs (that destabilise the star against the axi-symmetric perturbations), as well as for PTs with ``jumping'' over the energy barrier.
