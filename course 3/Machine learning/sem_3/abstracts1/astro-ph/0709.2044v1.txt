I discuss the spherically symmetric but inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman- Bondi (LTB) metric, which provides an exact toy model for an inhomogeneous universe. Since we observe light rays from the past light cone, not the expansion of the universe, spatial variation in matter density and Hubble rate can have the same effect on redshift as acceleration in a perfectly homogeneous universe. As a consequence, a simple spatial variation in the Hubble rate can account for the distant supernova data in a dust universe without any dark energy. I also review various attempts towards a semirealistic description of the universe based on the LTB model.
