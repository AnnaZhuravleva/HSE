The first two months of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the nearby type Ic SN 2007gr are presented. The very early discovery (less than 5 days after the explosion) and the relatively short distance of the host galaxy motivated an extensive observational campaign. SN 2007gr shows an average peak luminosity but unusually narrow spectral lines and an almost flat photospheric velocity profile. The detection of prominent carbon features in the spectra is shown and suggest a wide range in carbon abundance in stripped-envelope supernovae. SN 2007gr may be an important piece in the puzzle of the observed diversity of CC SNe.
