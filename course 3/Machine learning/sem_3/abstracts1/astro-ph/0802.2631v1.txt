A number of cool magnetic Ap stars show a prominent feature at lambda 6708 A. Its identification with Li I remains controversial due to a poor knowledge of the spectra of rare-earth elements that are strongly enhanced in peculiar stars and can potentially provide an alternative identification. We suggest to investigate the 6708 line in Ap stars with strong magnetic fields. In these objects the magnetic broadening and splitting provides an additional powerful criterium for line identification, allowing to use the whole line profile instead of a mere coincidence of the observed and predicted wavelength. Due to a small separation of the Li I doublet components, their magnetic splitting pattern deviates from the one expected for the Zeeman effect even in relatively weak fields. We carry out detailed calculations of the transition between the Zeeman and Paschen-Back regimes in the magnetic splitting of the Li I line and compute polarized synthetic spectra for the range of field strength expected in Ap stars. Theoretical spectral synthesis is compared with the high-resolution observations of cool Ap stars HD 116114, HD 166473 and HD 154708, which have a mean field strength of 6.4, 8.6 and 24.5 kG, respectively, and show a strong 6708 A line. High-resolution spectra for the 6708 A region are analysed for 17 magnetic Ap stars. The presence of the 6708 A line is confirmed in 9 stars and reported for the first time in 6 stars. We demonstrate that the observed profiles of the 6708 A line in the strong field stars HD 116114, HD 166473 and HD 154708 correspond rather well to the theoretical calculations assuming the Li I identification. Inclusion of the Paschen-Back effect improves the agreement with observations, especially for HD 154708. Results of our study confirm the Li I identification proposed for the 6708 A line in cool Ap stars.
