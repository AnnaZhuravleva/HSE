Minutes into the big bang, nucleosynthesis finds 96 percent of matter nonreactive. Massive pure disk protogalaxies must be formed in the early universe as their galaxies are found at high redshift. Surrounded by hot gas, they made little imprint on the CBR. The LHC has not found the Higgs or dark matter candidates. These phenomena can be explained by a cold baryonic shell.
