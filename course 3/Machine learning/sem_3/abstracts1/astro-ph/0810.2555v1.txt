In this communication devoted to the prompt emission of GRBs, we claim that some important parameters associated to the magnetic field, such as its index profile, the index of its turbulence spectrum and its level of irregularities, will be measurable with GLAST. In particular the law relating the peak energy Epeak with the total energy E (like Amati's law) constrains the turbulence spectrum index and, among all existing theories of MHD turbulence, is compatible with the Kolmogorov scaling only. Thus, these data will allow a much better determination of the performances of GRBs as particle accelerators. This opens the possibility to characterize both electron and proton acceleration more seriously. We discuss the possible generation of UHECRs and of its signature through GeV-TeV synchrotron emission.
