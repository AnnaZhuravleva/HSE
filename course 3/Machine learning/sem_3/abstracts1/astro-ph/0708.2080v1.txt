The characteristics of the resonant disturbing function for an asteroid perturbed by a planet in circular orbit are discussed. The location of the libration centers and their dependence with the orbital elements of the resonant orbit are analyzed. A proposed numerical method (Gallardo 2006a) for computing the strengths of the resonances is revised and applied to the region of the main belt of asteroids showing the relevance of several mean motion resonances (MMR) with several planets.
