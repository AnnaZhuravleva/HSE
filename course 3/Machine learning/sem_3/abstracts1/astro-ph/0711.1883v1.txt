PSR J0514-4002A is a 5-ms pulsar is located in the globular cluster NGC 1851; it belongs to a highly eccentric (e = 0.888) binary system. It is one of the earliest known examples of a numerous and fast-growing class of eccentric binary MSPs recently discovered in globular clusters. Using the GBT, we have obtained a phase-coherent timing solution for the pulsar, which includes a measurement of the rate of advance of periastron: 0.01289(4) degrees per year, which if due completely to general relativity, implies a total system mass of 2.453(14) solar masses. We also derive m_p < 1.5 solar masses and m_c > 0.96 solar masses. The companion is likely to be a massive white dwarf star.
