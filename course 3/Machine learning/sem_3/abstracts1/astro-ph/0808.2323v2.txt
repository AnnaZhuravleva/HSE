We discuss the 21cm power spectrum (PS) following the completion of reionization. In contrast to the reionization era, this PS is proportional to the PS of mass density fluctuations, with only a small modulation due to fluctuations in the ionization field on scales larger than the mean-free-path of ionizing photons. We derive the form of this modulation, and demonstrate that its effect on the 21cm PS will be smaller than 1% for physically plausible models of damped Ly-alpha systems. In contrast to the 21cm PS observed prior to reionization, in which HII regions dominate the ionization structure, the simplicity of the 21cm PS after reionization will enhance its utility as a cosmological probe by removing the need to separate the PS into physical and astrophysical components. As a demonstration, we consider the Alcock-Paczynski test and show that the next generation of low-frequency arrays could measure the angular distortion of the PS at the percent level for z~3-5.
