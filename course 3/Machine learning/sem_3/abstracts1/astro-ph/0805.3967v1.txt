We show that stable double-frequency orbits form the backbone of double bars, because they trap around themselves regular orbits, as stable closed periodic orbits do in single bars, and in both cases the trapped orbits occupy similar volume of phase-space. We perform a global search for such stable double-frequency orbits in a model of double bars by constructing maps of trajectories with initial conditions well sampled over the available phase-space. We use the width of a ring sufficient to enclose a given map as the indicator of how tightly the trajectory is trapped around a double-frequency orbit. We construct histograms of these ring widths in order to determine the fraction of phase-space occupied by ordered motions. We build 22 further models of double bars, and we construct histograms showing the fraction of the phase-space occupied by regular orbits in each model. Our models indicate that resonant coupling between the bars may not be the dominant factor reducing chaos in the system.
