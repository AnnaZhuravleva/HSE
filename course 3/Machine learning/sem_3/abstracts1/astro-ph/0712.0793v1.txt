We present observations of the nearby barred starburst galaxy, M83 (NGC5236), with the new Fabry-Perot interferometer GHAFAS mounted on the 4.2 meter William Herschel Telescope on La Palma. The unprecedented high resolution observations, of 16 pc/FWHM, of the H-alpha-emitting gas cover the central two kpc of the galaxy. The velocity field displays the dominant disk rotation with signatures of gas inflow from kpc scales down to the nuclear regions. At the inner Inner Lindblad Resonance radius of the main bar and centerd at the dynamical center of the main galaxy disk, a nuclear $5.5 (\pm 0.9) \times 10^8 M_\odot$ rapidly rotating disk with scale length of $60 \pm 20$ pc has formed. The nuclear starburst is found in the vicinity as well as inside this nuclear disk, and our observations confirm that gas spirals in from the outer parts to feed the nuclear starburst, giving rise to several star formation events at different epochs, within the central 100 pc radius of M83.
