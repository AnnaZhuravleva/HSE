We present statistical analysis of diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission and polarized thermal emission from dust. Both Galactic synchrotron emission and polarized thermal emission from dust reflect statistics of magnetic field fluctuations and, therefore, Galactic turbulence. We mainly focus on the relation between observed angular spectra and underlying turbulence statistics. Our major findings are as follows. First, we find that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the Galaxy can indeed explain diffuse synchrotron emission from high galactic latitude. Our model calculation suggests that either a one-component extended halo model or a two-component model, an extended halo component (scale height > 1kpc) plus a local component, can explain the observed angular spectrum of the synchrotron emission. However, discrete sources seem to dominate the spectrum for regions near the Galactic plane. Second, we study how star-light polarization is related with polarized emission from thermal dust. We also discuss the expected angular spectrum of polarized emission from thermal dust. Our model calculations suggest that C_l\propto l^{-11/3} for l > 1000 and a shallower spectrum for l < 1000.
