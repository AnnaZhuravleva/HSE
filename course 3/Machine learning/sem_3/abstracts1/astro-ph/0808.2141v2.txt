Using direct simulations, weakly nonlinear theory and nonlinear mean-field theory, it is shown that the quenched velocity field of a saturated nonlinear dynamo can itself act as a kinematic dynamo. The flow is driven by a forcing function that would produce a Roberts flow in the absence of a magnetic field. This result confirms an analogous finding by F. Cattaneo & S. M. Tobias (arXiv:0809.1801) for the more complicated case of turbulent convection, suggesting that this may be a common property of nonlinear dynamos; see also the talk given also online at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/dynamo_c08/cattaneo). It is argued that this property can be used to test nonlinear mean-field dynamo theories.
