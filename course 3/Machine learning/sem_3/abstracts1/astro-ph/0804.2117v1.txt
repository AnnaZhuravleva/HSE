Multi-planet systems detected until now are in most cases characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their central star as well as high eccentricities. As a consequence, from a dynamical point of view, compact multi-planetary systems form a variety of the general N-body problem (with N >= 3), whose solutions are not necessarily known. Extrasolar planets are up to now found in prograde (i.e. direct) orbital motions about their host star and often in mean-motion resonances (MMR). In the present paper, we investigate a theoretical alternative suitable for the stability of compact multi-planetary systems. When the outer planet moves on a retrograde orbit in MMR with respect to the inner planet, we find that the so-called retrograde resonances present fine and characteristic structures particularly relevant for dynamical stability. We show that retrograde resonances and their resources open a family of stabilizing mechanisms involving specific behaviors of apsidal precessions. We also point up that for particular orbital data, retrograde MMRs may provide more robust stability compared to the corresponding prograde MMRs.
