If dark matter consists of cold, neutral particles with a non-zero magnetic moment, then, in the presence of an external magnetic field, a measurable gyromagnetic Faraday effect becomes possible. This enables direct constraints on the nature and distribution of such dark matter through detailed measurements of the polarization and temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
