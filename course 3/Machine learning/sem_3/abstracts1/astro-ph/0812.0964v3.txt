Recent PAMELA data show that positron fraction has an excess above several GeV while anti-proton one is not. Moreover ATIC data indicates that electron/positron flux have a bump from 300 GeV to 800 GeV. Both annihilating dark matter (DM) with large boost factor and decaying DM with the life around $ 10^{26} s$ can account for the PAMELA and ATIC observations if their main final products are charged leptons ($e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). In this work, we calculated the neutrino flux arising from $\mu$ and $\tau$ which originate from annihilating/decaying DM, and estimated the final muon rate in the neutrino telescopes, namely Antares and IceCube. Given the excellent angular resolution, Antares and IceCube are promising to discover the neutrino signals from Galactic center and/or large DM subhalo in annihilating DM scenario, but very challenging in decaying DM scenario.
