The X- and gamma-ray telescope ECLAIRs onboard the future mission for gamma-ray burst studies SVOM (Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor) is foreseen to operate in orbit from 2013 on. ECLAIRs will provide fast and accurate GRB triggers to other onboard telescopes, as well as to the whole GRB community, in particular ground-based follow-up telescopes. With its very low energy threshold ECLAIRs is particularly well suited for the detection of highly redshifted GRB. The ECLAIRs X- and gamma-ray imaging camera (CXG), used for GRB detection and localization, is combined with a soft X-ray telescope (SXT) for afterglow observations and position refinement. The CXG is a 2D-coded mask imager with a 1024 cm$^2$ detection plane made of 80$\times$80 CdTe pixels, sensitive from 4 to 300 keV, with imaging capabilities up to about 120 keV and a localization accuracy better than 10 arcmin. The CXG permanently observes a 2 sr-wide field of the sky and provides photon data to the onboard science and triggering unit (UTS) which detects GRB by count-rate increases or by the appearance of a new source in cyclic sky images. The SXT is a mirror focusing X-ray telescope operating from 0.3 to 2 keV with a sensitivity of 1 mCrab for 100 s observations. The spacecraft slews within $\simeq$3 min in order to place the GRB candidate into the 23$\times$23 arcmin$^2$ field of view of the SXT, after which it refines the GRB position to about 10 arcsec. GRB alerts are transmitted to ground-observers within tens of seconds via a VHF network and all detected photons are available hours later for detailed analysis. In this paper we present the ECLAIRs concepts, with emphasis on the expected performances.
