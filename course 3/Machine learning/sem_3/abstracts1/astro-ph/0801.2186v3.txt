Context: New eclipse minimum timings of the M4.5/M4.5 binary CM Dra were obtained between the years 2000 and 2007. In combination with published timings going back to 1977, a clear non-linearity in observed-minus-calculated (O-C) times has become apparent. Several models are applied to explain the observed timing behavior.   Aims: Revealing the processes that cause the observed O-C behavior, and testing the evidence for a third body around the CM Dra system.   Methods: The O-C times of the system were fitted against several functions, representing different physical origins of the timing variations.   Results: An analysis using model-selection statistics gives about equal weight to a parabolic and to a sinusoidal fitting function. Attraction from a third body, either at large distance in a quasi-constant constellation across the years of observations or from a body on a shorter orbit generating periodicities in O-C times is the most likely source of the observed O-C times. The white dwarf GJ 630.1B, a proper motion companion of CM Dra, can however be rejected as the responsible third body. Also, no further evidence of the short-periodic planet candidate described by Deeg et al. (2000) is found, whereas other mechanisms, such as period changes from stellar winds or Applegate's mechanism can be rejected.   Conclusions: A third body, being either a few-Jupiter-mass object with a period of 18.5+-4.5 years or an object in the mass range of 1.5M_jup to 0.1M_sun with periods of hundreds to thousands of years is the most likely origin of the observed minimum timing behavior.
