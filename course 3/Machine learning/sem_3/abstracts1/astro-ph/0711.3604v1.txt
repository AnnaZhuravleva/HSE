This review discusses recent results on the astrochemistry of (mostly high-mass) star-forming regions. After an introduction on the use of chemistry in astrophysics and some basic concepts of astrochemistry, specific results are presented. Highlighted areas are the use of chemistry in the search for massive circumstellar disks, the interaction of molecular clouds with cosmic rays, and the feedback effects of protostellar irradiation on the parent molecular cloud. The review concludes with a discussion of future observational opportunities.
