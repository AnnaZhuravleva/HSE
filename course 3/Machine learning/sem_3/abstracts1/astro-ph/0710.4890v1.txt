This review presents a personal view of the role that starbursts play in the star formation history of the universe. It is mainly focused on the properties of nearby starburst galaxies selected for their strong UV and/or FIR emission. The similarities between local starbursts and star-forming galaxies at high redshift are also presented. I discuss too the role that LIRGs and ULIRGs and merging systems play in the formation and evolution of galaxies.
