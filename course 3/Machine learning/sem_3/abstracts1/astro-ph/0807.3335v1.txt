In a previous work, three bright MIR/radio sources were discovered in the nuclear region of NGC1365. We here confirm that these sources are young and massive ``embedded'' clusters, and derive their parameters, such as extinction, age and mass. Using ISAAC and VISIR at the VLT we obtained NIR and MIR maps and LR spectra. The dataset is first interpreted by comparing the observations with images and spectra of the close-by young cluster R136 in the LMC and then by using model predictions for both the nebular emission lines and the spectral energy distribution of the sources. We produce maps of the region containing the three sources in the R, J, Ks, L' bands and at 12.8micro. We also provide spectra in K, L and N. The spectral energy distribution of the three sources rises with wavelength. Emission lines from ionised hydrogen and molecular hydrogen are detected, as well as PAH emission. Conspicuous [NeII]12.8 line is also present, while neither the [ArIII] 8.9 nor the [SIV] 10.4 lines are detected. This provides a stringent constraint on the age of the sources: they are relatively evolved young clusters (6-8 Myr). Owing to their ionising photon rates and ages, they must be extremely massive clusters (around 10^7 solar masses). Their MIR spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of two components: (1) an optically thin component, with a continuum comparable to that of R136, and (2) an optically thick component which might be related to subsequent or on-going episodes of star formation. These sources are good candidates for evolving according to a bi-modal hydrodynamical regime, in which matter is trapped at the centre of a compact and massive cluster.
