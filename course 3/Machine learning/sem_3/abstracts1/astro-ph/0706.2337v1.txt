We present a study of the density profile of the remote M31 globular cluster B514, obtained from HST/ACS observations. Coupling the analysis of the distribution of the integrated light with star counts we can reliably follow the profile of the cluster out to r~35", corresponding to ~130pc. The profile is well fitted, out to ~15 core radii, by a King Model having C=1.65. With an estimated core radius r_c=0.38", this corresponds to a tidal radius of r_t~17" (~65pc). We find that both the light and the star counts profiles show a departure from the best fit King model for r>~8" - as a surface brightness excess at large radii, and the star counts profile shows a clear break in correspondence of the estimated tidal radius. Both features are interpreted as the signature of the presence of extratidal stars around the cluster. We also show that B514 has a half-light radius significantly larger than ordinary globular clusters of the same luminosity. In the M_V vs. log r_h plane, B514 lies in a region inhabited by peculiar clusters, like Omega Cen, G1, NGC2419 and others, as well as by the nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies.
