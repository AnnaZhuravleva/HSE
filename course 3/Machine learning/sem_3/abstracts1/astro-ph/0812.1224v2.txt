We analyze the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion rates peaked at about one percent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.
