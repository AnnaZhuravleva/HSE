We present the results of optical panoramic and long-slit spectroscopy of the nebula MF16 associated with the Ultraluminous X-ray Source NGC6946 ULX-1. More than 20 new emission lines are identified in the spectra. Using characteristic line ratios we find the electron density n_e ~ 600cm^{-3}, electron temperature in the range from ~9000K to ~20 000K (for different diagnostic lines) and the total emitting gas mass M ~ 900 Msolar. We also estimate the interstellar extinction towards the nebula as A_V = 1.m54 somewhat higher than the Galactic absorption. Observed line luminosities and ratios appear to be inconsistent with excitation and ionization by shock waves so we propose the central object responsible for powering the nebula. We estimate the parameters of the ionizing source using photon number estimates and Cloudy modelling. Required EUV luminosity ($\sim 10^{40}$\ergl) is high even if compared with the X-ray luminosity. We argue that independently of their physical nature ULXs are likely to be bright UV and EUV sources. It is shown that the UV flux expected in the GALEX spectral range (1000-3000Angstroms) is quite reachable for UV photometry. Measuring the luminosities and spectral slopes in the UV range may help to distinguish between the two most popular ULX models.
