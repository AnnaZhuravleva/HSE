In these proceedings I discuss various extragalactic surveys which will be undertaken over the next few years and which will be complementary to any HI and/or continuum surveys with the SKA-pathfinder telescopes. I concentrate on the near-infrared public surveys which will be undertaken with the Visible and Infrared Survey Telscope for Astronomy (VISTA), and in particular the VISTA Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey which will provide the ideal data set to combine with any deep SKA-pathfinder observations of the extragalactic sky. After highlighting the links that the SKA pathfinders have with the various VISTA surveys, I briefly describe an approved large area survey to be carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory which has a large scientific overlap with the SKA pathfinder telescopes.
