Recently, the MILAGRO collaboration reported on the detection of a diffuse multi-TeV emission from a region of the Galactic disk close to the inner Galaxy. The emission is in excess of what is predicted by conventional models for cosmic ray propagation, which are tuned to reproduce the spectrum of cosmic rays observed locally. By assuming that the excess detected by MILAGRO is of hadronic origin and that it is representative for the whole inner Galactic region, we estimate the expected diffuse flux of neutrinos from a region of the Galactic disk with coordinates $-40^{\circ} < l < 40^{\circ}$. Our estimate has to be considered as the maximal expected neutrino flux compatible with all the available gamma ray data, since any leptonic contribution to the observed gamma-ray emission would lower the neutrino flux. The diffuse flux of neutrinos, if close to the maximum allowed level, may be detected by a km$^3$--scale detector located in the northern hemisphere. A detection would unambiguously reveal the hadronic origin of the diffuse gamma-ray emission.
