We present the near- to mid-infared study of supernova remnants (SNRs) using the AKARI IRC Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC survey observed about a 10 square degree area of the LMC in five bands centered at 3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 \micron using the Infrared Camera (IRC) aboard AKARI. The number of SNRs in the survey area is 21, which is about a half of the known LMC SNRs. We systematically examined the AKARI images and identified eight SNRs with distinguishable infrared emission. All of them were detected at $\gtrsim 10$ \micron and some at 3 and 7 \micron, too. We present their AKARI images and fluxes. In the 11/15 \micron versus 15/24 \micron color-color diagram, the SNRs appear to be aligned along a modified blackbody curve, representing thermal emission from dust at temperatures between 90 and 190 K. There is a good correlation between the 24 \micron and X-ray fluxes of the SNRs. It was also found that there is a good correlation between the 24 \micron and radio fluxes even if there is no direct physical connection between them. We considered the origin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual SNRs. We conclude that the mid-infrared emissions in five SNRs that show morphologies similar to the X-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by X-ray emitting plasma. Their 15/24 \micron color temperatures are generally higher than the Spitzer 24/70 \micron color temperatures, which suggests that a single-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energy distribution (SED) of the SNRs. It also implies that our understanding of the full SED is essential for estimating the dust destruction rate of grains by SNR shocks.
