We present the results from the on-going radio monitoring of recent type II supernovae (SNe), including SNe 2004et, 2004dj, 2002hh, 2001em, and 2001gd. Using the Very Large Array to monitor these supernovae, we present their radio light-curves. From these data we are able to discuss parameterizations and modeling and make predictions of the nature of the progenitors based on previous research. Derived mass loss rates assume wind-established circumstellar medium, shock velocity ~10,000 km/s, wind velocity ~10 km/s, and CSM Temperature ~10,000 K.
