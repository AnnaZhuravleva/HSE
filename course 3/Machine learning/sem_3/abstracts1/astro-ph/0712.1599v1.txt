General relativity as one the pillar of modern cosmology has to be thoroughly tested if we want to achieve an accurate cosmology. We present the results from such a test on cosmological scales using cosmic shear and galaxy clustering measurements. We parametrize potential deviation from general relativity as a modification to the cosmological Poisson equation. We consider two models relevant either for some linearized theory of massive gravity or for the physics of extra-dimensions. We use the latest observations from the CFHTLS-Wide survey and the SDSS survey to set our constraints. We do not find any deviation from general relativity on scales between 0.04 and 10 Mpc. We derive constraints on the graviton mass in a restricted class of model.
