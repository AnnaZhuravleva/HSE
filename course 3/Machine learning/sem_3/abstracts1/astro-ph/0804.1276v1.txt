We present new results from follow-up time-resolved spectroscopy of radial velocity variable hot subdwarfs from the SPY project. Medium resolution spectra were taken at the ESO NTT. Preliminary orbital solutions are presented for three single-lined sdO/B binaries. The orbital periods of all binaries are short and the companions are most likely white dwarfs or late main-sequence stars. Follow-up time-resolved spectroscopy is necessary to measure the orbital parameters with higher accuracy. Light curves should be taken in order to search for reflection effects and or eclipses.
