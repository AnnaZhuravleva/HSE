We distinguish two types of stickiness in systems of two degrees of freedom (a) stickiness around an island of stability and (b) stickiness in chaos, along the unstable asymptotic curves of unstable periodic orbits. We studied these effects in the standard map with a rather large nonlinearity K=5, and we emphasized the role of the asymptotic curves U, S from the central orbit O and the asymptotic curves U+U-S+S- from the simplest unstable orbit around the island O1. We calculated the escape times (initial stickiness times) for many initial points outside but close to the island O1. The lines that separate the regions of the fast from the slow escape time follow the shape of the asymptotic curves S+,S-. We explained this phenomenon by noting that lines close to S+ on its inner side (closer to O1) approach a point of the orbit 4/9, say P1, and then follow the oscillations of the asymptotic curve U+, and escape after a rather long time, while the curves outside S+ after their approach to P1 follow the shape of the asymptotic curves U- and escape fast into the chaotic sea. All these curves return near the original arcs of U+,U- and contribute to the overall stickiness close to U+,U-. The isodensity curves follow the shape of the curves U+,U- and the maxima of density are along U+,U-. For a rather long time the stickiness effects along U+,U- are very pronounced. However after much longer times (about 1000 iterations) the overall stickiness effects are reduced and the distribution of points in the chaotic sea outside the islands tends to be uniform.
