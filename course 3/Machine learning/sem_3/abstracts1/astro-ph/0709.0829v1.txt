The collapsar model for long gamma-ray bursts requires a rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet star as progenitor. We test the idea of producing rapidly rotating Wolf-Rayet stars in massive close binaries through mass accretion and consecutive quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution; the latter had previously been shown to provide collapsars below a certain metallicity threshold for single stars. The binary channel presented here may provide a means for massive stars to obtain the high rotation rates required to evolve quasi-chemically homogeneous and fulfill the collapsar scenario. Moreover, it suggests that a possibly large fraction of long gamma-ray bursts occurs in runaway stars.
