Recent studies of massive O-type stars present clear evidences of inhomogeneous and clumped winds. O-type (H-rich) central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNs) are in some ways the low mass-low luminosity analogous of those massive stars. In this contribution, we present preliminary results of our on-going multi-wavelength (FUV, UV and optical) study of the winds of Galactic CSPNs. Particular emphasis will be given to the clumping factors derived by means of optical lines (Halpha and HeII4686) and "classic" FUV (and UV) lines.
