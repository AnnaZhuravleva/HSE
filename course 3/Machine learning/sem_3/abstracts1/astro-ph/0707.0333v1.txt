We have used the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer (SUSI) to measure the angular diameter of beta Hydri. This star is a nearby G2 subgiant whose mean density was recently measured with high precision using asteroseismology. We determine the radius and effective temperature of the star to be 1.814+/-0.017 R_sun (0.9%) and 5872+/-44 K (0.7%) respectively. By combining this value with the mean density, as estimated from asteroseismology, we make a direct estimate of the stellar mass. We find a value of 1.07+/-0.03 M_sun (2.8%), which agrees with published estimates based on fitting in the H-R diagram, but has much higher precision. These results place valuable constraints on theoretical models of beta Hyi and its oscillation frequencies.
