The recent discovery of a fifth planet bound to 55 Cancri (Fischer et. al 2007) motivated us to investigate if this exo-planetary system fits some form of the Titius-Bode (TB) law. We found that a simple exponential TB relation reproduces very well the five observed major semi-axis, provided we assign the orbital n = 6 to the largest a. This way of counting leaves empty the position n = 5, a situation curiously reminiscent of TB law in our planetary system, before the discovery of Ceres. The application of an exponential TB relation to 55 Cancri allows us to predict the existence of a planet at a = 2.0 AU with a period of P = 1130 days located within the large gap between a = 0.781 AU (P = 260 days) and a = 5.77 AU (P = 5218 days). With less certainty, we also predict a seventh planet at a = 15 AU with P = 62 years.
