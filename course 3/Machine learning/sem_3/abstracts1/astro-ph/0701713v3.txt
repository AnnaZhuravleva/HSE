By combining the VVDS with the SWIRE data, we have built the currently largest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-frame near-infrared. These allow us to investigate, for the first time using spectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected from their rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2<z<2.1. Therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to study the three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with IRAC and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from first epoch VVDS. We find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns, the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. In addition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher when galaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. These values are larger than the typical values found for I-band selected galaxies in the same redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering length between I-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing with increasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. We interpret this as evidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies actively forming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlier than z~1.5. The increasing difference in clustering length observed between rest-frame UV-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indication that star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmic time increases.
