We selected a sample of a dozen blazars which are the prime candidates for simultaneous multi-wavelength observing campaigns in their outburst phase. We searched for optical outbursts, intra-day variability and short term variability in these blazars. We carried out optical photometric monitoring of nine of these blazars in 13 observing nights during our observing run October 27, 2006 - March 20, 2007 by using the 1.02 meter optical telescope. From our observations, our data favor the hypothesis that three blazars were in the outburst state; one blazar was in the post outburst state; three blazars were in the pre/post outburst state; one blazar was in the low-state; and the state of one blazar was not known because there is not much optical data available for the blazar to compare with our observations. Out of three nights of observations of AO 0235+164, intra-day variability was detected in two nights. Out of five nights of observations of S5 0716+714, intra-day variability was detected in two nights. In one night of observations of PKS 0735+178, intra-day variability was detected. Out of six nights of observations of 3C 454.3, intra-day variability was detected in three nights. No intra-day variability was detected in S2 0109+224, OJ 287, ON 231, 3C 279 and 1ES 2344+514 in their 1, 4, 1, 2 and 1 nights of observations respectively. AO 0235+164, S5 0716+714, OJ 287, 3C 279 and 3C 454.3 were observed in more than one night and short term variations in all these blazars were also noticed. From our observations and the available data, we found that the predicted optical outburst with the time interval of ~ 8 years in AO 0235+164 and ~ 3 years in S5 0716+714 have possibly occurred.
