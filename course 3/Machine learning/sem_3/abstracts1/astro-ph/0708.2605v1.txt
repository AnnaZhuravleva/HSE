Abridged. We present high-quality optical spectra for 12 powerful radio sources at low and intermediate redshifts (z < 0.7) that show evidence for a substantial UV excess. These data were taken using the WHT and VLT to determine the detailed properties of the young stellar populations (YSPs) in the host galaxies as part of a larger project to investigate evolutionary scenarios for the AGN host galaxies. The results of our spectral synthesis model fits to the spectra highlight the importance of taking into account AGN-related components (emission lines, nebular continuum, scattered light) and reddening of the stellar populations in studies of this type. It is also clear that careful examination of the fits to the spectra, as well consideration of auxilary polarimetric and imaging data, are required to avoid degeneracies in the model solutions. In 3/12 sources in our sample we find broad permitted line components, and a combination of AGN-related continuum components and an old (12.5 Gyr) stellar population provides an adequate fit to the data. In the remaining 9 sources we find strong evidence for YSPs. In contrast to some recent studies that suggest relatively old post-starburst ages for the YSPs in radio galaxies (0.3-2.5 Gyr), we deduce a wide range of ages for the YSPs in our sample objects (0.02-1.5 Gyr), with ~50% of the sample showing evidence for young YSP ages (<~0.1 Gyr) in their nuclear regions. The nuclear YSPs are often significantly reddened (0.2 < E(B-V) < 1.4) and make up a substantial fraction (~1-35%) of the total stellar mass in the regions sampled by the spectroscopic slits. Moreover, in all the cases in which we have sufficient spatial resolution we find that the UV excess is extended across the full measureable extent of the galaxy (typically 5-30 kpc), suggesting galaxy-wide starbursts.
