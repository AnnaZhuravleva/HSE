AMS-02 is a multi-purpose spectrometer with superconducting magnet, and is designed for 3 years of data taking aboard the International Space Station. Its high performance regarding particle identification and energy measurement will allow performing indirect searches for dark matter (DM) in different channels simultaneously: gamma rays, positrons and antiprotons. AMS-02 sensitivity to those signals are presented and --provided the positron excess is due to DM signal-- it is shown that it allows to probe new physics models in detail. Its high sensitivity could even be a unique opportunity to reach the Majorana nature of the DM particle through final state polarization effects.
