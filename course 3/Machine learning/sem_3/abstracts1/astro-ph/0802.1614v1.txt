We present an up-to-date estimate for the prospect of using the Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices (ASTROD) for an unambiguous detection of solar g modes (f < 400 micro Hertz) through their gravitational signature. There are currently two major efforts to detect low-frequency gravitational effects, ASTROD and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Using the most recent g mode surface amplitude estimates, both observational and theoretical, it is unclear whether LISA will be capable of successfully detecting these modes. The ASTROD project may be better suited for detection as its sensitivity curve is shifted towards lower frequencies with the best sensitivity occurring in the range 100-300 micro Hertz.
