We carry out the self-similar solutions of viscous-resistive accretion flows around a magnetized compact object. We consider an axisymmetric, rotating, isotheral steady accretion flow which contains a poloidal magnetic field of the central star. The dominant mechanism of energy dissipation is assumed to be the turbulence viscosity and magnetic diffusivity due to magnetic field of the central star. We explore the effect of viscosity on a rotating disk in the presence of constant magnetic diffusivity. We show that the dynamical quantities of ADAFs are sensitive to the advection and viscosity parameters. Increase of the $\alpha$ coefficient in the $\alpha$-prescription model decreases the radial velocity and increases the density of the flow. It also affects the poloidal magnetic field considerably.
