In previous studies, we have examined a resonant excitation of disk oscillations in deformed disks. In these studies, however, mathematical treatment around the resonant points was not rigorous. In this paper the inadequate point is corrected, with no essential changes in the final results. For this excitation process to work, disks must be general relativistic. That is, the non-monotonic radial distribution of epicyclic frequency in relativistic disks is essential for the presence of the resonance and for trapping of oscillations. In this paper, the growth rate of resonant oscillations is expressed in a form more suitable for numerical calculations.
