New observations over the next few years of the emission of distant objects will help unfold the chapter in cosmic history around the era of the first galaxies. These observations will use the neutral hydrogen emission or absorption at a wavelength of 21-cm as a detector of the hydrogen abundance. We predict the signature on the 21-cm signal of the early generations of galaxies. We calculate the 21-cm power spectrum including two physical effects that were neglected in previous calculations. The first is the redistribution of the UV photons from the first galaxies due to their scattering off of the neutral hydrogen, which results in an enhancement of the 21-cm signal. The second is the presence of an ionized hydrogen bubble near each source, which produces a cutoff at observable scales. We show that the resulting clear signature in the 21-cm power spectrum can be used to detect and study the population of galaxies that formed just 200 million years after the Big Bang.
