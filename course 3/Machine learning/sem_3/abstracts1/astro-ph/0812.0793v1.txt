This is a report on the findings of the extragalactic science working group for the white paper on the status and future of TeV gamma-ray astronomy. The white paper was commissioned by the American Physical Society, and the full white paper can be found on astro-ph (arXiv:0810.0444). This detailed section discusses extragalactic science topics including active galactic nuclei, cosmic ray acceleration in galaxies, galaxy clusters and large scale structure formation shocks, and the study of the extragalactic infrared and optical background radiation. The scientific potential of ground based gamma-ray observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts and dark matter annihilation radiation is covered in other sections of the white paper.
