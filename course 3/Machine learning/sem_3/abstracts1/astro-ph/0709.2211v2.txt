We present a theoretical calculation on the time-variability of the fine-structure constant to fit the result of the recent precise analysis of the measurement of the QSO absorption lines. We find the parameters and initial values of the scalar-tensor theory to be determined much more accurately than fitting the accelerating universe itself, but leading not to easy detections of the effect on the equation of state of the dark energy in the earlier epochs.
