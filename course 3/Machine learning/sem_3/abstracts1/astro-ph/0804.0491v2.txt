We present 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a precessing jet propagating inside a supernova remnant (SNR) shell, particularly applied to the W50-SS433 system in a search for the origin of its peculiar elongated morphology. Several runs were carried out with different values for the mass loss rate of the jet, the initial radius of the SNR, and the opening angle of the precession cone. We found that our models successfully reproduce the scale and morphology of W50 when the opening angle of the jets is set to 10$\degr$ or if this angle linearly varies with time. For these models, more realistic runs were made considering that the remnant is expanding into an interstellar medium (ISM) with an exponential density profile (as HI observations suggest). Taking into account all these ingredients, the large scale morphology of the W50-SS 433 system, including the asymmetry between the lobes (formed by the jet-SNR interaction), is well reproduced.
