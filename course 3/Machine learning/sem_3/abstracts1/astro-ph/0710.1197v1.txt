This paper reviews the evidence for interaction between radio jets and their environment in small and intermediate (sub-kpc) scale radio sources. Observations of gas (both neutral hydrogen and ionised gas) have shown the presence of fast (> 1000 km/s) outflows likely originating from this interaction. The characteristics of these AGN-driven outflows (e.g. mass outflow rate) indicate that they may have a relevant impact on the evolution of the host galaxy. We also report on the detection of large HI disks found around the host galaxies of nearby compact radio sources. Similar structures have so far not been detected around large radio sources. The presence of these structures in relation to the evolution of young compact radio sources is discussed.
