The value of the Hubble Parameter (H0) is determined using the morphologically type dependent Ks-band Tully-Fisher Relation (K-TFR). The slope and zero point are determined using 36 calibrator galaxies with ScI morphology. Calibration distances are adopted from direct Cepheid distances, and group or companion distances derived with the Surface Brightness Fluctuation Method or Type Ia Supernova. Distances are determined to 16 galaxy clusters and 218 ScI galaxies with minimum distances of 40.0 Mpc. From the 16 galaxy clusters a weighted mean Hubble Parameter of H0=84.2 +/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1 is found. From the 218 ScI galaxies a Hubble Parameter of H0=83.4 +/-8 km s-1 Mpc-1 is found. When the zero point of the K-TFR is corrected to account for recent results that find a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus of 18.39 +/-0.05 a Hubble Parameter of 88.0 +/-6 km s-1 Mpc-1 is found. A comparison with the results of the Hubble Key Project (Freedman et al 2001) is made and discrepancies between the K-TFR distances and the HKP I-TFR distances are discussed. Implications for Lamda-CDM cosmology are considered with H0=84 km s-1 Mpc-1. (Abridged)
