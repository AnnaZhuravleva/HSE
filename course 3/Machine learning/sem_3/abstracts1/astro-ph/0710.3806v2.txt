We present a ballistic description of the formation and propagation of the working surface of a relativistic jet. Using simple laws of conservation of mass and linear momentum at the working surface, we obtain a full description of the working surface flow parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection rate. This allows us to compute analytically the energy release at any time in the working surface. We compare this model with the results obtained numerically through a new hydrodynamical code applied to the propagation of a relativistic fluid in one dimension in order to test the limits of our study. Finally, we compare our analytical results with observed light curves of five long gamma ray bursts and show that our model is in very good agreement with observations using simple periodic variations of the injected velocity profiles. This simple method allows us to recover initial mass discharge and energy output ejected during the burst.
