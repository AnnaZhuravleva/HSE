The transient X-ray binary pulsar A0535+262 was observed with Suzaku on 2005 September 14 when the source was in the declining phase of the August-September minor outburst. The ~103 s X-ray pulse profile was strongly energy dependent, a double peaked profile at soft X-ray energy band (<3 keV) and a single peaked smooth profile at hard X-rays. The width of the primary dip is found to be increasing with energy. The broad-band energy spectrum of the pulsar is well described with a Negative and Positive power-law with EXponential (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody component for soft excess. A weak iron K_alpha emission line with an equivalent width ~25 eV was detected in the source spectrum. The blackbody component is found to be pulsating over the pulse phase implying the accretion column and/or the inner edge of the accretion disk may be the possible emission site of the soft excess in A0535+262. The higher value of the column density is believed to be the cause of the secondary dip at the soft X-ray energy band. The iron line equivalent width is found to be constant (within errors) over the pulse phase. However, a sinusoidal type of flux variation of iron emission line, in phase with the hard X-ray flux suggests that the inner accretion disk is the possible emission region of the iron fluorescence line.
