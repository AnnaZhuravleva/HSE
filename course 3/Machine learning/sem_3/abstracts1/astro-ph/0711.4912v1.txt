This chapter reviews progress in the field of massive star formation. It focuses on evidence for accretion and current models that invoke high accretion rates. In particular it is noted that high accretion rates will cause the massive young stellar object to have a radius much larger than its eventual main sequence radius throughout much of the accretion phase. This results in low effective temperatures which may provide the explanation as to why luminous young stellar objects do not ionized their surroundings to form ultra-compact H II regions. The transition to the ultra-compact H II region phase would then be associated with the termination of the high accretion rate phase. Objects thought to be in a transition phase are discussed and diagnostic diagrams to distinguish between massive young stellar objects and ultra-compact H II regions in terms of line widths and radio luminosity are presented.
