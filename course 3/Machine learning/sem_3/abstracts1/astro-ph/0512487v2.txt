We report on a large scale numerical study of networks of semilocal cosmic strings in flat space in the parameter regime in which they are perturbatively stable. We find a population of segments with an exponential length distribution and indications of a scaling network without significant loop formation. Very deep in the stability regime strings of superhorizon size grow rapidly and ``percolate'' through the box. We believe these should lead at late times to a population of infinite strings similar to topologically stable strings. However, the strings are very light; scalar gradients dominate the energy density and the network has thus a global texture-like signature. As a result, the observational constraints, at least from the temperature power spectrum of the CMB, on models predicting semilocal strings, should be closer to those on global textures or monopoles, rather than on topologically stable gauged cosmic strings.
