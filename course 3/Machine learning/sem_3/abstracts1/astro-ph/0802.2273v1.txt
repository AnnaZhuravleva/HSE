We report a complete 2mm spectral line survey (130-170 GHz) taken with the NRAO 12m Telescope between 1993 and 1995 toward the following sources: Sgr B2N, Sgr B2OH, IRC +10 216, Orion (KL), Orion-S, W51M, and W3(IRS5).   Until very recently, this project was entirely the work of B. E. Turner. He wrote the original proposal, given below without changes or updates, and did all of the observing. B.E. Turner has fallen seriously ill and can no longer continue to work on the analysis of these data. The notes that follow the proposal give further information about the project and important information for users of these data.   The data are distributed using the Spectral Line Search Engine (SLiSE) developed by A. J. Remijan and M. J. Remijan. SLiSE is a data display tool that will contain all the fully reduced and calibrated archived data taken as part of this 2mm survey. SLiSE is fast, easy to use, and contains the necessary functionality to display the data taken from spectral line searches. For example, SLiSE contains functions to overlay possible molecule identifications based on a current line catalog as well as overlaying H and He recombination lines. It is a Java-based applet, so it is platform independent and easily accessed online. The only caveat is that SLiSE was built using Java 1.5, so an update to the user's Java may be necessary.   We request users of these data to give B.E. Turner and this work the appropriate citation and credit.
