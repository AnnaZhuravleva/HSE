Although full interoperativity between theoretical and observational data in the framework of the Virtual Observatory would be a very desirable achievement, the current status of VO offers few approaches to handle theoretical models. TSAP (Theoretical Spectra Access Protocol) has been proposed as a tool to fill this void, providing a simple scheme to easily operate with th is kind of data. TSAP is useful not only for synthetic spectra but also for other types of theoretical data. As an example we show an Isochrone and Evolutionary Tracks server using TSAP. Finally, we pay special attention to the correct treatment of the credits an important issue in the field of theoretical models.
