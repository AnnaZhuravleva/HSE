If there is a hidden photon -- i.e. a light abelian gauge boson in the hidden sector -- its kinetic mixing with the standard photon can produce a hidden cosmic microwave background (hCMB). For meV masses, resonant photon-hidden photon oscillations happen after nucleosynthesis (BBN) but before CMB decoupling, increasing the effective number of neutrinos but also the baryon to photon ratio. The current agreement between BBN and CMB data provides new constraints on the kinetic mixing. However, if one includes Lyman-alpha data, an effective number of neutrinos higher than 3 is preferred. It is tempting to interpret this effect in terms of the hCMB. Interestingly, the required parameters will be tested in the near future by laboratory experiments.
