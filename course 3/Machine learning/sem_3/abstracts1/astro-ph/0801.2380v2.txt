We have conducted a systematic survey for intervening OVI absorbers in available echelle spectra of 16 QSOs at z_QSO = 0.17-0.57. These spectra were obtained using HST/STIS with the E140M grating. Our search uncovered a total of 27 foreground OVI absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width W_r(1031) > 25mA. Ten of these QSOs exhibit strong OVI absorbers in their vicinity. Our OVI survey does not require the known presence of Lya, and the echelle resolution allows us to identify the OVI absorption doublet based on their common line centroid and known flux ratio. We estimate the total redshift survey path, \Delta z, using a series of Monte-Carlo simulations, and find that \Delta z=1.66, 2.18, and 2.42 for absorbers of strength W_r = 30, 50 and 80mA, respectively, leading to a number density of dN(W > 50mA)/dz = 6.7 +/- 1.7 and dN(W > 30mA)/dz = 10.4 +/- 2.2. In contrast, we also measure dN/dz = 27 +/- 9 for OVI absorbers of W_r > 50mA at |\Delta v|< 5000 kms from the background QSOs. Using the random sample of OVI absorbers with well characterized survey completeness, we estimate a mean cosmological mass density of the OVI gas \Omega(OVI)h = 1.7 +/- 0.3 x 10^-7. In addition, we show that <5% of OVI absorbers originate in underdense regions that do not show a significant trace of HI. Furthermore, we show that the neutral gas column N(HI) associated with these OVI absorbers spans nearly five orders of magnitude, and show moderate correlation with N(OVI). Finally, while the number density of OVI absorbers varies substantially from one sightline to another, it also appears to be inversely correlated with the number density of HI absorbers along individual lines of sight.
