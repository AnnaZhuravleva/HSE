We study the effects of dust in hydrodynamic simulations of spiral galaxies when different radial metallicity gradients are assumed. SUNRISE, a Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code, is used to make detailed calculations of the internal extinction of disk galaxies caused by their dust content.   SUNRISE is used on eight different Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of isolated spiral galaxies. These galaxies vary mainly in mass and hence luminosity, spanning a range in luminosities from -16 to -22 magnitudes in the B band. We focus on the attenuation in different wavelength bands as a function of the disk inclination and the luminosity of the models, and compare this to observations.   Observations suggest different metallicity gradients for galaxies of different luminosities. These metallicity gradients were explored in our different models, finding that the resulting dust attenuation matches observations for edge-on galaxies, but do not show a linear behaviour in log axis ratio as some observations have suggested. A quadratic law describing the dependence of attenuation on inclination, as proposed by more recent observations, reconciles the attenuation of the simulations at intermediate inclinations with observations. We also compare the total infrared-to-ultraviolet flux ratios for the simulated galaxies with those of the SINGS sample and find general agreement. Finally we compare our results with those from simpler models that do not take into account structure such as spiral arms, finding that the inclusion of sub-structure on the size scale of spiral arms does not change conclusions about the attenuation dependence on inclination or wavelength.
