The relevant gamma energy range is explicitly identified where additional gamma$ strength has to be located for having an impact on astrophysically relevant reactions. It is shown that folding the energy dependences of the transmission coefficients and the level density leads to maximal contributions for gamma energies of 2<=E_gamma<=4 MeV unless quantum selection rules allow isolated states to contribute. Under this condition, electric dipole transitions dominate. These findings allow to more accurately judge the relevance of modifications of the \gamma strength for astrophysics.
