We use coordinated Hinode SOT/EIS observations that include high-resolution magnetograms, chromospheric and TR imaging and TR/coronal spectra in a first test to study how the dynamics of the TR are driven by the highly dynamic photospheric magnetic fields and the ubiquitous chromospheric waves. Initial analysis shows that these connections are quite subtle and require a combination of techniques including magnetic field extrapolations, frequency-filtered time-series and comparisons with synthetic chromospheric and TR images from advanced 3D numerical simulations. As a first result, we find signatures of magnetic flux emergence as well as 3 and 5 mHz wave power above regions of enhanced photospheric magnetic field in both chromospheric, transition region and coronal emission.
