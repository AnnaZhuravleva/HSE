Magnetic field modifies the properties of waves in a complex way. Significant advances has been made recently in our understanding of the physics of waves in solar active regions with the help of analytical theories, numerical simulations, as well as hi-resolution observations. In this contribution we review the current ideas in the field, with the emphasis on theoretical models of waves in sunspots.
