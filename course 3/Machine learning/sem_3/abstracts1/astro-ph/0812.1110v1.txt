We study the Euler-Poisson equations of describing the evolution of the gaseous star in astrophysics. Firstly, we construct a family of analytical blowup solutions for the isothermal case in R^2. Furthermore the blowup rate of the above solutions is also studied and some remarks about the applicability of such solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations and the drift-diffusion model in semiconductors are included. Finally, for the isothermal case, the result of Makino and Perthame for the tame solutions is extended to show that the life span of such solutions must be finite if the initial data is with compact support.
