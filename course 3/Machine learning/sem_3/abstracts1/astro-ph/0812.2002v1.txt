The multifaceted role of the density dependent nuclear symmetry energy in the nuclear astrophysics involving neutron stars is highlighted. Efforts toward a model independent determination of the dense matter equation state through a deconstruction of the neutron star structure equation utilizing the masses and radii of several individual neutron stars are described. The need for observational data of both measurements for the same star is stressed.
