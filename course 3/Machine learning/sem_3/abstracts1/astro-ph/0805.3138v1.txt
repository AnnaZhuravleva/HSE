The advance of perihelion for geodesic motion on the galactic plane of some exact general relativistic disc solutions is calculated. Approximate analytical and numerical results are presented for the static Chazy-Curzon and the Schwarzschild discs in Weyl coordinates, the Schwarzschid disc in isotropic coordinantes and the stationary Kerr disc in the Weyl-Lewis-Papapetrou metrics. It is found that for these disc models the advance of perihelion may be an increasing or decreasing function of the orbital excentricity. The precession due to Newtonian gravity for these disc models is also calculated.
