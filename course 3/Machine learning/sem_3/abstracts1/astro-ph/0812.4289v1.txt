We exploit the accumulating, high-quality, multi-wavelength imaging data of nearby supernova (SN) hosts to explore the relationship between SN production and host galaxy evolution. The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX, Martin et al., 2005) provides ultraviolet (UV) imaging in two bands, complementing data in the optical and infra-red (IR). We compare host properties, derived from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, with nearby, well-observed SN Ia light curve properties. We also explore where the hosts of different types of SNe fall relative to the red and blue sequences on the galaxy UV-optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD, Wyder et al., 2007). We conclude that further exploration and larger samples will provide useful results for constraining the progenitors of SNe.
