The Stokes V parameter characterizes asymmetry of amplitudes between right- and left-handed waves, and non-vanishing value of the V parameter yields a circularly polarized signal. Cosmologically, V parameter may be a direct probe for parity violation in the universe. In this paper, we theoretically investigate a measurement of this parameter, particularly focusing on the gravitational-wave backgrounds observed via ground-based interferometers. In contrast to the traditional analysis that only considers the total amplitude (or equivalently $\Omega_{GW}$), the signal analysis including a circular-polarized mode has a rich structure due to the multi-dimensionality of target parameters. We show that, by using the network of next-generation detectors, separation between polarized and unpolarized modes can be performed with small statistical loss induced by their correlation.
