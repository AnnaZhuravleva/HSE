The discrete kinetic model is used to study the propagation of sound waves in system of hard-disk-like rotating stars (or vortex gases). The anomalous (negative) attenuation or amplification which is possibly due to the binary collision of a dilute-enough rotating disk (or vortex-gas) system (each with opposite-sign rotating direction or angular momenta but the total (net) angular momenta or vorticity is zero) or microreversibility might arise from the implicit balance of the angular momentum during encounter and give clues to the understanding of possible acceleration of cosmic rays passing through this kind of channel and direct or inverse vortex-gas cascades in two-dimensional turbulence of astrophysical problems.
