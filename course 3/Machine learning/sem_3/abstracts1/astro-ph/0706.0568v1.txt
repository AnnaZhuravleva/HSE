We present a "feedback compression" model to describe the galactic spheroid formation and its relation with the central nuclear activity. We suggest that the star formation itself can serve as the "positive feedback" in some extremely dense region to trigger the starburst. The star formation rate as well as the related stellar feedback-induced turbulence will be maximized under the regulation of the background dark halo's gravity. There is also stellar feedback acting inward to confine and obscure the central black hole (BH) till the BH grows sufficiently large to satisfy a balance condition between the accretion disk wind and the inward stellar feedback. The extremely vigorous star formation activity, the BH - bulge relations, the maximum velocity dispersion as well as the maximum BH mass are investigated based on such scenario, and are found to be consistent with observations.
