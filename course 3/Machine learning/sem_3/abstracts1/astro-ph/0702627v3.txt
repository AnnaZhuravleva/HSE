The CMB power spectra are studied for different families of single field new and chaotic inflation models in the effective field theory approach to inflation. We implement a systematic expansion in 1/N_e where N_e ~ 50 is the number of e-folds before the end of inflation. We study the dependence of the observables (n_s, r and dn_s/d\ln k) on the degree of the potential (2 n) and confront them to the WMAP3 and large scale structure data: this shows in general that fourth degree potentials (n=2) provide the best fit to the data; the window of consistency with the WMAP3 and LSS data narrows for growing n. New inflation models yield a good fit to the r and n_s data in a wide range of field and parameter space. Small field inflation yields r<0.16 while large field inflation yields r>0.16 (for N_e=50). All members of the new inflation family predict a small but negative running -4(n+1)10^{-4}< dn_s/d\ln k <-2 10^{-4}. A reconstruction program is carried out suggesting quite generallythat for n_s consistent with the WMAP3 and LSS data and r<0.1 the symmetry breaking scale for new inflation is |\phi_0| ~ 10 M_{Pl} while the field scale at Hubble crossing is |\phi_{50}| ~ M_{Pl}.The family of chaotic models feature r>0.16 (for N_e=50) and only a restricted subset of chaotic models are consistent with the combined WMAP3 bounds on r, n_s,dn_s/d\ln k with a narrow window in field amplitude around |\phi_{50}| ~ 15 M_{Pl}.A measurement of r<0.16 (for N_e =50) will distinctly rule out a large class of chaotic scenarios and will favor new inflationary models. As a general consequence, new inflation emerges more favoured than chaotic inflation.
