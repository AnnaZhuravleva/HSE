Global star formation is the key to understanding galaxy disk formation. This in turn depends on gravitational instability of disks and continuing gas accretion as well as minor merging. A key component is feedback from supernovae. Primary observational constraints on disk galaxy formation and evolution include the Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the Tully-Fisher relation and the galaxy luminosity function. I will review how theory confronts phenomenology, and discuss future prospects for refining our understanding of disk formation.
