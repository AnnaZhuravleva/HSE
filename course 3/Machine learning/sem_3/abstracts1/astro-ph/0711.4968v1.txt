We present meridional flow measurements of the Sun using a novel helioseismic approach for analyzing SOHO/MDI data in order to push the current limits in radial depth. Analyzing three consecutive months of data during solar minimum, we find that the meridional flow is as expected poleward in the upper convection zone, turns equatorward at a depth of around 40 Mm (~0.95 Rsol), and possibly changes direction again in the lower convection zone. This may indicate two meridional circulation cells in each hemisphere, one beneath the other.
