Cruz et al. recently showed that the CMB cold spot can be explained by a GUT-scale texture. But following Turok's argument that gauged configurations always relax quickly, they posit a global symmetry, without obvious relation to GUTs. An observation by Nambu invalidates Turok's argument when the broken symmetry group has commuting generators. This is demonstrated explicitly in the standard model of electroweak interactions and holds generally for intermediate SSB stages in GUTs. The cold spot could therefore be due to a GUT texture, and electroweak Higgs gradients may evolve indefinitely.
