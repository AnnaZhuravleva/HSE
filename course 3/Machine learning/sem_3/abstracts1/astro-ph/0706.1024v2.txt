We review some of the properties of chameleon theories. Chameleon fields are gravitationally coupled to matter and evade gravitational tests thanks to two fundamental properties. The first one is the density dependence of the chameleon mass. In most cases, in a dense environment, chameleons are massive enough to induce a short ranged fifth force. In other cases, non-linear effects imply the existence of a thin shell effect shielding compact bodies from each other and leading to an irrelevant fifth force. We also mention how a natural extension of chameleon theories can play a role to solve the PVLAS versus CAST discrepancy.
