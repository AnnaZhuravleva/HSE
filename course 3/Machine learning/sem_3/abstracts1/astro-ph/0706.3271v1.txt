The high resolution spectra of a R CrB type star Z UMi are analysed. The atmospheric parameters of Z UMi are estimated: Teff=5250+/-250K and log g=0.5+/-0.3. This places Z UMi among the coolest R CrB stars. The hydrogen deficiency of Z UMi is confirmed. The abundances of other elements resemble those found for the minority group of R CrB stars. We note very low iron abundance, [Fe/H]=-1.85, and an excess of lithium, [Li/Fe]=+1.9.
