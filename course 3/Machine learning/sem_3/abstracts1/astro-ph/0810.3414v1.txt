The main goals of the HELAS local helioseismology network activity are to consolidate this field of research in Europe, to organise scientific workshops, and to facilitate the distribution of observations and data analysis software. Most of this is currently accomplished via a dedicated website at http://www.mps.mpg.de/projects/seismo/NA4/ . In this paper we list the outreach material, observational data, analysis tools and modelling tools currently available from the website and describe the focus of the scientific workshops and their proceedings.
