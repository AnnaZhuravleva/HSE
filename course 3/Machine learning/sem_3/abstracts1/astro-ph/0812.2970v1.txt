The IAU-1976 System of astronomical constants includes three astronomical units (i.e. for time, mass and length). This paper reports on the status of the astronomical unit of length (ua) and mass (MSun) within the context of the recent IAU Resolutions on reference systems and the use of modern observations in the solar system. We especially look at a possible re-definition of the ua as an astronomical unit of length defined trough a fixed relation to the SI metre by a defining number.
