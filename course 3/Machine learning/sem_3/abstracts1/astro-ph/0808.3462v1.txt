An oscillating, homogeneous and isotropic Universe which arises from Scalar-Tensor gravity is discussed in the linearized approach, showing that some observative evidences like the Hubble Law and the Cosmological Redshift are in agreement with the model. In this context Dark Energy appears like a pure curvature effect arising by the scalar field.
