We study some cosmological constraints on the two phenomenological models of oscillating dark energy. In these scenarios, the equation of state of dark energy varies periodically and may provide a way to unify the early acceleration (inflation) and the late time acceleration of the universe. These models give also an effective way to tackle the so-called cosmic coincidence problem. We examine observational constraints on this class of models from the latest observational data including the \emph{gold} sample of 182 type Ia supernovae, the CMB shift parameter $R$ and the BAO measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
