Observations of very-high-energy (VHE, E > 250 GeV) gamma-ray emission from several blazars at z > 0.1 have placed stringent constraints on the elusive spectrum and intensity of the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR). Correcting their observed VHE spectrum for gamma-gamma absorption even by the lowest plausible level of the IIBR provided evidence for a very hard (photon spectral index Gamma_{ph} < 2) intrinsic source spectrum out to TeV energies. Such a hard VHE gamma-ray spectrum poses a serious challenge to the conventional synchrotron-self-Compton interpretation of the VHE emission of TeV blazars and suggests the emergence of a separate emission component beyond a few hundred GeV. Here we propose that such a very hard, slowly variable VHE emission component in TeV blazars may be produced via Compton upscattering of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons by shock-accelerated electrons in an extended jet. For the case of 1ES 1101-232, this component could dominate the bolometric luminosity of the extended jet if the magnetic fields are of the order of typical intergalactic magnetic fields B ~ 10 micro-Gauss and electrons are still being accelerated out to TeV energies gamma > 4 X 10^6) on kiloparsec scales along the jet.
