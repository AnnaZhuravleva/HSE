The Efstathiou, Lake and Negroponte (1982) criterion can not distinguish bar stable from bar unstable discs and thus should not be used in semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations. I discuss the reasons for this, illustrate it with examples and point out shortcomings in the recipes used for spheroid formation. I propose an alternative, although much less straightforward, possibility.
