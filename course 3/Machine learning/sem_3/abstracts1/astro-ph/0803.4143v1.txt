We report on initial results from the first phase of Exercise 1 of the asteroFLAG hare and hounds. The asteroFLAG group is helping to prepare for the asteroseismology component of NASA's Kepler mission, and the first phase of Exercise 1 is concerned with testing extraction of estimates of the large and small frequency spacings of the low-degree p modes from Kepler-like artificial data. These seismic frequency spacings will provide key input for complementing the exoplanet search data.
