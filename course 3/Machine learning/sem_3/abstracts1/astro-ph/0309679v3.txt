In addition to the two standard solutions of the quantum field equations having the form e^{+/-(iwt-ikx)}, there exist two additional solutions of the form e^{+/-(iwt+ikx). By incorporating these latter solutions, deemed "supplemental solutions", into the development of quantum field theory, one finds a simple and natural cancellation of terms that results in an energy VEV, and a cosmological constant, of zero. This fundamental, and previously unrecognized, inherent symmetry in quantum field theory shows promise for providing a resolution of the large vacuum energy problem, simply and directly, with little modification or extension to the extant mathematics of the theory. In certain scenarios, slight asymmetries could give rise to dark energy.
