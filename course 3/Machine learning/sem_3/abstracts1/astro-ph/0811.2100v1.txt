With construction halfway complete, IceCube is already the most sensitive neutrino telescope ever built. A rearrangement of the final holes of IceCube with increased spacing has been discussed recently to optimize the high energy sensitivity of the detector. Extending this baseline with radio and acoustic instrumentation in the same holes could further improve the high energy response. The goal would be both to detect events and to act as a pathfinder for hybrid detection, towards a possible larger hybrid array. Simulation results for such an array are presented here.
