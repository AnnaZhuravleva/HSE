We have observed the supernova remnant MSH 15-52 (G320.4-1.2), which contains the gamma-ray pulsar PSR B1509-58, using the CANGAROO-III imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array from April to June in 2006. We detected gamma rays above 810 GeV at the 7 sigma level during a total effective exposure of 48.4 hours. We obtained a differential gamma-ray flux at 2.35 TeV of (7.9+/-1.5_{stat}+/-1.7_{sys}) \times 10^{-13} cm^{-2}s^{-1}TeV^{-1} with a photon index of 2.21+/-0.39_{stat}+/-0.40_{sys}, which is compatible with that of the H.E.S.S. observation in 2004. The morphology shows extended emission compared to our Point Spread Function. We consider the plausible origin of the high energy emission based on a multi-wavelength spectral analysis and energetics arguments.
