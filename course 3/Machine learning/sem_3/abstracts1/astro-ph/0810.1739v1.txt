Findings of a few recent asteroseismic studies of the main-sequence pulsating stars, as performed in Wojciech Dziembowski's group in Warsaw and in Michel Breger's group in Vienna, are briefly presented and discussed. The selected objects are three hybrid pulsators Nu Eridani, 12 Lacertae and Gamma Pegasi, which show both Beta Cephei and SPB type modes, and the Delta Scuti type star 44 Tauri.
