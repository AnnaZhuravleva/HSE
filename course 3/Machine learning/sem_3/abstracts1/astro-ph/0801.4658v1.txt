The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) to be installed on the International Space Station (ISS) will be equipped with a proximity focusing Ring Imaging Cerenkov detector (RICH). Reconstruction of the Cerenkov angle and the electric charge with RICH are discussed. A likelihood method for the Cerenkov angle reconstruction was applied leading to a velocity determination for protons with a resolution around 0.1%. The electric charge reconstruction is based on the counting of the number of photoelectrons and on an overall efficiency estimation on an event-by-event basis. The isotopic mass separation of helium and beryllium is presented.
