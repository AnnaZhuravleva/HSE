We investigate the observational signatures of the holographic dark energy models in this paper, including both the original model and a model with an interaction term between the dark energy and dark matter. We first delineate the dynamical behavior of such models, especially whether they would have "Big Rip" for different parameters, then we use several recent observations, including 182 high-quality type Ia supernovae data observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, the SNLS and ESSENCE surveys, 42 latest Chandra X-ray cluster gas mass fraction, 27 high-redshift gamma-ray burst samples, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the CMB shift parameter from WMAP three years result to give more reliable and tighter constraints on the holographic dark energy models. The results of our constraints for the holographic dark energy model without interaction is $c=0.748^{+0.108}_{-0.009}$, $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}}=0.276^{+0.017}_{-0.016}$, and for model with interaction ($c=0.692^{+0.135}_{-0.107}$, $\Omega_{\mathrm{m0}}=0.281^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ ,$\alpha=-0.006 ^{+0.021}_{-0.024}$, where $\alpha$ is an interacting parameter). As these models have more parameters than the $\Lambda$CDM model, we use the Bayesian evidence as a model selection criterion to make comparison. We found that the holographic dark energy models are mildly favored by the observations compared with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ model.
