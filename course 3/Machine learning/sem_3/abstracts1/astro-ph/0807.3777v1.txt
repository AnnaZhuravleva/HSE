The FourStar infrared camera is a 1.0-2.5 micron (JHKs) near infrared camera for the Magellan Baade 6.5m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile). It is being built by Carnegie Observatories and the Instrument Development Group at Johns Hopkins and is scheduled for completion in 2009. The instrument uses four Teledyne HAWAII-2RG arrays that produce a 10.9 x 10.9 arcmin field of view. The outstanding seeing at the Las Campanas site coupled with FourStar's high sensitivity and large field of view will enable many new survey and targeted science programs.
