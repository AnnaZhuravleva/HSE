This paper reviews methods which can be used to detect binaries involving low- and intermediate-mass stars, with special emphasis on evolved systems. Besides the traditional methods involving radial-velocity or photometric monitoring, the paper discusses as well less known methods involving astrometry or maser (non-)detection. An extensive list of internet resources (mostly catalogues/databases of orbits and individual measurements) for the study of binary stars is provided at the end of the paper.
