Using a recent estimate of the velocity of pulsars arising from neutrinos emitted with modified URCA processes with electrons in Landua levels, and the temperture of the protoneutron star created by SN1987A, derived from the energy of the observed neutrinos, we predict the velocity of the resulting pulsar.
