We used deep observations collected with ACS@HST to derive the fraction of binary systems in a sample of thirteen low-density Galactic globular clusters. By analysing the color distribution of Main Sequence stars we derived the minimum fraction of binary systems required to reproduce the observed color-magnitude diagram morphologies. We found that all the analysed globular clusters contain a minimum binary fraction larger than 6% within the core radius. The estimated global fractions of binary systems range from 10% to 50% depending on the cluster. A dependence of the relative fraction of binary systems on the cluster age has been detected, suggesting that the binary disruption process within the cluster core is active and can significantly reduce the binary content in time.
