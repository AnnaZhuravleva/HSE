Some studies show that there are recent star formations in galaxies including early type galaxies. This suggests that we possibly did not obtain the accurate ages and metallicities of the dominating stellar populations of galaxies from colors. We study how young populations (YSPs) in composite stellar populations affect the colors of star systems and analyze how the stellar ages and metallicities derived from colors possibly deviate from those of the dominating populations of composite star systems. Some possible distributions of the differences between stellar ages and metallicities determined by colors and those of the dominating stellar populations of composite stellar systems are presented in this work. Furthermore, some possible distributions of the differences between colors of composite stellar populations and those of their dominating stellar populations are also shown in this paper. In addition, we compare the stellar ages and metallicities determined respectively by a color pair and two line strength indices. The results obtained by a color pair and those obtained by a few independent colors are also compared in the paper. We also discuss about how the YSPs may affect the Fundamental Plane and Kormendy relation of early type galaxies. The main results can be downloaded from the CDS.
