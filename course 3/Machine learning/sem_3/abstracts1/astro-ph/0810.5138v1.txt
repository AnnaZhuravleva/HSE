In order to evaluate and develop mission concepts for a search for Terrestrial Exoplanets, we have prepared a list of potential target systems. In this paper we present and discuss the criteria for selecting potential target stars suitable for the search for Earth like planets, with a special emphasis on the aspects of the habitable zone for these stellar systems. Planets found within these zones would be potentially able to host complex life forms. We derive a final target star sample of potential target stars, the Darwin All Sky Star Catalog (DASSC). The DASSC contains a sample of 2303 identified objects of which 284 are F, 464 G, 883 K, 615 M type stars and 57 stars without B-V index. Of these objects 949 objects are flagged in the DASSC as multiple systems, resulting in 1229 single main sequence stars of which 107 are F, 235 are G, 536 are K, and 351 are M type. We derive configuration dependent subcatalogs from the DASSC for two technical designs, the initial baseline design and the advanced Emma design as well as a catalog using an inner working angle cut off. We discuss the selection criteria, derived parameters and completeness of sample for different classes of stars.
