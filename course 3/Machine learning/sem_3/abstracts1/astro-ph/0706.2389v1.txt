I review current models used to interpret the spectra and variability of microquasars. Among other things, I discuss the structure of the accretion flow and its dependence on mass accretion rate, the intrinsic connection between hot comptonizing corona and compact radio jet in the hard state, as well as possible models for the spectral hysteresis observed during outbursts of transient sources. Finally I comment on several models for the non-poissonian X-ray noise in black hole binaries which, at least in some instances, is suspected to be associated with some form of coupling between disc and jet activity.
