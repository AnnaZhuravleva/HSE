Interstellar scintillations of pulsars PSR B0809+74 and B0950+08 have been studied using observations at low frequencies (41, 62, 89, and 112 MHz). Characteristic temporal and frequency scales of diffractive scintillations at these frequencies have been determined. The comprehensive analysis of the frequency and temporal structure functions reduced to the same frequency has shown that the spectrum of interstellar plasma inhomogeneities toward both pulsars is described by a power law. The exponent of the spectrum of fluctuations of interstellar plasma inhomogeneities toward PSR B0950+08 (n = 3.00 +- 0.05) appreciably differs from the Kolmogorov exponent. Toward PSR B0809+74 the spectrum is a power law with an exponent n = 3.7 +- 0.1. A strong angular refraction has been detected toward PSR B0950+08. The distribution of inhomogeneities along the line of sight has been analyzed; it has been shown that the scintillations of PSR B0950+08 take place on a turbulent layer with enhanced electron density, which is localized at approximately 10 pc from the observer. For PSR B0809+74 the distribution of inhomogeneities is quasi-uniform. Mean-square fluctuations of electron density on inhomogeneities with a characteristic scale rho_0 = 10^7 m toward four pulsars have been estimated. On this scale the local turbulence level in the 10-pc layer is 20 times higher than in an extended region responsible for the scintillations of PSR B0809+74.
