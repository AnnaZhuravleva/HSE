We present high-resolution Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar BRI 1335-0417 (z=4.41). Our CO(2-1) observations have a linear resolution of 0.15" (1.0 kpc) and resolve the molecular gas emission both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in BRI 1335-0417 is extended on scales of 5 kpc, and shows a complex structure. At least three distinct components encompassing about two thirds of the total molecular mass of 9.2 x 10^10 M_sun are identified in velocity space, which are embedded in a structure that harbors about one third of the total molecular mass in the system. The brightest CO(2-1) line emission region has a peak brightness temperature of 61+/-9 K within 1 kpc diameter, which is comparable to the kinetic gas temperature as predicted from the CO line excitation. This is also comparable to the gas temperatures found in the central regions of nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, which are however much more compact than 1 kpc. The spatial and velocity structure of the molecular reservoir in BRI 1335-0417 is inconsistent with a simple gravitationally bound disk, but resembles a merging system. Our observations are consistent with a major, gas-rich (`wet') merger that both feeds an accreting supermassive black hole (causing the bright quasar activity), and fuels a massive starburst that builds up the stellar bulge in this galaxy. Our study of this z>4 quasar host galaxy may thus be the most direct observational evidence that `wet' mergers at high redshift are related to AGN activity.
