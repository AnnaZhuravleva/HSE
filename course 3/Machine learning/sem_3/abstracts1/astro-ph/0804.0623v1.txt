The HFR and AUTOSTRUCTURE atomic structure codes are used to compute complete data sets of level energies, wavelengths, A-values, and radiative and Auger widths for K-vacancy states of the Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and Ca isonuclear sequences. Ions with electron number N>9 are treated for the first time. Detailed comparisons with previous measurements and theoretical data for ions with N<=9 are carried out in order to estimate reliable accuracy ratings.
