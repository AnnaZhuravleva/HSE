In this article, we demonstrate that PKSJ 1037-2705 has a weak accretion flow luminosity, well below the Seyfert1/QSO dividing line, weak broad emission lines (BELs) and moderately powerful FRII extended radio emission. It is one of the few documented examples of a broad-line object in which the time averaged jet kinetic luminosity, $\bar{Q}$, is larger than the total thermal luminosity (IR to X-ray) of the accretion flow, $L_{bol}$. The blazar nucleus dominates the optical and near ultraviolet emission and is a strong source of hard X-rays. The strong blazar emission indicates that the relativistic radio jet is presently active. The implication is that even weakly accreting AGN can create powerful jets. Kinetically dominated ($\bar{Q}>L_{bol}$) broad-line objects provide important constraints on the relationship between the accretion flow and the jet production mechanism.
