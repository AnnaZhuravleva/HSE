A chemical evolution model for the bimodal-like abundance distribution in the external galaxy M51 recently derived on the basis of HST data for more than a half million red supergiants is developed. It is shown that, like in our Galaxy, formation of fine structure of the radial abundance pattern -- a rather steep gradient in the internal part of the disc and a plateau in the middle part -- is due to the influence of the spiral arms, the bend in the slope of the distribution being arose near the corotation resonance. Our model strongly suggests that M51 is surrounded by overabundant gas infalling onto its disc.
