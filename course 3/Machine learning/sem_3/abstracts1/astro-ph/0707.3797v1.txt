The detection of high-energy particles, cosmic rays (CRs), deep inside the heliosphere implies that there are, at least, three distinctly different stages in the lifetime of a CR particle: acceleration, propagation in the interstellar medium (ISM), and propagation in the heliosphere. Gamma rays produced by interactions of CRs with gas, radiation, and magnetic fields can be used to study their spectra in different locations. Still, accurate direct measurements of CR species inside the heliosphere (such as their spectra and abundances) are extremely important for the understanding of their origin and propagation. In this paper, an emphasis is made on very recent advances and especially on those where GLAST and PAMELA observations can lead to further progress in our understanding of CRs.
