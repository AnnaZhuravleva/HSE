Astroparticle physics has evolved as an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of particle physics, astronomy and cosmology. Over the last two decades, it has moved from infancy to technological maturity and is now envisaging projects on the 100 Million Euro scale. This price tag requires international coordination, cooperation and convergence to a few flagship projects. The Roadmap Committee of ApPEC (Astroparticle Physics European Coordination) has recently released a roadmap covering the next ten years. This talk describes status and perspectives of astroparticle physics in Europe and reports the recommendations of the Roadmap Committee.
