Significant fraction of barred galaxies hosts secondary bar-like structures on optical and NIR images. The circumnuclear dynamics of double-barred objects are still not well understood, observational data concerning kinematics are incomplete and inconsistent. In order to compare the simulations results with observations, we have started new spectroscopic studying of stellar kinematics in lenticular galaxies from Peter Erwin's catalog of secondary bars. We present first results concerning their stellar kinematics based on the observations performed with the integral-field spectrograph MPFS at the Russian 6-m telescope.
