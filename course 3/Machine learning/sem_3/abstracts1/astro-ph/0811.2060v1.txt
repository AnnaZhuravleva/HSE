We present a convariant formulation for radiative transfer in curved space time and demonstrate some applications in the black-hole systems. We calculate the emission from semi-transparent accretion tori around black holes, for opacity provided by the Fe K lines and for opacity dominated by electron scattering. We also calculate the emission from radiative inefficient accretion flow in black holes with opacity provided by electron-positron annihilation lines. Finally we show shadows cast by accreting black holes with different spins and with different distribution of warm material around them.
