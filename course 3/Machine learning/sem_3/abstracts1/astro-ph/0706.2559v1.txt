The S-stars have been suggested to be a brief transitional phase as stars evolve from oxygen-rich M-type stars into carbon stars, through the dredge up of carbon from He-shell burning. As possible transition objects, S-stars might help achieve a deeper understanding of the chemical evolution as a star ascends the AGB, as well as shed more light on the mass-loss mechanism. We have initiated a large survey of 40 S-stars to observe line emission in common molecules such as CO, SiO, HCN, CS and SiS. Detailed radiative transfer modelling of multi-transition CO radio line observations towards a sample of 40 S-stars shows that the mass-loss rate distribution of S-stars is consistent with those found for M-type AGB stars and carbon stars. Initial results from modelling of the circumstellar SiO emission are also presented.
