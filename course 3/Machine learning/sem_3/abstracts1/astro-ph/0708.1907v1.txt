The impact of active galactic nuclei on low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) remains a vigorous field of study. We present preliminary results from a study of the mid-infrared atomic emission lines of LINERs with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We assess the ubiquity and properties of AGN in LINERs using this data. We discuss what powers the mid-infrared emission lines and conclude that the answer depends unsurprisingly on the emission line ionization state and, more interestingly, on the infrared luminosity.
