The intimate links between gravitation and the second law are summarized and two less known relations between gravity and thermodynamics are studied. Firstly, the information cost required to operate a Maxwell's demon on a curved spacetime is estimated using the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. More importantly, the charge and time (C and T) reversal properties of the Kerr-Newman solution in General relativity show that this solution, similarly to the Dirac equation, appears to represent both a particle and its antiparticle and suggests a definition of antimatter in general relativity. This definition leads to a parameter free explanation of the cosmological constant term observed in the supernovae data. The relation of this definition of antimatter with the coupled systems through opposite time arrows studied by Schulman is also emphasized.
