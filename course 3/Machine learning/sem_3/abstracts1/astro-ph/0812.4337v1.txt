We know that the galactic magnetic field possesses a random component in addition to the mean uniform component, with comparable strength of the two components. This random component is considered to play important roles in the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this work we present numerical simulations associated with the interaction of the supersonic flows located at high latitude in our Galaxy (High Velocity Clouds, HVC) with the magnetized galactic ISM in order to study the effect that produces a random magnetic field in the evolution of this objects.
