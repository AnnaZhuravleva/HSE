We present grids of stellar models and their associated oscillation frequencies that have been used by the CoRoT Seismology Working Group during the scientific preparation of the CoRoT mission. The stellar models have been calculated with the CESAM stellar internal structure and evolution code while the oscillation frequencies have been obtained from the CESAM models by means of the ADIPLS adiabatic oscillation programme. The grids cover a range of masses, chemical compositions and evolutionary stages corresponding to those of the CoRoT primary targets. The stellar models and oscillation frequencies are available on line through the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity (ESTA) web site.
