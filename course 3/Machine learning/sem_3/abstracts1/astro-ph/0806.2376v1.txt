We study magnetospheric structure surrounding rotating magnetized neutron star with nonvanishing NUT (Newman-Tamburino-Unti) parameter. For the simplicity of calculations Goldreich-Julian charge density is analyzed for the aligned neutron star with zero inclination between magnetic field, gravitomagnetic field and rotation axis. From the system of Maxwell equations in spacetime of slowly rotating NUT star, second-order differential equation for electrostatic potential is derived. Analytical solution of this equation indicates the general relativistic modification of an accelerating electric field and charge density along the open field lines by the gravitomagnetic charge. The implication of this effect to the magnetospheric energy loss problem is underlined. In the second part of the paper we derive the equations of motion of test particles in magnetosphere of slowly rotating NUT star. Then we analyze particle motion in the polar cap and show that NUT parameter can significantly change conditions for particle acceleration.
