The new $XMM-Newton$ data of seven Seyfert 2 galaxies with optical spectropolarimetric observations are presented. The analysis of 0.5 -- 10 keV spectra shows that all four Seyfert 2 galaxies with polarized broad lines (PBLs) are absorbed with $N_{\rm H}<10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, while two of three Seyfert 2 galaxies without PBLs have evidence suggesting Compton-thick obscuration, supporting the conclusion that Seyfert 2 galaxies without PBLs are more obscured than those with PBLs. Adding the measured obscuration indicators ($N_{\rm H}$, $T$ ratio, and Fe K$\alpha$ line EW) of six luminous AGNs to our previous sample improves the significance level of the difference in absorption from 92.3% to 96.3% for $N_{\rm H}$, 99.1% to 99.4% for $T$ ratio, and 95.3% to 97.4% for Fe K$\alpha$ line EW. The present results support and enhance the suggestions that the absence of PBLs in Seyfert 2 galaxies can be explained by larger viewing angle of line of sight to the putative dusty torus, which lead to the obscuration of broad-line scattering screen, as expected by the unification model.
