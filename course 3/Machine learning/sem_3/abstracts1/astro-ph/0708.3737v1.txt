We present two non-parametric deprojection methods aimed at recovering the three-dimensional density and temperature profiles of galaxy clusters from spatially resolved thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) and X-ray surface brightness maps, thus avoiding the use of X-ray spectroscopic data. In both methods, clusters are assumed to be spherically symmetric and modeled with an onion-skin structure. The first method follows a direct geometrical approach. The second method is based on the maximization of a single joint (tSZ and X-ray) likelihood function, which allows one to fit simultaneously the two signals by following a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach. These techniques are tested against a set of cosmological simulations of clusters, with and without instrumental noise. We project each cluster along the three orthogonal directions defined by the principal axes of the momentum of inertia tensor. This enables us to check any bias in the deprojection associated to the cluster elongation along the line of sight. After averaging over all the three projection directions, we find an overall good reconstruction, with a small (<~10 per cent) overestimate of the gas density profile. This turns into a comparable overestimate of the gas mass within the virial radius, which we ascribe to the presence of residual gas clumping. Apart from this small bias the reconstruction has an intrinsic scatter of about 5 per cent, which is dominated by gas clumpiness. Cluster elongation along the line of sight biases the deprojected temperature profile upwards at r<~0.2r_vir and downwards at larger radii. A comparable bias is also found in the deprojected temperature profile. Overall, this turns into a systematic underestimate of the gas mass, up to 10 percent. (Abridged)
