Schwarzschild-type aplanatic telescopes with two aspheric mirrors, configured to correct spherical and coma aberrations, are considered for application in gamma-ray astronomy utilizing the ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov technique. We use analytical descriptions for the figures of primary and secondary mirrors and, by means of numerical ray-tracing, we find telescope configurations which minimize astigmatism and maximize effective light collecting area. It is shown that unlike the traditional prime-focus Davies-Cotton design, such telescopes provide a solution for wide field of view gamma-ray observations. The designs are isochronous, can be optimized to have no vignetting across the field, and allow for significant reduction of the plate scale, making them compatible with finely-pixilated cameras, which can be constructed from modern, cost-effective image sensors such as multi-anode PMTs, SiPMs, or image intensifiers.
