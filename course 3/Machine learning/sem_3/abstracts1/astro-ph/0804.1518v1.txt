The recent star formation history in the Cygnus region is studied using 5 clusters (IC 4996, NGC 6910, Berkeley 87, Biurakan 2 and Berkeley 86). The optical data from the literature are combined with the 2MASS data to identify the pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars as stars with near IR excess. We identified 93 pre-MS stars and 9 stars with H$_\alpha$ emission spectra. The identified pre-MS stars are used to estimate the turn-on age of the clusters. The duration of star formation was estimated as the difference between the turn-on and the turn-off age. We find that, NGC 6910 and IC 4996 have been forming stars continuously for the last 6 -- 7 Myr, Berkeley 86 and Biurakan 2 for 5 Myr and Berkeley 87 for the last 2 Myr. This indicates that the Cygnus region has been actively forming stars for the last 7 Myr, depending on the location. 9 emission line stars were identified in 4 clusters, using slit-less spectra (Be 87 - 4 stars; Be 86 - 2 stars, NGC 6910 - 2 stars and IC 4996 - 1 star). The individual spectra were obtained and analysed to estimate stellar as well as disk properties. All the emission stars are in the MS, well below the turn-off, in the core hydrogen burning phase. These stars are likely to be Classical Be (CBe) stars. Thus CBe phenomenon can be found in very young MS stars which are just a few (2 -- 7) Myrs old. This is an indication that CBe phenomenon need not be an evolutionary effect.
