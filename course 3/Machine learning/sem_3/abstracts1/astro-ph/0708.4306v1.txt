Blazars are known to display strong and erratic variability at almost all the wavelengths of electromagnetic spectrum. Presently, variability studies at high-energies (hard X-rays, gamma-rays) are hampered by low sensitivity of the instruments. Nevertheless, the latest generation of satellites (INTEGRAL, Swift) have given suggestions not yet fully confirmed of variability on intraday timescales. Some specific cases recently observed are presented and physical implications are discussed (e.g. NRAO 530). The contribution that SIMBOL-X could give in this research topic is also outlined.
