Based on an axisymmetric galactic disk model, we estimate the equilibrium gas pressure P/k in the disk plane as a function of the galactocentric distance R for several galaxies (MW, M33, M51, M81, M100, M101, M106, and the SMC). For this purpose, we solve a self-consistent system of equations by taking into account the gas self-gravity and the presence of a dark pseudo-isothermal halo. We assume that the turbulent velocity dispersions of the atomic and molecular gases are fixed and that the velocity dispersion of the old stellar disk corresponds to its marginal stability (except for the Galaxy and the SMC). We also consider a model with a constant disk thickness. Of the listed galaxies, the SMC and M51 have the highest pressure at a given relative radius R/R_25, while M81 has the lowest pressure. The pressure dependence of the relative molecular gas fraction confirms the existence of a positive correlation between these quantities, but it is not so distinct as that obtained previously when the pressure was estimated very roughly. This dependence breaks down for the inner regions of M81 and M106, probably because the gas pressure has been underestimated in the bulge region. We discuss the possible effects of factors other than the pressure affecting the relative content of molecular gas in the galaxies under consideration.
