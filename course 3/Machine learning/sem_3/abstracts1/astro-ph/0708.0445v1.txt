Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is determined using the Cepheid variables in the LMC. We combine the individual LMC Cepheid distances obtained from the infrared surface brightness method and a dataset with a large number of LMC Cepheids. Using the standard least squares method, the LMC distance modulus can be found from the ZP offsets of these two samples. We have adopted both a linear P-L relation and a ``broken'' P-L relation in our calculations. The resulting LMC distance moduli are 18.48+-0.03 mag and 18.49+-0.04 mag (random error only), respectively, which are consistent to the adopted 18.50 mag in the literature.
