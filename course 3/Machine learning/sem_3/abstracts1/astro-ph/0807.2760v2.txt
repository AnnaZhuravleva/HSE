We present a joint analysis of near-ultraviolet (NUV) data from the GALEX mission and (optical) colour profiles for a sample of 7 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in the Canadian Cluster Comparison Project. We find that every BCG which has a blue rest-frame UV colour also shows a blue-core in its optical colour profile. Conversely, BCGs that lack blue cores and show monotonic colour gradients typical of old elliptical galaxies, are red in the UV. We interpret this as evidence that the NUV enhancement in the blue BCGs is driven by recent star formation and not from old evolved stellar populations such as horizontal branch stars. The recent star formation in the blue BCGs typically has an age less than 200 Myrs and contributes mass fractions of less than a percent. Although the sample studied here is small, we demonstrate, for the first time, a one-to-one correspondence between blue cores in elliptical galaxies (in particular BCGs) and a NUV-enhancement observed using GALEX. The combination of this one-to-one correspondence and the consistently young age of recent star formation, coupled with additional correlations with the host cluster's X-ray properties, strongly suggests that the star formation is fueled by gas cooling out of the intracluster medium. In turn, this implies that any AGN heating of the intracluster medium in massive clusters only acts to reduce the magnitude of the cooling flow and that once this flow starts, it is nearly always active.
