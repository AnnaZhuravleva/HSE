We study the generation of transversal oscillations in coronal loops represented as a straight thin flux tube under the effect of an external driver modeling the global coronal EIT wave. We investigate how the generated oscillations depend on the nature of the driver, and the type of interaction between the two systems. We consider the oscillations of a magnetic straight cylinder with fixed-ends under the influence of an external driver modeling the force due to the global EIT wave. Given the uncertainties related to the nature of EIT waves, we first approximate the driver by an oscillatory force in time and later by a shock with a finite width. Results show that for a harmonic driver the dominant period in the generated oscillation belongs to the driver. Depending on the period of driver, compared to the natural periods of the loop, a mixture of standing modes harmonics can be initiated. In the case of a non-harmonic driver (modeling a shock wave), the generated oscillations in the loop are the natural periods only. The amplitude of oscillations is determined by the position of the driver along the tube. The full diagnosis of generated oscillations is achieved using simple numerical methods.
