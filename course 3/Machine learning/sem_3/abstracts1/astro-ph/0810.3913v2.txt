We analyse models of inflation in which isocurvature perturbations present during inflation are converted into the primordial curvature perturbation during instant preheating. This can be due to an asymmetry between the fields present either during inflation or during preheating. We consider all the constraints that the model must satisfy in order to be theoretically valid and to satisfy observations. We show that the constraints are very tight in all of the models proposed and special initial conditions are required for the models to work. In the case where the symmetry is strongly broken during inflation the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL is generally large and negative.
