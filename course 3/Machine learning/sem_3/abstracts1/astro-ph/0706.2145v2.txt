We present results of simulations of a muon content in the air showers induced by very high energy cosmic rays. Muon energy distributions and muon densities at ground level are given. We discuss a prompt muon component generated by decays of charm mesons. The method combines standard Monte Carlo generators incorporated in the CORSIKA code and phenomenological estimates of the charm hadroproduction.
