We estimate the absolute magnitude distribution of galaxies which lie within about a Mpc of Mg II absorption systems. The absorption systems themselves lie along 1880 lines of sight to QSOs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3, have rest equivalent widths greater than 0.88 Angstroms, and redshifts between 0.37 < z < 0.82. Our measurement is based on all galaxies which lie within a projected distance of about 900 kpc/h of each QSO demonstrating absorption. The redshifts of these projected neighbors are not available, so we use a background subtraction technique to estimate the absolute magnitude distribution of true neighbors. (Our method exploits the fact that, although we do not know the redshifts of the neighbors, we do know the redshift of the absorbers.) The absolute magnitude distribution we find is well described by a bell-shaped curve peaking at about rest-frame M_B = -20, corresponding to L/L* = 1.4. A comparison of this observed distribution to ones in the literature suggests that it is unlikely to be drawn from a population dominated by late-type galaxies. However, the strong equivalent width systems may be associated with later galaxy types. Finally we use the absolute magnitude distribution, along with the observed covering fraction of about 8 percent, to estimate the extent of the MgII absorbing gas around a galaxy. For an L* galaxy, this scale is about 70 kpc/h. We provide an analytic description of our method, which is generally applicable to any dataset in which redshifts are only available for a small sub-sample. Hence, we expect it to aid in the analysis of galaxy scaling relations from photometric redshift datasets.
