Particle physics candidates for cosmological dark matter are usually considered as neutral and weakly interacting. However stable charged leptons and quarks can also exist and, hidden in elusive atoms, play the role of dark matter. The necessary condition for such scenario is absence of stable particles with charge -1 and effective mechanism for suppression of free positively charged heavy species. These conditions are realized in several recently developed scenarios. In scenario based on Walking Technicolor model excess of stable particles with charge -2 and the corresponding dark matter density is naturally related with the value and sign of cosmological baryon asymmetry. The excessive charged particles are bound with primordial helium in techni-O-helium "atoms", maintaining specific nuclear-interacting form of dark matter. Some properties of techni-O-helium Universe are discussed.
