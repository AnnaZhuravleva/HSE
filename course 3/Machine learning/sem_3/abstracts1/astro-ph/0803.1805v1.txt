Sakai et al. have observed long-chain unsaturated hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynes in the low-mass star-forming region L1527, and have attributed this result to a gas-phase ion-molecule chemistry, termed ``Warm Carbon Chain Chemistry'', which occurs during and after the evaporation of methane from warming grains. The source L1527 is an envelope surrounding a Class 0/I protostar with regions that possess a slightly elevated temperature of ~30 K. The molecules detected by Sakai et al. are typically associated only with dark molecular clouds, and not with the more evolved hot corino phase. In order to determine if L1527 is chemically distinct from a dark cloud, we compute models including various degrees of heating. The results indicate that the composition of L1527 is somewhat more likely to be due to ``Warm Carbon Chain Chemistry'' than to be a remnant of a colder phase. If so, the molecular products provide a signature of a previously uncharacterized early phase of low mass star formation, which can be characterized as a ``lukewarm'' corino. We also include predictions for other molecular species that might be observed toward candidate lukewarm corino sources. Although our calculations show that unsaturated hydrocarbons and cyanopolyynes can be produced in the gas phase as the grains warm up to 30 K, they also show that such species do not disappear rapidly from the gas as the temperature reaches 200 K, implying that such species might be detected in hot corinos and hot cores.
