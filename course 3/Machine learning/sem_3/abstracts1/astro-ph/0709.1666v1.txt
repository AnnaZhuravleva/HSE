Relativistic outflows carrying large scale magnetic fields have large inductive potential and may accelerate protons to ultra high energies. We discuss a novel scheme of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) acceleration due to drifts in magnetized, cylindrically collimated, sheared jets of powerful active galaxies (with jet luminosity $\geq 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$). A positively charged particle carried by such a plasma is in an unstable equilibrium if ${\bf B} \cdot \nabla \times {\bf v}< 0$, so that kinetic drift along the velocity shear would lead to fast, regular energy gain. The highest rigidity particles are accelerated most efficiently implying the dominance of light nuclei for energies above the ankle in our model: from a mixed population of pre-accelerated particle the drift mechanism picks up and boosts protons preferably.
