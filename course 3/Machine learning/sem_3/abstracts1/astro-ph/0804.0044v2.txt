In preparation for an experimental study of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metal, we present non-ideal axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the nonlinear evolution of MRI in the experimental geometry. The simulations adopt fully insulating boundary conditions. No-slip conditions are imposed at the cylinders. A clear linear phase is observed with reduced linear growth rate. MRI results in an inflowing "jet" near the midplane and enhances the angular momentum transport at saturation.
