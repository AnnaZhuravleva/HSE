We introduce the concept of multi-point propagators between linear cosmic fields and their nonlinear counterparts in the context of cosmological perturbation theory. Such functions express how a non-linearly evolved Fourier mode depends on the full ensemble of modes in the initial density field. We identify and resum the dominant diagrams in the large-$k$ limit, showing explicitly that multi-point propagators decay into the nonlinear regime at the same rate as the two-point propagator. These analytic results generalize the large-$k$ limit behavior of the two-point propagator to arbitrary order. We measure the three-point propagator as a function of triangle shape in numerical simulations and confirm the results of our high-$k$ resummation. We show that any $n-$point spectrum can be reconstructed from multi-point propagators, which leads to a physical connection between nonlinear corrections to the power spectrum at small scales and higher-order correlations at large scales. As a first application of these results, we calculate the reduced bispectrum at one-loop in renormalized perturbation theory and show that we can predict the decrease in its dependence on triangle shape at redshift zero, when standard perturbation theory is least successful.
