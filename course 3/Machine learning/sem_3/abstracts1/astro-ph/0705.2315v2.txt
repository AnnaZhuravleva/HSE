The mass loss properties of carbon AGB stars are not very well constrained at present. A variety of empirical or theoretical formulae with different parameterisations are available in the literature and the agreement between them is anything but good. These simple mass loss prescriptions are nontheless used in many models of stellar evolution without much consideration of their applicability in various cases. We present here an on-going project aiming at a better description of the mass loss, that could be used to improve stellar evolution models -- especially the evolution during the TP-AGB phase. As a first step, we have considered the mass loss evolution during a He-shell flash. Using stellar parameters sampled from a stellar evolutionary track, we have computed the time evolution of the atmospheric layers and wind acceleration region during a flash event with detailed frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical models including dust formation. Based on these results, we have also simulated the subsequent long-term dynamical evolution of the circumstellar envelope (CSE), including the formation of a detached shell. We find that existing simple mass loss prescriptions imply different mass loss evolutions compared with our model. The second step of the project deals with the dependence of mass loss on the basic stellar parameters. At the moment we are computing a large grid of wind models for C-rich AGB stars. Preliminary results show that simple parameterisations are difficult to obtain in certain regions of the parameter space considered, due to strong non-linearities in the wind mechanism.
