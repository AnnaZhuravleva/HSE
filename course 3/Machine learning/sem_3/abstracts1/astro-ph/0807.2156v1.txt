The classical T Tauri star DG Tau shows all typical signatures of X-ray activity and, in particular, harbors a resolved X-ray jet. We demonstrate that its soft and hard X-ray components are separated spatially by approximately 0.2 arcsec by deriving the spatial offset between both components from the event centroids of the soft and hard photons utilizing the intrinsic energy-resolution of the Chandra ACIS-S detector. We also demonstrate that this offset is physical and cannot be attributed to an instrumental origin or to low counting statistics. Furthermore, the location of the derived soft X-ray emission peak coincides with emission peaks observed for optical emission lines, suggesting that both, soft X-rays and optical emission, have the same physical origin.
