We focus on the astrobiological effects of photospheric radiation produced by main-sequence stars of spectral types F, G, K, and M. The photospheric radiation is represented by using realistic spectra, taking into account millions or hundred of millions of lines for atoms and molecules. DNA is taken as a proxy for carbon-based macromolecules, assumed to be the chemical centerpiece of extraterrestrial life forms. Emphasis is placed on the investigation of the radiative environment in conservative as well as generalized habitable zones.
