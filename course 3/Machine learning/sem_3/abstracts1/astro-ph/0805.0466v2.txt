OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. OH excitation calculations suggest that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for the 1720 MHz line. Previous observations and modelling of 1612, 1665 and 1667 MHz OH absorption and 1720 MHz OH masers indicated that the column densities in some supernova remnants, ~1e17 cm^-2, may be high enough for 6049 MHz OH masers to exist. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of remnant-cloud interaction.   We present excitation calculations predicting the formation of 6049 MHz OH masers and results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol Multibeam receiver for 6049, 6035 and 6030 MHz OH masers towards 35 supernova remnants, a star-forming region and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.   Two new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH maser emission associated with star-forming regions have been discovered, but no 6049 MHz masers were detected to a brightness temperature limit of ~0.3-0.6 K, even though modelling of the OH excitation suggests that maser emission should have been detected. Our upper-limits indicate that the OH column density for a typical remnant is less than 1e16.4 cm^-2, which conflicts with observed and modelled column densities. One possible explanation is that 6049 MHz OH masers may be more sensitive to velocity coherence than 1720 MHz OH masers under some conditions.
