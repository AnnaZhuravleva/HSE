We explore the use of the color-log(n) plane (where n is the global Sersic index) as a tool for subdividing the high redshift galaxy population in a physically-motivated manner. Using a series of volume-limited samples out to z=1.5 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) we confirm the correlation between color-log(n) plane position and visual morphology observed locally and in other high redshift studies in the color and/or structure domain. Via comparison to a low redshift sample from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue we quantify evolution by color-log(n) type, accounting separately for the specific selection and measurement biases against each. Specifically, we measure decreases in B-band surface brightness of 1.57 +/- 0.22 mag/sq.arcsec and 1.65 +/- 0.22 mag/sq.arcsec for `blue, diffuse' and `red, compact' galaxies respectively between redshift unity and the present day.
