We report the discovery of a planet transiting a moderately faint (V=12.3 mag) late F star, with an orbital period of 3.92289 +/- 0.00004 days. From the transit light curve and radial velocity measurements we determine that the radius of the planet is R_p = 1.40 +/- 0.06 R_Jup and that the mass is M_p = 0.78 +/- 0.09 M_Jup. The density of the new planet, rho = 0.35 +/- 0.06 g cm^{-3}, fits to the low-density tail of the currently known transiting planets. We find that the center of transit is at T_c = 2454417.9077 +/- 0.0003 (HJD), and the total transit duration is 0.143 +/- 0.004 days. The host star has M_s = 1.28 +/- 0.13 M_Sun and R_s = 1.32 +/- 0.07 R_Sun.
