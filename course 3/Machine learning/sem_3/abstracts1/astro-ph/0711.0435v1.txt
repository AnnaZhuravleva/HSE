Nowadays, g-mode detection is based upon a priori theoretical knowledge. By doing so, detection becomes more restricted to what we can imagine. De facto, the universe of possibilities is made narrower. Such an approach is pertinent for Bayesian statisticians. Examples of how Bayesian inferences can be applied to spectral analysis and helioseismic power spectra are given. Our intention is not to give the full statistical framework (much too ambitious) but to provide an appetizer for going further in the direction of a proper Bayesian inference, especially for detecting gravity modes.
