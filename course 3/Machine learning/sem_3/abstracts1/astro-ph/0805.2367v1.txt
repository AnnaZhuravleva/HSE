We describe a software package used at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences to reduce and analyze the data obtained with the Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer. We already described most of the algorithms employed in our earlier Paper I (Moiseev, 2002). In this paper we focus on extra procedures required in the case of the use of a high-resolution Fabry-Perot interferometer: removal of ghosts and measurement of the velocity dispersion of ionized gas in galactic and extragalactic objects.
