LS 5039 is among the most interesting VHE sources in the Galaxy. Two scenarios have been put forward to explain the observed TeV radiation: jets vs pulsar winds. The source has been detected during the superior conjunction of the compact object, when very large gamma-ray opacities are expected. In addition, electromagnetic cascades, which may make the system more transparent to gamma-rays, are hardly efficient for realistic magnetic fields in massive star surroundings. All this makes unlikely the standard pulsar scenario for LS 5039, in which the emitter is the region located between the star and the compact object, where the opacities are the largest. Otherwise, a jet-like flow can transport energy to regions where the photon-photon absorption is much lower and the TeV radiation is not so severely absorbed.
