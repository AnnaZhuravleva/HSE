We show that pairs of widely separated interferometers are advantageous for measuring the Stokes parameter V of a stochastic background of gravitational waves. This parameter characterizes asymmetry of amplitudes of right- and left-handed waves and generation of the asymmetry is closely related to parity violation in the early universe. The advantageous pairs include LIGO(Livingston)-LCGT and AIGO-Virgo that are relatively insensitive to Omega_GW (the simple intensity of the background). Using at least three detectors, information of the intensity Omega_GW and the degree of asymmetry V can be separately measured.
