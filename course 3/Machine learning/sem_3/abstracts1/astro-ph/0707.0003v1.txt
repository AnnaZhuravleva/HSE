Based on the microlensing variability of the two-image gravitational lens HE1104-1805 observed between 0.4 and 8 microns, we have measured the size and wavelength-dependent structure of the quasar accretion disk. Modeled as a power law in temperature, T proportional to R^-beta, we measure a B-band (0.13 microns in the rest frame) half-light radius of R_{1/2,B} = 6.7 (+6.2 -3.2) x 10^15 cm (68% CL) and a logarithmic slope of beta=0.61 (+0.21 -0.17) for our standard model with a logarithmic prior on the disk size. Both the scale and the slope are consistent with simple thin disk models where beta=3/4 and R_{1/2,B} = 5.9 x 10^15 cm for a Shakura-Sunyaev disk radiating at the Eddington limit with 10% efficiency. The observed fluxes favor a slightly shallower slope, beta=0.55 (+0.03 -0.02), and a significantly smaller size for beta=3/4.
