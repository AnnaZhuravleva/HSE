We have conducted a radio study at 3.6, 6 and 20 cm using ATCA and VLA and reprocessed XMM-Newton and Chandra data of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in the supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1. The new observations revealed that the morphology and symmetry suggested by Chandra observations (torus and jet-like features) are basically preserved in the radio range in spite of the rich structure observed in the radio emission of this PWN, including several arcs, bright knots, extensions and filaments. The reprocessed X-ray images show for the first time that the X-ray plasma fills almost the same volume as the radio PWN. Notably the X-ray maximum does not coincide with the radio maximum and the neutron star candidate CXOU J174722.8-280915 lies within a small depression in the radio emission. From the new radio data we have refined the flux density estimates, obtaining S(PWN) ~ 1.57 Jy, almost constant between 3.6 and 20 cm. For the whole SNR (compact core and shell), a flux density S(at 20 cm)= 11.5 Jy was estimated. Based on the new and the existing 90 cm flux density estimates, we derived alpha(PWN)=-0.18+/-0.04 and alpha(shell)=-0.68+/- 0.07. From the combination of the radio data with X-ray data, a spectral break is found near nu ~ 2.4 x 10^(12) Hz. The total radio PWN luminosity is L(radio)=1.2 x 10^(35) erg s^(-1) when a distance of 8.5 kpc is adopted. By assuming equipartition between particle and magnetic energies, we estimate a nebular magnetic field B = 56 muG. The associated particle energy turns out to be U(part)=5 x 10^(47) erg and the magnetic energy U(mag)=2 x 10^(47) erg. Based on an empirical relation between X-ray luminosity and pulsar energy loss rate, and the comparison with the calculated total energy, a lower limit of 1100 yr is derived for the age of this PWN.
