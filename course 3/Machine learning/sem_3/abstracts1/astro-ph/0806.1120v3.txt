Relations connecting gamma ray burst quantities can be used to constrain cosmographic parameters of the Hubble law at medium-high redshifts. We consider a sample of 27 gamma ray bursts to construct the luminosity distance to redshift relation and derive the values of the parameters $q_0$, $j_0$, and $s_0$. The analysis is compared with other methods in the literature. gamma gay bursts, if calibrated by SNeIa, seem reliable as distance indicators and give cosmographic parameters in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM model.
