Previous analyses have shown companion galaxies aligned along the minor axis of M31. The alignment includes some galaxies of higher redshift than conventionally accepted for Local Group members. Here we look at the distribution of all high redshift objects listed in a 10 x 10 deg. area around M31. We find not only galaxies of higher redshift but also quasars along the minor axis of this brightest Local Group galaxy, Some are an unusual class of low z, quasar-galaxy.   Previously observers had noted radio sources aligned along the minor axis of M31. The ejection directions of quasars from active galaxy nuclei is also along the minor axis within a cone of about 20 deg. opening angle. It is shown here that the quasar-like and higher redshift objects associated with M31 are relatively concentrated along this axis.   M33 also falls closely along the minor axis of M31 and the famous 3C48 and similar redshift galaxy/quasars are seen along a line coming from this Local Group companion of M31. What appears to be dusty nebulosity has also been shown to exist along this extended line in the sky.
