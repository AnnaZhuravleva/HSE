We present resolved images of the dust continuum emission from the debris disk around the young (80-200 Myr) solar-type star HD 107146 with CARMA at $\lambda$1.3 mm and the CSO at $\lambda$350 $\mu$m. Both images show that the dust emission extends over an $\sim$10\arcsec diameter region. The high resolution (3\arcsec) CARMA image further reveals that the dust is distributed in a partial ring with significant decrease in flux inward of 97 AU. Two prominent emission peaks appear within the ring separated by $\sim$140 degrees in position angle. The morphology of the dust emission is suggestive of dust captured into a mean motion resonance, which would imply the presence of a planet at an orbital radius of $\sim$45-75 AU.
