(Abridged) We present a study of the optical spectra of a sample of eight star-forming nuclear rings and the nuclei of their host galaxies. The spectra were obtained with the ISIS spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope and cover a wide range in wavelength, enabling the measurement of several stellar absorption features and gas emission lines.   We compared the strength of the absorption lines to a variety of population synthesis models for the star-formation history in the nuclear rings, including also the contribution of the older bulge and disc stellar components. We find that the stars in our sample of nuclear rings have most likely formed over a prolonged period of time characterised by episodic bursts of star-formation activity. Constant star formation is firmly ruled out by the data, whereas a one-off formation event is an unlikely explanation for a common galactic component such as nuclear rings.   We have used emission-line measurements to constrain the physical conditions of the ionised gas within the rings. Emission in all nuclear rings originates from HII-regions with electron densities typical for these kinds of objects, and that the rings are characterised by values for the gas metallicity ranging from slightly below to just above solar.   As 20% of nearby spiral galaxies hosts nuclear rings that are currently forming massive stars, our finding of an episodic star formation history in nuclear rings implies that a significant population remains to be identified of young nuclear rings that are not currently in a massive star formation phase.
