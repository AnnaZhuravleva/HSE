We report about the detection of 10 clusters of galaxies in the ongoing Swift/BAT all-sky survey. This sample, which comprises mostly merging clusters, was serendipitously detected in the 15--55 keV band. We use the BAT sample to investigate the presence of excess hard X-rays above the thermal emission. The BAT clusters do not show significant (e.g. >2 $\sigma$) non-thermal hard X-ray emission. The only exception is represented by Perseus whose high-energy emission is likely due to NGC 1275. Using XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, Chandra and BAT data, we are able to produce upper limits on the Inverse Compton (IC) emission mechanism which are in disagreement with most of the previously claimed hard X-ray excesses. The coupling of the X-ray upper limits on the IC mechanism to radio data shows that in some clusters the magnetic field might be larger than 0.5 $\mu$G. We also derive the first logN-logS and luminosity function distribution of galaxy clusters above 15 keV.
