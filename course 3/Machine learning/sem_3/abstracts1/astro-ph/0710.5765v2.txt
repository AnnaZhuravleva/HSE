We examine halo gas cross sections and covering fractions, f_c, of intermediate redshift MgII absorption selected galaxies. We computed statistical absorber halo radii, R_x, using current values of dN/dz and Schechter luminosity function parameters, and have compared these values to the distribution of impact parameters and luminosities from a sample of 37 galaxies. For equivalent widths W_r(2796) > 0.3 Ang, we find 43 < R_x < 88 kpc, depending on the lower luminosity cutoff and the slope, beta, of the Holmberg-like luminosity scaling, R \propto L^beta. The observed distribution of impact parameters, D, are such that several absorbing galaxies lie at D > R_x and several non-absorbing galaxies lie at D < R_x. We deduced f_c must be less than unity and obtain a mean of <f_c> ~ 0.5 for our sample. Moreover, the data suggest halo radii of MgII absorbing galaxies do not follow a luminosity scaling with beta in the range of 0.2-0.28, if f_c= 1 as previously reported. However, provided f_c~0.5, we find that halo radii can remain consistent with a Holmberg-like luminosity relation with beta ~ 0.2 and R* = R_x/sqrt(f_c)= 110 kpc. No luminosity scaling (beta=0) is also consistent with the observed distribution of impact parameters if f_c < 0.37. The data support a scenario in which gaseous halos are patchy and likely have non-symmetric geometric distributions about the galaxies. We suggest halo gas distributions may not be govern primarily by galaxy mass/luminosity but also by stochastic processes local to the galaxy.
