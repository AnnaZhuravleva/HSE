We present the analysis of multi-wavelength observations of bright quasar HS1603+3820: the optical data taken with the MMT and Keck telescopes, and X-ray data obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The optical spectra contain a very large number of absorption lines from numerous heavy elements. We derived X-ray properties of HS1603. The quasar has the optical-to-X-ray slope index alpha_ox of 1.70, which is on the high end of the typical range for radio quiet QSOs. We found 49 individual heavy element absorption clouds, which can be grouped into eleven distinct systems. We determined column densities and redshifts of the individual components. Absorbers from the associated system which is likely spatially closest to the QSO show large CIV to HI column density ratio, reaching ca.20.
