We present results from an optical spectroscopic investigation of the massive binary system [L72] LH~54-425 in the LH 54 OB association in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We revise the ephemeris of [L72] LH 54-425 and find an orbital period of 2.247409 +/- 0.000010 days. We find spectral types of O3 V for the primary and O5 V for the secondary. We made a combined solution of the radial velocities and previously published V-band photometry to determine the inclination for two system configurations, i = 52 degrees for the configuration of the secondary star being more tidally distorted and i = 55 degrees for the primary as the more tidally distorted star. We argue that the latter case is more probable, and this solution yields masses and radii of M_1 = 47 +/- 2 M_Sun and R_1 = 11.4 +/- 0.1 R_Sun for the primary, and M_2 = 28 +/- 1 M_Sun and R_2 = 8.1 +/- 0.1 R_Sun for the secondary. Our analysis places LH 54-425 amongst the most massive stars known. Based on the position of the two stars plotted on a theoretical HR diagram, we find the age of the system to be about 1.5 Myr.
