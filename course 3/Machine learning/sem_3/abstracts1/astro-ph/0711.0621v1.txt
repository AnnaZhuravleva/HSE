Nuclear stellar clusters are a common phenomenon in spirals and in starbursts galaxies, and they may be a natural consequence of the star formation processes in the central regions of galaxies. HST UV imaging of a few Seyfert 2 galaxies have resolved nuclear starbursts in Seyfert 2 revealing stellar clusters as the main building blocks of the extended emission. However, we do not know whether stellar clusters are always associated with all types of nuclear activity. We present NUV and optical images provided by HST to find out the role that stellar clusters play in different types of AGNs (Seyferts and LLAGNs). Also with these images, we study the circumnuclear dust morphology as a probe of the circumnuclear environment of AGNs. Here we present a summary of the the first results obtained for the sample of Seyferts and LLAGN galaxies.
