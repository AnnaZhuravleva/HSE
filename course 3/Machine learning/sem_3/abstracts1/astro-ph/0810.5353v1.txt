Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDG), or self-graviting objects created from the tidal forces in interacting galaxies, have been found in several merging systems. This work will focus on identifying TDG candidates among a sample of Luminous and Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, where these interactions are occurring, in order to study their formation and evolution. High angular resolution imaging from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in B, I and H band will be used to detect these sources. Photometric measurements of these regions compared to Stellar Synthesis Population models will allow us to roughly estimate the age and the mass. Complementary optical Integral Field spectroscopy we will be able to explore the physical, kinematic and dynamical properties in TDGs. We present preliminary photometric results for IRAS 0857+3915, as an example of the study that will be held for the entire sample of (U)LIRGs.
