We model the electrons/positrons produced by dark matter annihilations in the colliding galaxy cluster system 1E0657-56 (the bullet cluster). These charged particles, confined by the Magnetic field, clearly trace the path of the bullet, which passes through the main cluster with a speed of 3000-5000 km/s. Adding the effect of dark matter substructure (subhalos) in each cluster we find the annihilation rate is enhancedgreatly and the density of positrons in the trail is similar to that within the bullet cluster. This opens the door to unambiguous detection of the annihilation signal through the SZ effect, at significant separation from the thermal electrons.
