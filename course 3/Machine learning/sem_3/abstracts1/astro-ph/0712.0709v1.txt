Recently, a relationship between the water maser detection rate and far infrared (FIR) flux density has been found as a result of a 22 GHz maser survey in a sample comprised of northern galaxies with 100 micron flux density > 50 Jy and a declination >-30 degrees. The survey has been extended toward galaxies with lower FIR flux densities in order to confirm this correlation and to discover additional maser sources for relevant follow-up interferometric studies. A sample of 41 galaxies with 30 Jy < S(100 micron) < 50 Jy and Dec. > -30 degrees was observed with the 100-m telescope at Effelsberg in a search for the 22 GHz water vapor line. The average 3-sigma noise level of the survey is 40 mJy for a 1 km/s channel, corresponding to a detection threshold for the isotropic maser luminosity of about 0.5 solar luminosities at a distance of 25 Mpc. Two detections are reported: a megamaser with an isotropic luminosity of approximately 35 solar luminosities in the Seyfert/HII galaxy NGC613 and a kilomaser of approximately 1 solar luminosity in the merger system NGC520.[abridged]
