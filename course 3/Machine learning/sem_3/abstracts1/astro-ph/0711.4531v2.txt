Radio loud jetted sources with and without extended inner jet structure show good agreement with the simple ballistic ejection scenario proposed in the decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, where, because of projection effects, those that show the most obvious extended structure and large angular motions are assumed to have jets that lie close to the plane of the sky, and those with little or no structure and small angular motions are assumed to have jets that are coming almost directly towards us. This simple model also predicts several other relations seen in the raw data that, in some cases, may be less easily explained if the redshifts are cosmological and relativistic ejection is required. In particular, for radio-loud sources the source number density is found to be high for sources that are not Doppler boosted but low for highly boosted sources. This is opposite to what is expected, suggesting that Doppler boosting may not be involved at all, which would be in agreement with the DIR model. If so, the reality of relativistic beaming in quasar jets, the assumption of which has been the very foundation of the superluminal motion explanation in the cosmological redshift (CR) model, would then be questioned.
