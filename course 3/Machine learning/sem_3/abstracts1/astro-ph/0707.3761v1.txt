We analyse the sensitivity of geosynchrotron radio emission from inclined extensive air showers to the energy and mass of primary cosmic rays. We demonstrate that radio emission measurements at suitable lateral distances can infer both the number of electrons and positrons in the shower maximum and the atmospheric depth of the maximum on a shower-to-shower basis. Alternatively, measurements at a fixed lateral distance but in two different observing frequency bands yield comparable information. An RMS error of 5% in the determination of the number of electrons and positrons at shower maximum can be achieved. Through the determination of these quantities, geosynchrotron radiation provides access to the energy and mass of primary cosmic rays on a shower-to-shower basis.
