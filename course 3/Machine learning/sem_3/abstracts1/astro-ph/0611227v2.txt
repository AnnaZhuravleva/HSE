With the latest astronomical data including Cosmic Microwave Background (WMAP three year, CBI, ACBAR, VSA), Type Ia Supernova ("gold sample"), Galaxy Clustering (SDSS 3-D matter power, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and Baryon Acoustic Oscillating (BAO)), we make a global fitting to constrain the mass varying neutrinos. We find that the parameter $\delta$, denoting time evolving of neutrino mass, is weakly constrained and the neutrino mass limit today can be relaxed at least by a factor of two. Adding data of $0\nu2\beta$ decay of Heidelberg-Moscow experiment to our analysis, we find that $\delta$ can be constrained tightly and mass varying neutrinos are favored at about 99.7% confidence level.
