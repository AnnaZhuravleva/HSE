Within the year 2007, MAGIC will be upgraded to a two telescope system at La Palma. Its main goal is to improve the sensitivity in the stereoscopic/coincident operational mode. At the same time it will lower the analysis threshold of the currently running single MAGIC telescope. Results from the Monte Carlo simulations of this system will be discussed. A comparison of the two telescope system with the performance of one single telescope will be shown in terms of sensitivity, angular resolution and energy resolution.
