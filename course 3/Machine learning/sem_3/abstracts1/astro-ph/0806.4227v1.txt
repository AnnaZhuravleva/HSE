The R CrA region was observed in the 3.5 and 6.2 cm continuum with high angular resolutions (0.6--1.7 arcseconds) using the Very Large Array. Archival data sets were also analyzed for comparison, which provided angular resolutions up to 0.3 arcseconds. A cluster of young stellar objects was detected, and a rich array of star forming activities was revealed. IRS 7A showed an enhanced outflow activity recently. The main peak of IRS 7A positionally coincides with an X-ray source, which suggests that the X-ray emission is directly related to the central protostar. The Class 0 source SMA 2 is associated with a double radio source, B 9a and 9b, and seems to be driving two outflows. The B 9 complex is probably a multiple-protostar system. Both B 9a and 9b are nonthermal radio sources with negative spectral indices. IRS 7B is a compact radio source surrounded by an extended structure. The compact source corresponds to the Class 0/I source SMA 1, and it is also closely associated with an X-ray source, suggesting that magnetic activities start early in the protostellar stage of evolution. The extended structure of IRS 7B may be a bipolar outflow. IRS 5 was resolved into two sources with a separation of 0.9 arcseconds. Both IRS 5a and 5b display radio flares and X-ray emission, suggesting that energetic magnetic processes are active in both members. The month-scale active phase of IRS 5b implies that the flare activity must involve large-scale magnetic fields. During the strong flare event of IRS 5b in 1998, IRS 5a also showed an enhanced level of radio emission. This concurrent activity suggests that IRS 5 may be an interacting young binary system, but the interaction mechanism is unknown. Alternatively, what was seen in the radio images could be a circumbinary halo.
