We present observations between 14.2 and 17.9 GHz of sixteen Galactic HII regions made with the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI). In conjunction with data from the literature at lower radio frequencies we investigate the possibility of a spinning dust component in the spectra of these objects. We conclude that there is no significant evidence for spinning dust towards these sources and measure an average spectral index of 0.15+/-0.07 between 1.4 and 17.9 GHz for the sample.
