Star formation is enhanced in spiral arms because of a combination of orbit crowding, cloud collisions, and gravitational instabilities. The characteristic mass for the instability is 10^7 Msun in gas and 10^5 Msun in stars, and the morphology is the familiar beads on a string with 1-2 kpc separation. Similar instabilities occur in resonance rings and tidal tails. Sequential triggering from stellar pressure occurs in two ways. For short times and near distances, it occurs in the bright rims and dense knots that lag behind during cloud dispersal. For long times, it occurs in swept-up shells and along the periphery of cleared regions. The first case should be common but difficult to disentangle from independent star formation in the same cloud. The second case has a causality condition and a collapse condition and is often easy to recognize. Turbulent triggering produces a hierarchy of dense cloudy structure and an associated hierarchy of young star positions. There should also be a correlation between the duration of star formation and the size of the region that is analogous to the size-linewidth relation in the gas. The cosmological context is provided by observations of star formation in high redshift galaxies. Sequential and turbulent triggering is not yet observable, but gravitational instabilities are, and they show a scale up from local instabilities by a factor of ~3 in size and ~100 in mass. This is most easily explained as the result of an increase in the ISM turbulent speed by a factor of ~5. In the clumpiest galaxies at high redshift, the clumps are so large that they should interact with each other and merge in the center, where they form or contribute to the bulge.
