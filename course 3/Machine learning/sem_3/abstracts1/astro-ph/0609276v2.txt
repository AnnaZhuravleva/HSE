Analysis and interpretation of the Her X-1 X-ray light curve obtained with the ASM onbord RXTE over the period 1996 February to 2004 September is presented. We report that the features found previously in the averaged X-ray lightcurve are confirmed by the new RXTE/ASM data. In particular, anomalous dips and post-eclipse recoveries in two successive orbits in the short-on state are found to be prominent and stable details of the light curve. We argue that a change of the tilt of the accretion disk over the 35-day period is necessary to account for these features and show that our numerical model can explain such a behavior of the disk and reproduce the observed details of the light curve.
