AIM: To study the variation of the angular momentum and the rotational kinetic energy of the Sun, and associated variations in the gravitational multipole moments, on a timescale of the solar cycle. METHOD: Inverting helioseismic rotational splitting data obtained by the Global Oscillation Network Group and by the Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. RESULTS: The temporal variation in angular momentum and kinetic energy at high latitudes (>\pi/4) through the convection zone is positively correlated with solar activity, whereas at low latitudes it is anticorrelated, except for the top 10% by radius where both are correlated positively. CONCLUSION: The helioseismic data imply significant temporal variation in the angular momentum and the rotational kinetic energy, and in the gravitational multipole moments. The properties of that variation will help constrain dynamical theories of the solar cycle.
