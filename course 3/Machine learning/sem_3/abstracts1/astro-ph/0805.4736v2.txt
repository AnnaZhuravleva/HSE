A new all-sky catalog of stars with proper motions pm>0.15"/yr is presented. The catalog is largely a product of the SUPERBLINK survey, a data-mining initiative in which the entire Digitized Sky Surveys are searched for moving stellar sources. Findings from earlier proper motions surveys are also incorporated. The new all-sky catalog supersedes the great historic proper motion catalogs assembled by W. J. Luyten (LHS, NLTT), and provides a virtually complete (>98%) census of high proper motion stars down to magnitude R=19.
