The star HDE 226868 known as an optical counterpart of the black hole candidate Cyg X-1 has been observed in H_alpha region using spectrograph at Ondrejov 2-m telescope. The orbital parameters are determined from HeI-line by means of the author's method of Fourier disentangling. Preliminary results are also presented of disentangling the H_alpha-line into a P-Cyg profile of the (optical) primary and an emission profile of the circumstellar matter (and a telluric component).
