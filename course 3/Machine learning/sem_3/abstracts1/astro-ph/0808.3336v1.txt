We present the atlas of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula based on the ACS/WFC images obtained for the HST Treasury Program on the Orion Nebula Cluster. The observations have been carried out in 5 photometric filters nearly equivalent to the standard B, V, Halpha, I, and z passbands. Our master catalog lists 178 externally ionized proto-planetary disks (proplyds), 28 disks seen only in absorption against the bright nebular background (silhouette disks), 8 disks seen only as dark lanes at the midplane of extended polar emission (bipolar nebulae or reflection nebulae) and 5 sources showing jet emission with no evidence of neither external ionized gas emission nor dark silhouette disks. Many of these disks are associated with jets seen in Halpha and circumstellar material detected through reflection emission in our broad-band filters; approximately 2/3 have identified counterparts in x-rays. A total of 47 objects (29 proplyds, 7 silhouette disks, 6 bipolar nebulae, 5 jets with no evidence of proplyd emission or silhouette disk) are new detections with HST. We include in our list 4 objects previously reported as circumstellar disks which have not been detected in our HST/ACS images either because they are hidden by the bleeding trails of a nearby saturated bright star or because of their location out of the HST/ACS Treasury Program field. Other 31 sources previously reported as extended objects do not harbor a stellar source in our HST/ACS images. We also report on the detection of 16 red, elongated sources. Their location at the edges of the field, far from the Trapezium Cluster core (> 10'), suggests that these are probably background galaxies observed through low extinction regions of the Orion Molecular Cloud OMC-1.
