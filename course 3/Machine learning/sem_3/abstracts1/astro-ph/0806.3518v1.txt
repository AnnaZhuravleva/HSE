J2018-556, an X-shaped FR-I radio galaxy provides a unique opportunity to discuss the formation scenarios for the extended structures seen in this class of radio sources. An understanding of the origin of X-shaped source structures has important implications for radio galaxy models as well as black hole-black hole mergers. Guided by our ATCA radio continuum observations of J2018-556 we discuss evidence in support of 'wings' forming as a result of a redirection of backflows by asymmetric gas distribution associated with the host galaxy. Formation models invoking interaction between backflows with asymmetric environments seem the preferred model for X-shaped radio sources despite apparent discoveries of X-shaped FR-I radio sources.
