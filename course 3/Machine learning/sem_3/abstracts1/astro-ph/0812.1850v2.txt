We present a new prediction of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission from radio lobes of young AGN jets. In the previous work of Kino et al. (2007), MeV $\gamma$-ray bremsstrahlung emission was predicted from young cocoons/radio-lobes in the regime of no coolings. In this study, we include cooling effects of bremsstrahlung emission and adiabatic loss. With the initial conditions determined by observed young radio lobes, we solve a set of equations describing the expanding lobe evolution. Then we find that the lobes initially have electron temperature of $\sim$GeV, and they cool down to $\sim$MeV by the adiabatic loss. Correspondingly, the lobes initially yield bright bremsstrahlung luminosity in $\sim$GeV range and they fade out. We estimate these $\gamma$-ray emissions and show that nearby young radio lobes could be detected with Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
