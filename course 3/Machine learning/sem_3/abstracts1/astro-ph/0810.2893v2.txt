Clustering in the luminosity of the afterglows of gamma-ray burst has been reported in the optical and X-ray. We investigate the possibility that a clustering in the luminosity of the afterglows of gamma-ray burst exists in near infrared (J, H, K bands). We use observations of events occurring from 1997 to the end of 2007. We correct the gamma-ray burst afterglow light curve for distance effect and time dilation, and replace all light curves to a common distance of z=1. We used only observations of signal emitted in the near infrared (in the burst frame). We observe a clustering identical to the one observed in optical and similar to the one observed in X-ray. We thus confirm the previous works made in optical. We set a constraint on the total energy of the fireball.
