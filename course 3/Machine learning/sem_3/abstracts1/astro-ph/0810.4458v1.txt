We study the effects of synchrotron self-absorption on the Comptonising electron distribution in the magnetised corona of accreting black holes. We solve the kinetic equations assuming that power is supplied to the coronal electrons through Coulomb collisions with a population of hot protons and/or through the injection of non-thermal energetic electrons by some unspecified acceleration process. We compute numerically the steady state particle distributions and escaping photon spectra. These numerical simulations confirm that synchrotron self-absorption, together with e-e Coulomb collisions, constitute an efficient thermalising mechanism for the coronal electrons. When compared to the data, they allow us to constrain the magnetic field and temperature of the hot protons in the corona independently of any dynamical accretion flow model or geometry. A preliminary comparison with the Low Hard State (LHS) spectrum of Cygnus X-1 indicates a magnetic field below equipartition with radiation, suggesting that the corona is not powered through magnetic field dissipation (as assumed in most accretion disc corona models). However, in the LHS of Cygnus X-1 and other sources, our results also point toward proton temperatures substantially lower than what predicted by the ADAF-like models. In contrast, in the High Soft State (HSS) both the proton temperature and magnetic field could be much higher. We also show that in both spectral states the magnetised corona could be powered essentially through acceleration of non-thermal particles. The main differences between the LHS and HSS coronal emission can then be understood as the consequence of the much stronger radiative cooling in the HSS caused by the soft thermal radiation coming from the geometrically thin accretion disc.
