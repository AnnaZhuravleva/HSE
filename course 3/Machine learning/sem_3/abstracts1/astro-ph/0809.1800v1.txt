This article summarizes the basic facts and ideas concerning the formation and evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs). It is shown why the formation of CVs must involve huge losses of mass and orbital angular momentum, very likely via a common envelope evolution. A brief discussion of the principles of the long-term evolution of semi-detached binaries follows. Finally a brief sketch of CV evolution is given.
