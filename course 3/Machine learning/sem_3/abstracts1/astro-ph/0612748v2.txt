High resolution spectra of the Spitzer Space Telescope show vibration-rotation absorption bands of gaseous C2H2, HCN, and CO2 molecules toward a sample of deeply obscured (U)LIRG nuclei. The observed bands reveal the presence of dense (n>~ 10^7 cm^-3), warm (T_ex = 200-700 K) molecular gas with high column densities of these molecules ranging from a few 10^15 - 10^17 cm^-2. Abundances relative to H2, inferred from the silicate optical depth, range from ~10^-7 to 10^-6 and show no correlation with temperature. Theoretical studies show that the high abundances of both C2H2 and HCN exclude a X-ray dominated region (XDR) associated with the toroid surrounding an AGN as the origin of this dense warm molecular gas. Galactic massive protostars in the so-called Hot Core phase have similar physical characteristics with comparable high abundances of C2H2, HCN, and CO2 in the hot phase. However, the abundances of C2H2 and HCN and the C2H2/CO2 and HCN/CO2 ratios are much higher toward the (U)LIRGs in the cooler (T_ex <= 400 K) phase. We suggest that the warm dense molecular gas revealed by the mid-IR absorption lines is associated with a phase of deeply embedded star formation where the extreme pressures and densities of the nuclear starburst environment have inhibited the expansion of HII regions and the global disruption of the star forming molecular cloud cores, and `trapped' the star formation process in an `extended' Hot Core phase.
