We show that repeated sound waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) can be excited by a single inflation episode of an opposite bubble pair. To reproduce this behavior in numerical simulations the bubbles should be inflated by jets, rather than being injected artificially. The multiple sound waves are excited by the motion of the bubble-ICM boundary that is caused by vortices inside the inflated bubbles and the backflow (`cocoon') of the ICM around the bubble. These sound waves form a structure that can account for the ripples observed in the Perseus cooling flow cluster. We inflate the bubbles using slow massive jets, with either a wide opening angle or that are precessing. The jets are slow in the sense that they are highly sub-relativistic, $v_j \sim 0.01c-0.1c$, and they are massive in the sense that the pair of bubbles carry back to the ICM a large fraction of the cooling mass, i.e., $\sim 1-50 M_\odot \yr^{-1}$. We use a two-dimensional axisymmetric (referred to as 2.5D) hydrodynamical numerical code (VH-1).
