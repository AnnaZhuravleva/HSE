Most if not all stars form in star clusters. Thus the distribution of star clusters preserves the information on the star formation history of a galaxy. Massive clusters form only during episodes of high star formation activity whereas periods of low star formation activity cannot produce them. We present here the method of Maschberger & Kroupa (2007) to derive the star formation history of a galaxy from its star-cluster content.
