We consider a phenomenological model for a coupling between the dark matter and dark energy fluids and investigate the sensitivity of a weak lensing measurement for constraining the size of this coupling term. Physically, the functional form of the coupling term in our model describes the decay of dark matter into dark energy. We present forecasts for tomographic measurements of the weak shear bispectrum for the DUNE experiment in a Fisher-matrix formalism, where we describe the nonlinearities in structure formation by hyper-extended perturbation theory. Physically, CDM decay tends to increase the growth rate of density perturbations due to higher values for the CDM density at early times, and amplifies the lensing signal because of stronger fluctuations in the gravitational potential. We focus on degeneracies between the dark energy equation of state properties and the CDM decay constant relevant for structure formation and weak lensing. A typical lower bound on the CDM decay time ~7.7/H_0 = 75.3 Gyr/h$ which could be provided by DUNE would imply that it would not possible to produce the dark energy content of the universe by CDM decay within the age of the Universe for a constant equation of state parameter of w close to -1.
