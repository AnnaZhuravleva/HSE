Using a bistatic radar system on the ice surface, we have studied radiofrequency reflections off internal layers in Antarctic ice at the South Pole. In our measurement, the total propagation time of ~ns-duration, vertically broadcast radio signals, as a function of polarization axis in the horizontal plane, provides a direct probe of the geometry-dependence of the ice permittivity to depths of 1--2 km. Previous studies in East Antarctica have interpreted the measured azimuthal dependence of reflected signals as evidence for birefringent-induced interference effects, which are proposed to result from preferred alignment of the crystal orientation fabric (COF) axis. To the extent that COF alignment results from the bulk flow of ice across the Antarctic continent, we would expect a measurable birefringent asymmetry at South Pole, as well. Although we also observe clear dependence of reflected amplitude on polarization angle in our measurements, we do not observe direct evidence for birefringent-induced time-delay effects at the level of 0.1 parts per mille.
