We discuss the gamma-ray absorption in the inner region of the microquasar SS433. Our investigation includes several contributions to the opacity of this system. They result from the ambient fields generated by the primary star, possibly an A-type supergiant, and a very extended disk around the black hole. Besides the sharp and dramatic absorption effect that occurs every time the star crosses the emission zone, we find in the UV photon field from the extended disk an important source of absorption for very high energy gamma-rays. This results in periodic gamma-ray observational signatures.
