A prototype string for the future km3-scale Baikal neutrino telescope has been deployed in April, 2008 and is fully integrated into the NT200+ telescope. All basic string elements - optical modules (with 12"/13" hemispherical photomultipliers), 200MHz FADC readout and calibration system - have been redesigned following experience with NT200+. First results of in-situ operation of this prototype string are presented.
