The Rosette Complex in the constellation of Monoceros is a magnificent laboratory for the study of star formation. The region presents an interesting scenario, in which an expanding HII region generated by the large OB association NGC 2244 is interacting with a giant molecular cloud. Inside the cloud a number of stellar clusters have formed recently. In this chapter we present a review of past and present research on the region, and discuss investigations relevant to the physics of the nebula and the molecular cloud. We also review recent work on the younger embedded clusters and individual nebulous objects located across this important star forming region.
