We develop a simple method of dark energy reconstruction using a geometrical form of the luminosity-distance relation. In this method the FRW dynamical system with dark energy is reconstructed instead of the equation of state parameter. We give several examples which illustrate the usefulness of our method in fitting the redshift transition from the decelerating to accelerating phase as the value of the Hubble function at the transition.
