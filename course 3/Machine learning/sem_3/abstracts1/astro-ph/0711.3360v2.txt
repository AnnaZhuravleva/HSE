We explore the stability properties of multi-field solutions of assisted inflation type, where several fields collectively evolve to the same configuration. In the case of noninteracting fields, we show that the condition for such solutions to be stable is less restrictive than that required for tracking in quintessence models. Our results, which do not rely on the slow-roll approximation, further indicate that to linear order in homogeneous perturbations the fields are in fact unaware of each other's existence. We end by generalizing our results to some cases of interacting fields and to other background solutions and dynamics, including the high-energy braneworld.
