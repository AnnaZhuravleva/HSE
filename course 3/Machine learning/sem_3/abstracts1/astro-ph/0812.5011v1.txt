Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and its relativistic version - TeVeS offer us an alternative perspective to understand the universe without the demand of the elusive cold dark matter. This MONDian paradigm is not only competitive with the conventional CDM in a large range of scales, but also even more successful in the galactic scale. Recently, by studying 6 lensing systems, Ferreras et al. (2008) claimed that MOND still needs dark matter even in galactic scales. When we study the same systems, however, we yield an opposite conclusion. In this contribution, we report our result and conclude that MOND does not need dark matter in galactic lensing systems. Furthermore, we extend our study to 22 SLACS (Sloan Lens ACS Survey) lenses, and obtain the same conclusion as well, i.e., no dark matter is needed in elliptical galaxies.
