An extension may be proposed to the intensity interferometer of Hanbury Brown and Twiss to provide the Fourier phase measurement by the use of third-order intensity correlations. It is well known that interferometric reconstruction of astronomical images can be obtained from second-order correlations only when a priory information is used about the object. The third-order intensity correlations contain information about the Fourier phase and need no such assumptions. In the ordinary way we can make measurements of the second-order intensity correlations with an intensity interferometer. We can also calculate the third-order intensity correlations from the data set of measured intensities for each distance triplet. After that we can reconstruct the Fourier phase from third-order correlations by using bipectral technique. When this is combining with the Fourier magnitude obtained from the second-order intensity correlations, we have the ultimate Fourier transform of the source brightness distribution. An inverse Fourier transform recovers the source image.
