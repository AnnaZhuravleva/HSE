We study the most central regions of AGN jets with an angular resolution of tens of micro-arcseconds using VLBI at millimeter wavelengths (mm-VLBI). We present and discuss a new 86 GHz VLBI survey of compact radio sources. We show new high dynamic range images of two nearby radio galaxies (3C 120 and M87). In M87 the size of the compact VLBI core (the jet base) is < 15 Schwarzschild radii. Future mm-VLBI observations at 1 mm and shorter wavelengths should lead to images of galactic and extragalactic radio sources with a spatial resolution down to a few Schwarzschild radii of the central super massive black holes. To achieve this, the participation of large and sensitive millimeter and sub-millimeter telescopes in VLBI is essential. Owing to their high sensitivity existing and planned phased interferometers like the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer, CARMA, the SMA and ALMA could play an important role.
