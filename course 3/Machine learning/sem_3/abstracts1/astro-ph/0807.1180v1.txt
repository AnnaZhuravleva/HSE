We present the first results of a project aimed at following the formation and long-term dynamical evolution of star clusters within the potential of a host galaxy. Here we focus on a model evolved within a simplified potential representing the Large Magellanic Cloud. This demonstrates for the first time the self-consistent formation of a bound star cluster from a giant molecular cloud. The model cluster reproduces the density profiles and structural characteristics of observed star clusters.
