Vastly different time and length scales are a common problem in numerical simulations of astrophysical phenomena. Here, we present an approach to numerical modeling of such objects on the example of Type Ia supernova simulations. The evolution towards the explosion proceeds on much longer time scales than the explosion process itself. The physical length scales relevant in the explosion process cover 11 orders of magnitude and turbulent effects dominate the physical mechanism. Despite these challenges, three-dimensional simulations of Type Ia supernova explosions have recently become possible and pave the way to a better understanding of these important astrophysical objects.
