Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 with K_{Vega}<22 from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR, to submillimeter, radio and rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z~2 galaxies with moderate luminosities(L_{8um}<10^{11}L_sun), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However,20--30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L_{8um}>10^{11}L_sun, show a mid-IR excess which is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24um-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively 'transparent' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived (~400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4, and the space density of ULIRGs by an orderof magnitude, but give better agreement for z>1.4 quiescent galaxies.
