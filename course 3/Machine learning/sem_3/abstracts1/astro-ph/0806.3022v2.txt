We report new continuum observations of fourteen z~6 quasars at 250 GHz and fourteen quasars at 1.4 GHz. We summarize all recent millimeter and radio observations of the sample of the thirty-three quasars known with 5.71<=z<=6.43, and present a study of the rest frame far-infrared (FIR) properties of this sample. These quasars were observed with the Max Plank Millimeter Bolometer Array (MAMBO) at 250 GHz with mJy sensitivity, and 30% of them were detected. We also recover the average 250 GHz flux density of the MAMBO undetected sources at 4 sigma, by stacking the on-source measurements. The derived mean radio-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the full sample and the 250 GHz non-detections show no significant difference from that of lower-redshift optical quasars. Obvious FIR excesses are seen in the individual SEDs of the strong 250 GHz detections, with FIR-to-radio emission ratios consistent with that of typical star forming galaxies. Most 250 GHz-detected sources follow the L_{FIR}--L_{bol} relationship derived from a sample of local IR luminous quasars (L_{IR}>10^{12}L_{\odot}), while the average L_{FIR}/L_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that of the optically-selected PG quasars. The MAMBO detections also tend to have weaker Ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. We discuss possible FIR dust heating sources, and critically assess the possibility of active star formation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. The average star formation rate of the MAMBO non-detections is likely to be less than a few hundred M_{\odot} yr^{-1}, but in the strong detections, the host galaxy star formation is probably at a rate of \gtrsim10^{3} M_{\odot} yr^{-1}, which dominates the FIR dust heating.
