The accretion-powered (non-X-ray burst) pulsations of XTE J1814-338 are modeled to determine neutron star parameters and their uncertainties. The model is a rotating circular hot spot and includes: (1) an isotropic blackbody spectral component; (2) an anisotropic Comptonized spectral component; (3) relativistic time-delays and light-bending; and (4) the oblate shape of the star due to rotation. This model is the simplest possible model that is consistent with the data. The resulting best-fit parameters of the model favor stiff equations of state, as can be seen from the 3-sigma allowed regions in the mass-radius diagram. We analyzed all data combined from a 23 day period of the 2003 outburst, and separately analyzed data from 2 days of the outburst. The allowed mass-radius regions for both cases only allow equations of state (EOS) that are stiffer than EOS APR (Akmal et al. 1998), consistent with the large mass that has been inferred for the pulsar NGC 6440B (Freire et al. 2008). The stiff EOS inferred by this analysis is not compatible with the soft EOS inferred from a similar analysis of SAX J1808.
