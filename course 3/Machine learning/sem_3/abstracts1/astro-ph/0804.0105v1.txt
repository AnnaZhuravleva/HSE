The Blazhko effect in RR Lyrae stars is still poorly understood theoretically. Stars with multiple Blazhko periods or in which the Blazhko effect itself varies are particularly challenging. This study investigates the Blazhko effect in the RRc star LS Her. Detailed VRI CCD photometry has been performed on 63 nights during six months. LS Her is confirmed to have a Blazhko period of 12.75+/-0.02 days. However, where normally the side frequencies of the Blazhko triplet are expected, an equidistant group of three frequencies is found on both sides of the main pulsation frequency. As a consequence the period and amplitude of the Blazhko effect itself vary in a cycle of 109+/-4 days. LS Her is a unique object turning out to be very important in the verification of the theories for the Blazhko effect.
