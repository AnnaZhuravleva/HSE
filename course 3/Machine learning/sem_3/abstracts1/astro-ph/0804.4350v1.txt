The main observational properties and resulting classification of supernovae (SNe) are briefly reviewed. Then we discuss the progress in modeling of two basic types of SNe - the thermonuclear and core-collapse ones, with special emphasis being placed on difficulties relating to a consistent description of thermonuclear flame propagation and the detachment of supernova envelope from the collapsing core (a nascent neutron star). The properties of the neutrino flux expected from the corecollapse SNe, and the lessons of SN1987A, exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, are considered as well.
