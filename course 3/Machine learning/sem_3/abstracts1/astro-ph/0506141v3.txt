We study the resonant absorption of MHD waves in magnetized flux tubes with a radial density inhomogeneity. Within the approximation that resistive and viscous processes are operative in thin layers surrounding the singularities of the MHD equations, we give the full spectrum of the eigenfrequencies and damping rates of the MHD quasi modes of the tube. Both surface and body modes are analyzed. \keywords{Sun -- corona: magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) -- Sun: magnetic fields -- Sun: oscillations
