Detailed physical processes of magnetic field generation from density fluctuations in the pre-recombination era are studied. Solving Maxwell equations and the generalized Ohm's law, the evolutions of the net charge density, the electric current and the electromagnetic field are solved. Unlike most of previous works, we treat electrons and photons as separate components under the assumption of tight coupling. We find that generation of the magnetic field due to density fluctuations takes place only from the second order of both perturbation theory and the tight coupling approximation.
