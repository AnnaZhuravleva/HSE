We discuss the star formation history of the Galaxy, based on the observations of extremely metal-poor stars (EMP) in the Galactic halo, to gain an insight into the evolution and structure formation in the early universe. The initialmass function (IMF) of EMP stars is derived from the observed fraction of carbon-enhanced EXP (CEMP) stars among the EMP survivors, which are thought to originate from the evolution in the close binary systems with mass transfer. Relying upon the theory of the evolution of EMP stars and of their binary evolution, we find that stars of metallicity [Fe/H]<-2.5 were formed at typical mass of ~10M_sun. The top heavy IMF thus obtained is applied to study the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy. We construct the merging history of our Galaxy semi-analytically and derive the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of low-mass EMP stars that survive to date with taking into account the contribution of binary systems. It is shown that the resultant MDF can well reproduce the observed distribution of EMP survivors, and, in particular, that they almost all stem from a less-mass companion in binary systems. We also investigate how first stars affect the MDF of EMP stars.
