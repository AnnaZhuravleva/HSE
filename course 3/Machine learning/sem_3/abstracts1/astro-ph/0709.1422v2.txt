The Pierre Auger Observatory, a hybrid detector for the study of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), is now approaching completion. After describing Auger present status and performance, with an emphasis on the advantages provided by the combination of two different detection techniques, this contribution presents a brief panorama of the first scientific results achieved and of their impact on our knowledge of the UHECRs' origin and composition.
