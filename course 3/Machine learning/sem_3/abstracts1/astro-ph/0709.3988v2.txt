We consider a modified action functional with a non-minimum coupling between the scalar curvature and the matter Lagrangian, and study its consequences on stellar equilibrium. Particular attention is paid to the validity of the Newtonian regime, and on the boundary and exterior matching conditions, as well as on the redefinition of the metric components. Comparison with solar observables is achieved through numerical analysis, and constraints on the non-minimum coupling are discussed.
