We investigate large-amplitude baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO's) in off-diagonal entries of cosmological power-spectrum covariance matrices. These covariance-matrix BAO's describe the increased attenuation of power-spectrum BAO's caused by upward fluctuations in large-scale power. We derive an analytic approximation to covariance-matrix entries in the BAO regime, and check the analytical predictions using N-body simulations. These BAO's look much stronger than the BAO's in the power spectrum, but seem detectable only at about a one-sigma level in gigaparsec-scale galaxy surveys. In estimating cosmological parameters using matter or galaxy power spectra, including the covariance-matrix BAO's can have a several-percent effect on error-bar widths for some parameters directly related to the BAO's, such as the baryon fraction. Also, we find that including the numerous galaxies in small haloes in a survey can reduce error bars in these cosmological parameters more than the simple reduction in shot noise might suggest.
