The precise localization of short/hard (Type I) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in recent years has answered many questions but raised even more. I present some results of a systematic study of the optical afterglows of long/soft (Type II) and short/hard (Type I) GRBs, focusing on the optical luminosity as another puzzle piece in the classification of GRBs.
