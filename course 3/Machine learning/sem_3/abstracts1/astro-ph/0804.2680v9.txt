Since there are dark matter particles (neutrino) with mass about 10^(-1)eV in the universe, the superstructures with a scale of 10^(19) solar mass [large number A is about 10^(19)] appeared around the era of the hydrogen recombination. The redshift z distributions of quasars support the existence of superstructures. Since there are superstructures in the universe, it is not necessary for the hypothesis of dark energy. While neutrino is related to electro-weak field, the fourth stable elementary particles (delta particle) with mass about 10^(0)eV to 10^(1)eV is related to gravitation-"strong" field, which suggests p + anti(p)--> n/anti(n) + anti(delta particle)/(delta particle) and that some new meta-stable baryons appeared near the TeV region. Therefore, a twofold standard model diagram is proposed, and related to many experiment phenomena: The new meta-stable baryons' decays produce delta particles, which are helpful to explain the Dijet asymmetry phenomena at LHC of CERN, the different results for the Fermilab's data peak, etc; However, according to the (B-L) invariance, the sterile "neutrino" from "the event excess in MiniBooNe" can not be the fourth neutrino but rather the delta particle; We think that the delta particles are related to the phenomenon about neutrinos FTL, and that anti-neutrinos are faster than neutrinos. FTL is also related to the cosmic inflation, singular point disappearance, and abnormal red shift of SN Ia. Some experiments and observations are suggested. In the Extension section, we clarify "mass tree", our finite universe, cosmic dual expansions, dual SM etc. And the LHC can look for new particles with decay products graviton/delta particle and new interaction indeed.
