I describe the IR and X-ray campaign we have undertaken to determine the nature of the faint discrete X-ray source population discovered by Chandra in the Galactic Center. These results will provide the input to the FLAMINGOS-2 Galactic Center Survey (F2GCS). With FLAMINGOS-2's multi-object IR spectrograph we will obtain 1000s of IR spectra of candidate X-ray source counterparts, allowing us to efficiently identify the nature of these sources, and thus dramatically increase the number of known X-ray binaries and CVs in the Milky Way.
