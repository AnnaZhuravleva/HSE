Traditionally globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been distinguished by using one or more of the following criteria: (1) mass, (2) luminosity, (3) size, (4) mass-to-light ratio and (5) spread in metallicity. However, a few recently discovered objects show some overlap between the domains in parameter space that are occupied by galaxies and clusters. In the present note it is shown that ellipticity can, in some cases, be used to help distinguish between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
