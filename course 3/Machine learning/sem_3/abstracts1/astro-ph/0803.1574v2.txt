Spiral patterns are important agents of galaxy evolution. In this review, I describe how the redistribution of angular momentum by recurrent transient spiral patterns causes the random speeds of stars to rise over time, metallicity gradients to be reduced, and drives large-scale turbulence in the disk, which could be important for galactic dynamos. I also outline a possible mechanism for the recurrence of spiral instabilities and supporting evidence from solar neighborhood kinematics. Finally, I confirm that cloud scattering alone would predict the local velocity ellipsoid to be flattened, contrary to long-held expectations.
