Direction measurement of weakly interacting massive particles in time-projection chambers can provide definite evidence of their existence and help to determine their properties. This article demonstrates several concepts for charge amplification in time-projection chambers that can be used in direction-sensitive dark matter search experiments. We demonstrate reconstruction of the 'head-tail' effect for nuclear recoils above 100keV, and discuss the detector performance in the context of dark matter detection and scaling to large detector volumes.
