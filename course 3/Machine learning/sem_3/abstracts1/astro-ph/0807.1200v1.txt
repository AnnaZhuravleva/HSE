After reviewing the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) proposal, we advocate that the associated phenomenology may actually not result from a modification of Newtonian gravity, but from a mechanism of "gravitational polarization" of some dipolar medium playing the role of dark matter. We then build a relativistic model within standard general relativity to describe (at some phenomenological level) the dipolar dark matter polarizable in a gravitational field. The model naturally involves a cosmological constant, and is shown to reduce to the concordance cosmological scenario (Lambda-CDM) at early cosmological times. From the mechanism of gravitational polarization, we recover the phenomenology of MOND in a typical galaxy at low redshift. Furthermore, we show that the cosmological constant Lambda scales like a0^2, where a0 is the constant MOND acceleration scale, in good agreement with observations.
