There is a lot of current astrophysical evidence and interest in intermediate mass black holes, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand solar masses. The active galaxy M82 and the globular cluster in M31, for example, are known to host such objects. Here we discuss several aspects of intermediate mass black holes such as their expected luminosity, spectral nature of radiation, associated jets, etc. We also discuss possible scenarios for their formation including the effects of dynamical friction, gravitational radiation, etc. We also consider their formation in the early universe and also discuss the possibility of supermassive black holes forming from mergers of several intermediate mass black holes and compare the relevant time scales involved with other scenarios.
