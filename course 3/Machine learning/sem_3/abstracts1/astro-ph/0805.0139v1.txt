Weak gravitational lensing is a unique probe of the dark side of the universe: it provides a direct way to map the distribution of dark matter around galaxies, clusters of galaxies and on cosmological scales. Furthermore, the measurement of lensing induced distortions of the shapes of distant galaxies is a powerful probe of dark energy. In this review we describe how lensing measurements are made and interpreted. We discuss various systematic effects that can hamper progress and how they may be overcome. We review some of the recent results in weak lensing by galaxies, galaxy clusters and cosmic shear and discuss the prospects for dark energy measurements from planned surveys.
