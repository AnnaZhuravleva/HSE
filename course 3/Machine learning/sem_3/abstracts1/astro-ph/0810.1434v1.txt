We have optically identified a recently discovered INTEGRAL source, IGR J08390--4833, with a cataclysmic variable, i.e. an accreting white dwarf in a binary system. The spectrum exhibits a rising blue continuum together with Balmer and HeII emission lines. Analysis of the light curve of the source shows clear presence of intrinsic variability on a time scale of the order of an hour, although we do not claim that this variability is periodic. Therefore we are not yet able to classify the object into a specific CV subclass.
