Combining visual observations of SR variables with measurements of them using a photoelectric photometer is discussed then demonstrated using data obtained for the bright, southern SR variable theta Aps. Combining such observations is useful in that it can provide a more comprehensive set of data by extending the temporal coverage of the light curve. Typically there are systematic differences in the visual and photometric datasets that must be corrected for.
