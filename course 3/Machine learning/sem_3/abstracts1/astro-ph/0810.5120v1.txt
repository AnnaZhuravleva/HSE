We present new V-band differential photometry and radial-velocity measurements of the unevolved 1.18-day period F+G-type double-lined eclipsing binary VZ Cep. We determine accurate values for the absolute masses, radii, and effective temperatures as follows: M(A) = 1.402 +/- 0.015 M(Sun), R(A) = 1.534 +/- 0.012 R(Sun), T(eff) = 6690 +/- 160 K for the primary, and M(B) = 1.1077 +/- 0.0083 M(Sun), R(B) = 1.042 +/- 0.039 R(Sun), T(eff) = 5720 +/- 120 K for the secondary. A comparison with current stellar evolution models suggests an age of 1.4 Gyr for a metallicity near solar. The temperature difference between the stars, which is much better determined than the absolute values, is found to be about 250 K larger than predicted by theory. If all of this discrepancy is attributed to the secondary (which would then be too cool compared to models), the effect would be consistent with similar differences found for other low-mass stars, generally believed to be associated with chromospheric activity. However, the radius of VZ Cep B (which unlike the primary, still has a thin convective envelope) appears normal, whereas in other stars affected by activity the radius is systematically larger than predicted. Thus, VZ Cep poses a challenge not only to standard theory but to our understanding of the discrepancies in other low-mass systems as well.
