We present multi-frequency observations of a sample of 15 radio-emitting Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BAL QSOs), covering a spectral range between 74 MHz and 43 GHz. They display mostly convex radio spectra which typically peak at about 1-5 GHz (in the observer's rest-frame), flatten at MHz frequencies, probably due to synchrotron self-absorption, and become steeper at high frequencies, i.e., >~ 20 GHz. VLA 22-GHz maps (HPBW ~ 80 mas) show unresolved or very compact sources, with linear projected sizes of <= 1 kpc. About 2/3 of the sample look unpolarised or weakly polarised at 8.4 GHz, frequency in which reasonable upper limits could be obtained for polarised intensity. Statistical comparisons have been made between the spectral index distributions of samples of BAL and non-BAL QSOs, both in the observed and the rest-frame, finding steeper spectra among non-BAL QSOs. However constraining this comparison to compact sources results in no significant differences between both distributions. This comparison is consistent with BAL QSOs not being oriented along a particular line of sight. In addition, our analysis of the spectral shape, variability and polarisation properties shows that radio BAL QSOs share several properties common to young radio sources like Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) or Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources.
