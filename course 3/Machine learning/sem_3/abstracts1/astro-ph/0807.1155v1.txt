We measure the width of the MgII $\lambda2799$ line in quasar spectra from the SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ surveys and, by invoking an unnormalised virial mass estimator, relate the scatter in line width to the scatter in mass in the underlying black hole population. We find conclusive evidence for a trend such that there is less scatter in line width, and hence black hole mass, in more luminous objects.   However, the most luminous objects in our sample show such a low degree of scatter in line width that, when combined with measures for the intrinsic scatter in the radius-luminosity relation for the broad-line region in active galaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating black hole masses. This analysis implies that, at least for the most luminous quasars, either there is little-to-no intrinsic scatter in the radius-luminosity relation or the MgII broad emission line region is not totally dominated by virial velocities.   Finally we exploit the measured scatter in line widths to constrain models for the velocity field of the broad-line region. We show that the lack of scatter in broad line-widths for luminous quasars is inconsistent with a pure planar/disk-like geometry for the broad-line region... (abridged)
