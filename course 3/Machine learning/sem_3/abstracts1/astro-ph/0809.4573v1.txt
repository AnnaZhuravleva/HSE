Some comments are made on the usefulness or otherwise of the concept of `expanding space' in cosmology. These notes are an expanded version of material first published in 2001 but not previously available online except at www.roe.ac.uk/japwww. Since that personal webpage has been referred to in published work, it seems sensible to give these notes a more permanent home.
