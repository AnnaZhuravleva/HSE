S.Co.P.E. is one of the four projects funded by the Italian Government in order to provide Southern Italy with a distributed computing infrastructure for fundamental science. Beside being aimed at building the infrastructure, S.Co.P.E. is also actively pursuing research in several areas among which astrophysics and observational cosmology. We shortly summarize the most significant results obtained in the first two years of the project and related to the development of middleware and Data Mining tools for the Virtual Observatory.
