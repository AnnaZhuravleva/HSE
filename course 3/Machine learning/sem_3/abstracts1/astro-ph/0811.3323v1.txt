The correlation between the pointing direction of ultra high energy cosmic rays and AGN observed by the Pierre Auger Collaboration is explained in the framework of acceleration process in AGN. This acceleration process is produced by a rotating accretion disk around a black hole that is frozen-in magnetic field. In a result the accretion disk is acting as a induction accelerator of cosmic rays. We estimate the resulting magnetic field in the framework of the magnetic coupling process. The results of our calculations allow to make the conclusion that the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars appear the effective cosmic accelerators. We estimate also the attenuation of highest-energy cosmic rays in a result of their interaction with ambient radiation field.
