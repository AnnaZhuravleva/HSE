We compare observed clustering of quasars and galaxies as a function of redshift, mass, luminosity, & color/morphology, to constrain models of quasar fueling and spheroid-BH co-evolution. High redshift quasars are shown to be drawn from progenitors of local early-type galaxies, with the characteristic quasar luminosity L* reflecting a characteristic mass of 'active' BH/host populations at each redshift. Evolving observed high-z quasar clustering to z=0 predicts a trend of clustering in 'quasar remnants' as a function of stellar mass identical to that observed for early-types. However, quasar clustering does not simply reflect observed early (or late)-type populations; at each redshift, quasars cluster as an 'intermediate' population. Comparing with the age of elliptical stellar populations reveals that this 'intermediate' population represents those ellipticals undergoing or terminating their final significant star formation at each epoch. Assuming that quasar triggering is associated with the formation/termination epoch of ellipticals predicts quasar clustering at all observed redshifts without any model dependence or assumptions about quasar light curves, lifetimes, or accretion rates. This is not true for disks or quasar halos: i.e. quasars do not generically trace star formation, disks, or halo assembly. Quasar clustering at all z is consistent with a constant halo mass ~4x10^{12} M_sun, similar to local 'group scales.' The observations support a scenario in which major mergers trigger quasar activity and dominate bright, high-z quasar populations. We show that measurements of quasar clustering versus luminosity at z~1 can be used to constrain different lower-luminosity AGN fueling mechanisms, and that high-z clustering is sensitive to whether or not systems 'shut down' growth at z>3.
