We use the spherical evolution approximation to investigate nonlinear evolution from the non-Gaussian initial conditions characteristic of the local f_nl model. We provide an analytic formula for the nonlinearly evolved probability distribution function of the dark matter which shows that the under-dense tail of the nonlinear PDF in the f_nl model should differ significantly from that for Gaussian initial conditions. Measurements of the under-dense tail in numerical simulations may be affected by discreteness effects, and we use a Poisson counting model to describe this effect. Once this has been accounted for, our model is in good quantitative agreement with the simulations.
