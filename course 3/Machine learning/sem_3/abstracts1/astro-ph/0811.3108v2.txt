We report two new XMM-Newton observations of PG1211+143 in December 2007, again finding evidence of the fast outflow of highly ionised gas first detected in 2001. Stacking the new spectra with those from two earlier XMM-Newton observations reveals strong and broad emission lines of FeXXV and OVIII, indicating the fast outflow to be persistent and to have a large covering factor. This finding confirms a high mass rate for the ionised ouflow in PG1211+143 and provides the first direct measurement of a wide angle, sub-relativistic outflow from an AGN transporting mechanical energy with the potential to disrupt the growth of the host galaxy. We suggest PG1211+143 may be typical of an AGN in a rapid super-Eddington growth phase.
