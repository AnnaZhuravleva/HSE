The observed luminosity deficit of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshift z can be explained by partial conversion to weak vector bosons of photons crossing large-scale electroweak domain boundaries, making Hubble acceleration only apparent and eliminating the need for a cosmological constant > 0.
