We investigate the possibility to use higher order moments of gravitational lensed images in the weak lensing analysis. For this purpose we employ spin-2 component of HOLICs(Higher Order Lensing Characteristics) developed by us. We test the weak lensing analysis with spin-2 HOLICs using actual, ground based Subaru observations of the massive galaxy cluster A1689(z=0.183). It turns out that spin-2 HOLICs of order up to 8 are sufficiently applicable for weak lensing analysis after correcting PSF anisotropy as well as isotropic PSF smearing.
