We present the final spectroscopic QSO catalogue from the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO (2SLAQ) Survey. This is a deep, 18<g<21.85 (extinction corrected), sample aimed at probing in detail the faint end of the broad line AGN luminosity distribution at z<2.6. The candidate QSOs were selected from SDSS photometry and observed spectroscopically with the 2dF spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This sample covers an area of 191.9 deg^2 and contains new spectra of 16326 objects, of which 8764 are QSOs, and 7623 are newly discovered (the remainder were previously identified by the 2QZ and SDSS surveys). The full QSO sample (including objects previously observed in the SDSS and 2QZ surveys) contains 12702 QSOs. The new 2SLAQ spectroscopic data set also contains 2343 Galactic stars, including 362 white dwarfs, and 2924 narrow emission line galaxies with a median redshift of z=0.22. We present detailed completeness estimates for the survey, based on modelling of QSO colours, including host galaxy contributions. This calculation shows that at g~21.85 QSO colours are significantly affected by the presence of a host galaxy up to redshift z~1 in the SDSS ugriz bands. In particular we see a significant reddening of the objects in g-i towards fainter g-band magnitudes. This reddening is consistent with the QSO host galaxies being dominated by a stellar population of age at least 2-3 Gyr.
