We explore the noncommutative effect on single field inflation and compare with WMAP five-year data. First, we calculate the noncommutative effect from the potential and dynamical terms, and construct the general form of modified power spectrum. Second, we consider the leading order modification of slow-roll, DBI and K-inflation and unite the modification, which means the modification is nearly model independent at this level. Finally, comparing with the WMAP5 data, we find that the modified can be well realized as the origin of the relative large spectral index and the quite small running.
