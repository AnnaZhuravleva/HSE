We present spectra of accretion discs around white-dwarfs calculated with an improved and updated version of the Shaviv & Wehrse (1991) model. The new version includes line opacities and convective energy transport and can be used to calculate spectra of hot discs in bright systems (nova--like variables or dwarf novae in outburst) as well as spectra of cold accretion discs in quiescent dwarf novae.
