Motivated by the holographic principle, it has been suggested that the dark energy density may be inversely proportional to the area of the event horizon of the Universe. However, such a model would have a causality problem. In this paper, we propose to replace the future event horizon area with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature. We show that this model does not only avoid the causality problem and is phenomenologically viable, but also naturally solves the coincidence problem of dark energy. Our analysis of the evolution of density perturbations show that the matter power spectra and CMB temperature anisotropy is only slightly affected by such modification.
