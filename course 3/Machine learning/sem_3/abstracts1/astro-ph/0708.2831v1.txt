CONTEXT: The masses previously obtained for the X-ray binary 2S0921-630 inferred a compact object that was either a high-mass neutron star or low-mass black-hole, but used a previously published value for the rotational broadening (vsini) with large uncertainties. AIMS: We aim to determine an accurate mass for the compact object through an improved measurement of the secondary star's projected equatorial rotational velocity. METHODS: We have used UVES echelle spectroscopy to determine the vsini of the secondary star (V395 Car) in the low-mass X-ray binary 2S0921-630 by comparison to an artificially broadened spectral-type template star. In addition, we have also measured vsini from a single high signal-to-noise ratio absorption line profile calculated using the method of Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD). RESULTS: We determine vsini to lie between 31.3+/-0.5km/s to 34.7+/-0.5km/s (assuming zero and continuum limb darkening, respectively) in disagreement with revious results based on intermediate resolution spectroscopy obtained with the 3.6m NTT. Using our revised vsini value in combination with the secondary star's radial velocity gives a binary mass ratio of 0.281+/-0.034. Furthermore, assuming a binary inclination angle of 75 degrees gives a compact object mass of 1.37+/-0.13Mo. CONCLUSIONS: We find that using relatively low-resolution spectroscopy can result in systemic uncertainties in the measured vsini values obtained using standard methods. We suggest the use of LSD as a secondary, reliable check of the results as LSD allows one to directly discern the shape of the absorption line profile. In the light of the new vsini measurement, we have revised down the compact object's mass, such that it is now compatible with a canonical neutron star mass.
