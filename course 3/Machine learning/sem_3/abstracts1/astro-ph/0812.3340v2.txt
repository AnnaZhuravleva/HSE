The two brightest and so far the best studied gamma ray bursts (GRBs), 990123 and 080319B, were ordinary, highly collimated GRBs produced in a core collapse supernova explosion within a high-density wind environment and observed from a very near-axis viewing angle. Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) and synchrotron radiation (SR), the two dominant radiation mechanisms in the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs, together with the burst environment, provide a very simple and sufficiently accurate description of the multiwavelength lightcurves of their prompt and afterglow emissions.
