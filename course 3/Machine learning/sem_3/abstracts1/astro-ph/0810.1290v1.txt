We review our current knowledge of the population of high-redshift sub-mm/mm galaxies, with particular emphasis on recent results from the SCUBA HAlf Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES). All available evidence indicates that these objects form the high-redshift, high-luminosity, high-mass tail of the dusty starforming galaxy population revealed at lower redshifts and luminosities by Spitzer. Current theoretical models of galaxy formation struggle to reproduce these extreme objects in the numbers indicated by current surveys.
