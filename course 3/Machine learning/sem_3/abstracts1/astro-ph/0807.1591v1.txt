We have analyzed sensitive high spatial resolution archival radio continuum data at 1.3, 2.0, 3.6 and 6.0 cm as well as the H2O maser molecular line data obtained using the Very Large Array (VLA) in its hybrid AB configuration toward the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 17233-3606 (G351.78-0.54). We find nine compact radio sources associated with this region, six of them are new radio detections. We discuss the characteristics of these sources based mostly on their spectral indices and find that most of them appear to be optically thin or thick ultra- and hyper-compact HII regions ionized by B ZAMS stars. Furthermore, in a few cases the radio emission may arise from optically thick dusty disks and/or cores, however more observations at different wavelengths are necessity to firmly confirm their true nature. In addition, we compared our centimeter maps with the mid-infrared images fromthe Spitzer Space Observatory GLIMPSE survey revealing a cluster of young protostars in the region together with multiple collimated outflows some of whom might be related with the compact centimeter objects.
