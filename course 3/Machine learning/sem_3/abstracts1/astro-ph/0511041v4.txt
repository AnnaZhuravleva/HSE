After simplifying and improving the non-Gaussian formalism we developed in previous work, we derive a quantitative expression for the three-point correlator (bispectrum) of the curvature perturbation in general multiple-field inflation models. Our result describes the evolution of non-Gaussianity on superhorizon scales caused by the nonlinear influence of isocurvature perturbations on the adiabatic perturbation during inflation. We then study a simple quadratic two-field potential and find that when slow roll breaks down and the field trajectory changes direction in field space, the non-Gaussianity can become large. However, for the simple models studied to date, the magnitude of this non-Gaussianity decays away after the isocurvature mode is converted into the adiabatic mode.
