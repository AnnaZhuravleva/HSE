We consider a universe with a compact extra dimension and a cosmological constant emerging from a suitable ultraviolet cutoff on the zero point energy of the vacuum. We derive the Casimir force between parallel conducting plates as a function of the following scales: plate separation, radius of the extra dimension and cutoff energy scale. We find that there are critical values of these scales where the Casimir force between the plates changes sign. For the cutoff energy scale required to reproduce the observed value of the cosmological constant, we find that the Casimir force changes sign and becomes repulsive for plate separations less than a critical separation $d_0=0.6mm$, assuming a zero radius of the extra dimension (no extra dimension). This prediction contradicts Casimir experiments which indicate an attractive force down to plate separations of $100nm$. For a non-zero extra dimension radius, the critical separation $d_0$ gets even larger than $0.6mm$ and remains inconsistent with Casimir force experiments. We conclude that with or without the presence of a compact extra dimension, vacuum energy with any suitable cutoff can not play the role of the cosmological constant.
