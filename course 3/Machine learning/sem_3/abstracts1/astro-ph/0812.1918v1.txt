Gaseous H2O has been detected in several cold astrophysical environments, where the observed abundances cannot be explained by thermal desorption of H2O ice or by H2O gas phase formation. These observations hence suggest an efficient non-thermal ice desorption mechanism. Here, we present experimentally determined UV photodesorption yields of H2O and D2O ice and deduce their photodesorption mechanism. The ice photodesorption is studied under ultra high vacuum conditions and at astrochemically relevant temperatures (18-100 K) using a hydrogen discharge lamp (7-10.5 eV), which simulates the interstellar UV field. The ice desorption during irradiation is monitored using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy of the ice and simultaneous mass spectrometry of the desorbed species. The photodesorption yield per incident photon is identical for H2O and D2O and depends on both ice thickness and temperature. For ices thicker than 8 monolayers the photodesorption yield Y is linearly dependent on temperature due to increased diffusion of ice species such that Y(T) = 1E-3(1.3+0.032*T) UV photon-1, with a 60% uncertainty for the absolute yield. The increased diffusion also results in an increasing H2O:OH desorption product ratio with temperature. The yield does not depend on the substrate, the UV photon flux or the UV fluence. The yield is also independent on the initial ice structure since UV photons efficiently amorphize H2O ice. The results are consistent with theoretical predictions of H2O photodesorption and partly in agreement with a previous experimental study. Applying the experimentally determined yield to a Herbig Ae/Be star+disk model shows that UV photodesorption of ices increases the H2O content by orders of magnitude in the disk surface region compared to models where non-thermal desorption is ignored.
