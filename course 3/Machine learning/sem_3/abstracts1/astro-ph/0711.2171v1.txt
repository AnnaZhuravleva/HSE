I present here our project, the Bologna Open Clusters Chemical Evolution (BOCCE) project, aimed at using Open Clusters as tracers of the disk properties and their evolution with time. We are collecting and homogeneously analyzing data, both photometric and spectroscopic, on a large sample of open clusters, representative of the old cluster population, and I show here results obtained on a subset of our clusters.
