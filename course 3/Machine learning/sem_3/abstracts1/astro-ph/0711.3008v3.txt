We consider positron propagation in the interstellar medium and show that the positrons from the beta-plus decay chains of the radioactive nuclei Ni-56, Ti-44, and Al-26, produced in Galactic supernovae, can fully account for all the features of the diffuse Galactic 511 keV annihilation radiation observed by INTEGRAL/SPI. We also predict additional measurable features that can further test the origin of positrons and provide new information on the nature of the interstellar medium.
