Various observatories around the globe started regular full-disk imaging of the solar atmosphere in the Ca II K line since the early decades of the 20th century. The archives made by these observations have the potential of providing far more detailed information on solar magnetism than just the sunspot number and area records to which most studies of solar activity and irradiance changes are restricted. We evaluate the image contents of three Ca II K spectroheliogram time-series, specifically those obtained by the digitization of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, and Mt Wilson photographic archives. We describe the main problems afflicting these data and analyze their quality by expressing the image contents through several quantities. We compare the results obtained with those for similar present-day observations taken with the Meudon spectroheliograph and with the Rome-PSPT. We show that historic data suffer from stronger geometrical distortions and photometric uncertainties than similar present-day observations. The latter uncertainties mostly originate from the photographic calibration of the original data and from stray-light effects. We also show that the image contents of the three analyzed series vary in time. These variations are probably due to instrument changes and aging of the spectrographs used, as well as changes of the observing programs. Our results imply that the main challenge for the analysis of historic data is their accurate photometric calibration. This problem must be solved before they can provide reliable information about solar magnetism and activity over the last century. Moreover, inter-calibration of results obtained from independent time-series is required to reliably trace changes of solar properties with time from the analysis of such data.
