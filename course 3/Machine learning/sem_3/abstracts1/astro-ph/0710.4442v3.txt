We construct for the first time, the sequences of stable neutron star (NS) models capable of explaining simultaneously, the glitch healing parameters, $Q$, of both the pulsars, the Crab ($Q \geq 0.7$) and the Vela ($Q \leq 0.2$), on the basis of starquake mechanism of glitch generation, whereas the conventional NS models cannot give such consistent explanation. Furthermore, our models also yield an upper bound on NS masses similar to those obtained in the literature for a variety of modern equations of state (EOSs) compatible with causality and dynamical stability. The results obtained in this paper set an upper and lower bound on the energy of a gravitationally redshifted electron-positron annihilation line in the range of about 0.309 - 0.315 MeV from the Crab and in the range of about 0.425 - 0.439 MeV from the Vela pulsar.
