CONTEXT: Gravitationally lensed quasars constitute an independent tool to derive H0 through time-delays; they offer as well the opportunity to study the mass distribution and interstellar medium of their lensing galaxies and, through microlensing they also allow one to study details of the emitting source. AIMS: For such studies, one needs to have an excellent knowledge of the close environment of the lensed images in order to model the lensing potential: this means observational data over a large field-of-view and spectroscopy at high spatial resolution. METHODS: We present VIMOS integral field observations around four lensed quasars: HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4+0551, H 1413+117 and B 1359+154. Using the low, medium and high resolution modes, we study the quasar images and the quasar environments, as well as provide a detailed report of the data reduction. RESULTS: Comparison between the quasar spectra of the different images reveals differences for HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4+0551 and H 1413+117: flux ratios between the images of the same quasar are different when measured in the emission lines and in the continuum. We have also measured the redshifts of galaxies in the neighborhood of HE 0230-2130 and RX J0911.4+0551 which possibly contribute to the total lensing potential. CONCLUSIONS: A careful analysis reveals that microlensing is the most natural explanation for the (de)magnification of the continuum emitting region of the background sources. In HE 0230-2130, image D is likely to be affected by microlensing magnification; in RX J0911.4+0551, images A1 and A3 are likely to be modified by microlensing de-magnification and in H 1413+117, at least image D is affected by microlensing.
