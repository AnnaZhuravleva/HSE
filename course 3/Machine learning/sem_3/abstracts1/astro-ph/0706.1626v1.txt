We carried out deep and wide (about 8' x 8') JHKs imaging polarimetry in the southern region of the Eagle Nebula (M16). The polarization intensity map reveals that two YSOs with near-IR reflection nebulae are located at the tips of two famous molecular pillars (Pillars 1 and 2) facing toward the exciting stars of M16. The centrosymmetric polarization pattern are consistent with those around class I objects having circumstellar envelopes, confirming that star formation is now taking place at the two tips of the pillars under the influence of UV radiation from the exciting stars. Polarization measurements of point sources show that magnetic fields are aligned along some of the pillars but in a direction that is quite different to the global structure in M16.
