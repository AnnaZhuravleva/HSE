Hydrous silicates occur in various cosmic environments, and are among the minerals with the most pronounced bands in the far infrared (FIR) spectral region. Given that Herschel and ALMA will open up new possibilities for astronomical FIR and sub-mm spectroscopy, data characterizing the dielectric properties of these materials at long wavelengths are desirable. We aimed at examining the FIR spectra of talc, picrolite, montmorillonite, and chamosite, which belong to four different groups of phyllosilicates. We tabulated positions and band widths of the FIR bands of these minerals depending on the dust temperature. By means of powder transmission spectroscopy, spectra of the examined materials were measured in the wavelength range 25-500 mum at temperatures of 300, 200, 100, and 10 K. Room-temperature measurements yield the following results. For talc, a previously unknown band, centered at 98.5 mum, was found, in addition to bands at 56.5 and 59.5 mum. For montmorillonite, several bands at wavelengths <110 mum were detected, including a band at 105 mum with an FWHM of about 10 mum. Picrolite shows a sharp 77 mum FIR band. Chamosite is characterized by bands in the 72-92 mum range, and a prominent band at 277 mum. At decreasing temperature, most of the bands shift to shorter wavelengths. Examining a potential counterpart of the 105mum band in the spectra of HD 142527 and HD 100546, we find that the broad band in the spectra of these young stars - extending from 85 to 125 mum - cannot be due to montmorillonite or any of the hydrous silicates we studied, since these materials have sharper bands in the FIR wavelength range than previously assumed, especially at low temperatures.
