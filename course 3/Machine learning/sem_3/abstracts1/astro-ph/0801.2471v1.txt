We discuss results of 2D simulations of magnetorotational(MR) mechanism of core collapse supernova explosions. Due to the nonuniform collapse the collapsed core rotates differentially. In the presence of initial poloidal magnetic field its toroidal component appears and grows with time. Increased magnetic pressure leads to foramtion of compression wave which moves outwards. It transforms into the fast MHD shock wave (supernova shock wave). The shape of the MR supernova explosion qualitatively depends on the configuration of the initial magnetic field. For the dipole-like initial magnetic field the supernova explosion develops mainly along rotational axis forming mildly collimated jet. Quadrupole-like initial magnetic field leads to the explosion developing mainly along equatorial plane. Magnetorotational instability was found in our simulations. The supernova explosion energy is growing with increase of the initial core mass and rotational energy of the core, and corresponds to the observational data.
