Within the "fireshell" model we define a "canonical GRB" light curve with two sharply different components: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted when the optically thick fireshell of electron-positron plasma originating the phenomenon reaches transparency, and the afterglow, emitted due to the collision between the remaining optically thin fireshell and the CircumBurst Medium (CBM). We here present the consequences of such a scenario on the theoretical interpretation of the nature of "long" and "short" GRBs.
