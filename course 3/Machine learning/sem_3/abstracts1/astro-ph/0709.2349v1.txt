Simultaneous multiwavelength observations were conducted for the BL Lac object 1ES1959+650 in a steady state in May 2006 with the MAGIC telescope and the X-ray satellites Suzaku and Swift. Swift can also provide multi-filter photometry in the UV-optical band. The source was clearly detected in all observed energy bands, from the optical to TeV. With respect to previous observations the source was in a low state in the very high energy (VHE) band (~10% Crab flux above 300 GeV) but in a relatively high state in the X-ray band. The light curves showed rather stable activities, with no significant variability in the VHE gamma-ray emission and small variability (~10% amplitude) in the X-ray band. The observed spectral energy distribution in the steady state can be described by a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model.
