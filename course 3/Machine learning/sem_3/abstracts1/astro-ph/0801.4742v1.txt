The future of ground based gamma ray astronomy lies in large arrays of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) with better capabilities: lower energy threshold, higher sensitivity, better resolution and background rejection. Currently, designs for the next generation of IACT arrays are being explored by various groups. We have studied possible configurations with a large number of telescopes of various sizes. Here, we present the precision of source, shower core and energy reconstruction for gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range for different altitudes of observation. These results were obtained through tools that we have developed in order to simulate any type of IACT configuration and evaluate its performance.
