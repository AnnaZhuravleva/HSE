We have analyzed the evolution of mass of a stationary black hole in the standard FRW cosmological model. The evolution is determined specifically about the time of transition from the earlier matter to the later exotic dark energy dominated universe. It turns out that the accretion rate of matter on the black hole of mass $M$ was approximately $10^{54}M^{-1}$ higher than the accretion rate of exotic dark energy at the time of transition.
