This article presents recent work to constrain the physical and chemical properties in high-mass star formation based largely on interferometric high-spatial-resolution continuum and spectral line studies at (sub)mm wavelengths. After outlining the concepts, potential observational tests, a proposed evolutionary sequence and different possible definitions for massive protostars, four particular topics are highlighted: (a) What are the physical conditions at the onset of massive star formation? (b) What are the characteristics of potential massive accretion disks and what do they tell us about massive star formation in general? (c) How do massive clumps fragment, and what does it imply to high-mass star formation? (d) What do we learn from imaging spectral line surveys with respect to the chemistry itself as well as for utilizing molecules as tools for astrophysical investigations?
