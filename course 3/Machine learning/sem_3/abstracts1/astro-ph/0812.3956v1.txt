We present a sensitive search for the ^3P_1->^3P_0 ground state fine structure line at 205 microns of ionized nitrogen ([NII]) in one of the highest redshift quasars (J1148+5251 at z=6.42) using the IRAM 30m telescope. The line is not detected at a (3 sigma) depth of 0.47 Jy km s^-1, corresponding to a [NII] luminosity limit of L_[NII] < 4.0x10^8 L_sun and a L_[NII]/L$_FIR ratio of <2x10^-5. In parallel, we have observed the CO(J=6-5) line in J1148+5251, which is detected at a flux level consistent with earlier interferometric observations. Using our earlier measurements of the [CII] 158 micron line strength, we derive an upper limit for the [NII]/[CII] line luminosity ratio of ~1/10 in J1148+5251. Our upper limit for the [CII]/[NII] ratio is similar to the value found for our Galaxy and M82 (the only extragalactic system where the [NII] line has been detected to date). Given the non-detection of the [NII] line we can only speculate whether or not high-z detections are within reach of currently operating observatories. However, [NII] and other fine strucure lines will play a critical role in characterizing the interstellar medium at the highest redshifts (z>7) using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), for which the highly excited rotational transitions of CO will be shifted outside the accessible (sub-)millimeter bands.
