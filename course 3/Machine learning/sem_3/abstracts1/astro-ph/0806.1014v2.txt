As part of an ongoing series of deep GMRT surveys we have observed the Spitzer extragalactic First Look Survey field, producing the deepest wide-field 610-MHz survey published to date. We reach an rms noise of 30 microJy/beam before primary beam correction, with a resolution of ~6 arcsec over an area of ~4 square degrees. By combining these observations with the existing 1.4-GHz VLA survey produced by Condon et al. (2003), along with infrared data in up to seven wavebands from the Spitzer Space Telescope, optical photometry from SDSS and a range of spectroscopic redshift surveys, we are able to study the relationship between radio luminosity and star formation rate in star-forming galaxies up to z ~ 1. The large amount of multi-wavelength data available allows accurate k-corrections to be performed in the radio due to the knowledge of the radio spectral index, and in the infrared through the use of a semi-empirical radiative transfer model which models star-forming regions, warm dust surrounding these regions, and diffuse interstellar dust, taking into account the star formation rate, star formation history and hydrogen column density within each galaxy. A strong correlation is seen between radio luminosity and infrared-derived star formation rates, which is best fit by a slightly non-linear power-law. We look for cosmic evolution in the comparative radio brightness of star-forming galaxies by searching for deviations away from the global relationship. Any such deviation would indicate a systematic variation in one or more of the properties controlling synchrotron radiation, in particular an increase in the magnetic field strengths of star-forming galaxies. The data shows no evidence for such an effect, suggesting that there has been little evolution in the magnetic fields of galaxies since z ~ 1.
