In this paper the current status of high-energy research on the hard X-ray characteristics of the persistent emission from magnetars is reviewed. Focus is put on recent intriguing results for 1RXS J1708-40, from phase resolved spectral analysis over a 2 decades wide energy band (~3-300 keV) combining contemporaneous RXTE, XMM and INTEGRAL data. For 1E 1841-045 and SGR 1806-10 we also present updated results. The perspective for future MAXI observations for this source class is also addressed.
