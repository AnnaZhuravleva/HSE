The combination of a long duration and the absence of any accompanying supernova clearly shows that GRB 060614 can not be grouped into the two conventional classes of gamma-ray bursts, i.e. the long/soft bursts deemed to be collapsars and the short/hard bursts deemed to be merging binary compact stars. A new progenitor model is required for this anomalous gamma-ray burst. We propose that GRB 060614 might be produced through the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate mass black hole. In this scenario, the long duration and the lack of any associated supernova are naturally expected. The theoretical energy output is also consistent with observations. The observed 9-s periodicity in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of GRB 060614 can also be satisfactorily explained.
