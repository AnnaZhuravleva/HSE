Local (shearing box) simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the magnetorotational instability in a collisionless plasma show that angular momentum transport by pressure anisotropy ($p_\perp \ne p_\parallel$, where the directions are defined with respect to the local magnetic field) is comparable to that due to the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses. Pressure anisotropy, which is effectively a large-scale viscosity, arises because of adiabatic invariants related to $p_\perp$ and $p_\parallel$ in a fluctuating magnetic field. In a collisionless plasma, the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy, and thus the viscosity, is determined by kinetic instabilities at the cyclotron frequency. Our simulations show that $\sim 50$ % of the gravitational potential energy is directly converted into heat at large scales by the viscous stress (the remaining energy is lost to grid-scale numerical dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy). We show that electrons receive a significant fraction ($\sim [T_e/T_i]^{1/2}$) of this dissipated energy. Employing this heating by an anisotropic viscous stress in one dimensional models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows, we find that the radiative efficiency of the flow is greater than 0.5% for $\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{Edd}$. Thus a low accretion rate, rather than just a low radiative efficiency, is necessary to explain the low luminosity of many accreting black holes. For Sgr A* in the Galactic Center, our predicted radiative efficiencies imply an accretion rate of $\approx 3 \times 10^{-8} M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an electron temperature of $\approx 3 \times 10^{10}$ K at $\approx 10$ Schwarzschild radii; the latter is consistent with the brightness temperature inferred from VLBI observations.
