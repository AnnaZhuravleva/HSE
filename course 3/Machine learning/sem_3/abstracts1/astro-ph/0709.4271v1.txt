A set of bi-orthogonal potential-density basis functions is introduced to model the density and its associated gravitational field of three dimensional stellar systems. Radial components of our basis functions are weighted integral forms of spherical Bessel functions. We discuss the properties of our basis functions and demonstrate their shapes for the latitudinal Fourier number $l=2$.
