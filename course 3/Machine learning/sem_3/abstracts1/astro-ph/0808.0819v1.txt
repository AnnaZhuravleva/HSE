In this letter, we propose a model of inflationary cosmology with a bounce preceded and study its primordial curvature perturbations. Our model gives rise to a primordial power spectrum with a feature of oscillation on large scales compared with the nearly scale-invariant spectrum generated by the traditional slow rolling inflation model. We will show this effect changes the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature power spectrum and the Large Scale Structure (LSS) matter power spectrum. And further with a detailed simulation we will point out this signal is detectable to the forthcoming observations, such as PLANCK and LAMOST.
