The new results of a study of the kinematics of the supernova remnant S8 in the IC1613 galaxy are reported. The expansion velocity of the bright optical nebula is determined based on observations made with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using MPSF field spectrograph and SCORPIO focal reducer operating in the scanning Fabry--Perot interferometer mode. An analysis of 21-cm line VLA observations of the galaxy corroborates our earlier proposed model of a SN exploding inside a cavern surrounded by a dense shell and S8 colliding with the wall of the HI shell.
