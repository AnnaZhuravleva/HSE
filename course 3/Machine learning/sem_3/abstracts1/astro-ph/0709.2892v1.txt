IC 10 X-1 is a bright (Lx=10^38 ergs/s) variable X-ray source in the local group starburst galaxy IC 10. The most plausible optical counterpart is a luminous Wolf-Rayet star, making IC 10 X-1 a rare example of a Wolf-Rayet X-ray binary. In this paper, we report on the detection of an X-ray orbital period for IC 10 X-1of 34.4 hours. This result, combined with a re-examination of optical spectra, allow us to determine a mass function for the system f(m)=7.8 Msun and a probable mass for the compact object of 24-36 Msun. If this analysis is correct, the compact object is the most massive known stellar black black hole. We further show that the observed period is inconsistent with Roche lobe overflow, suggesting that the binary is detached and the black hole is accreting the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star. The observed mass loss rate of [MAC92] 17-A is sufficient to power the X-ray luminosity of IC 10 X-1.
