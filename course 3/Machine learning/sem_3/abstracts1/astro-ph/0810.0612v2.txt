Aims: As g-mode pulsators, gamma-Doradus-class stars may naively be expected to show a large number of modes. Taking advantage of the long photometric time-series generated by the Solar Mass Ejection Imager (SMEI) instrument, we have studied the star gamma Doradus to determine whether any other modes than the three already known are present at observable amplitude. Methods: High-precision photometric data from SMEI taken between April 2003 and March 2006 were subjected to periodogram analysis with the PERIOD04 package. Results: We confidently determine three additional frequencies at 1.39, 1.87, and 2.743 cycles per day. These are above and beyond the known frequencies of 1.320, 1.364, and 1.47 cycles per day. Conclusions: Two of the new frequencies, at 1.39 and 1.87 cycles per day, are speculated to be additional modes of oscillation, with the third frequency at 2.743 cycles per day a possible combination frequency.
