We have obtained deep J and Ks images of a sample of nine barred galaxies in order to collect a reliable and homogeneous set of images to which N-body simulations of barred galaxies will be compared. The observations were performed using the new near-infrared camera available at the 2.1-m telescope of the Observatorio Astrofisico Guillermo Haro (OAGH) in Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. We present the results of surface photometry techniques applied to the observed images, as well as to the deprojected images. These results include radial profiles of surface brightness (elliptically averaged), colour, position angle, ellipticity and the b4 Fourier component. In addition, we present isophotal maps, colour maps, surface brightness profiles along the bar major and minor axes, characteristic radial scale-lengths and bar length estimates. We discuss how projection effects can influence these measurements and the uncertainties introduced by deprojecting galaxy images. We show that analytical expressions can be used to obtain reliable estimates of deprojected bar lengths, ellipticities and position angles directly from the observed images. These expressions are based on the assumption that the outer parts of the bar are vertically thin, as shown by theoretical work. The usefulness of our data in addressing issues on bar formation and evolution is also discussed. In particular, we present results showing a steep drop in the ellipticity profile, as expected for bar formation processes in which the dark matter halo plays a fundamental role. Furthermore, we show that the location of this drop is a good indicator of the end of the bar in strongly barred galaxies, as predicted by numerical models.
