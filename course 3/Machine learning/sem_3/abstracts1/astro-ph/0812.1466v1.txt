We revisit the possible turbulent sources of the solar dynamo. Studying axisymmetric mean-field dynamo models, we find that the large-scale poloidal magnetic field could be generated not only by the famous alpha effect, but also by the Omega x J and shear-current effects. The inclusion of these additional turbulent sources alleviates several of the known problems of solar mean-field dynamo models.
