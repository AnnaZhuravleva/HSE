Using UBVRI Halpha CCD photometric observations and the archival NIR and X-ray data, we have carried out a multi-wavelength study of a young star cluster NGC 7419. An age of 22.5+/-3.0 Myr and a distance of 3230^{+330}_{-430} pc are derived for the cluster with a higher value of color excess ratio E(U-B)/E(B-V) than the normal one. There is an evidence for mass segregation in this dynamically relaxed cluster with mass function slope is in agreement with the Salpeter value. NIR and Halpha excess support the existence of a young (< 2 Myr) stellar population of Herbig Ae/Be stars (> 3.0 M_sun) indicating a second episode of star formation in the cluster region. Using XMM-Newton observations, we found several X-ray sources in the cluster region but none of the Herbig Ae/Be stars is detected in X-rays. We compare the distribution of upper limits for Herbig Ae/Be stars with the X-ray distribution functions of the T-Tauri and the Herbig Ae/Be stars from previous studies, and found that the X-ray emission level of these Herbig Ae/Be stars is not more than L_X ~5.2 x 10^{30} erg/s, which is not significantly higher than for the T-Tauri stars. Therefore, X-ray emission from Herbig Ae/Be stars could be the result of either unresolved companion stars or a process similar to T-Tauri stars. We report an extended X-ray emission from the cluster region NGC 7419, with a total L_X estimate of ~ 1.8 x 10^31 erg/s/arcmin^2. Investigation of dust and CO map of 1 degree region around the cluster indicates the presence of a foreground dust cloud which is most likely associated with star forming region Sh2-154. This cloud harbors uniformly distributed pre main sequence stars (0.1-2.0M_sun) and the star formation in this cloud depend mostly upon the primordial fragmentation.
