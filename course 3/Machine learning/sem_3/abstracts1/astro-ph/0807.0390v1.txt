Photospheric granulation may excite transverse kink pulses in anchored vertical magnetic flux tubes. The pulses propagate upwards along the tubes with the kink speed, while oscillating wakes are formed behind the wave front in a stratified atmosphere. The wakes oscillate at the kink cut-off frequency of stratified medium and gradually decay in time. When two or more consecutive kink pulses with different polarizations propagate in the same thin tube, then the wakes corresponding to different pulses may superimpose. The superposition sets up helical motions of magnetic flux tubes in the photosphere/chromosphere as seen by recent Hinode movies. The energy carried by the pulses is enough to heat the solar chrmosphere/corona and accelerate the solar wind.
