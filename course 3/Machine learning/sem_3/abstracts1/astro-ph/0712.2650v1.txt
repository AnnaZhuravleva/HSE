We study the layer of electrons on bare strange star surfaces, taking the Dirac exchange-energy into account. Because electrons are fermions, the electron wave function must be of exchange-antisymmetry. The Dirac exchange-energy originates, consequently, from the exchange-antisymmetry of electron wave functions. This consideration may result in changing the electron distribution and the electric field on the surface of bare strange star. The strong magnetic field effect on the structures of the electrospheres is also discussed.
