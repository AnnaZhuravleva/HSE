We use more than two years of data from the Pierre Auger Observatory to search for anisotropies on large scales in different energy windows. We account for various systematics in the acceptance, in particular due to the array growth and weather variations. We present the results of analyses and consistency checks looking for patterns in the right ascension modulation of the cosmic ray distribution. No significant anisotropies of this kind are observed.
