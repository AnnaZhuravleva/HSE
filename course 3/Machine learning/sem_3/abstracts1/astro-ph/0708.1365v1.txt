We have mapped the protostellar jet HH 211 in 342 GHz continuum, SiO ($J=8-7$), and CO ($J=3-2$) emission at $\sim$ \arcs{1} resolution with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). Thermal dust emission is seen in continuum at the center of the jet, tracing an envelope and a possible optically thick compact disk (with a size $<$ 130 AU) around the protostar. A knotty jet is seen in CO and SiO as in \H2{}, but extending closer to the protostar. It consists of a chain of knots on each side of the protostar, with an interknot spacing of $\sim$ \arcs{2}$-$\arcs{3} or 600$-$900 AU and the innermost pair of knots at only $\sim$ \arcsa{1}{7} or 535 AU from the protostar. These knots likely trace unresolved internal (bow) shocks (i.e., working surfaces) in the jet, with a velocity range up to $\sim$ 25 \vkm{}. The two-sided mass-loss rate of the jet is estimated to be $\sim (0.7-2.8)\times 10^{-6}$ \solarmass{} yr$^{-1}$. The jet is episodic, precessing, and bending. A velocity gradient is seen consistently across two bright SiO knots (BK3 and RK2) perpendicular to the jet axis, with $\sim$ 1.5$\pm$0.8 \vkm{} at $\sim$ 30$\pm$15 AU, suggesting a presence of a jet rotation. The launching radius of the jet, derived from the potential jet rotation, is $\sim$ 0.15$-$0.06 AU in the inner disk.
