The aim of this contribution is to determine the lower limit of the electron number density,the Debye temperature and the specific heat of solid grains present in the protoplanetary grains around beta Pictoris. The calculation has been performed using the Salpeter criterion,slightly modified a couple of years ago. The results obtained are physically reasonable and could be helpful in determining the chemical composition of solid particles in this system.
