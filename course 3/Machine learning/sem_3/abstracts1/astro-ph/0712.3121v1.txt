We study the stellar and star formation (SF) properties of the host galaxies of 58 X-ray selected AGN in the GOODS portion of the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) region at z~0.5-1.4. The AGN are selected such that their rest-frame UV to near-IR SEDs are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent 1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the AGN emission 'contamination'. This AGN population comprises approximately 50% of the X-ray selected AGN at these redshifts. Using models of stellar and dust emission we model their SEDs to derive stellar masses (M*) and total (UV+IR) star formation rates (SFR). AGN reside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. Their characteristic stellar masses (M*~7.8x10^10 Msun and M*~1.2x10^11 Msun at median z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of the X-ray selected AGN population at these redshifts, and are intermediate between those of local type 2 AGN and high redshift (z~2) AGN. The inferred black hole masses (MBH~ 2x10^8 Msun) of typical AGN are similar to those of optically identified quasars at similar redshifts. Since the AGN in our sample are much less luminous (L(2-10keV)<10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical AGN have low Eddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). This suggests that, at least at intermediate z, the cosmic AGN 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristic stellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. Finally there is no strong evidence in AGN host galaxies for either highly suppressed SF (expected if AGN played a role in quenching SF) or elevated SF when compared to mass selected (i.e., IRAC-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts. This may be explained by the fact that galaxies with M*~5x 10^10 - 5x10^11 Msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.
