Chromospherically Active Binaries (CAB) catalogue have been revised and updated. With 203 new identifications, the number of CAB stars is increased to 409. Catalogue is available in electronic format where each system has various number of lines (sub-orders) with a unique order number. Columns contain data of limited number of selected cross references, comments to explain peculiarities and position of the binarity in case it belongs to a multiple system, classical identifications (RS CVn, BY Dra), brightness and colours, photometric and spectroscopic data, description of emission features (Ca II H&K, $H_{\alpha}$, UV, IR), X-Ray luminosity, radio flux, physical quantities and orbital information, where each basic entry are referenced so users can go original sources.
