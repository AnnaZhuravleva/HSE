It has been well established that the $f$-mode of relativistic ordinary-fluid neutron stars displays a universal scaling behavior. Here we study whether the "ordinary" $f_{\rm o}$- and "superfluid" $f_{\rm s}$-modes of superfluid neutron stars also show similar universal behavior. We first consider a simple case where the neutron superfluid and normal fluid are decoupled, and with each fluid modeled by a polytropic equation of state. We find that the $f_{\rm o}$-mode obeys the same scaling laws as established for the $f$-mode of orindary-fluid stars. However, the oscillation frequency of the $f_{\rm s}$-mode obeys a different scaling law, which can be derived analytically from a homogenous two-fluid stellar model in Newtonian gravity. Next the coupling effect between the two fluids is studied via a parameterized model of entrainment. We find that the coupling in general breaks the universal behavior seen in the case of decoupled fluids. Based on a relativistic variational principle, an approximated expression is derived for the first-order shift of the $f_{\rm s}$-mode squared frequency due to the entrainment.
