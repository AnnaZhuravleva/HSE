The working principle of axion helioscopes can be behind unexpected solar X-ray emission, being associated with solar magnetic fields, which become the catalyst. Solar axion signals can be transient brightenings as well as continuous radiation. The energy range below 1 keV is a window of opportunity for direct axion searches. (In)direct signatures support axions or the like as an explanation of striking behaviour of X-rays from the Sun.
