It was suggested by several authors that hypothetical primordial black holes (PBHs) may contribute to the dark matter in our Galaxy. There are strong constraints based on the Hawking evaporation that practically exclude PBHs with masses m~1e15-1e16g and smaller as significant contributors to the Galactic dark matter. Similarly, PBHs with masses greater than about 1e26g are practically excluded by the gravitational lensing observation. The mass range between 10e16g<m<10e26g is unconstrained. In this paper, we examine possible observational signatures in the unexplored mass range, investigating hypothetical collisions of PBHs with main sequence stars, red giants, white dwarfs, and neutron stars in our Galaxy. This has previously been discussed as possibly leading to an observable photon eruption due to shock production during the encounter. We find that such collisions are either too rare to be observed (if the PBH masses are typically larger than about 1e20g), or produce too little power to be detected (if the masses are smaller than about 1e20g).
