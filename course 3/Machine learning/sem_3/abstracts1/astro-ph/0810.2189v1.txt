Context. We report the detection by the AGILE satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the gamma-ray source 3EG J1255-0549, associated to the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279, during the AGILE pointings towards the Virgo Region on 2007 July 9-13.   Aims. The simultaneous optical, X-ray and gamma-ray covering allows us to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the theoretical models relative to the flaring episode of mid-July.   Methods. AGILE observed the source during its Science Performance Verification Phase with its two co-aligned imagers: the Gamma- Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) sensitive in the 30 MeV - 50 GeV and 18 - 60 keV respectively. During the AGILE observation the source was monitored simultaneously in optical band by the REM telescope and in the X-ray band by the Swift satellite through 4 ToO observations.   Results. During 2007 July 9-13 July 2007, AGILE-GRID detected gamma-ray emission from 3C 279, with the source at ~2 deg from the center of the Field of View, with an average flux of (210+-38) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for energy above 100 MeV. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 10 mCrab. During the observation lasted about 4 days no significative gamma-ray flux variation was observed.   Conclusions. The Spectral Energy Distribution is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone Synchrotron Self Compton emission plus the contributions by external Compton scattering of direct disk radiation and, to a lesser extent, by external Compton scattering of photons from the Broad Line Region.
