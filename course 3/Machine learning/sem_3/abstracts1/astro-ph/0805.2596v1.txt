We solve for the behaviour of cosmological perturbations in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld model using a new numerical method. Unlike some other approaches in the literature, our method uses no approximations other than linear theory and is valid on large scales. We examine the behaviour of late-universe density perturbations for both the self-accelerating and normal branches of DGP cosmology.
