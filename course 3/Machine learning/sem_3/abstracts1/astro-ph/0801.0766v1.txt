We study the relationship between different wave phenomena associated with a coronal mass ejection (CME) observed on 05 Mar. 2000. EIT waves were observed in the images recorded by EIT at 195 {\AA}. The white-light LASCO/C2 images show clear deflection and propagation of a kink along with the CME. Spectroscopic observations recorded by the UVCS reveals excessive line broadening in the two O {\sc{vi}} lines (1032 and 1037 {\AA}). Moreover very hot lines such as Si {\sc{xii}} and Mg {\sc{x}} were observed. Interestingly, the EIT wave, the streamer deflection and the intensity modulation along the slit were all propagating North-East. Spatial and temporal correlations show that the streamer deflection and spectral line broadening are highly likely to be due to a CME-driven shock wave and that the EIT wave is the signature of a CME-driven shock wave in the lower corona.
