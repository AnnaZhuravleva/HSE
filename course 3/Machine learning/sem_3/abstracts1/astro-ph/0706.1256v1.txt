The Pierre Auger Observatory, with an array of currently more than 1200 Cherenkov detectors filled with 12 m$^3$ of water, can detect the putative high energy emission of a GRB (photons down to a few hundreds of MeV) by the so-called ``single particle technique'', through a coherent increase in the average background particle rates over the whole array, due to secondary particles in the photon-induced showers. We present a search for bursts on data collected since September 2005, as well as a search for excesses in coincidence with bursts observed by satellites.
