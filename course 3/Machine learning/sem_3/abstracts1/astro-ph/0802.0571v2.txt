Aims. To study intensity oscillations in the solar chromosphere/corona above a quiet-Sun magnetic network. Methods. We analyse the time series of He II 256.32, Fe XI 188.23 and Fe XII 195.12 spectral lines observed by EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode near the south pole. Then we use a standard wavelet tool to produce power spectra of intensity oscillations above the magnetic network. Results. We get ~7 min intensity oscillations in all spectral lines and ~13 min intensity oscillations only in He II with the probability of ~96-98 %, which probably reflects the process of magneto-acoustic wave propagation above the network. Conclusions. We suggest that field-free cavity areas under bipolar magnetic canopies in the vicinity of magnetic network may serve as resonators for the magneto-acoustic waves. The cavities with photospheric sound speed and granular dimensions may produce the waves with the observed periods. The waves may propagate upwards in the transition region/corona and cause observed intensity oscillations.
