We analyze different data of the variation of the fine structure constant obtained with different methods to check their consistency.We test consistency using the modified Student test and confidence intervals. We split the data sets in smaller intervals. A criterion for this selection is proposed. Results show consistency for reduced intervals for each pair of data sets considered. Results are at variance with the ones obtained considering mean values over the whole interval.
