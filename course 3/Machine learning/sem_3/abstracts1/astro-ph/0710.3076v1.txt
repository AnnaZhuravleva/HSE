Ca II triplet spectroscopy has been used to derive stellar metallicities for individual stars in four LMC fields situated at galactocentric distances of 3\arcdeg, 5\arcdeg, 6\arcdeg\@ and 8\arcdeg\@ to the north of the Bar. Observed metallicity distributions show a well defined peak, with a tail toward low metallicities. The mean metallicity remains constant until 6\arcdeg\@ ([Fe/H]$\sim$-0.5 dex), while for the outermost field, at 8\arcdeg, the mean metallicity is substantially lower than in the rest of the disk ([Fe/H]$\sim$-0.8 dex). The combination of spectroscopy with deep CCD photometry has allowed us to break the RGB age--metallicity degeneracy and compute the ages for the objects observed spectroscopically. The obtained age--metallicity relationships for our four fields are statistically indistinguishable. We conclude that the lower mean metallicity in the outermost field is a consequence of it having a lower fraction of intermediate-age stars, which are more metal-rich than the older stars. The disk age--metallicity relationship is similar to that for clusters. However, the lack of objects with ages between 3 and 10 Gyr is not observed in the field population. Finally, we used data from the literature to derive consistently the age--metallicity relationship of the bar. Simple chemical evolution models have been used to reproduce the observed age--metallicity relationships with the purpose of investigating which mechanism has participated in the evolution of the disk and bar. We find that while the disk age--metallicity relationship is well reproduced by close-box models or models with a small degree of outflow, that of the bar is only reproduced by models with combination of infall and outflow.
