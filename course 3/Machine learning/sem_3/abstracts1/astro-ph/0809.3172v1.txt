We study the extent to which the SAGE experiment data indicate the permanence of the solar neutrino flux. It is shown that in the first approximation this flux is constant and its distribution function is unimodal. Using a more detailed analysis one finds out that data of the first years of experiment (1990-1992) demonstrate a time dependence which is slightly different from what was found for the subsequent years (1993-2006). The distinctive feature of the first years of experiment is a high dispersion of neutrino flux in comparison with the following epoch. We discuss possible astronomical consequences of this result.
