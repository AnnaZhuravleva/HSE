We computed flat rotation curves from scalar-tensor theories in their weak field limit. Our model, by construction, fits a flat rotation profile for velocities of stars. As a result, the form of the scalar field potential and DM distribution in a galaxy are determined. By taking into account the constraints for the fundamental parameters of the theory $(\lambda, \alpha)$, it is possible to obtain analytical results for the density profiles. For positive and negative values of $\alpha$, the DM matter profile is as cuspy as NFW's.
