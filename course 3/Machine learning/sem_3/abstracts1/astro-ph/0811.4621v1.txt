In this series of papers we examine magnetic reconnection in a domain where the magnetic field does not vanish and the non-ideal region is localised in space. In a previous paper we presented a technique for obtaining analytical solutions to the stationary resistive MHD equations in such a situation and examined specific examples of non-ideal reconnective solutions. Here we further develop the model, noting that certain ideal solutions may be superimposed onto the fundamental non-ideal solutions and examining the effect of imposing various such flows. Significant implications are found for the evolution of magnetic flux in the reconnection process. It is shown that, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, in three-dimensions there is a very wide variety of physically different steady reconnection solutions.
