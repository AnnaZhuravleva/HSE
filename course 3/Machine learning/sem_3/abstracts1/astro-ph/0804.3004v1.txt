In addition to buoyancy- and magnetic tension-driven instabilities, magnetic flux rings are also susceptible to an instability induced by the hydrodynamic drag force. We investigate the influence of the toroidal shape and equilibrium condition on the thresholds of the friction-induced instability and on their relevance for emerging magnetic flux in solar-like stars. Analytical instability criteria are derived for axial symmetric perturbations and for flux rings in the equatorial plane by analysing the sequence of principal minors of the coefficient matrices of dispersion polynomials. The general case of non-equatorial flux rings is investigated numerically by considering flux tubes in the solar overshoot region. The friction-induced instability occurs when an eigenmode reverses its direction of propagation due to advection, typically from the retrograde to the prograde direction. Since the reversal requires a certain relative velocity difference between plasma inside the flux tube and the environment, the instability criterion depends on the location and field strength of the flux ring. The friction-induced instability sets in at lower field strengths than buoyancy- and tension-driven instabilities. Its threshold is independent of the strength of friction, but the growth rates depend on the strength of the frictional coupling between flux tube and environment. The friction-induced instability lowers the critical magnetic field strength beyond which flux tubes are subject to growing perturbations. Whereas buoyancy- and tension-driven instabilities depend on the magnetic field strength alone, the dependence of hydrodynamic drag on the tube diameter gives rise to an additional dependence of growth times on the magnetic flux.
