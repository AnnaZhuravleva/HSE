We present new Chandra observations of a high redshift (z~1) galaxy cluster discovered in the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS): RCS043938-2904.7. X-ray luminosity measurements and mass estimates are consistent with L_X-T_X and M_delta-T_X relationships obtained from low-redshift data. Assuming a single cluster, X-ray mass estimates are a factor of ~10-100 below the red-sequence optical richness mass estimate. Optical spectroscopy reveals that this cluster comprises two components which are close enough to perhaps be physically associated. We present simple modeling of this two-component system which then yields an X-ray mass and optical richness consistent with expectations from statistical samples of lower redshift clusters. An unexpectedly high gas mass fraction is measured assuming a single cluster, which independently supports this interpretation. Additional observations will be necessary to confirm the excess gas mass fraction and to constrain the mass distribution.
