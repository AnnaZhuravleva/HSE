We present a preliminary analysis of the photospheric activity of CoRoT-Exo-2a, a young G7V star accompanied by a transiting hot Jupiter recently discovered by CoRoT. We apply spot modelling techniques developed for the analysis of the Sun as a star and capable to extract from CoRoT high precision light curves information on the variation of the total spotted area and the longitude of active regions along the 142 days of the observations. This preliminary analysis shows that the active regions form within two active longitudes separated by about 180 degrees and rotating with periods of 4.5221 and 4.5543 days, respectively, and that the total spotted area oscillates with a period of about 28.9 days.
