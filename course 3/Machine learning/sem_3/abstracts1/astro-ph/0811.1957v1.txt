A canonic scalar field minimally coupled to a disformal metric generated by the field itself is considered. Causality and stability conditions are derived for such a field. Cosmological effects are studied and it is shown that the disformal modification could viably trigger an acceleration after a scaling matter era, thus possibly alleviating the coincidence problem.
