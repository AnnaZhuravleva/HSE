We present a model of cosmic ray heating of clusters' cores that reproduces the observed temperature distribution in clusters by using an energy balance condition in which the emitted X-ray energy is supplied by the hadronic cosmic rays, which act as warming rays (WRs). The temperature profile of the IC gas is correlated with the WR pressure distribution and, consequently, with the non-thermal emission (radio, hard X-ray and gamma-ray) induced by the interaction of the WRs with the IC gas and magnetic field. The temperature distribution of the IC gas in both cool-core and non cool-core clusters is successfully predicted from the measured IC gas density distribution. Under this contraint, the WR model is also able to reproduce the thermal and non-thermal pressure distribution in clusters, as well as their radial entropy distribution. The WR model provides other observable features: a correlation of the pressure ratio (WRs to thermal IC gas) with the inner cluster temperature T_{inner}, a correlation of the gamma-ray luminosity with T_{inner}, a substantial number of cool-core clusters observable with the GLAST-LAT experiment, a surface brightness of radio halos in cool-core clusters that recovers the observed one, a hard X-ray emission from cool-core clusters that is systematically lower than the observed limits and yet observable with the next generation HXR experiments like Simbol-X. The specific theoretical properties and the multi-frequency distribution of the e.m. signals predicted in the WR model render it quite different from the other models proposed for the heating of clusters' cool-cores. Such differences make it possible to prove or disprove our model as an explanation of the cooling-flow problems on the basis of multi-frequency observations of galaxy clusters.
