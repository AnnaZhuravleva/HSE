We present a possible scenario for the ejection of a superluminal component in the jet of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy 3C111 in early 1996. VLBI observations at 15 GHz discovered the presence of two jet features on scales smaller than one parsec. The first component evolves downstream, whereas the second one fades out after 1 parsec. We propose the injection of a perturbation of dense material followed by a decrease in the injection rate of material in the jet as a plausible explanation. This scenario is supported by 1D relativistic hydrodynamics and emission simulations. The perturbation is modeled as an increase in the jet density, without modifying the original Lorentz factor in the initial conditions. We show that an increase of the Lorentz factor in the material of the perturbation fails to reproduce the observed evolution of this flare. We are able to estimate the lifetime of the ejection event in 3C111 to be 36\pm7 days.
