We consider the time, angular and energy distributions of SN1987A events discussing the quality of their agreement with the expectations. A global interpretation is performed considering a simple model, based on the standard scenario for the explosion. Despite the contrasting and confusing indications, a straightforward fit to the data provides a result that does not contradict but rather supports the expectations. The calculated electron antineutrino flux is applied to predict the relic neutrino signal.
