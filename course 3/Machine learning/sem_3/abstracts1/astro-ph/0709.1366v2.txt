The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) experiment, a ground-based gamma-ray Cherenkov telescope array located in Namibia, has now detected many extragalactic objects, which redshifts range from z=0.00183 up to z=0.2, possibly more. With the increasing performances of Cherenkov telescopes, it now becomes possible to probe these objects at small timescales in gamma-ray, allowing the study of regions thought to be very close to the central supermassive black holes. Furthermore, H.E.S.S. has confirmed a gamma-ray emission from M87, which is thus the first extragalactic source seen at the TeV range that is not a blazar.   Among blazars, TeV BL Lacs are the most challenging objects to test the jet emission models and to shed light on particle acceleration mechanisms. The study of blazars with H.E.S.S. also revealed various temporal behaviors among them. Some objects presents a highly variable X-ray flux with small variation of the gamma-ray, while others show the inverse behavior. The interpretation of such differences is puzzling.   Observations at very high energies also bring indirect measurements of the infrared extragalactic background light (EBL). The interpretation of gamma-ray emission of radiogalaxies such as M87 in terms of misaligned blazars and the understanding of the properties of the EBL represent new challenges brought by H.E.S.S. observations of extragalactic sources.
