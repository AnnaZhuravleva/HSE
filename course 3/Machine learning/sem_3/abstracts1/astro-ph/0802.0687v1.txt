We undertake a first attempt towards a consistent reconstruction of the coronal magnetic field and the coronal density structure. We consider a stationary solar corona which has to obey the equations of magnetohydrostatics. We solve these equations with help of a newly developed optimization scheme. As a first step we illustrate how tomographic information can be included into the reconstruction of coronal magnetic fields. In a second step we use coronal magnetic field information to improve the tomographic inversion process. As input the scheme requires magnetic field measurements on the photosphere from vector-magnetographs and the line-of-sight integrated density distribution from coronagraphs. We test our codes with well known analytic magnetohydrostatic equilibria and models. The program is planed for use within the STEREO mission.
