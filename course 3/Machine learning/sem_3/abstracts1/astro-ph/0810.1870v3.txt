We consider two empirical relations using data only from the prompt emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), peak energy ($E_p$) - peak luminosity ($L_p$) relation (so called Yonetoku relation) and $E_p$-isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) relation (so called Amati relation). We first suggest the independence of the two relations although they have been considered similar and dependent.   From this viewpoint, we compare constraints on cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}$, from the Yonetoku and Amati relations calibrated by low-redshift GRBs with $z < 1.8$. We found that they are different in 1-$\sigma$ level, although they are still consistent in 2-$\sigma$ level. This and the fact that both Amati and Yonetoku relations have systematic errors larger than statistical errors suggest the existence of a hidden parameter of GRBs. We introduce the luminosity time $T_L$ defined by $T_L\equiv E_{\rm iso}/L_p$ as a hidden parameter to obtain a generalized Yonetoku relation as $(L_p/{10^{52} \rm{erg s^{-1}}}) =   10^{-3.88\pm0.09}(E_p/{\rm{keV}})^{1.84\pm0.04}   (T_L/{\rm{s}})^{-0.34\pm0.04}$. The new relation has much smaller systematic error, 30%, and can be regarded as "Fundamental plane" of GRBs. We show a possible radiation model for this new relation. Finally we apply the new relation for high-redshift GRBs with $1.8 < z < 5.6$ to obtain $(\Omega_m,\Omega_{\Lambda}) =   (0.16^{+0.04}_{-0.06},1.20^{+0.03}_{-0.09})$, which is consistent with the concordance cosmological model within 2-$\sigma$ level.
