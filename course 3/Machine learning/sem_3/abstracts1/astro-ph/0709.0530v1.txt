Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars near solar metallicity are believed to be driven by radiation pressure on the UV spectral lines of metal ions. As the metallicity decreases so does the line opacity, therefore the mass-loss rate. However, since the composition of a WR atmosphere is determined by the burn products of the core, there is a lower limit on the line opacity -- and therefore the mass-loss rate -- of a WR star, even in a star with zero initial metallicity. This presentation is the result of attempt to calculate the mass-loss rate of a Population III-type WO star using a modified version of the CAK approximation. I find that n_e greater than or equal to 10^{13} cm^{-3} and Gamma between 0.5 and 0.7 give the most plausible results, with the resulting mass-loss rate between 2x10^{-9} M_sun yr^{-1} and 3x10^{-8} M_sun yr^{-1}.
