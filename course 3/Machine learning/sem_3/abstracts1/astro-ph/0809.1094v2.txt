The effective extinction law for supernovae surrounded by circumstellar dust is examined by Monte-Carlo simulations. Grains with light scattering properties as for interstellar dust in the Milky-Way (MW) or the Large Magellanic Clouds (LMC), but surrounding the explosion site would cause a semi-diffusive propagation of light up to the edge of the dust shell. Multiple scattering of photons predominantly attenuates photons with shorter wavelengths, thus steepening the effective extinction law as compared to the case of single scattering in the interstellar medium. Our simulations yield typical values for the total to selective extinction ratio $R_V\sim 1.5-2.5$, as seen in recent studies of Type Ia supernova colors, with further stiffening differential extinction toward the near-UV.
