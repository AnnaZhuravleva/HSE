High time resolution spectroscopy of roAp stars at large telescopes has led to a major breakthrough in our understanding of magnetoacoustic pulsations in these interesting objects. New observations have allowed to uncover a number of intricate relations between stellar oscillations, magnetic field, and chemical inhomogeneities. It is now understood that unusual pulsational characteristics of roAp stars arise from an interplay between short vertical length of pulsation waves and extreme chemical stratification. Here I review results of recent studies which utilize these unique properties to map 3D pulsation geometry using a combination of Doppler imaging, vertical pulsation tomography, interpretation of line profile variation, and ultraprecise space photometry. I also describe recent attempts to interpret theoretically the complex observational picture of roAp pulsations.
