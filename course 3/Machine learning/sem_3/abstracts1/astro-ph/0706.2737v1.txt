In this work, we use observations of the Hubble parameter from the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies and the recent detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at $z_1=0.35$ to constrain the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) universe. For the case with a curvature term, we set a prior $h=0.73\pm0.03$ and the best-fit values suggest a spatially closed Universe. For a flat Universe, we set $h$ free and we get consistent results with other recent analyses.
