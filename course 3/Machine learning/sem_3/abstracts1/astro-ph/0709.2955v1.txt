Low-frequency observatories are currently being constructed with the goal of detecting redshifted 21cm emission from the epoch of reionization. These observatories will also be able to detect intensity fluctuations in the cumulative 21cm emission after reionization, from hydrogen in unresolved damped Ly-alpha absorbers (such as gas rich galaxies) down to a redshift z~3.5. The inferred power spectrum of 21cm fluctuations at all redshifts will show acoustic oscillations, whose co-moving scale can be used as a standard ruler to infer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy. We find that the first generation of low-frequency experiments (such as MWA or LOFAR) will be able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few percent in a redshift window just prior to the end of the reionization era, provided that foregrounds can be removed over frequency band-passes of >8MHz. This sensitivity to the acoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxy redshift surveys, but at much higher redshifts. Future extensions of the first generation experiments (involving an order of magnitude increase in the antennae number of the MWA) could reach sensitivities below one percent in several redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in the unexplored redshift regime of 3.5<z<12. Moreover, new experiments with antennae designed to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements (<1%) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts (1.5<z<3.5), where they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveys covering more than 1000 square degrees. Together with other data sets, observations of 21cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acoustic scale from the present time out to z~12.
