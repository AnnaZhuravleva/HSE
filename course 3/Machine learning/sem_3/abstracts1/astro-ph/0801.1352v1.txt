The central star of this nebula has an observed intense magnetic field and the fast wind is no longer present, indicating that a back flow process has probably developed. Long-slit, spatially resolved echelle spectra have been obtained across the main body of NGC 1360 and over its system of bipolar jets. Deep images of the knotty structures of the jets have also been obtained. The data allow a detailed study of the structure and kinematics of this object and the results are modeled considering the effects of a magnetic collimation process in the development of the nebula and then switching off the fast stellar wind to follow its evolution to its current state. The model is able to successfully reproduce many of the key features of NGC 1360 under these premises.
