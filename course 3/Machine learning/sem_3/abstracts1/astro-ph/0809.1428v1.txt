We study the coronal magnetic field structure inside active regions and its temporal evolution. We attempt to compare the magnetic configuration of an active region in a very quiet period with that for the same region during a flare. Probably for the first time, we use vector magnetograph data from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey (SOLIS) to model the coronal magnetic field as a sequence of nonlinear force-free equilibria. We study the active region NOAA 10960 observed on 2007 June 7 with three snapshots taken during a small C1.0 flare of time cadence 10 minutes and six snapshots during a quiet period. The total magnetic energy in the active region was approximately $3 \times 10^{25}$ J. Before the flare the free magnetic energy was about 5% of the potential field energy. A part of this excess energy was released during the flare, producing almost a potential configuration at the beginning of the quiet period. During the investigated period, the coronal magnetic energy was only a few percent higher than that of the potential field and consequently only a small C1.0 flare occurred. This was compared with an earlier investigated active region 10540, where the free magnetic energy was about 60% higher than that of the potential field producing two M-class flares. However, the free magnetic energy accumulates before and is released during the flare which appears to be the case for both large and small flares.
