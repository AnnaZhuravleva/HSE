We solve equations, describing in a simplified way the newtonian dynamics of a selfgravitating nonrotating spheroidal body after loss of stability. We find that contraction to a singularity happens only in a pure spherical collapse, and deviations from the spherical symmetry stop the contraction by the stabilising action of nonlinear nonspherical oscillations. A real collapse happens after damping of the oscillations due to energy losses, shock wave formation or viscosity. Detailed analysis of the nonlinear oscillations is performed using a Poincar\'{e} map construction. Regions of regular and chaotic oscillations are localized on this map.
