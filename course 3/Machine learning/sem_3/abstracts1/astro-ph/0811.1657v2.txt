The long lived afterglow emission that follows gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) was predicted prior to its detection in 1997, in the X-rays, optical and radio. It is thought to arise from the shock that is driven into the external medium as the latter decelerates the relativistic outflow that drives the GRB, and persists well after most of the energy in the outflow is transferred to the shocked external medium. As the blast wave decelerates, the typical emission frequency shifts to longer wavelength. Recent observations following the launch of the Swift satellite challenge the traditional afterglow modeling and call into questions some of the basic underlying concepts. This brief review outlines some of the major strengths and weaknesses of the standard afterglow model, as well as some of the challenges that it faces in explaining recent data, and potential directions for future study that may eventually help overcome some of the current difficulties.
