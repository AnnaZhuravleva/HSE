We use updated data on distances and velocities of galaxies in the proximity of the Local Group (LG) in order to establish properties of the local Hubble flow. For 30 neighbouring galaxies with distances 0.7 < D_LG < 3.0 Mpc, the Local flow is characterized by the Hubble parameter H_loc = (78+/-2) km/(s*Mpc), the mean-square peculiar velocity sigma_v = 25 km/s, corrected for errors of radial velocity measurements (~4 km/s) and distance measurements (~10 km/s), as well as the radius of the zero-velocity surface R_0 = (0.96+/-0.03) Mpc. The minimum value for sigma_v is achieved when the barycenter of the LG is located at the distance D_c = (0.55+/-0.05) D_M31 towards M31 corresponding to the Milky Way-to-M31 mass ratio M_MW / M_M31 ~ 4/5. In the reference frame of the 30 galaxies at 0.7 - 3.0 Mpc, the LG barycenter has a small peculiar velocity ~(24+/-4) km/s towards the Sculptor constellation. The derived value of R_0 corresponds to the total mass M_T(LG) = (1.9+/-0.2) 10^12 M_sun with Omega_m = 0.24 and a topologically flat universe, a value in good agreement with the sum of virial mass estimates for the Milky Way and M31.
