The Extended Groth Strip (EGS) is one of the premier fields for extragalactic deep surveys. Deep observations of the EGS with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope cover an area of 0.38 square degrees to a 50% completeness limit of 1.5 uJy at 3.6 um. The catalog comprises 57434 objects detected at 3.6 um, with 84%, 28%, and 24% also detected at 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um. Number counts are consistent with results from other Spitzer surveys. Color distributions show that the EGS IRAC sources comprise a mixture of populations: low-redshift star-forming galaxies, quiescent galaxies dominated by stellar emission at a range of redshifts, and high redshift galaxies and AGN.
