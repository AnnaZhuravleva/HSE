We present an investigation on effect of the ion-neutral (or ambipolar) diffusion heating rate on thermal phases of a molecular cloud. We use the modeling of ambipolar diffusion with two-fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics, as discussed by Nejad-Asghar & Molteni. We take into account the ambipolar drift heating rate on the net cooling function of the molecular clouds, and we investigate the thermal phases in a self-gravitating magnetized one dimensional slab. The results show that the isobaric thermal instability criterion is satisfied in the outer parts of the cloud, thus, these regions are thermally unstable while the inner part is stable. This feature may be responsible for the planet formation in the outer parts of a collapsing molecular cloud and/or may also be relevant for the formation of star forming dense cores in the clumps.
