The Kepler mission's primary goal is the detection and characterization of Earth-like planets by observing continuously a region of sky for a nominal period of three-and-a-half years. Over 100,000 stars will be monitored, with a small subset of these having a cadence of 1 minute, making asteroseismic studies for many stars possible. The subset of targets will consist of mainly solar-type and planet-hosting stars, and these will be observed for a minimum period of 1 month and a maximum depending on the scientific yield of the individual target. Many oscillation frequencies will be detected in these data, and these will be used to constrain the star's fundamental parameters. I investigate the effect that an increase in a) the length of observation and b) the signal quality, has on the final determination of some stellar global parameters, such as the radius and the age.
