We use the GALPROP code and the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) data to derive the cosmic ray (CR) isotopic composition at the sources. The composition is derived for two propagation models, diffusive reacceleration and plain diffusion. We show that the compositions derived assuming these two propagation models are different. We also compare the isotopic composition at the sources with the latest solar composition.
