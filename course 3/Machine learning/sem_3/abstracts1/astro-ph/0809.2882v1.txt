From the low-mass non-relativistic case to the relativistic limit, the density profile of a white dwarf is used to evaluate the complexity measure. Similarly to the recently reported atomic case where, by averaging shell effects, complexity grows with the atomic number, here complexity grows as a function of the star mass reaching a maximum finite value in the Chandrasekhar limit.
