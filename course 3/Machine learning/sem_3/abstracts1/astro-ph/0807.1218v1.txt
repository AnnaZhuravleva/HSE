Based on the assumptions that a fraction of cluster dark matter is composed of degenerate neutrinos and they are in hydrostatic equilibrium with other matter, we predict a relation between the density profile and temperature of the cluster hot gas. The predicted relation agrees with observational data of 103 clusters.
