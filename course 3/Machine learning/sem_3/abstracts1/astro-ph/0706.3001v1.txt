We report on the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of RX J1347.5-1145 (z=0.451), the most X-ray-luminous galaxy cluster. We present a detailed total and gas mass determination up to large distances (~1.7 Mpc), study the scaling properties of the cluster, and explore the role of AGN heating in the cluster cool core. By means of spatially resolved spectroscopy we derive density, temperature, entropy, and cooling time profiles of the intra-cluster medium. We compute the total mass profile of the cluster in the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. If the disturbed south-east region of the cluster is excluded from the analysis, our results on shape, normalization, scaling properties of density, temperature, entropy, and cooling time profiles are fully consistent with those of relaxed, cool core clusters. We compare our total and gas mass estimates with previous X-ray, lensing, dynamical, and SZ studies. We find good agreement with other X-ray results, dynamical mass measurements, weak lensing masses and SZ results. We confirm a discrepancy of a factor ~2 between strong lensing and X-ray mass determinations and find a gross mismatch between our total mass estimate and the mass reconstructed through the combination of both strong and weak lensing. We explore the effervescent heating scenario in the core of RX J1347.5-1145 and find support to the picture that AGN outflows and heat conduction are able to quenching radiative cooling.
