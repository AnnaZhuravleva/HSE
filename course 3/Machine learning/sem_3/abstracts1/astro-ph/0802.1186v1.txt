LOFAR, the Low-Frequency Array, is a next-generation software-driven radio telescope operating between 30 and 240MHz, currently under construction by ASTRON in the Netherlands. This low frequency radio band is one of the few largely unexplored regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensitivity and angular resolution offered by LOFAR will be two to three orders of magnitude better than existing telescopes, and as such it will open up this new window on the Universe. LOFAR will impact on a broad range of astrophysics, from cosmology to solar system studies.   There is growing European involvement in LOFAR, driven by the need to add stations far from the main core in order to improve angular resolution. LOFAR-UK is a project aimed at cementing UK participation in LOFAR via the operation of four stations within the UK. LOFAR-UK ground stations will allow LOFAR observations to reach sub-arcsecond scales at the highest frequencies, and as a result will also improve the (confusion-limited) sensitivity limit of the telescope for deep surveys.   LOFAR-UK will achieve involvement for UK astronomers in a world-leading science facility operating in the immediate future. It will allow the UK to build up important scientific and technical expertise in `next generation' radio astronomy in preparation for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), and will play an important role in broadening the UK community that has an interest in radio astronomy. This White Paper outlines the strategic importance to the UK astronomy community of gaining involvement in the LOFAR project, the scientific interests of UK researchers in using the telescope, and the technical challenges that will need to be overcome [abridged].
