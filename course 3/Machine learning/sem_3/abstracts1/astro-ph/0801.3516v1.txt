At least one massive binary system containing an energetic pulsar, PSR B1259-63/SS2883, has been recently detected in the TeV gamma-rays by the HESS telescopes. These gamma-rays are likely produced by particles accelerated in the vicinity of the pulsar and/or at the pulsar wind shock, in comptonization of soft radiation from the massive star. However, the process of gamma-ray production in such systems can be quite complicated due to the anisotropy of the radiation field, complex structure of the pulsar wind termination shock and possible absorption of produced gamma-rays which might initiate leptonic cascades. In this paper we consider in detail all these effects. We calculate the gamma-ray light curves and spectra for different geometries of the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS2883 and compare them with the TeV gamma-ray observations. We conclude that the leptonic IC model, which takes into account the complex structure of the pulsar wind shock due to the aspherical wind of the massive star, can explain the details of the observed gamma-ray light curve.
