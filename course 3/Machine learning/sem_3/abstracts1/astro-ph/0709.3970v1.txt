We easily tend to think of Integral-Field Spectrographs (IFS) along two opposing trends: as either the beautiful combination between photometry and spectroscopy, or as our worst nightmare including the dark side of both worlds. I favour a view where each IFS is considered individually, as one instrument with specific performances which can be used optimally for a certain range of scientific programs. It is indeed true that data-wise, IFS do sometime merge the characteristics of classic (e.g., long-slit) spectrographs with annoying issues associated with Imagers. This is in fact the price to pay to access a drastically different perspective of our favourite targets. The challenge is then to provide the necessary tools to properly handle the corresponding data. However, this should certainly not be thought as something specific to IFS: such a challenge should be accepted for any instrument, and most importantly solved prior to its delivery at the telescope.
