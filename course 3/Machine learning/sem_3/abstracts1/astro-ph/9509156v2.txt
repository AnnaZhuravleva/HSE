We review optical observations and theoretical models of the non-magnetic nova-like variables (UX UMa, VY Scl and SW Sex stars). A brief discussion of the classification scheme is followed by a statistical overview of the observed properties. The most important features of each of the sub-classes are then reviewed, concluding with a summary of the theoretical models invoked to understand these systems.
