In the framework of the "Groupe de Recherches de G\'eod\'esie Spatiale" (GRGS), a rigorous combination of the data from five space geodetic techniques (VLBI, GPS, SLR, LLR and DORIS) is routinely applied to simultaneously determine a Terrestrial Reference Frame (TRF) and Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP). This analysis is conducted with the software package GINS which has the capability to process data from all five techniques together. Such a combination at the observation level should ultimately facilitate fine geophysical studies of the global Earth system. In this project, Bordeaux Observatory is in charge of the VLBI data analysis, while satellite geodetic data are processed by other groups. In this paper, we present (i) details about the VLBI analysis undertaken with GINS, and (ii) the results obtained for the EOP during the period 2005-2006. We also compare this EOP solution with the IVS (International VLBI Service for geodesy and astrometry) analysis coordinator combined results. The agreement is at the 0.2 mas level, comparable to that of the other IVS analysis centers, which demonstrates the capability of the GINS software for VLBI analysis.
