In order to distinguish between the various components of massive star forming regions (i.e. infalling, outflowing and rotating gas structures) within our own Galaxy, we require high angular resolution observations which are sensitive to structures on all size scales. To this end, we present observations of the molecular and ionized gas towards massive star forming regions at 230 GHz from the SMA (with zero spacing from the JCMT) and at 22 and 23 GHz from the VLA at arcsecond or better resolution. These observations (of sources such as NGC7538, W51e2 and K3-50A) form an integral part of a multi-resolution study of the molecular and ionized gas dynamics of massive star forming regions (i.e. Klaassen & Wilson 2007). Through comparison of these observations with 3D radiative transfer models, we hope to be able to distinguish between various modes of massive star formation, such as ionized or halted accretion (i.e Keto 2003 or Klaassen et al. 2006 respectively).
