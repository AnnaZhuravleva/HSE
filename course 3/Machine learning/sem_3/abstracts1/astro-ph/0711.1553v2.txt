We present deep mid-infrared spectroscopy with the Spitzer Space Telescope of 13 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North (GOODS-N) field. We find strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in all of our targets which allows us to measure mid-IR spectroscopic redshifts and place constraints on the contribution from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity to the mid-IR emission. In the high signal-to-noise ratio composite spectrum of SMGs, we find that the hot dust continuum from an AGN contributes at most 30% of the mid-IR luminosity. We find that the mid-IR properties of SMGs are distinct from those of 24 micron -selected ULIRGs at z~2; the former are predominantly dominated by star formation while the latter are a more heterogeneous sample with many showing significant AGN activity. We fit the IRS spectrum and the mid-IR to radio photometry of SMGs with template spectral energy distributions to determine the best estimate of the total infrared luminosity from star formation. While many SMGs contain an AGN as evinced by their X-ray properties, our multi-wavelength analysis shows that the total infrared luminosity, LIR, in SMGs, is dominated by star formation and not AGN activity. We find that high redshift SMGs lie on the relation between LIR and LPAH6.2 (or LPAH7.7 or LPAH11.3) that has been established for local starburst galaxies. This suggests that PAH luminosity can be used as a proxy for the star formation rate in SMGs. SMGs are consistent with being a short lived cool phase in a massive merger. Although there appears to be an AGN present in many SMGs, it does not appear to have become strong enough to heat the dust and dominate the mid- or far-infrared emission.
