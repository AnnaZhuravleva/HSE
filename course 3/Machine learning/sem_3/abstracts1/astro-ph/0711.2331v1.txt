A shape of lateral distribution for charged particles in events with energy above 10^19eV is considered. Two methods were used for individual LDF parametrization. In the first approach, the index of power was determined for generalized Greisen-Linsley approximation. In second, mean square radius of the shower was determined for approximation proposed by Lagutin et al. Comparison of resulted parameters is presented for individual events arrived from different celestial regions -- Galactic planes and the region with increased flux of particles with E(0)>=10^19eV (according to Yakutsk array): 1.7h-3.7h right ascension; 45-60 degrees declination.
