We present results from a blind, spectroscopic survey for redshift ~5.7 Lyman-alpha-emitting galaxies using the Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph. A total of ~200 square arcminutes were observed in the COSMOS and LCIRS fields using a narrowband filter, which transmits between atmospheric emission lines at 8190 A, and a mask with 100 longslits. This observing technique provides higher emission-line sensitivity than narrowband imaging and probes larger volumes than strong lensing. We find 170 emission-line galaxies and identify their redshifts spectroscopically. We confirm three Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs), the first discovered using multislit-narrowband spectroscopy. Their line profiles are narrow, but fitted models suggest instrinsic, unattenuated widths 400 km/s FWHM. The red wing of the line profiles present features consistent with galactic winds. The star formation rates of these galaxies are at least 5-7 Msun/yr and likely a factor of two higher. We estimate the number density of L .ge. 5e42 erg/s LAEs is 9.0(+12,-4)e-5 Mpc-3 at redshift 5.7 and constrain the Schechter function parameters describing this population. Galaxies fainter than our detection limit may well be the primary source of ionizing photons at redshift ~ 6. We argue, however, that the break luminosity L* is not yet well constrained. If this break luminosity is near our detection limit, and somewhat lower than previous estimates, then the detected LAE population could be responsible for ionizing the intergalactic gas at redshift ~6. We discuss the potential of multislit-narrowband spectroscopy for deeper emission-line surveys.
