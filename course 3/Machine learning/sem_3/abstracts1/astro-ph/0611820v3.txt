We present a catalog of 36,120 QSO candidates from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) Release Two (GR2) UV catalog and the USNO-A2.0 optical catalog. The selection criteria are established using known quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The SDSS sample is then used to assign individual probabilities to our GALEX-USNO candidates. The mean probability is ~50%, and would rise to ~65% if better morphological information than that from USNO were available to eliminate galaxies. The sample is ~40% complete for i<=19.1. Candidates are cross-identified in 2MASS, FIRST, SDSS, and XMM-Newton Slewing Survey (XMMSL1), whenever such counterparts exist. The present catalog covers the 8000 square degrees of GR2 lying above 25 degrees Galactic latitude, but can be extended to all 24,000 square degress that satisfy this criterion as new GALEX data become available.
