The apparent alignment of the cosmic microwave background multipoles on large scales challenges the standard cosmological model. Scalar field inflation is isotropic and cannot account for the observed alignment. We explore the imprints, a non-standard spinor driven inflation would leave on the cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We show it is natural to expect an anisotropic inflationary expansion of the Universe which has the effect of suppressing the low multipole amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, while at the same time to provide the usual inflationary features.
