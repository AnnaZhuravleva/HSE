We present the results of a variable stars search in the field of the old open cluster NGC 2204. Five new variables were found, four of them being eclipsing binaries. The sample includes a detached binary located at the turnoff, a W UMa - type system, and an interesting detached low-mass binary with a period of 0.45d which, however, is a foreground object. We provide V-light curves and finder charts for all variables together with color-magnitude diagrams of the cluster. For four variables incomplete I-light curves are also provided.
