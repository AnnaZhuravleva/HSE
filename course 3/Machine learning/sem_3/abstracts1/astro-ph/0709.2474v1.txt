The MAGIC 17m diameter Cherenkov telescope will be upgraded with a second telescope within the year 2007. The camera of MAGIC-II will include several new features compared to the MAGIC-I camera. Photomultipliers with the highest available photon collection efficiency have been selected. A modular design allows easier access and flexibility to test new photodetector technologies. The camera will be uniformly equipped with 0.1 degree diamter pixels, which allows the use of an increased trigger area. Finally, the overall signal chain features a large bandwidth to retain the shape of the very fast Cherenkov signals.
