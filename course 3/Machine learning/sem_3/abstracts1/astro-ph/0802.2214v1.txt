The Auger experiment was designed to study the high-energy cosmic rays by measuring the properties of the showers produced in the atmosphere. The Southern Auger Observatory has taken data since January 2004. Results on mass composition, energy spectrum and anisotropy of the arrival directions are presented. The most important result is the recent observation of correlations with nearby extragalactic objects.
