Archival Spitzer observations of 41 starburst galaxies that span a wide range in metallicity reveal for the first time a correlation between the [FeII]/[NeII] 26.0/12.8 micron ratio and the electron gas density as traced by the 18.7/33.4 micron [SIII] ratio, with the [FeII]/[NeII] ratio decreasing with increasing gas density. We also find a strong correlation between the gas density and the PAH peak to continuum strength. Using shock and photoionization models, we see the driver of the observed [FeII]/[NeII] ratios is metallicity. The majority of [FeII] emission in low metallicity galaxies may be shock-derived, whilst at high metallicity, the [FeII] emission may be instead dominated by contributions from HII and in particular from dense PDR regions. However, the observed [FeII]/[NeII] ratios may instead be following a metallicity-abundance relationship, with iron being less depleted onto grains in low metallicity galaxies - a result that would have profound implications for the use of iron emission lines as unambiguous tracers of shocks.
