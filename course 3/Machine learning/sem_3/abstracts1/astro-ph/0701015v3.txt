An outstanding issue in braneworld theory concerns the setting up of proper boundary conditions for the brane-bulk system. Boundary conditions (BC's) employing regulatory branes or demanding that the bulk metric be nonsingular have yet to be implemented in full generality. In this paper, we take a different route and specify boundary conditions directly on the brane thereby arriving at a local and closed system of equations (on the brane). We consider a one-parameter family of boundary conditions involving the anisotropic stress of the projection of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane and derive an exact system of equations describing scalar cosmological perturbations on a generic braneworld with induced gravity. Depending upon our choice of boundary conditions, perturbations on the brane either grow moderately (region of stability) or rapidly (instability). In the instability region, the evolution of perturbations usually depends upon the scale: small scale perturbations grow much more rapidly than those on larger scales. This instability is caused by a peculiar gravitational interaction between dark radiation and matter on the brane. Generalizing the boundary conditions obtained by Koyama and Maartens, we find for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model an instability, which leads to a dramatic scale-dependence of the evolution of density perturbations in matter and dark radiation. A different set of BC's, however, leads to a more moderate and scale-independent growth of perturbations. For the mimicry braneworld, which expands like LCDM, this class of BC's can lead to an earlier epoch of structure formation.
