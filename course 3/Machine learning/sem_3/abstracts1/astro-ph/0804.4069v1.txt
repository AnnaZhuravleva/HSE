While in the past spherodicity was assumed, and still is used in modeling of most nebulae, we know now that only a small number of planetary nebulae (PNe) are really spherical or at least nearly round. Round planetary nebulae are the minority of objects. In the case of those objects that underwent a very late helium flash (called VLTP objects or ``born-again'' PNe) it seems to be different. The first, hydrogen-rich PN, is more or less round. The ejecta from the VLTP event, in contrast, are extremely asymmetrical.
