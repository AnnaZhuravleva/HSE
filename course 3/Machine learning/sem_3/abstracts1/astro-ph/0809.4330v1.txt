In this review I briefly describe the latest advances in studies of aperiodic variability of accreting X-ray binaries and outline the model which currently describe the majority of observational appearances of variability of accreting sources in the best way. Then I concentrate on the case of luminous accreting neutron star binaries (in the soft/high spectral state), where study of variability of X-ray emission of sources allowed us to resolve long standing problem of disentangling the contribution of accretion disk and boundary/spreading layer components to the time average spectrum of sources. The obtained knowledge of the shape of the spectrum of the boundary layer allowed us to make estimates of the mass and radii of accreting neutron stars.
