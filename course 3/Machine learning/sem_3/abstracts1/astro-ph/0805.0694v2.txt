We evaluate background rejection capabilities and physics performance of a detector composed of two diverse elements: a sensitive target (filled with one or two species of liquefied noble gasses) and an active veto (made of Gd-doped ultra-pure water). A GEANT4 simulation shows that for a direct WIMP search, this device can reduce the neutron background to O(1) event per year per tonne of material. Our calculation shows that an exposure of one tonne $\times$ year will suffice to exclude spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections ranging from $10^{-9}$ pb to $10^{-10}$ pb.
