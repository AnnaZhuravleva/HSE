Using the OGLE catalogue of eclipsing binaries, 15 contact binaries were identified towards the SMC and the LMC at vertical distances from the Galactic plane between 300 pc and 10 kpc. Based on the luminosity function calculated for these contact binaries, we estimated a frequency of occurrence relative to Main Sequence stars in the thick disk at roughly 1/600. This estimate suffers from the small number statistics, but is consistent with the value previously found for the solar neighbourhood.
