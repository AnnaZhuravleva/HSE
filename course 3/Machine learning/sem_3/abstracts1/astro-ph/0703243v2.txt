We present an analysis of a devised sample of Rotation Curves (RCs), aimed at checking the consequences of a modified f(R) gravity on galactic scales. Originally motivated by the the dark energy mystery, this theory may serve as a possibility of explaining the observed non-Keplerian profiles of galactic RCs in terms of a break-down of the Einstein General Relativity. We show that in general the power-law f(R) version could fit well the observations with reasonable values for the mass model parameters, encouraging further investigation on R^n gravity from both observational and theoretical points of view.
