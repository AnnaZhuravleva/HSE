We use a 1D propagation model to study the dependence of the pbar and dbar exotic fluxes on the transport parameters. The simple analytical solutions allow us i) to clarify the origin of the astrophysical uncertainties, and ii) to compare two models used for {\em signal} predictions, namely the constant and the linear Galactic wind models. We also study how these uncertainties should be reduced using forthcoming nuclear cosmic ray data. We confirm that the degeneracy of the transport parameters for a given propagation model leads to very different fluxes for primary antinuclei (~10^2). However, we show that with forthcoming data, these uncertainties could be greatly reduced (~2). As the precision will increase, the astrophysical uncertainty could then be dominated by our ignorance of the correct spatial dependence for some of the transport parameters: for instance, the constant and the linear wind models do not predict the same amount of exotic pbar at low energy.
