We present high precision radial velocity observations of HD17156 during a transit of its eccentric Jovian planet. In these data, we detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is an apparent perturbation in the velocity of the star due to the progressive occultation of part of the rotating stellar photosphere by the transiting planet. This system had previously been reported by Narita et al. (2008) to exhibit a lambda = 62 +/- 25 degree misalignment of the projected planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation axis. We model our data, along with the Narita et al. data, and obtain lambda = 9.4 +/- 9.3 degrees for the combined data set. We thus conclude that the planetary orbital axis is actually very well aligned with the stellar rotation axis.
