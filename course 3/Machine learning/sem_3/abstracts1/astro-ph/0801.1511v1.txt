This paper is devoted to exploring how we can discover and study nearby (< 1-2 kpc) planetary and binary systems by observing their action as gravitational lenses. Lensing can extend the realm of nearby binaries and planets that can be systematically studied to include dark and dim binaries, and face-on systems. As with more traditional studies, which use light from the system, orbital parameters (including the total mass, mass ratio, and orbital separation) can be extracted from lensing data, Also in common with these traditional methods, individual systems can be targeted for study. We discuss the specific observing strategies needed in order to optimize the discovery and study of nearby planetary and binary systems by observing their actions as lenses.
