We present the results of a contemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of lambda And and II Peg aimed at investigating the behavior of surface inhomogeneities in the atmospheres of these active stars which have nearly the same temperature but different gravity. The light curves and the modulation of the surface temperature, as recovered from LDRs, are used to map the photospheric spots, while the H-alpha emission has been used as an indicator of chromospheric inhomogeneities. The spot temperatures and sizes were derived from a spot model applied to the contemporaneous light and temperature curves. We find larger and cooler spots on II Peg (T_sp ~ 3600 K) compared to lambda And (T_sp ~ 3900 K); this could be the result of both the different gravity and the higher activity level of the former. Moreover, we find a clear anti-correlation between the H-alpha emission and the photospheric diagnostics. We have also detected a modulation of the intensity of the HeI D_3 line with the star rotation. A rough reconstruction of the 3D structure of their atmospheres has been also performed by applying a spot/plage model to the light and temperature curves and to the H-alpha flux modulation. A close spatial association of photospheric and chromospheric active regions has been found in both stars. Larger and cooler spots have been found on II Peg, the system with the active component of higher gravity and higher activity level. The area ratio of plages to spots seems to decrease when the spots get bigger. Moreover, with the present and literature data, a correlation between the temperature difference Delta_T = T_ph - T_sp and the surface gravity has been also suggested. In addition, a strong flare affecting the H-alpha, the HeI D_3, and the cores of NaI D_1,2 lines has been observed on II Peg.
