Europa is believed to have formed near the very end of Jupiter's own accretion, within a circumplanetary disk of gas and solid particles. We review the formation of the Galilean satellites in the context of current constraints and understanding of giant planet formation, focusing on recent models of satellite growth within a circumjovian accretion disk produced during the final stages of gas inflow to Jupiter. In such a disk, the Galilean satellites would have accreted slowly, in more than 10^5 yr, and in a low pressure, low gas density environment. Gravitational interactions between the satellites and the gas disk lead to inward orbital migration and loss of satellites to Jupiter. Such effects tend to select for a maximum satellite mass and a common total satellite system mass compared to the planet's mass. One implication is that multiple satellite systems may have formed and been lost during the final stages of Jupiter's growth, with the Galilean satellites being the last generation that survived as gas inflow to Jupiter ended. We conclude by discussing open issues and implications for Europa's conditions of formation.
