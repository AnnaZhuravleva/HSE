Similarly to the larger Galactic ridge, the Galactic center region presents a hard diffuse emission whose origin has been strongly debated for the past two decades: does this emission result from the contribution of numerous, yet unresolved, discrete point sources ? Or does it originate in a truly diffuse, hot plasma ?   The Galactic center region (GC) is however different on many respects from the outer parts of the Galaxy, which makes the diffuse emission issue at the Galactic center unique. Although recent observations seem to favour a point sources origin in the far Galactic ridge, the situation is still unclear at the GC and new observations are required.   Here we present results on the modeling of the truly diffuse plasma. Interestingly, such a plasma would strongly affect the dynamics of orbiting molecular clouds and thus the central engine activity. Discriminating between the two hypothesis has thus become a crucial issue in the understanding of this central region that makes the link between the inner small accretion disk and the large scale Galactic dynamics. We investigate the new inputs we can expect from Simbol-X on this matter.
