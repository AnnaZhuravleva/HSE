We study chirality of the vorticity of the Universe within the Einstein-Cartan cosmology. The role of the spin of fermion species during the evolution of the Universe is studied by averaged spin densities and Einstein-Cartan equations. It is shown that spin density of the light Majorana neutrinos acts as a seed for vorticity at early stages of the evolution of the Universe. Its chirality can be evaluated in the vicinity of the spacelike infinity. It turns out that vorticity of the Universe has right-handed chirality.
