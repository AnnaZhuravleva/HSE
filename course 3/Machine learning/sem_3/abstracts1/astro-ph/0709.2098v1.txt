We calculate the antideuteron flux expected from dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo. The propagation is treated in a full 2-D propagation model consistent with the results obtained from the propagation of B/C and other galactic species. We discuss the potentials of this indirect dark matter detection means, with special emphasis on the possible sources of uncertainties affecting future measurements
