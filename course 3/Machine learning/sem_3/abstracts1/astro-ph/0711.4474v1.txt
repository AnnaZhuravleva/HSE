In the framework of the search of dark matter in galactic halos in form of massive compact halo object (MACHOs), we discuss the status of microlensing observations towards the Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda galaxy, M31. The detection of a few microlensing events has been reported, but an unambiguous conclusion on the halo content in form on MACHOs has not been reached yet. A more detailed modelling of the expected signal and a larger statistics of observed events are mandatory in order to shed light on this important astrophysical issue.
