We report on the catalog of Gamma--Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected with the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor aboard the BeppoSAX satellite. It includes 1082 GRBs with 40--700 keV fluences in the range from $1.3\times 10^{-7}$ to $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, and with 40--700 keV peak fluxes from $3.7\times 10^{-8}$ to $7.0\times 10^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. We report in the catalog some relevant parameters of each GRB and discuss the derived statistical properties.
