While often the point sources in X-ray surveys are dominated by AGN, with the high sensitivity of modern X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM-Newton normal/starburst galaxies are also being detected in large numbers. We have made use of Bayesian statistics for both the selection of galaxies from deep X-ray surveys and in the analysis of the luminosity functions for galaxies. These techniques can be used to similarly select galaxies from wide-area X-ray surveys and to analyze their luminosity function. The prospects for detecting galaxies and AGN from a proposed ``wide-deep'' XMM-Newton survey and from future wide-area X-ray survey missions (such as WFXT and eRosita) are also discussed.
