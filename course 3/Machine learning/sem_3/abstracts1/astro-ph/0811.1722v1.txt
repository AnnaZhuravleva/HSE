We present spectropolarimetric analysis of umbral dots and a light bridge fragment that show dark lanes in G-band images. Umbral dots show upflow as well as associated positive Stokes V area asymmetry in their central parts. Larger umbral dots show down flow patches in their surrounding parts that are associated with negative Stokes V area asymmetry. Umbral dots show weaker magnetic field in central part and higher magnetic field in peripheral area. Umbral fine structures are much better visible in total circularly polarized light than in continuum intensity. Umbral dots show a temperature deficit above dark lanes. The magnetic field inclination show a cusp structure above umbral dots and a light bridge fragment. We compare our observational findings with 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations.
