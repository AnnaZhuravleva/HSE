We present accurate analytic fitting formulae which summarize the results of the recent calculation by Nozawa, Itoh and Kohyama on the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung Gaunt factor for the intracluster plasma. The fitting is carried out for Z = 1 to 28, 6.0 < log T < 8.5, -4.0 < log (omega/kT) < 1.0, where Z is the charge number of the ion, T is the temperature, and omega is the angular frequency of the emitted photon. The present analytic fitting formulae will be useful for the analysis of the X-ray emission which comes from the intracluster plasma as well as the other X-ray sources.
