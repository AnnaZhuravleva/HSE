We provide a quantitative analysis of time-variable phenomena in the photospheric, near-star, and outflow regions of the late-B supergiant (SG) HD 199478. The analysis is based primarily on optical spectroscopic datasets secured between 1999 and 2000 from the Bulgarian NAO, Tartu, and Ritter Observatories. The temporal behaviour of HD 199478 is characterised by three key empirical properties: (i) systematic central velocity shifts in the photospheric absorption lines, including C II and He I, over a characteristic time-scale of abou 20 days; (ii) extremely strong, variable H alpha emission with no clear modulation signal, and (iii) the occurrence in 2000 of a (rare) high-velocity absorption (HVA) event in H alpha, which evolved over about 60 days, showing the clear signature of mass infall and outflows. In these properties HD 199478 resembles few other late-B SGs with peculiar emission and HVAs in H alpha (HD 91619, HD 34085, HD 96919). Non-LTE line synthesis modelling is conducted using FASTWIND for these late-B SGs to constrain and compare their fundamental parameters within the context of extreme behaviour in the H alpha lines. Our analysis indicate that at the cooler temperature edge of B SGs, there are objects whose wind properties, as traced by H alpha, are inconsistent with the predictions of the smooth, spherically symmetric wind approximation. This discordance is still not fully understood and may highlight the role of a non-spherical, disk-like, geometry, which may result from magnetically-driven equatorial compression of the gas. Ordered dipole magnetic fields may also lead to confined plasma held above the stellar surface, which ultimately gives rise to transient HVA events.
