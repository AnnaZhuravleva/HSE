Secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be detected by using the cross-correlation between the large-scale structure (LSS) and the CMB temperature fluctuations. In such studies, chance correlations of primordial CMB fluctuations with the LSS are the main source of uncertainty. We present a method for reducing this noise by exploiting information contained in the polarisation of CMB photons. The method is described in general terms and then applied to our recently proposed optimal method for measuring the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. We obtain an expected signal-to-noise ratio of up to 8.5. This corresponds to an enhancement of the signal-to-noise by 23 per cent as compared to the standard method for ISW detection, and by 16 per cent w.r.t. our recently proposed method, both for the best-case scenario of having perfect (noiseless) CMB and LSS data.
