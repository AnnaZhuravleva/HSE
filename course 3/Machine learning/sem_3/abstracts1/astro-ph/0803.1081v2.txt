We study cosmological expansion in F(R) gravity using the trace of the field equations. High frequency oscillations in the Ricci scalar, whose amplitude increase as one evolves backward in time, have been predicted in recent works. We show that the approximations used to derive this result very quickly breakdown in any realistic model due to the non-linear nature of the underlying problem. Using a combination of numerical and semi-analytic techniques, we study a range of models which are otherwise devoid of known pathologies. We find that high frequency asymmetric oscillations and a singularity at finite time appear to be present for a wide range of initial conditions. We show that this singularity can be avoided with a certain range of initial conditions, which we find by evolving the models forwards in time. In addition we show that the oscillations in the Ricci scalar are highly suppressed in the Hubble parameter and scale factor.
