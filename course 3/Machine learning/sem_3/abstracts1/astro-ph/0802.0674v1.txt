Nearby interstellar clouds at high Galactic latitudes are ideal objects in which the interaction of interstellar dust with photons from the well-characterized interstellar radiation field can be studied. Scattering and UV-excited photoluminescence at optical wavelengths as well as thermal emission at mid- and far-infrared wavelengths are observable manifestations of such interactions. Here we report initial results from an optical imaging survey of optically thin high-Galactic-latitude clouds, which is designed to study the surface brightness, structure, and spectral energy distribution of these objects. The primary aim of this paper is to study the extended red emission (ERE) that has been reported at high Galactic latitudes in earlier investigations and which is attributed to ultraviolet-excited photoluminescence of an as yet unidentified component of interstellar dust. We find strong evidence for dust emission in the form of a broad (>1000 A FWHM) ERE band with peak emission near 600 nm wavelength and peak intensity of ~ 5x10^-9 (erg cm^-2 s^-1 A^-1 sr^-1) in optically-thin clouds. This amounts to about 30% of the total optical surface brightness of these clouds, the remainder being consistent with expectations for dust-scattered light. This supports claims for the ubiquitous presence of the ERE carrier throughout the diffuse interstellar medium of the Milky Way Galaxy. We suggest that the ERE carrier is involved in the radiative processing of about 20% to 30% of the dust-absorbed UV/optical luminosity of the Milky Way galaxy, with the bulk of this energy being emitted in the near- to mid-infrared spectral regions.
