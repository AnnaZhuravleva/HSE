We present high quality (high signal-to-noise ratio and moderate spectral resolution) near-infrared (near-IR) spectroscopic observations of 23 well-known broad-emission line active galactic nuclei (AGN). Additionally, we obtained simultaneous (within two months) optical spectroscopy of similar quality. The near-IR broad emission line spectrum of AGN is dominated by permitted transitions of hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and calcium, and by the rich spectrum of singly-ionized iron. In this paper we present the spectra, line identifications and measurements, and address briefly some of the important issues regarding the physics of AGN broad emission line regions. In particular, we investigate the excitation mechanism of neutral oxygen and confront for the first time theoretical predictions of the near-IR iron emission spectrum with observations.
