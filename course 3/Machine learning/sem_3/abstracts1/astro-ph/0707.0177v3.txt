We report the results of interferometric observations of Centaurus A with the MID-infrared Interferometer (MIDI) at ESO's VLTI telescope array. The interferometric measurements are spectrally resolved (R = 30) in the wavelength range 8 to 13 micron. Their spatial resolution reaches 15 mas at the shortest wavelengths. Supplementary observations were obtained in the near-infrared with the adaptive optics instrument NACO, and at mm wavelengths with SEST and JCMT. We find that he mid-infrared emission from the core of Centaurus A is dominated by an unresolved point source (<10 mas). Observations with baselines orientated perpendicular to the radio jet reveal an extended component which can be interpreted as a geometrically thin, dusty disk, the axis of which is aligned with the radio jet. Its diameter is about 0.6 pc. We argue, that the unresolved emission is dominated by a synchrotron source. Its overall spectrum is characterized by a \nu^{-0.36} power-law which cuts off exponentially towards high frequencies at 8x10^{13} Hz and becomes optically thick at \nu < 45 GHz. Based on a Synchrotron Self Compton (SSC) interpretation for the gamma-ray emission, we find a magnetic field strength of 26 microTesla and a maximum energy of relativistic electrons of \gamma_c = E_c/m_e c^2 = 8500. Near \gamma_c, the acceleration time scale is 4 days, in good agreement with the fastest X-ray variations. Our SSC model argues for an upper limit for the bulk Lorentz factor < 2.5, at variance with the concept of a "mis-directed BL Lac object". We estimate a thermal core luminosity of 1.3x10^{34} W, intermediate between the values for highly efficiently accreting AGN (e.g. Seyfert galaxies) and those of typical FR I radio galaxies.
