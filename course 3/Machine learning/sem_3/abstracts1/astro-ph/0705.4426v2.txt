A computation of the inflationary observables n_{s} and r is made for `logamediate' inflation where the cosmological scale factor expands as $a=\exp (A(\ln t)^{\lambda})$, and is compared to their predicted values in the intermediate inflationary theory, where $a=\exp (Bt^{f})$. Both versions prove to be consistent with observational measurements of the cosmic background radiation. It is shown that the dynamics of a single inflaton field can be mimicked by a system of several fields in an analogous manner to that created by the joint evolution of the fields in assisted power-law inflation.
