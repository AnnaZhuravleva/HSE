The impact of HST photometry and European astronomy in studies concerning the star formation histories of resolved galaxies is described. Our current knowledge of the star formation history of systems within 10-20 Mpc, as derived from the colour-magnitude diagrams of their resolved stellar populations, is reviewed, as well as the impact of these results on our understanding of galaxy evolution.
