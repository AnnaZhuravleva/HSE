SpIOMM is an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer designed to obtain the visible range (350 to 850 nm) spectrum of every light source in a circular field of view of 12 arcminutes in diameter. It is attached to the 1.6-m telescope of the Observatoire du Mont Megantic in southern Quebec. We present here some results of three successful observing runs in 2007, which highlight SpIOMMs capabilities to map emission line objects over a very wide field of view and a broad spectral range. In particular, we discuss data cubes from the planetary nebula M27, the supernova remnants NGC 6992 and M1, the barred spiral galaxy NGC7479, as well as Stephans quintet, an interacting group of galaxies.
