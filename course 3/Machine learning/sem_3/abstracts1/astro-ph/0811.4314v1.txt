The AMS-02 detector will measure cosmic rays on the International Space Station. This contribution will cover production, testing, space qualification and integration of the AMS-02 anticoincidence counter. The anticoincidence counter is needed to to assure a clean track reconstruction for the charge determination and to reduce the trigger rate during periods of high flux.
