This study establishes that SMC, LMC and Milky Way extinction curves obey the same extinction law which depends on the 2200A bump size and one parameter, and generalizes the Cardelli, Clayton and Mathis (1989) relationship. This suggests that extinction in all three galaxies is of the same nature. The role of linear reddening laws over all the visible/UV wavelength range, particularly important in the SMC but also present in the LMC and in the Milky Way, is also highlighted and discussed.
