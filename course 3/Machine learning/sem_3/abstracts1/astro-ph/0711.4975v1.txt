The paper investigates the milli-arcsecond scale structure of the present-day mass-loss of the post-Red Supergiant IRC+10420. We use three telescopes of the VLT Interferometer in combination with the AMBER near-infrared beam combiner to measure spectrally dispersed correlated fluxes in the K-band around the Br gamma transition. The resulting visibilities are compared to the predicted visibilities of emission structures with various simple models in order to infer the size of the observed emission region. The Br gamma line is resolved by VLTI+AMBER on all three baselines, with the maximum projected baseline extending 69 meter and a P.A. ranging between 10 and 30 degrees. A differential phase between line and continuum is detected on the longest baseline. The Br gamma emission region is found to have a diameter of 3.3 milli-arcseconds (FWHM), when compared to a Gaussian intensity distribution. A uniform disk and a ring-like intensity distribution do not fit the line visibilities. Comparing the AMBER equivalent width of Br gamma with measurements from various epochs, we find that the stellar photosphere contributes about 60% of the total continuum light at 2.2 micron. The remaining 40% continuum emission is found on scales larger than the 66mas AMBER field of view. Using simple arguments, and assuming optically thick line emission, we find that the line emitting region is elongated. We briefly discuss the possibilities whether such a structure is due to a bi-polar flow or a circumstellar disk. (Abridged).
