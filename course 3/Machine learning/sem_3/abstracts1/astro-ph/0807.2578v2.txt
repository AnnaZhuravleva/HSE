From the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey we use a sample of 6447 galaxies with I_{AB} < 24 to identify 251 pairs of galaxies, each member with a secure spectroscopic redshift, which are close in both projected separation and in velocity. We find that at z ~ 0.9, 10.9 +/- 3.2 % of galaxies with M_B(z) < -18-Qz are in pairs with separations dr < 20 kpc/h, dv < 500 km/s, and with dM_B < 1.5, significantly larger than 3.76 +/- 1.71 % at z ~ 0.5; we find that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^m with m = 2.49 +/- 0.56. For brighter galaxies with M_B(z=0) < -18.77, the pair fraction is higher and its evolution with redshift is somewhat flatter with m=1.88 \pm 0.40, a property also observed for galaxies with increasing stellar masses. Early type, dry mergers, pairs increase their relative fraction from 3 % at z ~ 0.9 to 12 % at z ~ 0.5. We find that the merger rate evolves as N_{mg}=(9.05 +/- 3.76) * 10^{-4}) * (1+z)^{2.43 +/- 0.76}. We find that the merger rate of galaxies with M_B(z) < -18-Qz has significantly evolved since z ~ 1. The merger rate is increasing more rapidly with redshift for galaxies with decreasing luminosities, indicating that the flat evolution found for bright samples is not universal. The merger rate is also strongly dependent on the spectral type of galaxies involved, late type mergers being more frequent in the past, while early type mergers are more frequent today, contributing to the rise in the local density of early type galaxies. About 20 % of the stellar mass in present day galaxies with log(M/M_{sun}) > 9.5 has been accreted through major merging events since z ~ 1, indicating that major mergers have contributed significantly to the growth in stellar mass density of bright galaxies over the last half of the life of the Universe.
