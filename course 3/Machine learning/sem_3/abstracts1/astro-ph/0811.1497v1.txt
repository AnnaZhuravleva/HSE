The binaries known as cataclysmic variables are particular binary systems in which the primary star (a white dwarf) accretes material from a secondary via Roche-lobe mechanism. Usually, these objects have orbital period of a few hours so that a detailed temporal analysis can be performed. Here, we present Chandra ${\it XMM}$-Newton observations of a dwarf nova candidate identified in the past by optical observations towards the galactic Bulge and labeled as MACHO 104.20906.960. After a spectral analysis, we used the Lomb-Scargle technique for the period search and evaluated the confidence level using Monte-Carlo simulations. In this case, we found that the $X$-ray source shows a period of $2.03_{-0.07}^{+0.09} $ hours (3$\sigma$ error) so that it is most likely a system of interacting objects. The modulation of the signal was found with a confidence level of $>$99%. The spectrum can be described by a two thermal plasma components with X-ray flux in the 0.3--10 keV energy band of $1.77_{-0.19}^{+0.16}\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We find that the distance of the source is approximately 1 kpc thus corresponding to a luminosity $L_{X}\simeq 2\times 10^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
