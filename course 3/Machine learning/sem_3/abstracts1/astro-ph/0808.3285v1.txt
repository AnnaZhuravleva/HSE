Using archival imaging from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigate the stellar populations of the Local Group dwarf spheroidal Andromeda V - a companion satellite galaxy of M31. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) extends from above the first ascent red giant branch (RGB) tip to approximately one magnitude below the horizontal branch (HB). The steep well-defined RGB is indicative of a metal-poor system while the HB is populated predominantly redward of the RR Lyrae instability strip. Utilizing Galactic globular cluster fiducial sequences as a reference, we calculate a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.20 +/- 0.15 and a distance of (m-M)0 = 24.57 +/- 0.04 after adopting a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.16. This metal abundance places And V squarely in the absolute magnitude - metallicity diagram for dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In addition, if we attribute the entire error-corrected color spread of the RGB stars to an abundance spread, we estimate a range of ~0.5 dex in the metallicities of And V stars. Our analysis of the variable star population of And V reveals the presence of 28 potential variables. Of these, at least 10 are almost certainly RR Lyrae stars based on their time sequence photometry.
