Phenomena currently attributed to Dark Energy (DE) and Dark Matter (DM) are merely a result of the interplay between gravitational energy density, generated by the contraction of space by matter, and the energy density of the Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB), which causes space dilation. In the universe, globally, the gravitational energy density equals the CMB energy density. This leads to the derivation of the Hubble parameter, H, as a function of the scale factor, a, the time, t, the redshift, z, and to the calculation of its present value. It also leads to a new understanding of the cosmological redshift and the Euclidian nature of the universe. From H(t) we conclude that the time derivative of a is constant. This is in contrast to the consensus of the last decade. This result is supported by the fit of our theoretically derived flux from supernovae (SN) as a function of z, with observation. This flux is derived based on our H(z) that determines DL, the Luminosity Distance. We obtain this fit without any free parameters, whereas in current cosmology this fit is obtained by using the dependent free parameters Omega_M and Omega_Lambda.
