I consider an extented version of Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar theory where the action of the vector field is of a general Einstein-Ether form. This work presents the cosmological equations of this theory, both at the background and perturbed level, for scalar, vector and tensor perturbation modes. By solving the background equations in the radiation era analytically, to an excellent approximation, I construct the primordial adiabatic perturbation for a general family of scalar field kinetic functions.
