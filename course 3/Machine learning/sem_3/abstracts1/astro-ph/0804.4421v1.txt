We present results of fully self-consistent N-body simulations of the motion of four globular clusters moving in the inner region of their parent galaxy. With regard to previous simplified simulations, we confirm merging and formation of an almost steady nuclear cluster, in a slightly shorter time. The projected surface density profile shows strong similarity to that of resolved galactic nuclei. This similarity reflects also in the velocity dispersion profile which exhibits a central colder component as observed in many nucleated galaxies.
