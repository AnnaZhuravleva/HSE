We present here the prospects for the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT) detection of the signature of the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP). It decays by direct annihilation into electron-positron pairs that may be detectable in the high energy electron flux. We discuss the LAT capability for detecting the high energy (20 GeV - ~1 TeV) cosmic ray electron flux and we analyze the LAT sensitivity to detect LKP-produced electrons for various particle masses. We include an analysis of the diffusive propagation of the electrons in the galaxy.
