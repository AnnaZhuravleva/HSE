Hierarchical assembly of early-type galaxies (Es and S0s) over an extended period of time will result in mixed-generation stellar populations. Here we look for signatures of composite populations in broad-band, near-ultraviolet (2500-3400 A), high-resolution HST imaging of the cores of 12 bright early-type galaxies without obvious dust or active galactic nuclei. Near-UV imaging is a sensitive probe for the detection of younger components with ages in the range of 10 Myr to 5 Gyr. Only two galaxies have central colors (r < 0.75 r_eff) that are consistent with a single-generation population. The other ten require a composite population.
