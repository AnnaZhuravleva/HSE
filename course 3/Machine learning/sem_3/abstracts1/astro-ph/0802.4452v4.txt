We present a systematic study of different methods for the analytic calculation of ultra-high energy nuclei diffuse spectra. Nuclei propagating in the intergalactic space are photo-disintegrated and decrease their Lorentz factor due to the interaction with cosmic microwave background and extragalactic background light. We calculate the evolution trajectories in the backward time, that describe how atomic mass number $A$ and Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ change with redshift $z$. Three methods of spectra calculations are investigated and compared: {\it (i)} trajectory method, {\it(ii)} kinetic equation combined with trajectory calculations and {\it (iii)} coupled kinetic equations. We believe that these three methods exhaust at least the principal possibilities for any analytic solution of the problem. In the most straightforward method {\it(i)} only trajectory calculations are used to connect the observed nuclei flux with the production rate of primary (accelerated) nuclei $A_0$. In the second method {\it (ii)} the flux (space density) of primary nuclei, and secondary nuclei and protons are calculated with the help of kinetic equation and trajectories are used only to determine the generation rates of these nuclei. The third method {\it (iii)} consists in solving the complete set of coupled kinetic equations, written starting with primary nuclei $A_0$, then for $A_0-1$ etc down to the $A$ of interest. The solution of the preceding equation gives the generation rate for the one which follows. An important element of the calculations for all methods is the systematic use of Lorentz factor instead of energy. We consider here the interaction of nuclei only with the cosmic microwave background, this case is particularly suitable for understanding the physical results.
