In this paper we consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model whit cosmological constant, containing a stiff fluid and a classical Dirac field. The proposed cosmological scenario describes the evolution of effective dark matter and dark energy components reproducing, with the help of that effective multifluid configuration, the quintessential behavior. We find the value of the scale factor where the effective dark energy component crosses the phantom divide. The model we introduce, which can be considered as a modified $\La$CDM one, is characterized by a set of parameters which may be constrained by the astrophysical observations available up to date.
