In this paper we investigate theoretical pulsation models for the delta Scuti star 44 Tau. The star was monitored during several multisite campaigns which confirmed the presence of radial and nonradial oscillations. Moreover, its exceptionally low rotational velocity makes 44 Tau particulary interesting for an asteroseismic study. Due to the measured log g value of 3.6 +/- 0.1, main sequence and post-main sequence models have to be considered. We perform mode identification based on photometric and spectroscopic data. A nonadiabatic pulsation code is used to compute models that fit the identified modes. The influence of different opacity tables and element mixtures on the results is tested. The observed frequencies of 44 Tau can be fitted in both the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolutionary stage. Post-main sequence models are preferable as they fulfill almost all observational constraints (fit of observed frequencies, position in the HRD and instability range). These models can be obtained with normal chemical composition which is in agreement with recent spectroscopic measurements. The efficiency of envelope convection (in the framework of the mixing-length theory) is predicted to be very low in 44 Tau. We show that the results are sensitive to the choice between the OPAL and OP opacities. While the pulsation models of 44 Tau computed with OP opacities are considerably too cool and too faint, the use of OPAL opacities results in models within the expected temperature and luminosity range.
