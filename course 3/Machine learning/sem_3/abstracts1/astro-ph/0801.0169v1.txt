A widely accepted viewpoint is to consider candidates for cosmological dark matter as neutral and weakly interacting particles, as well as to consider only light elements in the pregalactic chemical composition. It is shown that stable charged leptons and quarks can exist and, hidden in elusive atoms, play the role of dark matter. The inevitable consequence of realistic scenarios with such composite atom-like dark matter is existence of significant or even dominant fraction of "atoms", binding heavy -2 charged particles and He-4 nuclei. Being alpha-particles with shielded electric charge, such atoms catalyse a new path of nuclear transformations in the period of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which result in primordial heavy elements. The arguments are given, why such scenario escapes immediate contradiction with observations and challenges search for heavy stable charged particles in cosmic rays and at accelerators.
