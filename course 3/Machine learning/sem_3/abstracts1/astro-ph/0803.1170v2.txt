Although much is known about the nature of winds from hot stars and giants and supergiants with spectral types earlier than K, there is still much to be learned regarding the mass-loss process in cool, late-type stars. We will review the current state of research, with particular reference to observations and modelling of mass-loss from giant stars in symbiotic systems.
