Various studies have established that the dynamical M/L ratios of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) tend to be at the limit or beyond the range explicable by standard stellar populations with canonical IMF. We discuss how IMF variations may account for these high M/L ratios and how observational approaches may in the future allow to discriminate between those possibilities. We also briefly discuss the possibility of dark matter in UCDs.
