We searched for and detected stellar streams or moving groups in the solar neighbourhood, using the data provided by the 1st RAVE public data release. This analysis is based on distances to RAVE stars estimated from a color-magnitude relation that was calibrated on Hipparcos stars. Our final sample consists of 7015 stars selected to be within 500 pc of the Sun and to have distance errors better than 25%. Together with radial velocities from RAVE and proper motions from various data bases, there are estimates for all 6 phase-space coordinates of the stars in the sample. We characterize the orbits of these stars through suitable proxies for their angular momentum and eccentricity, and compare the observed distribution to the expectations from a smooth distribution. On this basis we identify at least four "phase space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in the Solar neighbourhood. We estimate the statistical significance of these overdensities by Monte Carlo simulations. Three of them have been identified previously: the Sirius and Hercules moving group and a stream found independently in 2006 by Arifyanto and Fuchs and Helmi et al. In addition, we have found a new stream candidate on a quite radial orbit, suggesting an origin external to the Milky Way's disk. Also, there is evidence for the Arcturus stream and the Hyades-Pleiades moving group in the sample. This analysis, using only a minute fraction of the final RAVE data set, shows the power of this experiment to probe the phase-space substructure of stars around the Sun.
