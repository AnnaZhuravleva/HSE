We present a method to simulate color, 3-dimensional images taken with a space-based observatory by building off of the established shapelets pipeline. The simulated galaxies exhibit complex morphologies, which are realistically correlated between, and include, known redshifts. The simulations are created using galaxies from the 4 optical and near-infrared bands (B, V, i and z) of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) as a basis set to model morphologies and redshift. We include observational effects such as sky noise and pixelization and can add astronomical signals of interest such as weak gravitational lensing. The realism of the simulations is demonstrated by comparing their morphologies to the original UDF galaxies and by comparing their distribution of ellipticities as a function of redshift and magnitude to wider HST COSMOS data. These simulations have already been useful for calibrating multicolor image analysis techniques and for better optimizing the design of proposed space telescopes.
