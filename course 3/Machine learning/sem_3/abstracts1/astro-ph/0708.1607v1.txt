aims: We determine the solar abundance of phosphorus using co5bold 3D hydrodynamic model atmospheres. method: High resolution, high signal-to-noise solar spectra of the PI lines of Multiplet 1 at 1051-1068 nm are compared to line formation computations performed on a co5bold solar model atmosphere. results: We find A(P)=5.46+- 0.04, in good agreement with previous analysis based on 1D model atmospheres, due to the fact that the PI lines of Mult. 1 are little affected by 3D effects. We cannot confirm an earlier claim by other authors of a downward revision of the solar P abundance by 0.1 dex employing a 3D model atmosphere. Concerning other stars, we found modest (<0.1 dex) 3D abundance corrections for P among four F dwarf model atmospheres of different metallicity, being largest at lowest metallicity. conclusions: We conclude that 3D abundance corrections are generally rather small for the PI lines studied in this work. They are marginally relevant for metal-poor stars, but may be neglected in the Sun.
