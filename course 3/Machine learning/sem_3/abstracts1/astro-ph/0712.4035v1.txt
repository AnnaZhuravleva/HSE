Analysis of the polarization of light from supernovae can reveal the shape and distribution of matter ejected from exploding stars. Here we review the young field of Type Ia supernova spectropolarimetry and critically evaluate, and place in context, the recent work of Wang et al. (2007, Science, 315, 212) in which a suggestive trend is found in data from 17 Type Ia events.
