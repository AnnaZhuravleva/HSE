Proceeded from the gravitation equations proposed by one of authors it was argued in a previous paper that there can exist supermassive compact configurations of degenerated Fermi-gas without events horizon. In the present paper we consider the stability of these objects by method like the one used in the theory of stellar structure. It is shown that the configurations with an adiabatic equation of state with the power 4/3 are stable.
