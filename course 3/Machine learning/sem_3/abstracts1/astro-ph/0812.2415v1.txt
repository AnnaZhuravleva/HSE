Our observations of the first reported outburst of SDSS J081321.91+452809.4 during 2008 April show that this cataclysmic variable is a dwarf nova. The outburst amplitude was at least 3.1 magnitudes and the outburst appears to have been rather short-lived at around 3 days with a rapid decline to quiescence of 0.73 mag/day.
