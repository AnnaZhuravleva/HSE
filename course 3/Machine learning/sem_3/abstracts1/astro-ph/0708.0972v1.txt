Gamma- and X-rays resulting from radioactive decays provide a potentially powerful tool to investigate the explosion physics of supernovae, since the distribution and the amount of radioactive isotopes are strongly dependent on properties of the explosion. In this paper, expected features of these high energy emissions are presented for bipolar jet-induced explosion models, which are recently favored for very energetic supernovae and even for typical Type Ib/c supernovae. It is shown that combination of various observations, i.e., line-to-continuum ratio, photoelectric absorption cut-off energy, line profiles and luminosities, allows the unique determination of the explosion energy, the amount of radioactive 56Ni, the explosion geometry, and even the viewing orientation.
