We describe a new technique for heterodyne spectroscopy, which we call Least-Squares Frequency Switching, or LSFS. This technique avoids the need for a traditional reference spectrum, which--when combined with the on-source spectrum--introduces both noise and systematic artifacts such as ``baseline wiggles''. In contrast, LSFS derives the spectrum directly, and in addition the instrumental gain profile. The resulting spectrum retains nearly the full theoretical sensitivity and introduces no systematic artifacts.   Here we discuss mathematical details of the technique and use numerical experiments to explore optimum observing schemas. We outline a modification suitable for computationally difficult cases as the number of spectral channels grows beyond several thousand. We illustrate the method with three real-life examples. In one of practical interest, we created a large contiguous bandwidth aligning three smaller bandwidths end-to-end; radio astronomers are often faced with the need for a larger contiguous bandwidth than is provided with the available correlator.
