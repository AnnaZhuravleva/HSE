We investigate the population of z=3 damped Lyman alpha absorbers (DLAs) in a recent series of high resolution galaxy formation simulations. The simulations are of interest because they form at z=0 some of the most realistic disk galaxies to date. No free parameters are available in our study: these have been fixed by physical and z=0 observational constraints, and thus our study provides a genuine consistency test. The precise role of DLAs in galaxy formation remains in debate, but they provide a number of strong constraints on the nature of our simulated bound systems at z=3 because of their coupled information on neutral H I densities, kinematics, metallicity and estimates of star formation activity.   Our results, without any parameter-tuning, closely match the observed incidence rate and column density distributions of DLAs. Our simulations are the first to reproduce the distribution of metallicities (with a median of Z_{DLA} = Z_{solar}/20) without invoking observationally unsupported mechanisms such as dust biasing. This is especially encouraging given that these simulations have previously been shown to have a realistic 0<z<2 stellar mass-metallicity relation. Additionally, we see a strong positive correlation between sightline metallicity and low-ion velocity width, the normalization and slope of which comes close to matching recent observational results. However, we somewhat underestimate the number of observed high velocity width systems; the severity of this disagreement is comparable to other recent DLA focused studies. By z=0 the majority of the z=3 neutral gas forming the DLAs has been converted into stars, in agreement with rough physical expectations.   [Abridged]
