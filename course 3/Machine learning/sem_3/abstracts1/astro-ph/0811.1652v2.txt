Possible effects of magnetic fields in core collapse supernovae rely on an efficient amplification of the weak pre-collapse fields. It has been suggested that the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) leads to rapid field growth. Although MRI studies exist for accretion discs, the application of their results to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the physics of supernova cores is substantially different from that of accretion discs. We address the problem of growth and saturation of the MRI by means of semi-global simulations, which combine elements of global and local simulations by taking the presence of global background gradients into account and using a local computational grid. We analyze the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify different regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented by simulations, where we consider a local computational box rotating at sub-Keplerian velocity, and where we allow for a radial entropy gradient. We identify six regimes of the MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and angular velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the instability criteria and growth rates for all relevant regimes. The MRI grows exponentially within milliseconds the flow and magnetic field geometries being dominated by channel flows. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are disrupted by resistive instabilities (due to finite numerical conductivity), and MHD turbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of the resistive instabilities, we deduce scaling laws for the termination amplitude of the MRI which agree well with our numerical models. We determine the dependence of the development of coherent flow structures in the saturated state on the aspect ratio of the simulation boxes. [abridged]
