We evaluate the generation of magnetosonic waves in differentially rotating magnetized plasma. Differential rotation leads to an increase of the azimuthal field by winding up the poloidal field lines into the toroidal field lines. An amplification of weak seed perturbations is considered in this time-dependent background state. It is shown that seed perturbations can be amplified by several orders of magnitude in a differentially rotating flow. The only necessary condition for this amplification is the presence of a non-vanishing component of the magnetic field in the direction of the angular velocity gradient.
