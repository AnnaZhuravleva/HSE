VO-Neural is the natural evolution of the Astroneural project which was started in 1994 with the aim to implement a suite of neural tools for data mining in astronomical massive data sets. At a difference with its ancestor, which was implemented under Matlab, VO-Neural is written in C++, object oriented, and it is specifically tailored to work in distributed computing architectures. We discuss the current status of implementation of VO-Neural, present an application to the classification of Active Galactic Nuclei, and outline the ongoing work to improve the functionalities of the package.
