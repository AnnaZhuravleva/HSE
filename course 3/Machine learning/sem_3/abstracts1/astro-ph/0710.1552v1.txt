The accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 may be a transition object between accreting X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. We have constrained the thermal radiation from its surface through XMM-Newton X-ray observations, providing strong evidence for neutrino cooling processes from the neutron star core. We have also undertaken simultaneous X-ray and optical (Gemini) observations, shedding light on whether the strong heating of the companion star in quiescence may be due to X-ray irradiation, or to a radio pulsar turning on when accretion stops.
