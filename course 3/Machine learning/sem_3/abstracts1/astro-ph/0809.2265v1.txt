- Aims: Gas cooling in the centre of massive galaxy clusters is believed to feed the most powerful active galactic nuclei in the Universe. How often clusters at high redshift show such cool cores has still to be explored by current and upcoming X-ray telescopes. - Methods: We correlated extended X-ray emissions from the second XMM-Newton source catalogue with SDSS data to particularly identify distant clusters. 2XMM J100451.6+411627 is a candidate luminous enough to obtain its redshift and temperature from the X-ray spectrum. We also determine the surface luminosity profile and estimate the temperature in a few spherical bins. The analysis is complemented by a Subaru g'r'i'-image. - Results: 2XMM J100451.6+411627 has a redshift a redshift of z=0.82+-0.02 and a temperature of k_BT = 4.2+-0.4 keV. A double-beta profile fit yields a highly concentrated surface brightness, c_SB = 0.32, i.e. the clusters hosts very likely a strong cool core. This is supported by the relaxed morphology of the cluster and an central temperature decrease.
