The new L-band 7-feed-array at the 100-m telescope in Effelsberg will be used to perform an unbiased fully sampled HI survey of the entire northern hemisphere observing the galactic and extragalactic sky using simultaneously two different backends.   The survey will be extremely valuable for a broad range of research topics: study of the low-mass end of the HI mass function (HIMF) in the local volume, environmental and evolutionary effects (as seen in the HIMF), the search for galaxies near low-redshift Lyman-alpha absorbers, and analysis of multiphase and extraplanar gas, HI shells, and ultra-compact high-velocity-clouds.
