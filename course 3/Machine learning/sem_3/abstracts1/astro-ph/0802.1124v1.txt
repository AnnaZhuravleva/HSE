We explore aspects of Cosmological Nucleosynthesis in an FRW universe in which the scale factor evolves linearly with time: $a(t) \sim t$. A high Lepton number density during the period when significant nucleosynthesis takes place would lead to a dominant screening of the Coulomb potential of colliding nucleii. This would lead to a significant enhancement of nucleosynthesis rates. We demonstrate how adequate amount of $^4He$ and a collataral metallicity, close to the lowest metallicity observed in metal poor Pop II stars and clouds, can be produced with such an evolution.
