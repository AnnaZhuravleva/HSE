We present a star cluster population study in the interacting galaxy system M51 based on HST ACS BVI mosaic images taken by the Hubble Heritage Team to commemorate the HST's 15th anniversary. We have found and classified star clusters in M51 using SExtractor and visual inspection. We have derived the photometry, size, and age of the clusters. It is found that the companion SB0 galaxy NGC 5195 harbors about 50 faint fuzzy clusters and that the age distribution of star clusters appears to be correlated with the epochs of dynamical events in M51 system.
