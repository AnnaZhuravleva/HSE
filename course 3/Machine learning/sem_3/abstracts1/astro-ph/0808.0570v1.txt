We examine the origin of photometrical properties of N-body merger remnants from the perpective of their orbital content. We show that disc mergers alone are unlikely to form a boxy-discy dichotomy in isophotal shape, because of the survival of disc-like orbits even in violent mergers. The shape of the different orbit families can vary strongly, depending on how violent the merger was. Minor axis tubes can become boxy and box orbits can be round. However, for edge-on projections isophotal shape, orbital content and line-of-sight velocity are well connected.
