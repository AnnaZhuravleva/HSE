It is shown herein that planets with eccentric orbits are more likely to transit than circularly orbiting planets with the same semimajor axis by a factor of (1-e^2)^{-1}. If the orbital parameters of discovered transiting planets are known, as from follow-up radial velocity observations, then the transit-detected planet population is easily debiased of this effect. The duration of a planet's transit depends upon of its eccentricity and longitude of periastron; transits near periastron are shorter, and those near apoastron last longer, for a given impact parameter. If fitting for the stellar radius with the other transit parameters, this effect causes a systematic error in the resulting measurements. If the stellar radius is instead held fixed at a value measured independently, then it is possible to place a lower limit on the planet's eccentricity using photometry alone. Orbital accelerations cause a difference in the planet's ingress and egress durations that lead to an asymmetry in the transit lightcurve that could be used along with the transit velocity measurement to uniquely measure the planet's eccentricity and longitude of periapsis. However, the effect is too small to be measured with current technology. The habitability of transiting terrestrial planets found by Kepler depends on those planets' orbital eccentricities. While Kepler will be able to place lower limits on those planets' orbital eccentricity, the actual value for any given planet will likely remain unknown.
