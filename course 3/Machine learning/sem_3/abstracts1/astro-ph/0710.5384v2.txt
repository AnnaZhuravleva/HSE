We investigate the structure of protoneutron stars (PNS) formed by hadronic and quark matter in $\beta$-equilibrium described by appropriate equations of state (EOS). For the hadronic matter, we use a finite temperature EOS based on the Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone many-body theory, with realistic two- and three-body forces. For the quark sector, we employ the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the maximum allowed masses are comprised in a narrow range around 1.8 solar masses, with a slight dependence on the temperature. Metastable hybrid protoneutron stars are not found.
