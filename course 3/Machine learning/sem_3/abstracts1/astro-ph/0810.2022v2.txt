We analyze the effects of capture of dark matter (DM) particles, with successive annihilations, predicted in the minimal walking technicolor model (MWT) by the Sun and the Earth. We show that the Super-Kamiokande (SK) upper limit on excessive muon flux disfavors the mass interval between 100-200 GeV for MWT DM with a suppressed Standard Model interaction (due to a mixing angle), and the mass interval between 0-1500 GeV for MWT DM without such suppression, upon making the standard assumption about the value of the local DM distribution. In the first case, the exclusion interval is found to be very sensitive to the DM distribution parameters and can vanish at the extreme of the acceptable values.
