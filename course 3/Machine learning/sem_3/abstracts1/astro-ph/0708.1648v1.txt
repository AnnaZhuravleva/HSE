We aim to derive the electron temperature Te in the gas of metal-rich star-forming galaxies, which can be obtained from their ratios of auroral lines [O II]7320,7330 to nebular lines [O II]3727, in order to establish a more robust mass-metallicity relationship, and compare the Te-based (O/H) abundances with those from empirical strong-line calibrations, such as R23. We obtained 27 spectra by stacking the spectra of several hundred (even several thousand) star-forming galaxies selected from the SDSS-DR4 in each of the 27 stellar mass bins from log(M*) ~8.0 to 10.6 (logMsun). This "stack" method sufficiently improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the auroral lines [O II]7320,7330, which allow us to reliably obtain the electron temperature t2 in the low ionization region from the ratio of [O II]7320,7330 to [O II]3727, then t3 in the high ionization region from t2 by using a relation, and then the direct (O/H) abundances from Te. The results show that the empirical R23 method will overestimate the log(O/H) by 0.2 to 0.6 dex for these moderate metal-rich galaxies. The new metal-mass relationship of the galaxies with moderate metallicities is fitted by a linear fit (12+log(O/H) =6.223+0.231*logM*) confirming that empirical methods significantly overestimate (O/H). We also derived their (N/O) abundance ratios on the basis of the Te method, which are consistent with the combination of the primary and secondary components of nitrogen. For actual use, we re-derive the relations of 12+log(O/H)(Bay) vs. logM* and 12+log(O/H)(Bay) vs. logR23 from the SDSS-DR4 data, which are a bit different from those derived from DR2.
