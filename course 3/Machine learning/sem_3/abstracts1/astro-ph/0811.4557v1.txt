The aim of this work is to make available unpublished non-Fe+ emission line fluxes from optical spectra of the symbiotic nova RR Tel which were taken in 2000, and to compare them with fluxes of the same lines from spectra taken in 1996. After leaving out blends and misidentifications, as well as the unreliable far-red and violet lines, we present the log (F2000/F1996) flux ratios for identified non-Fe+ lines. Mean values of log (F2000/F1996) for different ionization potential ranges of the ions producing the lines are shown separately for the permitted and forbidden lines. All means show fading, which is larger in the lowest range of ionization potential. Provisional interpretations are suggested. We also measured the values of FWHM in 2000; the previously known decrease with time of FWHM of lines due to the same ion has continued.
