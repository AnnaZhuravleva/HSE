Rate coefficients for rotational transitions in H_2 induced by H_2 impact are presented. Extensive quantum mechanical coupled-channel calculations based on a recently published (H_2)_2 potential energy surface were performed. The potential energy surface used here is presumed to be more reliable than surfaces used in previous work. Rotational transition cross sections with initial levels J <= 8 were computed for collision energies ranging between 0.0001 and 2.5 eV, and the corresponding rate coefficients were calculated for the temperature range 2 < T <10,000 K. In general, agreement with earlier calculations, which were limited to 100-6000 K, is good though discrepancies are found at the lowest and highest temperatures. Low-density-limit cooling functions due to para- and ortho-H_2 collisions are obtained from the collisional rate coefficients. Implications of the new results for non-thermal H_2 rotational distributions in molecular regions are also investigated.
