The WD+MS channel of the single-degenerate scenario is currently favourable for progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Incorporating the results of detailed binary evolution calculations for this channel into the latest version of a binary population synthesis code, I obtained the distributions of many properties of the companion stars at the moment of SN explosion. The properties can be verified by future observations.
