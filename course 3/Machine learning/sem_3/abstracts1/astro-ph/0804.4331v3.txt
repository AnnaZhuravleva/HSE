We revisit a weak gravitational lensing problem by constructing a setup which describes the actual system as accurately as possible and solving the null geodesic equations. Details are given for the case of a Universe driven only by a cosmological constant, \Lambda, which confirm the conventional results: The conventional lensing analysis is correct as it is, without any need for correction of O(\Lambda). We also treat the cases of the lensing in generic FRW backgrounds.
