(Abridged) S147 is a large faint shell-type supernova remnant (SNR). Its remarkable spectral break at cm-wavelengths is an important physical property to characterize the SNR evolution. However, the spectral break is based on radio observations with limited precision. We made new radio continuum and polarization observations of S147 at 11cm and at 6cm with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the Urumqi 25-m telescope, respectively. These new data were combined with published lower frequency data from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and very high frequency data from WMAP to investigate the spectral turnover and polarization properties of S147. S147 consists of numerous filaments embedded in diffuse emission. We found that the integrated flux densities of S147 are 34.8+/-4.0 Jy at 11cm and 15.4+/-3.0Jy at 6cm. These new measurements confirm the known spectral turnover at ~1.5GHz, which can be entirely attributed to the diffuse emission component. The spectral index above the turnover is -1.35+/-0.20. The filamentary emission component has a constant spectral index over the entire wavelength range up to 40.7GHz of -0.35+/-0.15. The weak polarized emission of S147 is at the same level as the ambient diffuse Galactic polarization. The rotation measure of the eastern filamentary shell is about -70 rad/m2. The filamentary and diffuse emission components of S147 have different physical properties, which make S147 outstanding among shell type SNRs.The weak polarization of S147 at 11cm and at 6cm can be attributed to a section of the S147 shell showing a tangential magnetic field direction.
