We have studied the $\nu + \bar{\nu} \to e^+ + e^- $ energy deposition rate in a rotating compact star. This reaction is important for the study of gamma ray bursts. The General Relativistic (GR) effects on the energy deposition rate have been incorporated. We find that the efficiency of the process is larger for a rotating star. The total energy deposition rate increases by more than an order of magnitude due to rotation. The dependence of this energy deposition rate on the deformation parameter of the star has also been discussed.
