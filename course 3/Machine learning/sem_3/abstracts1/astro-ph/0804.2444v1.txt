This report summarizes the discussions in the Session 1 and Session 3 groups which met to discuss the questions: ``What Physical Processes Drive the Multiphase Interstellar Medium in the Local Bubble?'', and ``What are the Energy and Pressure Balances in the Local Bubble?'' Most of our understanding of the Local Bubble has come from soft X-ray observations, but recent appreciation of the importance of solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) reactions has shown that the heliosphere produces some fraction of the soft X-rays that were previously ascribed to the Local Bubble. Some astronomers suggest that the SWCX X-rays rather than Local Bubble emission could explain most of the locally produced X-rays. Our discussions, therefore, also included a debate concerning the Local Bubble's existence.
