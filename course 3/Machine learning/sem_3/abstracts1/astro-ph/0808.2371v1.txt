Temperature, density and abundance profiles of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) are important diagnostics of the complex interactions of gravitational and feedback processes in the cores of galaxy clusters. Deprojection of X-ray data by methods such as projct, which are model dependent, can produce large and unphysical oscillating temperature profiles. Here we validate a deprojection routine, Direct Spectral Deprojection (DSDeproj; Sanders & Fabian 2007), showing that it solves some of the issues inherent to model-dependent deprojection routines. DSDeproj is a model-independent approach, assuming only spherical symmetry, which subtracts projected spectra from each successive annulus to produce a set of deprojected spectra.
