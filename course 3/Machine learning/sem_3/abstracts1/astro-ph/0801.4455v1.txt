A variety of magnetohydrodynamic mechanisms that may play a role in magnetic, chemically peculiar (mCP) stars is reviewed. These involve dynamo mechanisms in laminar flows as well as turbulent environments, and magnetic instabilities of poloidal and toroidal fields as well as combinations of the two. While the proto-stellar phase makes the survival of primordial fields difficult, the variety of magnetic field configurations on mCP stars may be an indication for that they are instability remnants, but there is no process which is clearly superior in explaining the strong fields.
