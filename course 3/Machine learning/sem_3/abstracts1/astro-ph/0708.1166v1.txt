We present results from a wide-field imaging study of the globular cluster (GC) systems of a sample of edge-on, Sb-Sc spiral galaxies ~7-20 Mpc away. This study is part of a larger survey of the ensemble properties of the GC populations of giant galaxies. We imaged the galaxies in BVR filters with large-format CCD detectors on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope, to projected radii of ~20-40 kpc. For four galaxies (NGC 2683, NGC 3556, NGC 4157, and NGC 7331), we quantify the radial distributions of the GC systems and estimate the total number, luminosity- and mass-normalized specific frequencies (S_N and T), and blue (metal-poor) fraction of GCs. A fifth galaxy (NGC 3044) was apparently too distant for us to have detected its GC system. Our S_N for NGC 2683 is 2.5 times smaller than the previously-published value, likely due in part to reduced contamination from non-GCs. For the spiral galaxies analyzed for the survey to date, the average number of GCs is 170+/-40 and the weighted mean values of S_N and T are 0.8+/-0.2 and 1.4+/-0.3. We use the survey data to derive a relationship between radial exent of the GC system and host galaxy mass over a factor of 20 in mass. Finally, we confirm the trend, identified in previous survey papers, of increasing specific frequency of metal-poor GCs with increasing galaxy mass. We compare the data with predictions from a simple model and show that carefully quantifying the numbers of metal-poor GCs in galaxies can constrain the formation redshifts of the GCs and their host galaxies.
