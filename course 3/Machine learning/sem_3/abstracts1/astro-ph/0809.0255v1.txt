Starting from a complete sample of type I AGN observed by INTEGRAL in the 20-40 keV band, we have selected a set of 8 AGN which can be classified as radio loud objects according to their 1.4 GHz power density, radio to hard X-ray flux flux density ratio and radio morphology. The sample contains 6 Broad Line Radio Galaxies and 2 candidate ones. Most of the objects in our sample display a double lobe morphology, both on small and large scales. For all the objects, we present broad-band (1-110 keV) spectral analysis using INTEGRAL observations together with archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, Swift/XRT and Swift/BAT data. We constrain the primary continuum (photon index and cut-off energy), intrinsic absorption and reprocessing features (iron line and reflection) in most of the objects. The sources analysed here show remarkable similarities to radio quiet type 1 AGN with respect to most of the parameters analysed; we only find marginal evidence for weaker reprocessing features in our objects compared to their radio quiet counterparts. Similarly we do not find any correlation between the spectral parameters studied and the source core dominance or radio to 20-100 keV flux density ratios, suggesting that what makes our objects radio loud has no effect on their high energy characteristics.
