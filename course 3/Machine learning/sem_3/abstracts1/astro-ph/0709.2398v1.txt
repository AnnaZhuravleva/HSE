M87 is the first extragalactic source detected in the TeV range that is not a blazar. The large scale jet of M87 is not aligned with the line of sight. Modification of standard emission models of TeV blazars appears necessary to account for the gamma-ray observations made by H.E.S.S. despite this misalignment.   We present a new multi-blob synchrotron self-Compton model that deals explicitly with large viewing angles and moderate values of the Lorentz factor inferred from MHD simulations of jet formation.
