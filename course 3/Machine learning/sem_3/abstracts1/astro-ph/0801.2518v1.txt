We present GOSSIP (Galaxy Observed-Simulated SED Interactive Program), a new tool developed to perform SED fitting in a simple, user friendly and efficient way. GOSSIP automatically builds-up the observed SED of an object (or a large sample of objects) combining magnitudes in different bands and eventually a spectrum; then it performs a chi-square minimization fitting procedure versus a set of synthetic models. The fitting results are used to estimate a number of physical parameters like the Star Formation History, absolute magnitudes, stellar mass and their Probability Distribution Functions. User defined models can be used, but GOSSIP is also able to load models produced by the most commonly used synthesis population codes. GOSSIP can be used interactively with other visualization tools using the PLASTIC protocol for communications. Moreover, since it has been developed with large data sets applications in mind, it will be extended to operate within the Virtual Observatory framework. GOSSIP is distributed to the astronomical community from the PANDORA group web site (http://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/gossip.html)
