Spitzer images resolve the debris disk around \gamma Ophiuchi at both 24 and 70 um. The resolved images suggest a disk radius of ~520 AU at 70 um and >=260 AU at 24 um. The images, along with a consistent fit to the spectral energy distribution of the disk from 20 to 350 um, show that the primary disk structure is inclined by ~50 degree from the plane of the sky at a position angle of 55+/-2 degree. Among a group of twelve debris disks that have similar host star spectral types, ages and infrared fractional luminosities, the observed sizes in the infrared and color temperatures indicate that evolution of the debris disks is influenced by multiple parameters in addition to the proto-planetary disk initial mass.
