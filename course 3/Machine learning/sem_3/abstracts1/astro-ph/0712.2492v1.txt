In this paper, we present an overview of ASTROD (Astrodynamical Space Test of Relativity using Optical Devices) and ASTROD I mission concepts and studies. The missions employ deep-space laser ranging using drag-free spacecraft to map the gravitational field in the solar-system. The solar-system gravitational field is determined by three factors: the dynamic distribution of matter in the solar system; the dynamic distribution of matter outside the solar system (galactic, cosmological, etc.) and gravitational waves propagating through the solar system. Different relativistic theories of gravity make different predictions of the solar-system gravitational field. Hence, precise measurements of the solar-system gravitational field test all these. The tests and observations include: (i) a precise determination of the relativistic parameters beta and gamma with 3-5 orders of magnitude improvement over previous measurements; (ii) a 1-2 order of magnitude improvement in the measurement of G-dot; (iii) a precise determination of any anomalous, constant acceleration Aa directed towards the Sun; (iv) a measurement of solar angular momentum via the Lense-Thirring effect; (v) the detection of solar g-mode oscillations via their changing gravity field, thus, providing a new eye to see inside the Sun; (vi) precise determination of the planetary orbit elements and masses; (viii) better determination of the orbits and masses of major asteroids; (ix) detection and observation of gravitational waves from massive black holes and galactic binary stars in the frequency range 0.05 mHz to 5 mHz; and (x) exploring background gravitational-waves.
