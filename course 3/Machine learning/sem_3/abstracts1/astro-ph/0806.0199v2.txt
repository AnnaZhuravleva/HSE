A two-dimensional (2D) shock-rest-frame model for particle simulations is developed. Then full kinetic dynamics of a perpendicular collisionless shock is examined by means of a 2D full particle simulation. We found that in the 2D simulation there are fewer nonthermal electrons due to surfing acceleration which was seen in the previous 1D simulations of a high Mach number perpendicular shock in a low-beta and weakly magnetized plasma. This is because the particle motion along the ambient magnetic field disturbs the formation of coherent electrostatic solitary structures which is necessary for electron surfing acceleration.
