During the operational life of BeppoSax, the Wide Field Camera observations covered almost the full sky at different epochs. The energy coverage, wide field of view and imaging capabilities share many commonalities with IBIS, the gamma-ray telescope onboard INTEGRAL satellite. We mosaicked all the available single pointing WFC observation images and then we searched the map for persistent and transient sources as has been done for the IBIS survey. This work represents the first unbiased source list compilation produced in this way from the overall WFC data set.
