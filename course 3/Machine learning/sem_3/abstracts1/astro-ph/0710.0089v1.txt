The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) is an array of four 12m diameter Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT) telescopes operated at the base of Mt. Hopkins in southern Arizona. The four-telescope experiment started operation in April, 2007. GeV and TeV gamma-ray observations of blazars can be used to probe the structure and composition of their jets, and to contribute to our understanding of how supermassive black holes accrete matter. In this contribution, we present first VERITAS blazar results obtained with three and four telescopes.
