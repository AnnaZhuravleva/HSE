We present the first measurements of surface differential rotation on a pre-main sequence binary system. Using intensity (Stokes I) and circularly polarised (Stokes V) timeseries spectra, taken over eleven nights at the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT), we incorporate a solar-like differential rotation law into the surface imaging process. We find that both components of the young, 18 Myr, HD 155555 (V824 Ara, G5IV + K0IV) binary system show significant differential rotation. The equator-pole laptimes as determined from the intensity spectra are 80 days for the primary star and 163 days for the secondary. Similarly for the magnetic spectra we obtain equator-pole laptimes of 44 and 71 days respectively, showing that the shearing timescale of magnetic regions is approximately half that found for stellar spots. Both components are therefore found to have rates of differential rotation similar to those of the same spectral type main sequence single stars. The results for HD 155555 are therefore in contrast to those found in other, more evolved, binary systems where negligible or weak differential rotation has been discovered. We discuss two possible explanations for this; firstly that at the age of HD 155555 binary tidal forces have not yet had time to suppress differential rotation, secondly that the weak differential rotation previously observed on evolved binaries is a consequence of their large convection zone depths. We suggest that the latter is the more likely solution and show that both temperature and convection zone depth (from evolutionary models) are good predictors of differential rotation strength. Finally, we also examine the possible consequences of the measured differential rotation on the interaction of binary star coronae.
