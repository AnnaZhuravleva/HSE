We study the consequences of limited recoil sense reconstruction on the number of events required to reject isotropy and detect a WIMP signal using a directional detector. For a constant probability of determining the sense correctly, 3-d read-out and zero background, we find that as the probability is decreased from 1.0 to 0.75 the number of events required to reject isotropy using the mean angle statistic is increased by a factor of a few. As the probability is decreased further the number of events required using this statistic increases sharply, and in fact isotropy can be rejected more easily by discarding the sense information and using axial statistics. This however requires an order of magnitude more events than vectorial data with perfect sense determination. We also consider energy dependent probabilities of correctly measuring the sense, 2-d read-out and non-zero background. Our main conclusion regarding the sense determination is that correctly determining the sense of the abundant, but less anisotropic, low energy recoils is most important for minimising the number of events required.
