The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm is complemented with a magnetized contribution whose effects on the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) are assessed by means of a dedicated numerical approach. The accuracy on the temperature and polarization correlations stems from the inclusion of the large-scale magnetic fields both at the level of the initial conditions and at the level of the Einstein-Boltzmann hierarchy which is consistently embedded in a generalized magnetohydrodynamical framework. Examples of the calculations of the temperature and polarization angular power spectra are illustrated and discussed. The reported results and the described numerical tools set the ground for a consistent inclusion of a magnetized contribution in current strategies of cosmological parameter estimation.
