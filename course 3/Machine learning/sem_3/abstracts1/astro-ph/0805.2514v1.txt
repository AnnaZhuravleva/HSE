Neutrinos produced in gamma-ray bursters (GRBers) may provide a unique probe for the physics of these extreme astrophysical systems. Here we discuss neutrino production in inelastic neutron-proton collisions within the relativistic outflows associated with GRBers. We consider both the widely used fireball model and a recently proposed magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model for the GRB outflow.
