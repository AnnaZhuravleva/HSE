We report on the wide band spectra of SN 1006 as observed by Suzaku. Thermal and nonthermal emission are successfully resolved thanks to the excellent spectral response of Suzaku's X-ray CCD XIS. The nonthermal emission cannot be reproduced by a simple power-law model but needs a roll-off at 5.7$\times 10^{16}$ Hz = 0.23 keV. The roll-off frequency is significantly higher in the northeastern rim than in the southwestern rim. We also have placed the most stringent upper limit of the flux above 10 keV using the Hard X-ray Detector.
