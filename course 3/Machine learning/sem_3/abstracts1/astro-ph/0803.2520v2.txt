This paper reports on an XMM-Newton observation of the Seyfert 1 Galaxy Mrk 335 performed as a Target of Opportunity when the source was in an unusually low flux state. The low level of continuum emission unveiled an underlying line-rich soft X-ray spectrum, which can be studied with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer. The emission features have been analysed at high resolution with unprecedented detail for this source. Line ratios diagnostic from H-like and He-like ions indicates that the line emission arises in X-ray photoionised plasma. Extensive simulations have been performed with the CLOUDY photoionisation code. From the comparison of the expected and observed line intensities the physical properties of the line emitting material were derived. Because of the degeneracy in the ionisation parameter, a number of different solutions in terms of electron density and column density of the gas are consistent with the spectral diagnostics. This prevents us from determining uniquely the properties of the plasma; however, the location(s) of the X-ray photoionised gas can be constrained to be within 0.06 pc (outer boundary). This limit places the X-ray line emitting gas at the inner edge of the material where the broad optical lines are produced (Broad Line Region).
