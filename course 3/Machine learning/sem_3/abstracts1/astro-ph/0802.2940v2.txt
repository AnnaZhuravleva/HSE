We use the formalism of Szapudi(2004} to derive full explicit expressions for the linear two-point correlation function, including redshift space distortions and large angle effects. We take into account a non-perturbative geometric term in the Jacobian, which is still linear in terms of the dynamics. This term had been identified previously (Kaiser 1987,Hamilton and Culhane 1996), but has been neglected in all subsequent explicit calculations of the linear redshift space two-point correlation function. Our results represent a significant correction to previous explicit expressions and are in excellent agreement with our measurements in the Hubble Volume Simulation.
