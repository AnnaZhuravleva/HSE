Higher-order gravity models have been recently the subject of much attention in the context of cosmic acceleration. These models are derived by adding various curvature invariants to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Several studies showed that these models can have late-time self-acceleration and could, in some cases, fit various observational constraints. In view of the infinite spectrum of invariants that could be built from curvature tensors, we propose here a method based on minimal sets of independent invariants as a possible route for a systematic approach to these models. We explore a connection made between theorems on bases in invariants theory in relativity and higher-order cosmological models. A dynamical system analysis is performed and some models with accelerating attractors are discussed. The asymptotic behavior of the models is also studied using analytical calculations.
