Available proper motion measurements of Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxies are used to calculate their orbital poles and projected uncertainties. These are compared to a set of recent cold dark-matter (CDM) simulations, tailored specifically to solve the MW satellite problem. We show that the CDM satellite orbital poles are fully consistent with being drawn from a random distribution, while the MW satellite orbital poles indicate that the disc-of-satellites of the Milky Way is rotationally supported. Furthermore, the bootstrapping analysis of the spatial distribution of theoretical CDM satellites also shows that they are consistent with being randomly drawn. The theoretical CDM satellite population thus shows a significantly different orbital and spatial distribution than the MW satellites, most probably indicating that the majority of the latter are of tidal origin rather than being DM dominated sub-structures. A statistic is presented that can be used to test a possible correlation of satellite galaxy orbits with their spatial distribution.
