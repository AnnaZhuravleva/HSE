In their Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 121302 (2004)] (also [Astron. Astrophys. 417, 853 (2004)]), Srianand et al. analysed optical spectra of heavy-element species in 23 absorption systems along background quasar sight-lines, reporting limits on relative variations in the fine-structure constant: da/a=(-0.06+/-0.06) x 10^{-5}. Here we demonstrate basic flaws in their analysis, using the same data and absorption profile fits, which led to spurious values of da/a and significantly underestimated uncertainties. We conclude that these data and fits offer no stringent test of previous evidence for a varying alpha.   In their Reply (arXiv:0711.1742) to this Comment, Srianand et al. state or argue several points regarding their original analysis and our new analysis. We discuss these points here, dismissing all of them because they are demonstrably incorrect or because they rely on a flawed application of simple statistical arguments.
