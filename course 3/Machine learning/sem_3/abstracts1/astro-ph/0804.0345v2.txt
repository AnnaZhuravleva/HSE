Context: We study the kappa-mechanism that excites radial oscillations in Cepheid variables.   Aims: We address the mode couplings that manages the nonlinear saturation of the instability in direct numerical simulations (DNS).   Methods: We project the DNS fields onto an acoustic subspace built from the regular and adjoint eigenvectors that are solutions to the linear-oscillations equations.   Results: We determine the time evolution of both the amplitude and kinetic energy of each mode that propagates in the DNS. More than 98% of the total kinetic energy is contained in two modes that correspond to the linearly-unstable fundamental mode and the linearly-stable second overtone. Because the eigenperiods ratio is close to 1/2, we discover that the nonlinear saturation is due to a 2:1 resonance between these two modes. An interesting application of this result concerns the reproduction of Hertzsprung's progression observed in Bump Cepheids.
