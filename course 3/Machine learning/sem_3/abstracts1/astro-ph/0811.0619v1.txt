(Abridged). Stellar absorption lines in the optical have been extensively studied and constitute an important stellar population diagnostic for galaxies in the local universe and up to moderate redshifts. Proceeding towards higher look-back times, galaxies are younger and the ultraviolet becomes the relevant spectral region where the dominant stellar populations shine. A comprehensive study of ultraviolet absorption lines of stellar population models is however still lacking. We study absorption line indices in the far and mid-ultraviolet in order to determine age and metallicity indicators for UV-bright stellar populations in the local universe as well as at high redshift. We explore empirical and theoretical spectral libraries and use evolutionary population synthesis to compute synthetic line indices of stellar population models. From the empirical side, we exploit the IUE-low resolution library of stellar spectra and system of absorption lines. From the theoretical side we use a high-resolution library of Kurucz synthetic spectra. In order to select indices that can be used as age and/or metallicity indicators for distant galaxies and globular clusters, we compare the models to data of template globular clusters from the Magellanic Clouds. We provide synthetic line indices in the wavelength range 1200 Angstrom to 3000 Angstrom for stellar populations of various ages and metallicities. This adds several new indices to the well-studied CIV and SiIV absorptions. Based on the comparison with globular cluster data, we select a set of 11 indices blueward of the 2000 Angstrom rest-frame that allows to recover well the ages and the metallicities of the clusters. These indices are ideal to study young galaxies at high redshift. We also provide the synthetic high-resolution stellar population SEDs.
