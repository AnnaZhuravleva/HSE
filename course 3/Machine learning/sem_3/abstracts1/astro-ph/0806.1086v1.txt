The gravitational lens equation for the tilted Plummer family of models can be reduced to a one-dimensional non-linear equation. For certain values of the slope of the radial profile it can be reduced to a polynomial form. Both forms are advantageous to find the roots, i.e. the images for a given model. The critical curve equations can also be reduced to a non-linear or polynomial form, and therefore it is useful to find the caustics. This lens model family has ample use in gravitational lens theory, and can produce up to five images.
