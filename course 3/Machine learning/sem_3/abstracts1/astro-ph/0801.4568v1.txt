In the CDM cosmological framework structures grow from merging with smaller structures. Merging should have observable effects on galaxies including destroying disks and creating spheroids. This proceeding aims to give a brief overview of how mergers occur in cosmological simulations. In this regard it is important to understand that dark matter halo mergers are not galaxy mergers; a theory of galaxy formation is necessary to connect the two. Mergers of galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations show a stronger dependence on mass than halo mergers in N-body simulations. If one knows how to connect galaxies to dark matter halos then the halo merger rate can be converted into a galaxy merger rate. When this is done it becomes clear that major mergers are many times more common in more massive galaxies offering a possible explanation of why Hubble type depends on galaxy mass.
