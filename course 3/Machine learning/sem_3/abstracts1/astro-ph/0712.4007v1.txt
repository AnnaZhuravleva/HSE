DDO 68 is the second most metal-poor star-forming galaxy (12+log(O/H)=7.14). Its peculiar optical morphology and the data on its HI distribution and kinematics indicate the merger origin. We use the photometry of the SDSS u,g,r,i images of DDO 68 to estimate its stellar population ages. The available H-alpha-images of DDO 68 were used to select several representative regions without nebular emission. The analysis of obtained colours was performed via comparison with the PEGASE2 evolutionary tracks for various star formation (SF) laws, including the two extremes: instantaneous SF and continuous SF with constant SF rate. The (u-g), (g-r) colours derived for all selected regions, are consistent with a few `instantaneous' SF episodes with ages from ~0.05 to ~1Gyr. Combining the fluxes and colours of visible stellar subsystems with PEGASE2 models, we have estimated the total mass of visible stars in DDO 68 of ~2.4x10^7 Mo. This comprises only ~6% of the total galaxy baryonic mass. All available data do not contradict to the option that DDO 68 is a kind of very rare candidate `young' galaxy, whose dominant stellar build-up took place in course of the recent (with the first encounter ~1 Gyr ago) merger of two very gas-rich disks. DDO 68 best approximates on its properties cosmologically young low-mass galaxies.
