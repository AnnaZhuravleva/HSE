We present stellar population modeling results for 10 newly discovered Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs), as well as four previously known LAEs at z ~ 4.5 in the Chandra Deep Field - South. We fit stellar population models to these objects in order to learn specifically if there exists more than one class of LAE. Past observational and theoretical evidence has shown that while many LAEs appear to be young, they may be much older, with Lyman alpha EWs enhanced due to resonant scattering of Lyman alpha photons in a clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). Our results show a large range of stellar population age (3 - 500 Myr), stellar mass (1.6 x 10^8 - 5.0 x 10^10 Msol) and dust extinction (A_1200 = 0.3 - 4.5 mag), broadly consistent with previous studies. With such a large number of individually analyzed objects, we have looked at the distribution of stellar population ages in LAEs for the first time, and we find a very interesting bimodality, in that our objects are either very young (< 15 Myr) or old (> 450 Myr). This bimodality may be caused by dust, and it could explain the Lyman alpha duty cycle which has been proposed in the literature. We find that eight of the young objects are best fit with a clumpy ISM. We find that dust geometry appears to play a large role in shaping the SEDs that we observe, and that it may be a major factor in the observed Lyman alpha equivalent width distribution in high redshift Lyman alpha galaxies, although other factors (i.e. outflows) may be in play. We conclude that 12 out of our 14 LAEs are dusty star-forming galaxies, with the other two LAEs being evolved galaxies.
