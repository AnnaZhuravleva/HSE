We establish that global solar p-mode frequencies can be measured with sufficient precision on time scales as short as nine days to detect activity-related shifts. Using ten years of GONG data, we report that mode-mass and error-weighted frequency shifts derived from nine days are significantly correlated with the strength of solar activity and are consistent with long duration measurements from GONG and the MDI/SOHO instrument. However, the correlation varies from year to year and appears to be a complex phenomena. For the short-duration observations, the analysis indicates a higher sensitivity to activity. We also find that magnetic indices behave differently in the rising and falling phases of the activity cycle.
