We investigate the origin of the soft X-ray excess emission from narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies Akn564 and Mrk1044 using XMM-Newton observations. We find clear evidence for time delays between the soft and hard X-ray emission from Akn564 based on a 100ks long observation. The variations in the 4-10keV band lag behind that in the 0.2-0.5keV band by 1768+/-122s. The full band power density spectrum (PDS) of Akn~564 has a break at ~1.2e-3Hz with power-law indices of ~1 and ~3 below and above the break. The hard (3-10keV) band PDS is stronger and flatter than that in the soft (0.2-0.5keV) band. Based on a short observation of Mrk1044, we find no correlation between the 0.2-0.3keV and 5-10keV bands at zero lag. These observations imply that the soft excess is not the reprocessed hard X-ray emission. The high resolution spectrum of Akn564 obtained with the RGS shows evidence for a highly ionized and another weakly ionized warm absorber medium. The smeared wind and blurred ionized reflection models do not describe the pn data adequately. The spectrum is consistent with a complex model consisting of optically thick Comptonization in a cool plasma for the soft excess and a steep power-law, modified by two warm absorber media as inferred from the RGS data and the foreground Galactic absorption. The smeared wind and optically thick Comptonization models both describe the spectrum of Mrk1044 satisfactorily, but the ionized reflection model requires extreme parameters. The data suggest two component corona -- a cool, optically thick corona for the soft excess and a hot corona for the power-law component. The existence of a break in the soft band PDS suggests a compact cool corona that can either be an ionized surface of the inner disk or an inner optically thick region coupled to a truncated disk.
