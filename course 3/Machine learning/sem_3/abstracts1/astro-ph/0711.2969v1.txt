A heuristic hypothesis about domination of Bose-Einstein statistics in the early Universe is suggested. The possibility of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of primordial baryon-antibaryon pairs is considered. In accordance with this postulation enormous masses in the order of galactic mass may be accumulated within the cosmic scales. At the certain threshold value of the matter density the structural bosons decay into fermions and the sharp breakdown of quantum-mechanical symmetry of the particles wave functions occurs. Then, due to the Pauli principle of exclusion a large-scale phase transition occurs because of enormous pressure jump of the matter. This phenomenon might cause Cosmological Bang at the beginning stage of the Matter Era. As a mechanism of accumulation of galactic mass much larger than the configuration with structural bosons, a hypothetical BEC of elementary bosons (gauge bosons $W^{\pm}$ and $Z^{0})$ is discussed as well.
