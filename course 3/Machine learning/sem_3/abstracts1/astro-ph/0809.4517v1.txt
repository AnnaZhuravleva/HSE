We report preliminary VRI differential photometric and spectroscopic results for KBS 13, a recently discovered non-eclipsing sdB+dM system. Radial velocity measurements indicate an orbital period of 0.2923 +/- 0.0004 days with a semi-amplitude velocity of 22.82 +/- 0.23 km s-1. This suggests the smallest secondary minimum mass yet found. We discuss the distribution of orbital periods and secondary minimum masses for other similar systems.
