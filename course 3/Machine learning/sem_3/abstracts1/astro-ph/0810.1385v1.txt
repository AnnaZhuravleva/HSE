On 30th August 2006 SXP18.3 a high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with an 18.3s pulse period was observed by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The source was seen continuously for the following 36 weeks. This is the longest Type II outburst ever seen from a HMXB in the SMC. During the outburst SXP18.3 was located from serendipitous XMM-Newton observations. The identification of the optical counterpart has allowed SXP18.3 to be classified as a Be/X-ray binary. This paper will report on the analysis of the optical and weekly RXTE X-ray data that span the last 10 years. The extreme length of this outburst has for the first time enabled us to perform an extensive study of the pulse timing of an SMC Be/X-ray binary. We present a possible full orbital solution from the pulse timing data. An orbital period of 17.79d is proposed from the analysis of the OGLE III light curve placing SXP18.3 on the boundary of known sources in the Corbet diagram.
