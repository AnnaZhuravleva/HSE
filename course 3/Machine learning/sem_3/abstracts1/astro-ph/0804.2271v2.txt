This Comment is in response to an Erratum to the paper entitled "The shape and composition of interstellar silicate grains" (Min et al., A&A, 462, 667-676 (2007). The Erratum corrects erroneously cited data but upholds the paper's original conclusions that GEMS are not remnant interstellar grains and that most GEMS formed in the early solar system. In our Comment, we show that the correct data in fact strengthen the relationship between GEMS and interstellar silicates, contrary to the conclusions of Min et al. in their Erratum. We also explore the validity of the isotopic and bulk chemical bases for comparison and present additional indicators of past ISM radiation processing of silicates.
