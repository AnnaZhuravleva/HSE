As a continuation of a series of work, we aim to refine and re-determine the physical parameters of previously rarely or un-studied open star clusters with good quality CMDs using Near-IR JHK photometry. Here we present a morphological analysis of the 2MASS database (the digital Two Micron All Sky Survey) for the open cluster Pismis 3. Some of the physical parameters are estimated for the first time, and some others, re-determined.
