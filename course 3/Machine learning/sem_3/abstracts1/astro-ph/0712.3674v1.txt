Computational gas dynamics has become a prominent research field both in astrophysics and cosmology. In the first part of this review we intend to briefly describe several of the numerical methods used in this field, discuss their range of application and present strategies for converting conditionally-stable numerical methods into unconditionally-stable solution procedures. The underlying aim of the conversion is to enhance the robustness and unification of numerical methods and subsequently enlarge their range of applications considerably. In the second part Fabian Heitsch presents and discusses the implementation of a time-explicit MHD Boltzmann solver.
