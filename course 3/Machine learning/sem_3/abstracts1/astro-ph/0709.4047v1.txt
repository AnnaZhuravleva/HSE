We have observed optical (Halpha and [SII]) and near-IR (S(1) line of H2) deep fields and taken optical spectra using the 2.56m NOT, as well as a near-UV deep field (U band) using the 3.58m NTT. In addition we present new SPITZER (IRAC and MIPS) mid-IR observations. We use previous Halpha and S(1) observations taken 15 and 9 years earlier to make proper motion maps. We then investigate the shock physics by matching our spectra with planar shock models. We discover six new HH objects in B335. From proper motions we find an optically bright, roughly E-W oriented group with high space velocities (200-280 km/s) and a near-IR bright, slower group (15-75 km/s) moving to the ESE. We also find a system of at least 15 H2 knots in the western lobe. This (WNW) counterflow suggests the possibility of a binary outflow source, giving rise to two outflow axes with slightly different orientations. We find that the E-W flow is symmetrical with evidence for two outbursts. We make the first detection of [OI] 6300/63 in HH119 B and Hbeta in HH119 A and B and find their extinctions to be AV~1.4 and 4.4, respectively. HH119 A is found to expand much faster than expected from linear expansion with distance from the outflow source. Using planar shock models we find shock velocities of ~60 km/s (A) and ~35 km/s (B and C). This agrees with A being of higher excitation than B and C. In our U image we detect three of the HH objects and propose that the emission arise from the [OII] 3728 line and the blue continuum. New SPITZER observations show most of the HH objects at 4.5 micron and a E-W elongated hour-glass shaped structure at the outflow source. Even at 24 micron it is not clear whether most of the light is direct or reflected.
