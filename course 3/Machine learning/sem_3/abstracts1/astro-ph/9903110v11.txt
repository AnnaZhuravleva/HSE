Using mathematical techniques to model one of the most simplistic of human linguistic processes, it is rationally predicted that within the nonstandard physical world (NSP-world) there exists a force-like (logical) operator *S and an entity w' such that *S{w'} sequentially generates each of the Natural systems that comprise a Universe. This model shows specifically that within the NSP-world the behavior of each Natural world Natural system is related logically. Further, the model predicts the rational existence of a single type of entity within the NSP-world's substratum that can be used to construct, by means of an exceptionally simple process, all of the fundamental Natural world particles used within particle physics. In section 11.2, it is shown how (Natural law) allowable perturbations in Natural system behavior are also included within this mathematical model. These results solve the pre-geometry problem of Wheeler. In general, the model predicts that when the behavior of these Universe creating processes is viewed globally, it can be described as apparently mirroring the behavior of an infinitely powerful computer or mind.
