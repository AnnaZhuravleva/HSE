Recently, it has been recognised that very large spectroscopic surveys (several million spectra) are required to advance our understanding of Dark Energy (via baryonic wiggles) and the detailed history of our Local Group of galaxies (via Galactic Archeology or near-field cosmology). In this paper I make a preliminary exploration of how this might be done by putting a wide field, optical, prime-focus fibre-fed spectroscopic facility on one of the VLT's UTs.
