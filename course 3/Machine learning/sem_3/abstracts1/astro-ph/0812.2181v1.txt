Differential rotation plays a crucial role in the alpha-omega dynamo, and thus also in creation of magnetic fields in stars with convective outer envelopes. Still, measuring the radial differential rotation on stars is impossible with the current techniques, and even the measurement of surface differential rotation is difficult. In this work we investigate the surface differential rotation obtained from dynamo models using similar techniques as are used on observations, and compare the results with the known radial differential rotation used when creating the Dynamo model.
