In many versions of brane model, the modulus field of extra dimensions, the radion, could have cosmological evolution, which induces variation of the Higgs vacuum expectation value, $<H>$, resulting in cosmological variation of the electron mass $m_e$. The formation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies is thus affected, causing changes both in the peaks positions and amplitudes in the CMB power spectra. Using the three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropies Probe (WMAP) CMB data, with the Hubble parameter $H_0$ fixed to be the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) result 72 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, we obtain a constraint on $\rho$, the ratio of the value of $<H>$ at CMB recombination to its present value, to be [0.97, 1.02].
