Recent observations by Ferrarese et al. (2006) and Wehner et al. (2006) reveal that a majority of galaxies contain a central massive object (CMO), either a supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a compact stellar nucleus, regardless of the galaxy mass or morphological type, and that there is a tight relation between the masses of CMOs and those of the host galaxies. Several recent studies show that feedback from black holes can successfully explain the $\msigma$ correlation in massive elliptical galaxies that contain SMBHs. However, puzzles remain in spirals or dwarf spheroids that do not appear to have black holes but instead harbor a compact central stellar cluster. Here we use three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated galaxies to study the formation and evolution of CMOs in bulgeless disk galaxies, and simulations of merging galaxies to study the transition of the CMO--host mass relation from late-type bulgeless spirals to early-type ellipticals. Our results suggest that the observed correlations may be established primarily by the depletion of gas in the central region by accretion and star-formation, and may hold for all galaxy types. A systematic search for CMOs in the nuclei of bulgeless disk galaxies would offer a test of this conclusion. (Abridged)
