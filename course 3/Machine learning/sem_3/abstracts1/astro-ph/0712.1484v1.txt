Radio images of supernova remnants in the framework of diffusion model are discussed. The distribution profiles of synchrotron radiation intensity for spherical injection source of relativistic electrons are reduced at different frequencies. An explanation of the observational data obtained on UTR-2, according to which the size of the supernova remnant at decametric waves is larger than the remnant size at high frequencies, is given.
