We present numerical N-body simulation studies of large-scale structure formation. The main purpose of these studies is to analyze the several models of dark matter and the role they played in the process of large-scale structure formation. We analyze in this work a flat cold dark matter dominated model known as the Santa Barbara cluster. We compare the results for this model using the standard Newtonian limit of general relativity with the corresponding results of using the Newtonian limit of scalar-tensor theories. An specific model is the one that considers that the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. Comparisons of the models are done showing results of rotation curves, density profiles, and velocity dispersions for halos formed at z=0. We analyze, in particular, the Santa Barbara cluster and its possible equation of state.
