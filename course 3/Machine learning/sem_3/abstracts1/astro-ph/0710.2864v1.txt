We present results from two high-contrast imaging surveys that exploit a novel technique, L-band angular differential imaging. Our first survey targeted 21 young stars in the Beta Pic and Tuc-Hor moving groups with VLT/NACO reaching typical sensitivities of <1 MJup at r > 20 AU. The statistical analysis of the null result demonstrates that the giant planet population is truncated at 30 AU or less (90% confidence level). Our second, on-going MMT/Clio survey utilizes the unique sensitivity achieved in the L-band for old planets to probe all M-dwarf stars within 6 pc. The proximity of these targets enables direct imaging of planets in orbits like Jupiter for the first time - a key step for directly imaging giant planets.
