Only a fraction of the theoretically predicted nonradial pulsation modes have so far been observed in Delta Scuti stars. Nevertheless, the large number of frequencies detected in recent photometric studies of selected Delta Scuti stars allow us to look for regularities in the frequency spacing of modes. Mode identifications are used to interpret these results.   Statistical analyses of several Delta Scuti stars (FG Vir, 44 Tau, BL Cam and others) show that the photometrically observed frequencies are not distributed at random, but that the excited nonradial modes cluster around the frequencies of the radial modes over many radial orders.   The observed regularities can be partly explained by modes trapped in the stellar envelope. This mode selection mechanism was proposed by Dziembowski & Krolikowska (1990) and shown to be efficient for l = 1 modes. New pulsation model calculations confirm the observed regularities.   We present the s-f diagram, which compares the average separation of the radial frequencies (s) with the frequency of the lowest-frequency unstable radial mode (f). This provides an estimate for the log g value of the observed star, if we assume that the centers of the observed frequency clusters correspond to the radial mode frequencies. This assumption is confirmed by examples of well-studied Delta Scuti variables in which radial modes were definitely identified.
