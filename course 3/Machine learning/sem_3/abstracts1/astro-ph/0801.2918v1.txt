Context. Rigorous modeling of the \ion{Ba}{ii} ${\lambda}4554$ formation is potentially interesting since this strongly polarized line forms in the solar chromosphere where the magnetic field is rather poorly known. Aims. To investigate the role of isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen in the formation of the polarized \ion{Ba}{ii} ${\lambda}4554$ line and, thus, in the determination of the magnetic field. Methods. Multipole relaxation and transfer rates of the $d$ and p-states of \ion{Ba}{ii} by isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen are calculated. We consider a plane parallel layer of \ion{Ba}{ii} situated at the low chromosphere and anisotropically illuminated from below which produces linear polarization in the ${\lambda}4554$ line by scattering processes. To compute that polarization, we solve the statistical equilibrium equations for \ion{Ba}{ii} levels including collisions, radiation and magnetic field effects. Results. Variation laws of the relaxation and transfer rates with hydrogen number density $n_{\textrm {\scriptsize H}}$ and temperature are deduced. The polarization of the ${\lambda}4554$ line is clearly affected due to isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen although the collisional depolarization of its upper level $^2P_{3/2}$ is negligible. This is because the alignment of the metastable levels $^2D_{3/2}$ and $^2D_{5/2}$ of the \ion{Ba}{ii} are vulnerable to collisions. At the height of formation of the ${\lambda}4554$ line where $n_{\textrm {\scriptsize H}} \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$, we find that the neglecting of the collisions induces inaccuracy of $\sim$ 25% on the calculation of the polarization and $\sim$ 35 % inaccuracy on microturbulent magnetic field determination.
