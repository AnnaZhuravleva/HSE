We use a recently released SDSS catalog of X-ray emitting AGNs in conjunction with the FIRST 20cm radio survey to investigate the black hole fundamental plane relationship between the 1.4GHz radio luminosity ($L_r$), 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), and the black hole mass ($M$), namely, $log L_r=\xi_{RX}log L_X+\xi_{RM}log M +const$. For this purpose, we have compiled a large sample of 725 broad-line AGNs, which consists of 498 radio-loud sources and 227 radio-quiet sources. Our results are generally consistent with those in our previous work based on a smaller sample of 115 SDSS AGNs. We confirm that radio-loud objects have a steeper slope ($\xi_{RX}$) in the radio-X-ray relationship with respect to radio-quiet objects, and the dependence of the black hole fundamental plane on the black hole mass ($\xi_{RM}$) is weak. We also find a tight correlation with a similar slope between the soft X-ray luminosity and broad emission line luminosity for both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs, which implies that their soft X-ray emission is unbeamed and probably related to the accretion process. With the current larger sample of AGNs, we are able to study the redshift evolution of the black hole fundamental plane relation for both radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples. We find that there is no clear evidence of evolution for radio-quiet AGNs, while for radio-loud ones there is a weak trend where $\xi_{RM}$ decreases as the redshift increases. This may be understood in part as due to the observed evolution of the radio spectral index as a function of redshift. Finally, we discuss the relativistic beaming effect and some other uncertainties related to the black hole fundamental plane (Abridged).
