The claim that the large scale structure of the Universe is heirarchical has a very long history going back at least to Charlier's papers of the early 20th century. In recent years, the debate has centered largely on the works of Sylos Labini, Joyce, Pietronero and others, who have made the quantative claim that the large scale structure of the Universe is quasi-fractal with fractal dimension $D\approx2$. There is now a concensus that this is the case on medium scales, with the main debate revolving around what happens on the scales of the largest available modern surveys.   This paper, which is a realization of a worldview which is deeply rooted in the ideas of Aristotle, Leibniz, Berkeley and Mach shows, as a very special case of a general formalism, that such a fractal $D\approx 2$ world, which we denote as $\mathcal{U}_0$ world, is necessarily a world of dynamical equilibrium: that is, it is a flat world. Whilst we confine ourselves here to discussing cosmology on the medium scale (that is $\mathcal{U}_0$ world), the general nature of the formalism allows ready specializations to the small-scale world of Newtonian gravitational physics and to the world of very large scale gravitational physics.
