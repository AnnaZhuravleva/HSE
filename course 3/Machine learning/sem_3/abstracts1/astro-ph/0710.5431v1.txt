Warm dark matter is consistent with the observations of the large-scale structure, and it can also explain the cored density profiles on smaller scales. However, it has been argued that warm dark matter could delay the star formation. This does not happen if warm dark matter is made up of keV sterile neutrinos, which can decay into X-ray photons and active neutrinos. The X-ray photons have a catalytic effect on the formation of molecular hydrogen, the essential cooling ingredient in the primordial gas. In all the cases we have examined, the overall effect of sterile dark matter is to facilitate the cooling of the gas and to reduce the minimal mass of the halo prone to collapse. We find that the X-rays from the decay of keV sterile neutrinos facilitate the collapse of the gas clouds and the subsequent star formation at high redshift.
