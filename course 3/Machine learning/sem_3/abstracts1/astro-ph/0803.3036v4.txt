We have investigated the model of dark energy interacting with dark matter by choosing inhomogeneous equations of state for dark energy and a non-linear interaction term for the underlying interaction. The equation of state have dependencies either on the energy densities, redshift, Hubble parameter and its derivatives or the bulk viscosity. We have considered these possibilities and have derived the effective equations of state for the dark energy in each case.
