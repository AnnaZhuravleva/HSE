The aim of this work is to investigate rotation profile of solar-like stars with magnetic fields. A diffusion coefficient of magnetic angular momentum transport is deduced. Rotating stellar models with different mass are computed under the effect of the coefficient. Then rotation profiles are obtained from the theoretical stellar models. The total angular momentum of solar model with only hydrodynamic instabilities is about 13 times larger than that of the Sun at the age of the Sun, and this model can not reproduce quasi-solid rotation in the radiative region. However, not only can the solar model with magnetic fields reproduce an almost uniform rotation in the radiative region, but its total angular momentum is consistent with helioseismic result at the level of 3 $\sigma$ at the age of the Sun. The rotation of solar-like stars with magnetic fields is almost uniform in the radiative region. But there is an obvious transition region of angular velocity between the convective core and the radiative region of models with 1.2 - 1.5 $M_{\odot}$, where angular velocity has a sharp radial change, which is different from the rotation profile of the Sun and massive stars with magnetic fields. Moreover the changes of the angular velocity in the transition region increase with the increasing in the age and mass.
