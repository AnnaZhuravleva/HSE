This work reports on the development of the first phonon detectors based on CaMoO4 and ZnWO4 scintillating crystals for the CRESST-II experiment. In particular, a novel technique for the production of the ZnWO4 phonon detector with a separate thermometer carrier was investigated. The influence of the thermal and mechanical treatment on the scintillation light output of CaMoO4 and ZnWO4 crystals at room temperature is discussed.
