Modified dispersion relations from effective field theory are shown to alter the Chandrasekhar mass limit. At exceptionally high densities, the modifications affect the pressure of a degenerate electron gas and can increase or decrease the mass limit, depending on the sign of the modifications. These changes to the mass limit are unlikely to be relevant for the astrophysics of white dwarf or neutron stars due to well-known dynamical instabilities that occur at lower densities. Generalizations to frameworks other than effective field theory are discussed.
