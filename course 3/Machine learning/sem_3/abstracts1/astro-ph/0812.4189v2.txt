We present timing and spectral analysis of RXTE-PCA observations of the accretion powered pulsar 4U 1907+09 between June 2007 and August 2008. 4U 1907+09 had been in a spin-down episode with a spin-down rate of $-3.54\times10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$ before 1999. From RXTE observations after March 2001, the source showed a $\sim 60$% decrease in spin-down magnitude and INTEGRAL observations after March 2003 showed that source started to spin-up. We found that the source recently entered a new spin-down episode with a spin-down rate of $-3.59 \times 10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. This spin-down rate is pretty close to the previous long term spin-down rate of the source measured before 1999. From the spectral analysis, we showed that Hydrogen column density varies with the orbital phase.
