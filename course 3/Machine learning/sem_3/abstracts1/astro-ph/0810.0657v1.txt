Recently, the concept of rotational mixing has been challenged by some authors (e.g. Hunter et al. 2008). We show that the excess N/H is a multivariate function f(M, age, v, sin i, multiplicity,Z). To find a correlation of a multivariate function with some parameter, it is evidently necessary to limit as much as possible the range of the other involved parameters. When this is done, the concept of rotational mixing is supported by the observations. We also show that the sample data are not free from several biases. A fraction of about 20% of the stars may escape to the relation as a result of binary evolution.
