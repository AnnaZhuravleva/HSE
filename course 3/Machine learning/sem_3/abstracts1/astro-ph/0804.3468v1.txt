The distribution of luminous radio galaxies in galaxy clusters has been observed to be concentrated in the inner region. We consider the role of dynamical friction of massive galaxies ($M\sim 10^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$), assuming them to be hosts of luminous radio galaxies, and show that beginning with a Navarro-Frenk-White density profile of a cluster of mass $M_{cl}\sim 10^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$ of concentration $c\sim 5$ and collapsing at $z\sim 1$, the density profile of radio galaxies evolve to a profile of concentration $c \sim 25$, as observed, in a time scale of $t\sim 3\hbox{--}5$ Gyr.
