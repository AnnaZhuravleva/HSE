VERITAS is an array of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes designed for very high energy gamma ray (E>100,GeV) observations of astrophysical sources.   The experiment began its scientific observation program in the 2006/2007 observing season. We describe here the analysis chain for reducing the data, reconstructing the direction and energy of incident gamma rays and the rejection of background cosmic rays.
