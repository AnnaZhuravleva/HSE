The collapse of a massive star is believed to be the most probable progenitor of a long GRB. Such a star is expected to modify its environment by stellar wind. The effect of such a circum-stellar wind medium is expected to be seen in the evolution of a GRB afterglow, but has so far not been conclusively found. We claim that a signature of wind to constant density medium transition of circum-burst medium is visible in the afterglow of GRB 050319. Along with the optical observations of the afterglow of GRB 050319 we present a model for the multiband afterglow of GRB 050319. We show that the break seen in optical light curve at $\sim$ 0.02 day could be explained as being due to wind to constant density medium transition of circum-burst medium, in which case, to our knowledge, this could be the first ever detection of such a transition at any given frequency band. Detection of such a transition could also serve as a confirmation of massive star collapse scenario for GRB progenitors, independent of supernova signatures.
