Accurate physical parameters of newborn massive stars are essential ingredients to shed light on their formation, which is still an unsolved problem. The rare class of compact H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), termed ``high-excitation blobs'' (HEBs), presents a unique opportunity to acquire this information. These objects (~ 4" to 10", ~ 1 to 3 pc, in diameter) harbor the youngest massive stars of the OB association/molecular cloud complexes in the MCs accessible through high-resolution near-IR and optical techniques. We present a brief overview of the results obtained with HST mainly on two HEBs, one in the LMC (N159-5) and the other in the SMC (N81).
