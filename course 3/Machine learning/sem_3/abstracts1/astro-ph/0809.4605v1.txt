The Antares nebula is a peculiar emission nebula seen in numerous Fe II lines and in radio free-free emission, probably associated with the H II region caused by alpha Sco B in the wind of alpha Sco A. High-resolution spectra with spatial resolution were used to study the emission line spectrum, the physical nature of the nebula and to determine the mass-loss rate of the M supergiant alpha Sco A.
