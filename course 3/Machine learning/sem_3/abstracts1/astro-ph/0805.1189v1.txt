We present the results of a proper motion survey of the Hyades to search for brown dwarfs, based on UKIDSS and 2MASS data. This survey covers ~275 square degrees to depth of K~15 mag, equivalent to a mass of 0.05 solar masses assuming a cluster age of 625 Myr. The discovery of 12 L dwarf Hyades members is reported. These members are also brown dwarfs, with masses between 0.05 < M < 0.075 solar masses. A high proportion of these L dwarfs appear to be photometric binaries.
