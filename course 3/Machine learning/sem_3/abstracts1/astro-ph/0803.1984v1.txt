A thorough search for Ultraluminous X-ray source candidates within the Local Volume is made. The search spatially matches potential ULXs detected in X-ray images or cataloged in the literature with galaxies tabulated in the Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies compiled by Karachentsev et al. (2004). The specific ULX frequency (occurrence rate per unit galaxy mass) is found to be a decreasing function of host galaxy mass for host masses above $\sim10^{8.5}$ solar mass. There is too little mass in galaxies below this point to determine if this trend continues to lower galaxy mass. No ULXs have yet been detected in lower-mass galaxies. Systematic differences between dwarf and giant galaxies that may explain an abundance of ULXs in dwarf galaxies and what they may imply about the nature of ULXs are discussed.
