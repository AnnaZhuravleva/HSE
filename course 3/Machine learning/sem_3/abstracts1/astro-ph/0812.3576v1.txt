While the PAMELA collaboration has recently confirmed the cosmic ray positron excess, it is interesting to review the effects of dark matter (DM) subhalos on the predicted antimatter signals. We recall that, according to general subhalo properties as inferred from theoretical cosmology, and for DM with constant annihilation cross section, the enhancement cannot be $\gtrsim$ 20 for the antimatter yield. This bound is obviously different from that found for gamma-rays. We also recall some predictions for supersymmetric benchmark models observable at the LHC and derived in the cosmological N-body framework, illustrating in the meantime the existing discrepancy between the profiles derived from N-body experiments and the current observations of the Milky Way.
