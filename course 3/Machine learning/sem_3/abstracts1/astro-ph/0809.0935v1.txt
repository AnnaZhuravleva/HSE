The majority of mass in the universe has not been observed optically and is termed dark matter. The supersymmetric neutralino provides an interesting dark matter candidate, which may self-annihilate in our galaxy, producing particles visible in the cosmic ray spectrum. During a ten day space shuttle flight, the AMS-01 detector recorded over 100 million cosmic ray events. This analysis searches for the products of neutralino annihilation in the AMS-01 Z=-1 spectrum, and uses the results to place limits on which supersymmetric and dark matter halo distribution models are compatible.
