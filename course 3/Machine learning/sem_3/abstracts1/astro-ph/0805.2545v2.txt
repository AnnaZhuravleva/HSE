The ANTARES Collaboration is completing the deployment of a 12 lines underwater detector, 2500m deep in the Mediterranean Sea, dedicated to high energy neutrino astronomy. Starting with the first line in 2006, 10 lines were continuously recording data by the end of 2007, which allow us to reconstruct downward-going cosmic muons, and search for the first upward-going neutrino-induced muons. Calibration topics will be described and preliminary results presented.
