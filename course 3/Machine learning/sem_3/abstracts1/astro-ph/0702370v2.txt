An overview is given on the present status of the understanding of the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Recent measurements of charged cosmic rays and photons are reviewed. Their impact on the contemporary knowledge about the sources and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays and their propagation through the Galaxy is discussed. Possible reasons for the knee in the energy spectrum and scenarios for the end of the galactic cosmic-ray component are described.
