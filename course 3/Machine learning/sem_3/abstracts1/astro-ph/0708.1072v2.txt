Most parametrizations for dark energy involve the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy. In this work, we choose the pressure of the dark energy to parametrize. As $p = constant$ essentially gives a cosmological constant, we use the Taylor expansion around this behavior $p = -p_{0} + (1-a)p_{1} + ....$ to study the small deviations from the cosmological constant. In our model, the departure from the cosmological constant behavior has been modeled by the presence of extra K-essence fields while keeping the cosmological constant term untouched. The model is similar to assisted inflation scenario in a sense that for any higher order deviation in terms of Taylor series expansion, one needs multiple K-essence fields. We have also tested our model with the recent observational data coming from Supernova type Ia measurements, the baryon oscillations peak (BAO) and the gas mass fraction of the galaxy clusters inferred from X-ray observations and obtain constraints for our model parameters.
