In ESO period 65 (April-September 2000) the large programme 165.N-0276, led by Roger Cayrel, began making use of UVES at the Kueyen VLT telescope. Known within the Team and outside as ``First Stars'', it was aimed at obtaining high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra in the range 320 nm -- 1000 nm for a large sample of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars identified from the HK objective prism survey.In this contribution we highlight the main results of the large programme.
