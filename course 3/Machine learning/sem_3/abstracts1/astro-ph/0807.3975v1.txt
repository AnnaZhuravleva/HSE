We have obtained deep Adaptive Optics (AO) images of Vega and epsilon Eri to search for planetary-mass companions. We observed at the MMT in the L' (3.8 micron) and M (4.8 micron) bands using Clio, a recently commissioned imager optimized for these wavelengths. Observing at these long wavelengths represents a departure from the H band (1.65 microns) more commonly used for AO imaging searches for extrasolar planets. The long wavelengths offer better predicted planet/star flux ratios and cleaner (higher Strehl) AO images, at the cost of lower diffraction limited resolution and higher sky background. We have not detected any planets or planet candidates around Vega or epsilon Eri. We report the sensitivities obtained around both stars, which correspond to upper limits on any planetary companions which may exist. The sensitivities of our L' and M band observations are comparable to those of the best H-regime observations of these stars. For epsilon Eri our M band observations deliver considerably better sensitivity to close-in planets than any previously published results, and we show that the M band is by far the best wavelength choice for attempts at ground-based AO imaging of the known planet epsilon Eri b. The Clio camera itself with MMTAO may be capable of detecting epsilon Eri b at its 2010 apastron, given a multi-night observing campaign. Clio appears to be the only currently existing AO imager that has a realistic possibility of detecting epsilon Eri b.
