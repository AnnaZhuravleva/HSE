The most distinctive feature of the primordial density inhomogeneities that existed in the cosmic plasma at the instant of decoupling is their scale invariant power spectrum ${\cal P}(k) \sim k$ over the range $k \ll H_{eq}$ of modes with cosmologically large comoving wavelength. We characterize this feature in real space, in terms of their correlation function at two points. We show that over cosmologically large comoving distances $r \gg H^{-1}_{eq}$ the primordial inhomogeneities were (anti)correlated as $f(r) \sim - r^{-4}$. We revisit the so-called {\it origin of structures problem} of the standard cosmology at the light of this observation. Our conclusions contradict the current wisdom on this issue.
