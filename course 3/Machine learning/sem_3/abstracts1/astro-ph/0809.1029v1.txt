Numerical simulations of galaxy mergers are a powerful tool to study these fundamental events in the hierarchical built-up of galaxies. Recent progress have been made owing to improved modeling, increased resolution and large statistical samples. We present here the highest-resolution models of mergers performed so far. The formation of a variety of substructures ranging from kinematically decoupled cores to globular-like clusters is directly resolved. In a resolution study, we show that the large-scale structure of elliptical-like merger remnants can be affected by the resolution, and a too modest resolution may affect the numerical predictions on the properties of major merger remnants: understanding precisely which kind of event or succession of events has formed the various types of elliptical galaxies remains an open challenge.
