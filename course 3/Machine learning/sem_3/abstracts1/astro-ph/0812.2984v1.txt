We investigate the cosmological evolution of large- and small-scale magnetic fields in galaxies at high redshifts. Results from simulations of hierarchical structure formation cosmology provide a tool to develop an evolutionary model of regular magnetic fields coupled to galaxy formation and evolution. Turbulence in protogalactic halos generated by thermal virialization can drive an efficient turbulent dynamo. The mean-field dynamo theory is used to derive the timescales of amplification and ordering of regular magnetic fields in disk and dwarf galaxies. For future observations with the SKA, we predict an anticorrelation at fixed redshift between galaxy size and the ratio between ordering scale and galaxy size. Undisturbed dwarf galaxies should host fully coherent fields at z<1, spiral galaxies at z<0.5.
