We measure the mass and kinematics of the massive molecular torus in the planetary nebula NGC 6302. The nebula is the proto-typical butterfly nebula. The origin of the wing-like morphology is disputed: determining the mass-loss history of the confining torus is an important step in understanding the formation of this structure. We performed submillimeter observations with JCMT and the SMA interferometer. The continuum emission as well as the J=2-1 and 3-2 transitions of 12CO and 13CO are analysed at arcsecond resolution. The CO emission indicates a mass of the torus of ~ 2Msun +/- 1Msun. The 12CO and 13CO emission matches the dark lane seen in absorption in the Halpha image of the object. The CO torus is expanding with a velocity of ~ 8 km/s, centred at Vlsr=-31.5 km/s. The size and expansion velocity of the torus indicates that the torus was ejected from ~ 7500 yr to 2900 yr ago, with a mass-loss rate of 5x10^{-4}Msun/yr. We also see a ballistic component in the CO images with a velocity gradient of 140 km/s/pc.   The derived mass-loss history of the torus favours binary interaction as the cause of the ejection of the torus. We predict the existence of a companion with an orbital period P < 1 month.
