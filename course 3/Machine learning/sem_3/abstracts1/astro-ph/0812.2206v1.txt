Dark energy is usually parametrized as a perfect fluid with negative pressure and a certain equation of state. Besides, it is supposed to interact very weakly with the rest of the components of the universe and, as a consequence, there is no reason to expect it to have the same large-scale rest frame as matter and radiation. Thus, apart from its equation of state $w$ and its energy density $\Omega_{DE}$ one should also consider its velocity as a free parameter to be determined by observations. This velocity defines a cosmological preferred frame, so the universe becomes anisotropic and, therefore, the CMB temperature fluctuations will be affected, modifying mainly the dipole and the quadrupole.
