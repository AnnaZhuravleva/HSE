Within the framework of the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory (GAVO), we provide synthetic spectra, simulation software for the calculation of NLTE model atmospheres, as well as necessary atomic data. This will enable a VO user to directly compare observation and model-atmosphere spectra on three levels: The easiest and fastest way is the use of our pre-calculated flux-table grid in which one may inter- and extrapolate. For a more precise analysis of an abservation, the VO user may improve the fit to the observation by the calculation of individual model atmospheres with fine-tuned photospheric parameters via the WWW interface TMAW. The more experienced VO user may create own atomic-data files for a more detailed analysis and calculate model atmosphere and flux tables with these.
