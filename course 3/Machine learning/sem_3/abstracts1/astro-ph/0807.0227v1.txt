We present a catalogue of 99 candidate clusters and groups of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1 < z_{phot} < 1.3 discovered in the Spitzer First Look Survey (FLS). The clusters are selected by their R - 3.6um galaxy color-magnitude relation using the cluster red sequence algorithm. Using this cluster sample we compute the 3.6um, 4.5um, 5.8um, & 8.0um cluster luminosity functions (LFs). Similar to previous studies, we find that for the bands that trace stellar mass at these redshifts (3.6um, 4.5um) the evolution in M* is consistent with a passively evolving population of galaxies with a high formation redshift (z_{f} > 1.5). Using the 3.6um LF as a proxy for stellar luminosity we remove this component from the MIR (5.8um & 8.0um) cluster LFs and measure the LF of dusty star formation/AGN in clusters. We find that at z < 0.4 the bright end of the cluster 8.0um LF is well-described by a composite population of quiescent galaxies and regular star forming galaxies with a mix consistent with typical cluster blue fractions; however, at z > 0.4, an additional population of dusty starburst galaxies is required to properly model the 8.0um LFs. Comparison to field studies at similar redshifts shows a strong differential evolution in the field and cluster 8.0um LFs with redshift. At z ~ 0.65 8.0um-detected galaxies are more abundant in clusters compared to the field, but thereafter the number of 8.0um sources in clusters declines with decreasing redshift and by z ~ 0.15, clusters are underdense relative to the field by a factor of ~5. The rapid differential evolution between the cluster and field LFs is qualitatively consistent with recent field galaxy studies that show the star formation rates of galaxies in high density environments are larger than those in low density environments at higher redshift.
