Solar magnetism is measured with different indexes: for instance the MPSI and the MWSI, number of sunspots, radio flux at 10.7 cm, Ca II K, Mg II K, EUV, He I or L_alpha. Bachmann & White (1994) had compared these indicators of the solar activity showing a hysteresis of the solar cycle variations and a time lag between these indices not related to instrumental effects. Later on, Ozguc & Atac (2001) extended this study of hysteresis phenomenon between Flare index and other solar indices (mean magnetic field, coronal index). In its original working configuration, GOLF/SoHO was able to measure during 26 days the solar mean magnetic field (Garcia et al. 1999). We check here if the velocity data could be used as another solar magnetism proxy with the advantage of having a duty cycle >95% during the last 12 years. We will compare the GOLF data with some of the above-mentioned solar activity indexes.
