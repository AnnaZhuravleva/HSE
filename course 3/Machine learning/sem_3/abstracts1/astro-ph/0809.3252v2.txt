Several lines of evidence suggest that the galaxy cluster Cl0024+17, an apparently relaxed system, is actually a collision of two clusters, the interaction occurring along our line of sight. Recent lensing observations suggest the presence of a ring-like dark matter structure, which has been interpreted as the result of such a collision. In this paper we present $N$-body simulations of cluster collisions along the line of sight to investigate the detectability of such features. We use realistic dark matter density profiles as determined from cosmological simulations. Our simulations show a "shoulder" in the dark matter distribution after the collision, but no ring feature even when the initial particle velocity distribution is highly tangentially anisotropic ($\sigma_\theta/\sigma_r >> 1$). Only when the initial particle velocity distribution is circular do our simulations show such a feature. Even modestly anisotropic velocity distributions are inconsistent with the halo velocity distributions seen in cosmological simulations, and would require highly fine-tuned initial conditions. Our investigation leaves us without an explanation for the dark matter ring-like feature in Cl 0024+17 suggested by lensing observations.
