We study the alignments between the angular momentum of individual objects and the large-scale structure in cosmological numerical simulations and real data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 6. To this end we measure anisotropies in the two point cross-correlation function around simulated halos and observed galaxies, studying separately the 1- and 2-halo regimes. The alignment of the angular momentum of dark-matter haloes in LCDM simulations is found to be dependent on scale and halo mass. At large distances (2-halo regime), the spins of high mass haloes are preferentially oriented in the direction perpendicular to the distribution of matter; lower mass systems show a weaker trend that may even reverse to show an angular momentum in the plane of the matter distribution. In the 1-halo term regime, the angular momentum is aligned in the direction perpendicular to the matter distribution; the effect is stronger than for the 1-halo term and increases for higher mass systems.   On the observational side, we focus our study on galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) with elongated apparent shapes, and study alignments with respect to the major semi-axis. We find an excess of structure in the direction of the major semi-axis for all samples; the red sample shows the highest alignment (2.7+-0.08%) and indicates that the angular momentum of flattened spheroidals tends to be perpendicular to the large-scale structure.
