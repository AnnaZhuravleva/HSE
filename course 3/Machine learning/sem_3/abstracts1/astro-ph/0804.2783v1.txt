Mergers between stellar-mass black holes will be key sources of gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors. However, the rates of these events are highly uncertain, given that such systems are invisible. One formation scenario involves mergers in field binaries, where our lack of complete understanding of common envelopes and the distribution of supernova kicks has led to rate estimates that range over a factor of several hundred. A different, and highly promising, channel involves multiple encounters of binaries in globular clusters or young star clusters. However, we currently lack solid evidence for black holes in almost all such clusters, and their low escape speeds raise the possibility that most are ejected because of supernova recoil. Here we propose that a robust environment for mergers could be the nuclear star clusters found in the centers of small galaxies. These clusters have millions of stars, black hole relaxation times well under a Hubble time, and escape speeds that are several times those of globulars, hence they retain most of their black holes. We present simulations of the three-body dynamics of black holes in this environment and estimate that, if most nuclear star clusters do not have supermassive black holes that interfere with the mergers, at least several tens of events per year will be detectable with Advanced LIGO.
