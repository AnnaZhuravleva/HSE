Recent astrophysical observations of neutron stars and heavy-ion data are confronted with our present understanding of the equation of state of dense hadronic matter. Emphasis is put on the possible role of the presence of hyperons in the interior of compact stars. We argue that data from low-mass pulsars provide an important cross-check between high-density astrophysics and heavy-ion physics.
