In this paper, we investigate the holographic dark energy model with interaction between dark energy and dark matter, from the statefinder viewpoint. We plot the trajectories of the interacting holographic dark energy model for different interaction cases as well as for different values of the parameter $c$ in the statefinder-plane. The statefinder diagrams characterize the properties of the holographic dark energy and show the discrimination between the two cases with and without interaction. As a result, we show the influence of the interaction to the evolution of the universe in the statefinder diagrams. Moreover, as a complement to the statefinder diagnosis, we study the interacting holographic dark energy model in the $w-w'$ plane, which can provide us with a dynamical diagnosis.
