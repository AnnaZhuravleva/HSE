The MOST photometric space mission discovered an eclipsing binary among its guide stars in June 2006 which combines a relatively large eccentricity e = 0.20 with an orbital period of only 2.27 days. HD 313926 appears to consist of two early-type stars of spectral type B3 - B7. It has a largest eccentricity among known early-type binaries with periods less than 3.5 d. Despite the large components indicated by its spectral type and light curve model, and its short period, the orbit of HD 313926 has not yet circularised so it is probably very young, even compared to other young B stars.
