We consider contributions to non-Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from remnants of post-inflationary phase transitions in the very early universe. Such signatures can optimistically be used to discover evidence of new particle physics through cosmological observations. More conservatively they provide a potential obstacle to extracting information about the non-Gaussian nature of primordial density fluctuations from any detection in the CMB. We demonstrate this explicitly by computing the bispectrum from global textures, which may be generated from a wide class of particle physics models.
