We report the discovery of 11 new cataclysmic variable (CV) candidates by the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) Photometric H alpha Survey of the northern Galactic plane (IPHAS). Three of the systems have been the subject of further follow-up observations. For the CV candidates IPHAS J013031.90+622132.4 and IPHAS J051814.34+294113.2, time-resolved optical spectroscopy has been obtained and radial-velocity measurements of the H alpha emission-line have been used to estimate their orbital periods. A third CV candidate (IPHAS J062746.41+ 014811.3) was observed photometrically and found to be eclipsing. All three systems have orbital periods above the CV period-gap of 2-3 h. We also highlight one other system, IPHAS J025827.88+635234.9, whose spectrum distinguishes it as a likely high luminosity object with unusual C and N abundances.
