The IceCube neutrino observatory, under construction at the South Pole, consists of three sub-detectors: a km-scale array of digital optical modules deployed deep in the ice, the AMANDA neutrino telescope and the surface array IceTop. We summarize results from searches for cosmic neutrinos with the AMANDA telescope and review expected sensitivities for IceCube at various installation phases. Reliability and robustness of installation at the South Pole has been demonstrated during the past four successful construction seasons. The 40 installed IceCube strings are working well. We are developing detailed plans for the final construction of IceCube, including extensions optimized for low and high energy. We describe the IceCube Deep Core project which will extend the low energy response of IceCube.
