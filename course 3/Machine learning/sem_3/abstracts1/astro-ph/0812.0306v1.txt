We present a hadronic model of activity for Galactic gamma-ray-loud binaries, in which the multi-TeV neutrino flux from the source can be much higher and/or harder than the detected TeV gamma-ray flux. This is related to the fact that most neutrinos are produced in pp interactions close to the bright massive star, in a region optically thick for the TeV gamma-rays. Considering the specific example of LS I +61o 303, we derive upper bounds for neutrino fluxes from various proton injection spectra compatible with the observed multi-wavelength spectrum. At this upper level of neutrino emission, we demonstrate that ICECUBE will not only detect this source at 5 sigma C.L. after one year of operation, but, after 3 years of exposure, will also collect a sample marginally sufficient to constrain the spectral characteristics of the neutrino signal, directly related to the underlying source acceleration mechanisms.
