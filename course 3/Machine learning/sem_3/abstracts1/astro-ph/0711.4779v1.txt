Experiments with thin ZnS(Ag) scintillators provide evidence with C.L. > 99.99% for the existence of DArk Electric Matter Objects - daemons (presumably negatively charged Planckian particles with M ~ 10^-5 g) captured from the Galactic disk into near-Earth, almost circular heliocentric orbits. Their flux at V ~ 10-15 km/s was found to be as high as f > 10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1 and vary with P = 0.5 y, with maxima in March and September. A daemon flux f ~ 10^-7 - 10^-6 cm^-2 s^-1 is capable of accounting for the Troitsk anomaly in the tritium beta-spectrum and suggests its more pronounced manifestation in future KATRIN experiment. In view of the channeling effect on iodine recoil nuclei in the NaI(Tl) crystal, the DAMA/NaI experiment is also apparently detecting a flux of daemons, f ~ 6x10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1, but in this case of those falling with V = 30-50 km/s from strongly elongated, Earth-crossing heliocentric orbits oriented in the antapex direction, as a result of which the number of events detected in the 2-6-keV interval varies with P = 1 y.
