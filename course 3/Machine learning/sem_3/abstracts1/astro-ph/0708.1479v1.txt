The evolution of angular momentum is a key to our understanding of star formation and stellar evolution. The rotational evolution of solar-mass stars is mostly controlled by magnetic interaction with the circumstellar disc and angular momentum loss through stellar winds. Major differences in the internal structure of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- they are believed to be fully convective throughout their lives, and thus should not operate a solar-type dynamo -- may lead to major differences in the rotation and activity of these objects. Here, we report on observational studies to understand the rotational evolution of the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.
