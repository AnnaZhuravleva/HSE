I present an overview of the observational signatures of feeding of Active Galactic Nuclei, discussing briefly the role of interactions among galaxies on extragalactic scales, and of non-axisymmetric gravitational potentials -- such as bars -- on galactic scales. Then I discuss at larger length the feeding signatures on hundred of parsec scales, for which new results include: (1) recent star formation surrounding the active nucleus on tens of parsec scales; (2) excess of gas and dust in active galaxies relative to non-active ones, in the form of nuclear spirals and disks; (3) new kinematic signatures of gas inflow along nuclear spiral arms, which may be the long sought mechanism to bring gas from kiloparsec scales down to the nucleus to feed the supermassive black hole.
