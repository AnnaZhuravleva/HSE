Currently available Type Ia distant supernovae observed data seem to support evidence that the cosmic expansion of the universe is accelerating. This unexpected result is beyond any standard model of modern cosmology. The new concept advanced to account for the acceleration is dark energy or quintessence with negative pressure. Most analyses using this new form of energy describe the observed data with great accuracy, although there has been no laboratory confirmation of it. The present work analyzes the consequences of Thomson scattering on Type Ia supernovae data for two significant reasons; (i) recently observed data reveal the existence of sufficient amount of ionized baryonic (hydrogen) dark matter in the intergalactic medium, a necessary ingredient for Thomson scattering, and (ii) its effects have not been considered previously in determining distances to the supernovae from their observed distance moduli. Quantitative results of the present investigation based on observed data and corrected for Thomson scattering are consistent with the prediction of Hubble expansion of the universe.
