Nikos Voglis had many astronomical interests, among them was the question of the origin of galactic angular momentum. In this short tribute we review how this subject has changed since the 1970's and how it has now become evident that gravitational tidal forces have not only caused galaxies to rotate, but have also acted to shape the very cosmic structure in which those galaxies are found. We present recent evidence for this based on data analysis techniques that provide objective catalogues of clusters, filaments and voids.
