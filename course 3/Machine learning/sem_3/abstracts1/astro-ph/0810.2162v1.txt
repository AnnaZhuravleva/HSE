We have computed a series of realistic and self-consistent models that reproduce the properties of HII galaxies.   The emitted spectrum of HII galaxies is reproduced by means of the photoionization code CLOUDY, using as ionizing spectrum the spectral energy distribution of the modelled HII galaxy, calculated using new and updated stellar population synthesis model (PopStar, Molla et al. 08) This, in turn, is calculated according to a star formation history and a metallicity evolution given by a chemical evolution code. Our technique reproduces observed abundances, diagnostic diagrams, colours and equivalent width vs. colour relations for local HII galaxies
