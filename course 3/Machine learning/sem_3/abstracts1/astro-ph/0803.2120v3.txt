Correlations between the arrival time and the energy of photons emitted in outbursts of astrophysical objects are predicted in quantum and classical gravity scenarios and can appear as well as a result of complex acceleration mechanisms responsible for the photon emission at the source. This paper presents a robust method to study such correlations that overcomes some limitations encountered in previous analysis, and is based on a Likelihood function built from the physical picture assumed for the emission, propagation and detection of the photons. The results of the application of this method to a flare of Markarian 501 observed by the MAGIC telescope are presented. The method is also applied to a simulated dataset based on the flare of PKS 2155-304 recorded by the H.E.S.S. observatory to proof its applicability to complex photon arrival time distributions.
