We study the conditions needed to have an early epoch of inflationary expansion with a potential coming from IIB superstring theory with fluxes involving two moduli fields. The phenomenology of this potential is different from the usual hybrid inflation scenario and we analize the possibility that the system of field equations undergo a period of inflation in three different regimes with the dynamics modified by a Randall-Sundrum II term in the Friedmann equation. We find that the system can produce inflation and due to the modification of the dynamics, a period of accelerated contraction can follow or preceed this inflationary stage depending on the sign of one of the parameters of the potential. We discuss on the viability of this model in a cosmological context.
