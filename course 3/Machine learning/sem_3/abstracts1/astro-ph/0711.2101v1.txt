Distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in the central region of the barred spiral galaxy Maffei 2 were investigated using a data set of 12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), CS(2-1) lines and 103 GHz continuum. We found that the offset ridges along the kpc-scale bar continue to the central spiral structure embedded in the weak oval structure which is regarded as x2 orbit in the bar potential. The spiral structure continues toward the center diverging from the oval structure. The size of these structures is less than R ~ 100 pc. The mass concentration within R = 35 pc is estimated to be 2 X 10^8 Mo. The high mass concentration is consistent with theoretical predictions concerning the creation of such a nuclear spiral structure. A comparison with the tracers of dense gas and star-forming region suggests that the dense molecular gas traced by CS(2-1) line is formed at the crossing points of x1 and x2 orbits and the star-forming region appears after 2 X 10^5 yr which is comparable with the free-fall time of the dense gas traced by the CS line (~ 10^5 cm^-3).
