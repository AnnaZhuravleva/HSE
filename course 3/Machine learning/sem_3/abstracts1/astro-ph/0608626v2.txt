We present the formalism and numerical results for torsional oscillations of relativistic stars endowed with a strong dipole magnetic field. We do a systematic search of parameter space by computing torsional mode frequencies for various values of the harmonic index $\ell$ and for various overtones, using an extended sample of models of compact stars, varying in mass, high-density equation of state and crust model. We show that torsional mode frequencies are sensitive to the crust model if the high-density equation of state is very stiff. In addition, torsional mode frequencies are drastically affected by a dipole magnetic field, if the latter has a strength exceeding roughly $10^{15}$G and we find that the magnetic field effects are sensitive to the adopted crust model. Using our extended numerical results we derive empirical relations for the effect of the magnetic field on torsional modes as well as for the crust thickness. We compare our numerical results to observed frequencies in SGRs and find that certain high-density EoS and mass values are favored over others in the non-magnetized limit. On the other hand, if the magnetic field is strong, then its effect has to be taken into account in attempts to formulate a theory of asteroseismology for magnetars.
