The active galactic nucleus PG 1553+113 was observed by the MAGIC telescope in July 2006 during a multiwavelength campaign, in which telescopes in the optical, X-ray, and very high energies participated. Although the MAGIC data were affected by strong atmospheric absorption (calima), they were analyzed after applying a correction. In 8.5 hours, a signal was detected with a significance of 5.0 sigma. The integral flux above 150 GeV was (2.6 +/- 0.9)*10^{-7} ph/s/m^2. By fitting the differential energy spectrum with a power law, a spectral index of -4.1 +/- 0.3 was obtained.
