We report the details of an XMM observation of the cluster of galaxies ZW 1305.4+2941 at the intermediate redshift of z=0.241, increasing the small number of interesting X-ray constraints on properties of ~3 keV systems above z=0.1. Based on the 45 ks XMM observation, we find that within a radius of 228 kpc the cluster has an unabsorbed X-ray flux of 2.07 +/- 0.06 x 10^{-13} erg/cm^2/s, a temperature of kT = 3.17 +/-0.19 keV, in good agreement with the previous ROSAT determination, and an abundance of 0.93 (+0.24,-0.29} solar. Within r_500 = 723 +/- 6 kpc the rest-frame bolometric X-ray luminosity is L_X (r_500)= 1.25 +/- 0.16 x 10^{44} erg/s. The cluster obeys the scaling relations for L_X, T and the velocity dispersion derived at intermediate redshift for kT < 4 keV, for which we provide new fits for all literature objects. The mass derived from an isothermal NFW model fit is, M_vir = 2.77 +/- 0.21 x 10^{14} solar masses, with a concentration parameter, c = 7.9 +/- 0.5.
