The thermal plasma of galaxy clusters lost most of its information on how structure formation proceeded as a result of dissipative processes. In contrast, non-equilibrium distributions of cosmic rays (CR) preserve the information about their injection and transport processes and provide thus a unique window of current and past structure formation processes. This information can be unveiled by observations of non-thermal radiative processes, including radio synchrotron, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. To explore this, we use high-resolution simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters spanning a mass range of about two orders of magnitudes, and follow self-consistent CR physics on top of the radiative hydrodynamics. We model CR electrons that are accelerated at cosmological structure formation shocks and those that are produced in hadronic interactions of CRs with ambient gas protons. We find that CR protons trace the time integrated non-equilibrium activities of clusters while shock-accelerated CR electrons probe current accretion and merging shock waves. The resulting inhomogeneous synchrotron emission matches the properties of observed radio relics. We propose a unified model for the generation of radio halos. Giant radio halos are dominated in the centre by secondary synchrotron emission with a transition to the synchrotron radiation emitted from shock-accelerated electrons in the cluster periphery. This model is able to explain the observed correlation of mergers with radio halos, the larger peripheral variation of the spectral index, and the large scatter in the scaling relation between cluster mass and synchrotron emission. Future low-frequency radio telescopes (LOFAR, GMRT, MWA, LWA) are expected to probe the accretion shocks of clusters. [abridged]
