The Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) has been collecting data for over 30yrs and so observations span nearly three 11yr solar activity cycles. This allows us to address important questions concerning the solar cycle and its effect on solar oscillations, such as: how consistent is the acoustic behaviour from one cycle to the next? We have used the p-mode frequencies observed in BiSON data from one solar activity cycle (cycle 22) to predict the mode frequencies that were observed in the next activity cycle (cycle 23). Some bias in the predicted frequencies was observed when short 108d time series were used to make the predictions. We also found that the accuracy of the predictions was dependent on which activity proxy was used to make the predictions and on the length of the relevant time series.
