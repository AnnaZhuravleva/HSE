The power carried by the jet of blazars is large, compared to the luminosity produced by their accretion disk, and is probably in the form of kinetic energy of a normal electron-proton plasma. The Poynting flux is modest, as suggested by the inconspicuous synchrotron luminosity when compared to the high energy (hard X-rays and gamma-ray) one, assumed to be produced by the inverse Compton process. It is suggested that the jet power and the SED (Spectral Energy Distribution) of its emission are linked to the mass of the black hole M and the accretion rate dot M. This corresponds to a new "blazar sequence" based on M and dot M instead of only the observed blazar luminosity. These ideas can be tested quite easily once the AGILE and especially the GLAST satellite observations, coupled with information in the optical/X-ray band from Swift, will allow the knowledge of the entire SED of hundreds blazars.
