Polarized microwave emission from dust is an important foreground that may contaminate polarized CMB studies unless carefully accounted for. Modeling of polarization from dust requires a quantitative understanding of grain alignment. I review the current status of grain alignment theory outlining recent advances in quantitative description of the alignment. In particular, I show that the grain-alignment theory is a predictive one, and its results nicely match observations. Those indicate that the most important process of alignment is related to radiative torques acting on irregular grains. The recently developed analytical model of radiative torque alignment has proven to be a very efficient tool for predicting the degree of grain alignment. We expect the alignment theory to further mature before CMBPol flight, which would ensure a better accounting for the dust-related polarization. At the same time, CMBPol should provide the additional testing of grain alignment, clarifying the reliability of polarimetry for tracing of magnetic field.
