We present resolved-star VI photometry of the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy IC1613 reaching I~23.5, obtained with the wide-field camera at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope. A fit to the stellar density distribution shows an exponential profile of scale length 2.9' +/- 0.1 and gives a central surface brightness mu_V,0 = 22.7 +/- 0.6. The significant number of red giant branch (RGB) stars present in the outer part of our images (r > 16.5') indicates that the galaxy is actually more extended than previously estimated. A comparison of the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) as a function of galactocentric distance shows a clear gradient in the age of its population, the scale length increasing with age, while we find no evidence of a metallicity gradient from the width of the RGB. We present quantitative results of the recent star formation history from a synthetic CMD analysis using IAC-STAR. We find a mean star formation rate of (1.6 +/- 0.8) x 10^{-3} Mo/yr/kpc^2 in the central r < 2.5' for the last 300 Myr.
