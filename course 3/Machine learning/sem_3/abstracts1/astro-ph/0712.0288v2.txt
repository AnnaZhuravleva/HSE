New results of a Programme of study of BAL + IR + Fe II QSOs (at low and high redshift) are presented. Which are based mainly on deep Gemini GMOS integral field unit (IFU/3D) spectroscopy. We have performed a detailed study of the kinematics, morphological, and physical conditions, in the BAL + IR + Fe II QSO: IRAS 04505-2958. From this study, some selected results are presented, mainly for the 3 expanding giant shells (observed with Gemini). In particular, the GMOS data suggest that the outflow (OF) process -in this IR QSO- generated multiple expanding hypergiant shells (from 10, to 100 kpc), in several extreme explosive events. These new Gemini GMOS data are in good agreement with our evolutionary, explosive and composite Model: where part of the ISM of the host galaxy is ejected in the form of multiple giant shells, mainly by HyN explosions. This process could generate satellite/companion galaxies, and even could expel a high fraction -or all- the host galaxy. In addition, this Model for AGN could give important clue about the physical processes that could explain the origin -in AGNs- of very energetic cosmic rays, detected by the P. Auger Observatory.
