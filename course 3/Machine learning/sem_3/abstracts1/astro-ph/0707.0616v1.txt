We investigate how the geometrical and physical properties of soft X-ray flare kernels change with their altitude above the photosphere. We analyze limb flares well observed by {\em Yohkoh}/SXT showing clear geometry with well separated loop-top kernels. Our analysis concerns relations between kernel size, plasma pressure, energy release and the kernel altitude. We define scaling laws describing how the sizes and its physical properties of kernels vary with the altitude above the photosphere. We interpret the observed relations in terms of the general magnetic structure of active regions.
