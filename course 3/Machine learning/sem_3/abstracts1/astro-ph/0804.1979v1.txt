This is a very short conference proceeding based on a poster shown at the ESO workshop "Science with the VLT in the ELT Era". For more information, see "The Afterglows of Swift-era Gamma-Ray Bursts. I. Comparing pre-Swift and Swift era Long/Soft (Type II) GRB Optical Afterglows" (arXiv:0712.2186) as well as "The Afterglows of Swift-era Gamma-Ray Bursts. II. Short/Hard (Type I) vs. Long/Soft (Type II) Optical Afterglows" (arXiv:0804.1959)
