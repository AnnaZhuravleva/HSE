The near orthogonal distributions of dwarf elliptical (dE) and giant elliptical (E) galaxies in the mu_e-Mag and mu_e-log(R_e) diagrams have been interpreted as evidence for two distinct galaxy formation processes. However, continuous, linear relationships across the alleged dE/E boundary at M_B = -18 mag - such as those between central surface brightness (mu_0) and (i) galaxy magnitude and (ii) light-profile shape (n) - suggest a similar, governing formation mechanism. Here we explain how these latter two linear trends necessitate a different behavior for dE and E galaxies, exactly as observed, in diagrams involving mu_e (and also <mu>_e). A natural consequence is that the distribution of dEs and Es in Fundamental Plane type analyses that use the associated intensity I_e, or <I>_e, are expected to appear different. Together with other linear trends across the alleged dE/E boundary, such as those between luminosity and color, metallicity, and velocity dispersion, it appears that the dEs form a continuous extension to the E galaxies. The presence of partially depleted cores in luminous (M_B < -20.5 mag) Es does however signify the action of a different physical process at the centers (< ~300 pc) of these galaxies.
