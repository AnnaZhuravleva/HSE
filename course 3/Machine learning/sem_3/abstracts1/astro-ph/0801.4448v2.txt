At the surface of the Sun, acoustic waves appear to be affected by the presence of strong magnetic fields in active regions. We explore the possibility that the inclined magnetic field in sunspot penumbrae may convert primarily vertically propagating acoustic waves into elliptical motion. We use helioseismic holography to measure the modulus and phase of the correlation between incoming acoustic waves and the local surface motion within two sunspots. These correlations are modeled assuming the surface motion is elliptical, and we explore the properties of the elliptical motion on the magnetic field inclination. We also demonstrate that the phase shift of the outward propagating waves is opposite to the phase shift of the inward propagating waves in stronger, more vertical fields, but similar to the inward phase shifts in weaker, more inclined fields.
