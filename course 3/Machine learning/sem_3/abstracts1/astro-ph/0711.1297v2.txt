Dark matter caustics are small scale, high density structures believed to exist in galaxies like ours. If the dark matter consists of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, these caustics may be detected by means of the gamma rays produced by dark matter particle annihilation. We discuss particle annihilation in outer and inner caustics and provide sky maps of the expected gamma ray distribution.
