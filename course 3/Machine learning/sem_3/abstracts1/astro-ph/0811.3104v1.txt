We investigate the causes of the different shape of the $K$-band number counts when compared to other bands, analyzing in detail the presence of a change in the slope around $K\sim17.5$. We present a near-infrared imaging survey, conducted at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto Spanish-German Astronomical Center (CAHA), covering two separated fields centered on the HFDN and the Groth field, with a total combined area of $\sim0.27$deg$^{2}$ to a depth of $K\sim19$ ($3\sigma$,Vega). We derive luminosity functions from the observed $K$-band in the redshift range [0.25-1.25], that are combined with data from the references in multiple bands and redshifts, to build up the $K$-band number count distribution. We find that the overall shape of the number counts can be grouped into three regimes: the classic Euclidean slope regime ($d\log N/dm\sim0.6$) at bright magnitudes; a transition regime at intermediate magnitudes, dominated by $M^{\ast}$ galaxies at the redshift that maximizes the product $\phi^{\ast}\frac{dV_{c}}{d\Omega}$; and an $\alpha$ dominated regime at faint magnitudes, where the slope asymptotically approaches -0.4($\alpha$+1) controlled by post-$M^{\ast}$ galaxies. The slope of the $K$-band number counts presents an averaged decrement of $\sim50%$ in the range $15.5<K<18.5$ ($d\log N/dm\sim0.6-0.30$). The rate of change in the slope is highly sensitive to cosmic variance effects. The decreasing trend is the consequence of a prominent decrease of the characteristic density $\phi^{\ast}_{K,obs}$ ($\sim60%$ from $z=0.5$ to $z=1.5$) and an almost flat evolution of $M^{\ast}_{K,obs}$ (1$\sigma$ compatible with $M^{\ast}_{K,obs}=-22.89\pm0.25$ in the same redshift range).
