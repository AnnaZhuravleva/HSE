The origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays is discussed in light of the latest observational results from the Pierre Auger Observatory, highlighting potential astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts, and clusters of galaxies. Key issues include their energy budget, the acceleration and escape of protons and nuclei, and their propagation in extragalactic radiation and magnetic fields. We briefly address the prospects for Telescope Array and future facilities such as JEM-EUSO, and also emphasize the importance of multi-messenger X-ray and gamma-ray signatures in addition to neutrinos as diagnostic tools for source identification.
