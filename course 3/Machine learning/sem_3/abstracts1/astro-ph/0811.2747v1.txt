The penumbra of a sunspot is a fascinating phenomenon featuring complex velocity and magnetic fields. It challenges both our understanding of radiative magneto-convection and our means to measure and derive the actual geometry of the magnetic and velocity fields. In this contribution we attempt to summarize the present state-of-the-art from an observational and a theoretical perspective.
