We examine the published light curves (LCs) of 117 X-ray binary pulsars, focusing on the dependence of their light curves on the observed energy bands. It is found that the energy dependence of the LCs appears only when the X-ray luminosity is larger than ~ 5 x 10^36 erg/s. Assuming that the behavior of light curve is related to the radiative accretion column on the neutron star surface, this energy threshold can be considered as the observational proof of the accretion column formation proposed by Basko and Sunyaev. Once we can grasp the existence of radiative column, we can also obtain several useful informations on the neutron star properties. As an instance, we perform the statistical analysis of the orientation angle of the magnetic axis, and we find that the inclination angle of magnetic axis should be small in order to explain the observed statistics.
