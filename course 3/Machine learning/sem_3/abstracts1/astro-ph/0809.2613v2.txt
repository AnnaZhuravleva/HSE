We analyzed global properties, radial profiles and 2D maps of the metal abundances and temperature in the cool core cluster of galaxies Hydra A using a deep XMM-Newton exposure. The best fit among the available spectral models is provided by a Gaussian distribution of the emission measure (gdem). We can accurately determine abundances for 7 elements in the cluster core with EPIC and 3 elements with RGS. The gdem model gives lower Fe abundances than a single temperature model. The abundance profiles for Fe, Si, S, but also O are centrally peaked. Combining the Hydra A results with 5 other clusters for which detailed chemical abundance studies are available, we find a significant decrease of O with radius, while the increase in the O/Fe ratio with radius is small within 0.1 r_200. We compare the observed abundance ratios with the mixing of various supernova type Ia and core-collapse yield models in different relative amounts. Producing the estimated O, Si and S peaks in Hydra A requires either an amount of metals ejected by stellar winds 3-8 times higher than predicted by available models or a remaining peak in the enrichment by core-collapse supernovae from the protocluster phase. The temperature map shows cooler gas extending in arm-like structures towards the north and south. These structures appear to be richer in metals than the ambient medium and spatially correlated with the large-scale radio lobes. We estimate the mass of cool gas, which was probably uplifted by buoyant bubbles of relativistic plasma produced by the AGN, to 1.6-6.1x10^9 M_sun, and the energy associated with this uplift to 3.3-12.5x10^58 ergs. The best estimate of the mass of Fe uplifted together with the cool gas is 1.7x10^7 M_sun, 15% of the total mass of Fe in the central 0.5arcmin region.
