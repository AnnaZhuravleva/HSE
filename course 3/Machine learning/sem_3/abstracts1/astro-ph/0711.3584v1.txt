Both continuum and emission line flickering are phenomena directly associated with the mass accretion process. In this work we simulate accretion disk Doppler maps including the effects of winds and flickering flares. Synthetic flickering Doppler maps are calculated and the effect of the flickering parameters on the maps is explored. Jets and winds occur in many astrophysical objects where accretion disks are present. Jets are generally absent among the cataclysmic variables (CVs), but there is evidence of mass loss by wind in many objects. CVs are ideal objects to study accretion disks and consequently to study the wind associated with these disks. We also present simulations of accretion disks including the presence of a wind with orbital phase resolution. Synthetic H-alpha line profiles in the optical region are obtained and their corresponding Doppler maps are calculated. The effect of the wind simulation parameters on the wind line profiles is also explored. From this study we verified that optically thick lines and/or emission by diffuse material into the primary Roche lobe are necessary to generate single peaked line profiles, often seen in CVs. The future accounting of these effects is suggested for interpreting Doppler tomography reconstructions.
