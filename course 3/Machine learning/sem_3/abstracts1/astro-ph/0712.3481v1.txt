The understanding of transport processes inside the stars is one of the main goals of asteroseismology. Chemical turbulent mixing can affect the internal distribution of \mu near the energy generating core, having an effect on the evolutionary tracks similar to that of overshooting. This mixing leads to a smoother chemical composition profile near the edge of the convective core, which is reflected in the behavior of the buoyancy frequency and, therefore, in the frequencies of gravity modes. We describe the effects of convective overshooting and turbulent mixing on the frequencies of gravity modes in B-type main sequence stars. In particular, the cases of p-g mixed modes in beta Cep stars and high-order modes in SPBs are considered.
