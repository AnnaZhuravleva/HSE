We present 3D gasdynamic simulations of the Herbig Haro object HH 555. HH 555 is a bipolar jet emerging from the tip of an elephant trunk entering the Pelican Nebula from the adjacent molecular cloud. Both beams of HH 555 are curved away from the center of the H II region. This indicates that they are being deflected by a side-wind probably coming from a star located inside the nebula or by the expansion of the nebula itself. HH 555 is most likely an irradiated jet emerging from a highly embedded protostar, which has not yet been detected.   In our simulations we vary the incident photon flux, which in one of our models is equal to the flux coming from a star 1 pc away emitting 5x10^48 ionizing (i. e., with energies above the H Lyman limit) photons per second. An external, plane-parallel flow (a ``side-wind'') is coming from the same direction as the photoionizing flux. We have made four simulations, decreasing the photon flux by a factor of 10 in each simulation. We discuss the properties of the flow and we compute Halpha emission maps (integrated along lines of sight).   We show that the level of the incident photon flux has an important influence on the shape and visibility of the jet. If the flux is very high, it causes a strong evaporation of the neutral clump, producing a photoevaporated wind traveling in the direction opposite to the incident flow. The interaction of the two flows creates a double shock ``working surface'' around the clump protecting it and the jet from the external flow. The jet only starts to curve when it penetrates through the working surface.
