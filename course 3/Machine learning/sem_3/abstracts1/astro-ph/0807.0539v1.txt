We present the results of population syntheses for binary stars carried out using the ``Scenario Machine'' code with the aim of analyzing events that may result in long gamma-ray bursts. We show that the observed distribution of morphological types of the host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts can be explained in a model in which long gamma-ray bursts result from the core collapse of massive Wolf-Rayet stars in close binaries. The dependence of the burst rate on galaxy type is associated with an increase in the rate of stellar-wind mass-loss with increasing stellar metallicity. The separation of binary components at the end of their evolution increases with the stellar-wind rate, resulting in a reduction of the number of binaries that produce gamma-bursts.
