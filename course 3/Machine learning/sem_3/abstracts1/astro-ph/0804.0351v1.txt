AIMS: Compact groups of galaxies are excellent laboratories for studying galaxy interactions and their effects on the evolution of galaxies. In particular, dynamically young systems, with a large fraction of interacting, late type galaxies, have so far escaped proper studies in the X-ray band and their hot intergalactic medium properties are virtually unknown. Motivated by this lack of knowledge, we present a detailed investigation here of the X-ray properties of such a dynamically young system. METHODS: We obtained XMM-Newton observations of one spiral-only system in the new southern compact group catalogue: SCG0018-4854. We present here the results of the data analysis and discuss them in comparison with the few other similar systems also studied in the X-ray band. RESULTS: The 4 members of SCG0018-4854 emit at a level comparable to what is expected based on their optical properties. We detect the low level diffuse emission between galaxies, which is most likely due to the presence of the intergalactic medium. Compared to other spiral--only groups, this could be the coolest system detected so far, although the measurements have large uncertainties. These results indicate that high quality deep X-ray observations are needed to allow a proper study of the properties of the potential well of dynamically young systems, before more general conclusions can be drawn on their average characteristics.
