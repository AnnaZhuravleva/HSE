In order to examine the hypothesis of the existence of two different kinds of nova populations in the Galaxy - 'disk' novae and 'bulge' novae - the frequency distribution in the z-direction was obtained for 64 novae. The fact that large number of fast novae related to disk novae are found at a significant distance from the Galactic plane (up to z~3700 pc) can't result from photometric measurements errors. Slow novae considered to belong to bulge novae show more close concentration to the Galactic plane (z<1700 pc). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test run on the data showed that the two populations hypothesis probability amounts to 95.56%.
