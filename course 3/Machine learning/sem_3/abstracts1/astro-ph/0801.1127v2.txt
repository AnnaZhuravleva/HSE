(Abridged) We use cosmological N-body simulations to study the properties of substructure halos in galaxy-sized dark matter halos. We extend prior work on the subject by considering the whole population of subhalos physically associated with the main system. These are defined as subhalos that have at some time in the past been within the virial radius of the halo's main progenitor and that have survived as self-bound entities to $z=0$. We find that this population extends beyond {\it three times} the virial radius, and contains objects on extreme orbits. We trace the origin of these unorthodox orbits to the tidal dissociation of bound groups of subhalos, which results in the ejection of some subhalos along tidal streams. Ejected subhalos are primarily low-mass systems, leading to mass-dependent biases in their spatial distribution and kinematics: the lower the subhalo mass at accretion time, the less centrally concentrated and kinematically hotter their descendant population. The bias is strongest amongst the most massive subhalos, but disappears at the low-mass end. Our findings imply that subhalos identified within the virial radius represent an incomplete census of the substructure physically related to a halo: only about {\it one half} of all associated subhalos are found today within the virial radius of a halo. These results may explain the age dependence of the clustering of low-mass halos, and has implications for (i) the interpretation of the structural parameters and assembly histories of halos neighboring massive systems; (ii) the existence of low-mass dynamical outliers in the Local Group; and (iii) the presence of evidence for evolutionary effects well outside the traditional virial boundary of a galaxy system.
