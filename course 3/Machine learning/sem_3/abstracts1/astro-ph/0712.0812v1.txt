Results are presented from a pilot survey of 3.3 micron PAH emission from planetary nebulae using FLITECAM, an instrument intended for airborne astronomy with SOFIA. The observations were made during ground-based commissioning of FLITECAM's spectroscopic mode at the 3-m Shane telescope at Lick Observatory. Direct-ruled KRS-5 grisms were used to give a resolving power (R)~1,700. Targets were selected from IRAS, KAO and ISO sources with previously observed PAH emission at longer wavelengths. AGB stars and PN with C/O ratios < 1 were also added to the target list in order to test PAH detection thresholds. In all, 20 objects were observed. PAH emission was detected in 11 out of 20 observed targets.
