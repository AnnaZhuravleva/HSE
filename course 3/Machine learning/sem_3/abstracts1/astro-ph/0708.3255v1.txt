We are presenting a wide-field image of the Mon R2 star forming region obtained with WFCAM on UKIRT in the 2.12 micron filter centered on the H2 1--0 S(1) emission line. We report the discovery of 15 new H2 jets in Mon R2 and two in L 1646 and confirm most of these discoveries using archival Spitzer IRAC 4.5 and 8.0 micron images. We find that many of these protostellar jets are found in projection against the outflow cavities of the huge CO outflow in Mon R2, suggesting that the jets may be associated with an episode of star formation in Mon R2 triggered by this large, but now fossil, outflow. We also study the spatial distribution of small, localized reflection nebulae and find that these are distributed in the same way as photometrically identified Class I sources.
