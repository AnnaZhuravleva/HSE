Mirror dark matter provides a simple framework for which to explain the DAMA/Libra annual modulation signal consistently with the null results of the other direct detection experiments. The simplest possibility involves ordinary matter interacting with mirror dark matter via photon-mirror photon kinetic mixing of strength epsilon ~ 10^(-9). We confirm that photon-mirror photon mixing of this magnitude is consistent with constraints from ordinary Big Bang nucleosynthesis as well as the more stringent constraints from cosmic microwave background measurements and large scale structure considerations.
