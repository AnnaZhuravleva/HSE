If taken into account, the transmission of the particle-scattering turbulence --in addition to just the particles-- through the shock front can change the effective compression ratio felt by the accelerating particles significantly from the compression of the underlying plasma. This can lead to significantly harder energy spectra than what are traditionally predicted assuming frozen-in turbulence. I consider the applicability and limitations of turbulence transmission scenario in parallel shock waves of different thickness, its consequences in AGN and microquasar environments, and discuss the possible effects to the spectrum of the accelerated particles.
