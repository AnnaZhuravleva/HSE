We calculate the wavelength dependence of the ratio of the linear polarization degree to extinction (polarizing efficiency) $P(\lambda)/A(\lambda)$ from the ultraviolet to near-infrared. The prolate and oblate particles with aspect ratios from $a/b=1.1$ up to 10 are assumed to be rotating and partially aligned with the mechanism of paramagnetic relaxation (Davis--Greenstein). Size/shape/orientation effects are analyzed. It is found that the wavelength dependence of $P(\lambda)/A(\lambda)$ is mainly determined by the particle composition and size whereas the values of $P(\lambda)/A(\lambda)$ depend on the particle shape, degree and direction of alignment.
