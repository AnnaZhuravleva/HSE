Three Algol-type binaries in Cygnus constellation were selected for an analysis from a huge database of observations made by the INTEGRAL/OMC camera. These data were processed and analyzed, resulting in a first light-curve study of these neglected eclipsing binaries. The temperatures of the primary components range from 9500 K to 10500 K and the inclinations are circa 73deg (for PV Cyg and V1011 Cyg), while almost 90deg for V822 Cyg. All of them seem to be main-sequence stars, well within their critical Roche lobes. Nevertheless, further detailed analyses are still needed.
