We derive new constraints on the mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo, based on a set of halo stars from SDSS as kinematic tracers. Our sample comprises 2401 rigorously selected Blue Horizontal-Branch (BHB) halo stars drawn from SDSS DR-6. To interpret these distributions, we compare them to matched mock observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation simulations designed to resemble the Milky Way, which we presume to have an appropriate orbital distribution of halo stars. We then determine which value of $\rm V_{cir}(r)$ brings the observed distribution into agreement with the corresponding distributions from the simulations. This procedure results in an estimate of the Milky Way's circular velocity curve to $\sim 60$ kpc, which is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of $\rm 220 km s^{-1}$ at the Sun's location, and implies M$(<60 \rm kpc) = 4.0\pm 0.7\times 10^{11}$M$_\odot$. The radial dependence of $\rm V_{cir}(r)$, derived in statistically independent bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations from an NFW dark matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center. If we assume an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration holds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the Milky Way's dark matter halo, M$_{\rm vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times 10^{12}$M$_\odot$, which is lower than many previous estimates. This estimate implies that nearly 40% of the baryons within the virial radius of the Milky Way's dark matter halo reside in the stellar components of our Galaxy. A value for M$_{\rm vir}$ of only $\sim 1\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ also (re-)opens the question of whether all of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies are on bound orbits.
