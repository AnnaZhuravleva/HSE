During the last few years there were discovered and deeply examined several transient neutron stars (Rotating Radio Transients). It is already well accepted that these objects are rotating neutron stars. But their extraordinary features (burst-like behavior) made necessary revision of well accepted models of pulsar interior structure. Nowadays most popular model for RRATs is precessing pulsar model, which is the subject of big discussion. We assume that these objects are pulsars with specific spin parameters. An important feature of our model, naturally explaining most of the properties of these neutron stars, is presence of very low frequency, nearly transverse drift waves propagating across the magnetic field and encircling the open field lines region of the pulsar magnetosphere.
