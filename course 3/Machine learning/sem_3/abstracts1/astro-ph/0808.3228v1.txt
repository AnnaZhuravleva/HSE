Self-gravitational fluid mechanical methods termed hydro-gravitational-dynamics (HGD) predict plasma fragmentation 0.03 Myr after the turbulent big bang to form protosuperclustervoids, turbulent protosuperclusters, and protogalaxies at the 0.3 Myr transition from plasma to gas. Linear protogalaxyclusters fragment at 0.003 Mpc viscous-inertial scales along turbulent vortex lines or in spirals, as observed. The plasma protogalaxies fragment on transition into white-hot planet-mass gas clouds (PFPs) in million-solar-mass clumps (PGCs) that become globular-star-clusters (GCs) from tidal forces or dark matter (PGCs) by freezing and diffusion into 0.3 Mpc halos with 97% of the galaxy mass. The weakly collisional non-baryonic dark matter diffuses to > Mpc scales and frag-ments to form galaxy cluster halos. Stars and larger planets form by binary mergers of the trillion PFPs per PGC on 0.03 Mpc galaxy accretion disks. Star deaths depend on rates of planet accretion and internal star mixing. Moderate accretion rates produce white dwarfs that evaporate surrounding gas planets by spin-radiation to form planetary nebulae before Supernova Ia events, dimming some events to give systematic distance errors misinterpreted as the dark energy hypothesis and overestimates of the universe age. Failures of standard LCDM cosmological models reflect not only obsolete Jeans 1902 fluid mechanical assumptions, but also failures of standard turbulence models that claim the cascade of turbulent kinetic energy is from large scales to small. Because turbulence is always driven at all scales by inertial-vortex forces the turbulence cascade is always from small scales to large.
