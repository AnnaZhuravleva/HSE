The shapes of neutrino spectra and fluxes from representative stars in the solar neighborhood up to 10 pc are calculated. The individual contribution of the most important, specific stellar objects (the alpha-Centauri system, Sirius A, Procyon, Vega, Fomalhaut and Altair) are determined and investigated by detailed stellar modeling. The possibility for a potential detection is discussed.
