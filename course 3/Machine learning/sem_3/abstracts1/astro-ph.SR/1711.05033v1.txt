Among the solar fusion reactions, the rate of the $^7$Be($p,\gamma$)$^8$B reaction is one of the most difficult to determine rates. In a number of previous experiments, its astrophysical $S$-factor has been measured at $E$ = 0.1-2.5 MeV center-of-mass energy. However, no experimental data is available below 0.1 MeV. Thus, an extrapolation to solar energies is necessary, resulting in significant uncertainty for the extrapolated $S$-factor. On the other hand, the measured solar neutrino fluxes are now very precise. Therefore, the problem of the $S$-factor determination is turned around here: Using the measured $^7$Be and $^8$B neutrino fluxes and the Standard Solar Model, the $^7$Be($p,\gamma$)$^8$B astrophysical $S$-factor is determined at the solar Gamow peak. In addition, the $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be $S$-factor is redetermined with a similar method.
