We advocate the idea that the surprising emission of extreme ultra violet (EUV) radiation and soft x-rays from the Sun are powered externally by incident dark matter (DM) particles. The energy and the spectral shape of this otherwise unexpected solar irradiation is estimated within the quark nugget dark matter model. This model was originally invented as a natural explanation of the observed ratio $\Omega_{\rm dark} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ when the DM and visible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude values. This generic consequence of the model is a result of the common origin of both types of matter which are formed during the same QCD transition and both proportional to the same fundamental dimensional parameter $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. We also present arguments suggesting that the transient brightening-like "nano-flares" in the Sun may be related to the annihilation events which inevitably occur in the solar atmosphere within this dark matter scenario.
