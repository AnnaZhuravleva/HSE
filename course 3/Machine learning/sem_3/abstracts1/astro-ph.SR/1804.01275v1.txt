The evolution of the remnant of the merger of two white dwarfs is still an open problem. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the case in which the remnant is a magnetic white dwarf with a mass larger than the Chandrasekhar limiting mass. Angular momentum losses might bring the remnant of the merger to the physical conditions suitable for developing a thermonuclear explosion. Alternatively, the remnant may be prone to gravitational or rotational instabilities, depending on the initial conditions reached after the coalescence. Dipole magnetic braking is one of the mechanisms that can drive such losses of angular momentum. However, the timescale on which these losses occur depend on several parameters, like the strength of the magnetic field. In addition, the coalescence leaves a surrounding Keplerian disk that can be accreted by the newly formed white dwarf. Here we compute the post-merger evolution of a super-Chandrasekhar magnetized white dwarf taking into account all the relevant physical processes. These include magnetic torques acting on the star, accretion from the Keplerian disk, the threading of the magnetic field lines through the disk, as well as the thermal evolution of the white dwarf core. We find that the central remnant can reach the conditions suitable to develop a thermonuclear explosion before other instabilities (such as the inverse beta-decay instability or the secular axisymmetric instability) are reached, which would instead lead to gravitational collapse of the magnetized remnant.
