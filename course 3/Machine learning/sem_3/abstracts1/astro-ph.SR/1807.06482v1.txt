The paper considers Euler-Poisson equations which govern the steady state of a self gravitating, rotating, axi-symmetric stars under the additional assumption that it is composed of incompressible stratified fluid. The original system of six nonlinear equations is reduced to two equations, one for the mass density and the other for gravitational field. This reduction is carried out separately in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. As a "byproduct" we derive also expressions for the pressure. The resulting equations are then solved approximately and these analytic solutions are used then to determine the shape of the rotating star.
