The resemblance between the tensor networks (TNs) and machine learning has drawn considerable attention. In particular, TNs and deep learning architectures bear striking similarities suggesting using quantum techniques for machine learning. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve image recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the multipartite entanglement renormalization ansatz. This approach overcomes scalability issues and implies novel mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information theory, and machine learning. The algorithm optimally encodes each image class into a TN state, so that the learning tasks as well as the image classes can be characterized by quantum properties of the state including quantum entanglement and fidelity. Furthermore, the unitary conditions of the local mappings in our algorithm make it possible to realize the machine learning by, e.g., quantum state tomography techniques or quantum computations.
