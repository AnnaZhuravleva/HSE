Variational Bayes (VB) inference is one of the most important algorithms in machine learning and widely used in engineering and industry. However, VB is known to suffer from the problem of local optima. In this Letter, we generalize VB by using quantum mechanics, and propose a new algorithm, which we call quantum annealing variational Bayes (QAVB) inference. We then show that QAVB drastically improve the performance of VB by applying them to a clustering problem described by a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, we discuss an intuitive understanding on how QAVB works well.
