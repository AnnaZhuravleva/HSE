Hydra is a header-only, templated and C++11-compliant framework designed to perform the typical bottleneck calculations found in common HEP data analyses on massively parallel platforms. The framework is implemented on top of the C++11 Standard Library and a variadic version of the Thrust library and is designed to run on Linux systems, using OpenMP, CUDA and TBB enabled devices. This contribution summarizes the main features of Hydra. A basic description of the overall design, functionality and user interface is provided, along with some code examples and measurements of performance.
