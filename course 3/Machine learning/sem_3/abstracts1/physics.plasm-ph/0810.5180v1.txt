Modulational excitation of longitudinal photons (photonikos) and electron Langmuir waves, as well as ion sound waves by an incoherent strong and superstrong radiation (high-power short pulse lasers, non-thermal equilibrium cosmic field radiation, etc.) in plasmas are investigated. A simultaneous generation of photonikos and plasmons are demonstrated. Furthermore, the kinetic instability is considered when a low frequency photonikos are generated alone. Growth rates of these new modes are obtained.
