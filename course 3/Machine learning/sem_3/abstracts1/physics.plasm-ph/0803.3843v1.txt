A novel method to derive stationary solutions of the Vlasov-Maxwell system is established. This method is based on the assumption that the deviation of the velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can be expanded by the Hermite polynomials. By applying our method, a new two-dimensional equilibrium is derived, which may provide an initial setup for investigations of three-dimensional collisionless reconnection of magnetic fields.
