A kinetic theory for spin plasmas is put forward, generalizing those of previous authors. In the model, the ordinary phase space is extended to include the spin degrees of freedom. Together with Maxwell's equations, the system is shown to be energy conserving. Analysing the linear properties, it is found that new types of wave-particle resonances are possible, that depend directly on the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. As a result new wave modes, not present in the absence of spin, appear. The implications of our results are discussed.
