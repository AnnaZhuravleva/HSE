The quantum effect on the Weibel instability in an unmagnetized plasma is presented. Our analysis shows that the quantum effect tends to stabilize the Weibel instability in the hydrodynamic regime, whereas it produces a new oscillatory instability in the kinetic regime. A novel effect the quantum damping, which is associated with the Landau damping, is disclosed. The new quantum Weibel instability may be responsible for the generation of non-stationary magnetic fields in compact astrophysical objects as well as in the forthcoming intense laser-solid density plasma experiments.
