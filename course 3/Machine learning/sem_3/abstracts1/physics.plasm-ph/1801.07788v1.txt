We study the possibility of the existence of the electric current, formed by massive electrons and positrons, along the external magnetic field. The charged fermions are supposed to have nonzero anomalous magnetic moments and electroweakly interact with background matter. The expression for the current is obtained on the basis of the exact solution of the Dirac equation in the corresponding external fields. We demonstrate that such a current is vanishing for any characteristics of the electron-positron plasma as well as the external fields. Our results are compared with the recent findings of other authors.
