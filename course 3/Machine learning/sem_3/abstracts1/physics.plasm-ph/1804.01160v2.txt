If an electric charge is accelerated by a sufficiently intense electromagnetic field, the effects of the radiation emitted by the charge on the charge dynamics (radiation reaction) cannot be ignored. Here we show that classical radiation-reaction effects alter qualitatively and quantitatively the infrared behavior of the spectrum of the radiation emitted by an electron in the presence of an intense electromagnetic plane wave (nonlinear Thomson scattering). An analytical expression of the infrared limit of nonlinear Thomson scattering is provided, which includes radiation-reaction effects and is valid for an arbitrary plane wave. Apart from their own conceptual importance and as a signature of classical radiation reaction, these results provide the limiting expression of the corresponding and yet unknown exact infrared behavior of strong-field QED in an intense plane wave.
