Starting from the non-relativistic Pauli description of spin-1/2 particles, a set of fluid equations, governing the dynamics of such particles interacting with external fields and other particles, is derived. The equations describe electrons, positrons, holes, and similar conglomerates. In the case of electrons, the magnetohydrodynamic limit of an electron-ion plasma is investigated. The results should be of interest and relevance both to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.
