Laser photons traveling through a plasma can be considered to acquire an effective mass. This modifies the well-known Volkov states of an electron dressed by a strong laser-field propagating through a plasma from the vacuum case and consequently all quantum electrodynamical effects triggered by the electron. Here we present an in-depth study of the basic process of photon emission by an electron scattered from an intense short laser pulse inside a plasma, labeled nonlinear Compton scattering, based on modified Volkov solutions derived from first principles. Consequences of the massive photon effects on the Compton spectra of emitted photons and implications for the high-intensity laser-plasma experiments are pointed out.
