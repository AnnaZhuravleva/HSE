The radiated energy from a current is determined by the form of finite radiation field within a theoretical model, according to the Poynting theorem. QED's expectation value of the only measurable lowest optical transverse mode of the free-electron laser is not in phase with the average of the mode over the transverse plane, because of the difference between the QED's model of the mode, the local-retarded plane wave, and the true non-local mode. The two Fourier components of the average of the mode which are in quadrature to each other can be considered as the two conjugate variables of the Hamiltonian, and the photon count is sensitive to the uncertainty along only the quadrature which is in phase with QED's expectation value of the mode. Then, because of the correspondence principle and the energy conservation, the Fourier component of the average of the mode which is in quadrature with QED's expectation value of the mode may squeeze the zero point fluctuations to create the amplitude squeezed state and can be traced by variance but not by mean of the photon statistics. This phenomenon may explain the previously observed sub-Poisson fluctuations in the intensity of the coherent spontaneous harmonic radiation emitted by the MARKIII infrared free-electron laser.
