The non-linear (strong-field) Breit-Wheeler $e^+e^-$ pair production by a probe photon traversing two consecutive short and ultra short (sub-cycle) laser pulses is considered within a QED framework. The temporal shape of the pulses and the distance between them are essential for the differential cross section as a function of the azimuthal angle distribution of the outgoing electron (positron). The found effect of a pronounced azimuthal anisotropy is important for sub-cycle pulses and decreases rapidly with increasing width of the individual pulses.
