The growth rate of the filamentation instability triggered when a diluted cold electron beam passes through a cold plasma is evaluated using the quantum hydrodynamic equations. Compared with a cold fluid model, quantum effects reduce both the unstable wave vector domain and the maximum growth rate. Stabilization of large wave vector modes is always achieved, but significant reduction of the maximum growth rate depends on a dimensionless parameter that is provided. Although calculations are extended to the relativistic regime, they are mostly relevant to the non-relativistic one.
