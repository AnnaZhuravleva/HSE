The rapid evolution of technology and the parallel increasing complexity of algorithmic analysis in HEP requires developers to acquire a much larger portfolio of programming skills. Young researchers graduating from universities worldwide currently do not receive adequate preparation in the very diverse fields of modern computing to respond to growing needs of the most advanced experimental challenges. There is a growing consensus in the HEP community on the need for training programmes to bring researchers up to date with new software technologies, in particular in the domains of concurrent programming and artificial intelligence. We review some of the initiatives under way for introducing new training programmes and highlight some of the issues that need to be taken into account for these to be successful.
