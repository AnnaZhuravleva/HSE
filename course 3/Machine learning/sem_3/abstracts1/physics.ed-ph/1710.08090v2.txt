The fundamental principles of quantum mechanics are considered to be hard for understanding by unprepared listeners, many attempts of its popularization turned out to be either difficult to grasp or incorrect. We propose quantum cryptography as a very effective tool for quantum physics introduction as it has the desired property set to intrigue students and outline the basic quantum principles. A modular desktop quantum cryptography setup that can be used for both educational and research purposes is presented. The carried out laboratory and field tests demonstrated usability and reliability of the developed system.
