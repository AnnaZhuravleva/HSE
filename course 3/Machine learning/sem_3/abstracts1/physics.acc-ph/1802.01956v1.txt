The plasma-based acceleration is an encouraging technique to overcome the limits of the accelerating gradient in the conventional RF acceleration. A plasma accelerator is able to provide accelerating fields up to hundreds of $GeV/m$, paving the way to accelerate particles to several MeV over a short distance (below the millimetre range). Here the characteristics of preliminary electron beams obtained with the self-injection mechanism produced with the FLAME high-power laser at the SPARC_LAB test facility are shown. In detail, with an energy laser on focus of $1.5\ J$ and a pulse temporal length (FWHM) of $40\ fs$, we obtained an electron plasma density due to laser ionization of about $6 \times 10^{18}\ cm^{-3}$, electron energy up to $350\ MeV$ and beam charge in the range $(50 - 100)\ pC$.
