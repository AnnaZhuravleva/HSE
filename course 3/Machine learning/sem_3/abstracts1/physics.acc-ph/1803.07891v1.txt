Muons have been accelerated by using a radio frequency accelerator for the first time. Negative muonium atoms (Mu$^-$), which are bound states of positive muons ($\mu^+$) and two electrons, are generated from $\mu^+$'s through the electron capture process in an aluminum degrader. The generated Mu$^-$'s are initially electrostatically accelerated and injected into a radio frequency quadrupole linac (RFQ). In the RFQ, the Mu$^-$'s are accelerated to 89 keV. The accelerated Mu$^-$'s are identified by momentum measurement and time of flight. This compact muon linac opens the door to various muon accelerator applications including particle physics measurements and the construction of a transmission muon microscope.
