In this paper, we demonstrate the connection between a magnetic storage ring with additional sextupole fields set so that the x and y chromaticities vanish and the maximizing of the lifetime of in-plane polarization (IPP) for a 0.97-GeV/c deuteron beam. The IPP magnitude was measured by continuously monitoring the down-up scattering asymmetry (sensitive to sideways polarization) in an in-beam, carbon-target polarimeter and unfolding the precession of the IPP due to the magnetic anomaly of the deuteron. The optimum operating conditions for a long IPP lifetime were made by scanning the field of the storage ring sextupole magnet families while observing the rate of IPP loss during storage of the beam. The beam was bunched and electron cooled. The IPP losses appear to arise from the change of the orbit circumference, and consequently the particle speed and spin tune, due to the transverse betatron oscillations of individual particles in the beam. The effects of these changes are canceled by an appropriate sextupole field setting.
