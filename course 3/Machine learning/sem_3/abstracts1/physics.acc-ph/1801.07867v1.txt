This paper describes the concept for the DArk Sector Experiments at LCLS-II (DASEL) facility which provides a near-CW beam of multi-GeV electrons to the SLAC End Station A for experiments in particle physics. The low-current multi-GeV electron beam is produced parasitically by the superconducting RF linac for the LCLS-II X-ray Free Electron Laser, which is under construction at SLAC. DASEL is designed to host experiments to detect light dark matter such as the Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) but can be configured to support a wide range of other experiments requiring current ranging from pico-amps to micro-amps.
