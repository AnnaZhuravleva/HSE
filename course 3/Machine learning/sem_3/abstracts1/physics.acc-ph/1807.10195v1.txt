An advanced Normal Conducting Radio Frequency (NCRF) C-band linear accelerator (linac) structure has been designed for a high gradient, high power e$^+$e$^-$ linear collider in the TeV class. The structure features internal manifolds for distributing RF power separately to each cell, permitting the full structure geometry to be designed for high shunt impedance and low breakdown. In addition, the structure is cooled directly by liquid nitrogen (LN), further increasing the shunt impedance. A crucial part of the design process has been cost optimization, and based on achieving the DOE-HEP GARD goal for RF power of $2/peak kW, the linac would be substantially cheaper than current designs.
