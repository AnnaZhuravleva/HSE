Misplacement of electrostatic elements can pose false EDM signal in a storage ring EDM experiment because of coupling between vertical electric field and magnetic dipole moment. A vertically misplaced quadrupole introduces electric field proportional to its misplacement, changing periodically in the particle's rest frame during the storage. This leads to accumulation of vertical spin component at every revolution. We investigated this effect by simulating a proton in an all-electric ring with several quadrupole scenarios. It turns out that the misplacement of quadrupoles is a critical item to keep under control, for which we propose several methods. These include tuning the frequency of the RF cavity, making use of additional correction quadrupoles and using quadrupoles with weaker focusing strength.
