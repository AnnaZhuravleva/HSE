The RIBLL2 in-flight separator at IMP, the secondary beam line between two storage rings at the \blue{\uwave{Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR)}}, has been commissioned to study the rare-isotope beam (RIB) physics at around 300 MeV/nucleon for the first time, in combination of the external target facility (ETF). The unambiguous particle identification in mass and charge states for $^{18}$O and $^{40}$Ar fragments has been achieved in recent experiments. A full realization of RIBLL2 will open many potentials to address important RIB physics problems at around 300 MeV/nucleon.
