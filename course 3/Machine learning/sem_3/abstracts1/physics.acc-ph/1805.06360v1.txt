This note describes two versatile accelerator complexes that could be built at a Future Circular Collider (FCC) in order to produce $e^{+}e^{-}$, $\gamma\gamma$ and $ep$ collisions. The first facility is an SLC-type machine comprising a superconducting L-band linear accelerator (linac) and two arcs of bending magnets inside the FCC tunnel. Accelerated by the linac, electron and positron beams would traverse the arcs in opposite directions and collide at centre-of-mass energies considerably exceeding those attainable at circular $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders. The proposed SLC-type facility would have the same luminosity as a conventional two-linac $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. The L-band linac may form a part of the injector chain for a 100-TeV proton collider inside the FCC tunnel (FCC-pp), and could deliver electron or positron beams for an $ep$ collider (FCC-ep). The second facility is an ILC-based $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider placed tangentially to the circular FCC tunnel. If the collider is positioned asymmetrically with respect to the FCC tunnel, electron (or positron) bunches could be accelerated by both linacs before they are brought into collision with the 50-TeV beams from the FCC-pp proton storage ring. The two linacs may also form a part of the injector chain for FCC-pp. Each facility could be converted into a $\gamma\gamma$ collider or a source of multi-MW beams for fixed-target experiments.
