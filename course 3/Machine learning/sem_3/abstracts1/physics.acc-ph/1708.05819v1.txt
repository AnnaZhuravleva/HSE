We discuss a low energy $e^+e^-$ collider for production of the not yet observed ($\mu^+\mu^-$) bound system (dimuonium). Collider with large crossing angle for $e^+e^-$ beams intersection produces dimuonium with non-zero momentum, therefore, its decay point is shifted from the beam collision area providing effective suppression of the elastic $e^+e^-$ scattering background. The experimental constraints define subsequent collider specifications. We show preliminary layout of the accelerator and obtained main parameters. High luminosity in chosen beam energy range allows to study $\pi^\pm$ and $\eta$ -mesons.
