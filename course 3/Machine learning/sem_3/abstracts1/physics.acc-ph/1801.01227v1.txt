The series of the experiments on precise mass measurement of $J/\Psi$-, $\Psi'$- mesons have been performed in 2002-2004. Energy calibration has been done with the help of the resonant depolarization technique. The present paper discusses the influence of the vertical orbit distortions on the accuracy of the energy calibration. The sources of the orbit distortions are misalignments of the quadrupoles and sextupoles in vertical plane and kicks of the vertical correctors. Comparison with previously published papers is presented.
