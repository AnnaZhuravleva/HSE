In this work, our statements are based on the progress of current research on superatomic clusters. Combining the new trend of materials and device manufacture at the atomic level, we analyzed the opportunities for the development based on the use of superatomic clusters as units of functional materials, and presented a foresight of this new branch of science with relevant studies on superatoms.
