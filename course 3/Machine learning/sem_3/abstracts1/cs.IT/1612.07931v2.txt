The diamond norm plays an important role in quantum information and operator theory. Recently, it has also been proposed as a reguralizer for low-rank matrix recovery. The norm constants that bound the diamond norm in terms of the nuclear norm (also known as trace norm) are explicitly known. This note provides a simple characterization of all operators saturating the upper and the lower bound.
