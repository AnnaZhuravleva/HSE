In this paper we propose a new model for arbitrarily varying classical-quantum channels. In this model a jammer has side information. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario the jammer knows the channel input, while in the second scenario the jammer knows both the channel input and the message. The transmitter and receiver share a secret random key with a vanishing key rate. We determine the capacity for both average and maximum error criteria for both scenarios. We also establish the strong converse. We show that all these corresponding capacities are equal, which means that additionally revealing the message to the jammer does not change the capacity.
