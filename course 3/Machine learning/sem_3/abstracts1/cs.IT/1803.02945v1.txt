This paper considers the comparison of noisy channels from the viewpoint of statistical decision theory. Various orderings are discussed, all formalizing the idea that one channel is "better" than another for information transmission. The main result is an equivalence relation that is proved for classical channels, quantum channels with classical encoding, and quantum channels with quantum encoding.
