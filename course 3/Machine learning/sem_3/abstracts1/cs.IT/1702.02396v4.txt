We study the problem of entanglement-assisted quantum state redistribution in the one-shot setting and provide a new achievability result on the quantum communication required. Our bounds are in terms of the max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy. We use the techniques of convex split and position-based decoding to arrive at our result. We show that our result is upper bounded by the result obtained in Berta, Christandl, Touchette (2016).
