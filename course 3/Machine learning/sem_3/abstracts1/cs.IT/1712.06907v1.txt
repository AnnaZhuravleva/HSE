We give sufficient conditions for self-orthogonality with respect to symplectic, Euclidean and Hermitian inner products of a wide family of quasi-cyclic codes of index two. We provide lower bounds for the symplectic weight and the minimum distance of the involved codes. Supported in the previous results, we show algebraic constructions of good quantum codes and determine their parameters.
