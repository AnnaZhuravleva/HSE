We show that the Segal topos of derived stacks over simplicial commutative $k$-algebras, which can be used to model natural phenomena, has a subobject classifier, something we regard as being a source from which dynamics is generated. This is done by considering the $\infty$-category associated to such a Segal topos, which turns out to be an $\infty$-topos. At this point we have the formalism of Higher topoi at our disposal to deal with Higher Category Theory concepts in a transparent manner.
