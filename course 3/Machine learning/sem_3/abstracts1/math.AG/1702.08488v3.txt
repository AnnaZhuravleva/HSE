We propose a definition of Vafa-Witten invariants counting semistable Higgs pairs on a polarised surface. We use virtual localisation applied to Mochizuki/Joyce-Song pairs.   For $K_S\le0$ we expect our definition coincides with an alternative definition using weighted Euler characteristics. We prove this for deg $K_S<0$ here, and it is proved for $S$ a K3 surface in \cite{MT}.   For K3 surfaces we calculate the invariants in terms of modular forms which generalise and prove conjectures of Vafa and Witten.
