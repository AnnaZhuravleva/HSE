Zhegalkin Zebra Motives are tilings of the plane by black and white polygons created by certain 01-valued functions. They exhibit a rich geometric structure and provide easy to draw insightful visualizations of many topics in the physics and mathematics literature, like dimer models, quivers with relations, alternating link diagrams and quadrangle tilings of tori. The present paper gives some pieces of a general theory and a few explicit examples. More examples will be shown in a separate paper.
