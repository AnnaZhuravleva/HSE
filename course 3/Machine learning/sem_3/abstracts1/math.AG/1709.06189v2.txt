We consider the Gauss-Manin differential equations for hypergeometric integrals associated with a family of weighted arrangements of hyperplanes moving parallelly to themselves. We reduce these equations modulo a prime integer $p$ and construct polynomial solutions of the new differential equations as $p$-analogs of the initial hypergeometric integrals.   In some cases we interpret the $p$-analogs of the hypergeometric integrals as sums over points of hypersurfaces defined over the finite field $F_p$. That interpretation is similar to the interpretation by Yu.I. Manin in [Ma] of the number of point on an elliptic curve depending on a parameter as a solution of a classical hypergeometric differential equation.   We discuss the associated Bethe ansatz.
