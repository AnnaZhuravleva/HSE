We study the relative orbifold Donaldson-Thomas theory of $[\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}]\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We establish a correspondence between the DT theory relative to 3 fibers to quantum multiplication by divisors in the Hilbert scheme of points on $[\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}]$. This determines the whole theory if a further nondegeneracy condition is assumed. The result can also be viewed as a crepant resolution correspondence to the DT theory of $\mathcal{A}_n\times \mathbb{P}^1$.
