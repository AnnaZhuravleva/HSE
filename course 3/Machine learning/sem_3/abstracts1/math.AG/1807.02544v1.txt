These notes were born out of a five-hour lecture series for graduate students at the May 2018 Snowbird workshop Crossing the Walls in Enumerative Geometry. After a short primer on equivariant cohomology and localization, we provide proofs of the genus-zero mirror theorems for the quintic threefold, first in Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory and then in Gromov-Witten theory. We make no claim to originality, except in exposition, where special emphasis is placed on peeling away the standard technical machinery and viewing the mirror theorems as closed-formula manifestations of elementary localization recursions.
