We study the supergeometry of complex projective superspaces $\mathbb{P}^{n|m}$. First, we provide formulas for the cohomology of invertible sheaves of the form $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n|m}} (\ell)$, that are pull-back of ordinary invertible sheaves on the reduced variety $\mathbb{P}^n$. Next, by studying the even Picard group $\mbox{Pic}_0 (\mathbb{P}^{n|m})$, classifying invertible sheaves of rank $1|0$, we show that the sheaves $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb {P}^{n|m}} (\ell)$ are not the only invertible sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^{n|m}$, but there are also new genuinely supersymmetric invertible sheaves that are unipotent elements in the even Picard group. We study the $\Pi$-Picard group $\mbox{Pic}_\Pi (\mathbb{P}^{n|m})$, classifying $\Pi$-invertible sheaves of rank $1|1$, proving that there are also non-split $\Pi$-invertible sheaves on supercurves $\mathbb{P}^{1|m}$. Further, we investigate infinitesimal automorphisms and first order deformations of $\mathbb{P}^{n|m}$, by studying the cohomology of the tangent sheaf using a supersymmetric generalisation of the Euler exact sequence. A special special attention is paid to the meaningful case of supercurves $\mathbb{P}^{1|m}$ and of Calabi-Yau's $\mathbb{P}^{n|n+1}$. Last, with an eye to applications to physics, we show in full detail how to endow $\mathbb{P}^{1|2}$ with the structure of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Riemann surface and we obtain its SUSY-preserving infinitesimal automorphisms from first principles, that prove to be the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp} (2|2)$. A particular effort has been devoted to keep the exposition as concrete and explicit as possible.
