We show that normalized quantum K-theoretic vertex functions for cotangent bundles of partial flag varieties are the eigenfunctions of quantum trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider (tRS) Hamiltonians. Using recently observed relations between quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations and tRS integrable system we derive a nontrivial identity for vertex functions with relative insertions.
