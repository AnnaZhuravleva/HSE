We study certain even-eight curve configurations on a specific class of Jacobian elliptic K3 surfaces with lattice polarizations of rank ten. These configurations are associated with K3 double covers, some of which are elliptic but not Jacobian elliptic. Several non-generic cases corresponding to K3 surfaces of higher Picard rank are also discussed. Finally, the results and the construction in question are interpreted in the context of the string dualities linked with the eight-dimensional CHL string.
