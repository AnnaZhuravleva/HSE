We study local, global and local-to-global properties of threefolds with certain singularities. We prove criteria for these threefolds to be rational homology manifolds and conditions for threefolds to satisfy rational Poincar\'e duality. We relate the topological Euler characteristic of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds with $\mathbb Q$-factorial terminal singularities to dimensions of Lie algebras and certain representations, Milnor and Tyurina numbers and other birational invariants of an elliptic fibration. We give an interpretation in terms of complex deformations. We state a conjecture on the extension of Kodaira's classification of singular fibers on relatively minimal elliptic surfaces to the class of birationally equivalent relatively minimal genus one fibered varieties and we give results in this direction.
