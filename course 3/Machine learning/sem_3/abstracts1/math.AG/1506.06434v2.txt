We prove formula between Nekrasov partition functions defined from stable and co-stable ADHM data for the plane following method by Nakajima-Yoshioka based on the theory of wall-crossing formula developed by Mochizuki. This formula is similar to conjectures by Itoh-Maruyoshi-Okuda for $A_{1}$ singularity.
