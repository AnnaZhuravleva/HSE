We investigate SYZ mirror symmetry via asymptotic analysis on Maurer-Cartan equations, following a program set forth by Fukaya. Let $X_0$ and $\check{X}_0$ be a mirror pair of semi-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds, equipped with fibre-wise dual Lagrangian torus fibrations $p : X_0 \rightarrow B_0$ and $\check{p} : \check{X}_0 \rightarrow B_0$. We study the Maurer-Cartan equation of the Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory of complex structures on $\check{X}_0$ over a contractible open subset $U \subset B_0$ by expanding its solutions into Fourier series along the torus fibres of $\check{p}$ and then apply asymptotic analysis on the Fourier modes. We prove that the semi-classical limits (i.e. leading order terms in asymptotic expansions) of the Fourier modes of a Maurer-Cartan solution give rise to a consistent scattering diagram. Furthermore, we establish a bijective correspondence between these leading order terms and tropical disks. These tropical data are known to encode Gromov-Witten data on the mirror side and have played an important role in works of Kontsevich-Soibelman and Gross-Siebert on the reconstruction problem in mirror symmetry.
