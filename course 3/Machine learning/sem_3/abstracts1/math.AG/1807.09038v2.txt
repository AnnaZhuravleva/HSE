These are (somewhat informal) lectures notes for the CIME summer school "Geometric Representation Theory and Gauge Theory" in June 2018. In these notes we review the results and constructions of a series of our joint papers with H.Nakajima where a mathematical definition of Coulomb branches of 3d N=4 quantum gauge theories (of cotangent type) is given. We also discuss some further constructions (such as categories of line operators in the corresponding topologically twisted theories) and briefly discuss a connection to local geometric Langlands correspondence.
