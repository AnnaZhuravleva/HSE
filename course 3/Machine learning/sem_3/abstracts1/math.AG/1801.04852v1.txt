Let T_1 be an k_1-tensor and let T_2 be a k_2-tensor and consider the tensor product of T_1 \otimes T_2, which is a (k_1 + k_2)-tensor. It has recently been shown ([Christandl, Jensen, Zuiddam]) that the tensor rank can be strictly submultiplicative under the tensor product. The necessary upper bounds were obtained with help of the border rank. It was left open whether border rank itself can be strictly submultiplicative. In the current work, we answer this question in the affirmative. In order to do so, we construct lines in projective space along which the border rank drops multiple times and use this result in conjunction with a previous construction for a tensor rank drop. Our results also imply strict submultiplicativity for cactus rank and border cactus rank.
