We develop a virtual cycle approach towards generalized Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be the moduli stack of Gieseker semistable sheaves of fixed topological type on a Calabi-Yau threefold $W$. We construct an associated Deligne-Mumford stack $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$ with an induced semi-perfect obstruction theory of virtual dimension zero and define the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant of $W$ via Kirwan blowups to be the degree of the virtual cycle $[\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}]^{\mathrm{vir}}$. We show that it is invariant under deformations of the complex structure of $W$.
