We describe the relationship between two spaces associated to a quiver with potential. The first is a complex manifold parametrizing Bridgeland stability conditions on a triangulated category, and the second is a cluster variety with a natural Poisson structure. For quivers of type $A$, we construct a local biholomorphism from the space of stability conditions to the cluster variety. The existence of this map follows from results of Sibuya in the classical theory of ordinary differential equations.
