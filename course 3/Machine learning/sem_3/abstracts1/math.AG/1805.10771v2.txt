We consider a pointed curve $(X,P)$ which is given by the Weierstrass normal form, $y^r + A_{1}(x) y^{r-1} + A_{2}(x) y^{r-2} +\cdots + A_{r-1}(x) y+ A_{r}(x)$ where $x$ is an affine coordinate on $\mathbb{P}^1$, the point $\infty$ on $X$ is mapped to $x=\infty$, and each $A_j$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $\le j s/r$ for a certain coprime positive integers $r$ and $s$ ($r<s$) so that its Weierstrass non-gap sequence at $\infty$ is a numerical semigroup. Since it can be regarded as a natural generalization of Weierstrass normal form in the Weierstrass elliptic function theory, it has natural properties. We investigate such a curve and show the Jacobi inversion formulae of the strata of its Jacobian based on results of Jorgenson (Israel J. Math (1992) 77 pp 273-284).
