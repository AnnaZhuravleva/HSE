For a semisimple real Lie group $G$, we study topological properties of moduli spaces of parabolic $G$-Higgs bundles over a Riemann surface with a divisor of finitely many distinct points. For a split real form of a complex simple Lie group, we compute the dimension of apparent parabolic Teichm\"uller components. In the case of isometry groups of classical Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type, we provide new topological invariants for parabolic maximal $G$-Higgs bundles arising from a correspondence to orbifold Higgs bundles. Using orbifold cohomology we count the least number of connected components of moduli spaces of such objects. We further exhibit how one can provide an alternative explanation of fundamental results on counting components in the absence of a parabolic structure. These topological invariants may be found useful in the study of the geometric Langlands program in the case of tame ramification.
