In this paper, we formulate a natural conjecture on the location of mixed Tate motives in Voevodsky's triangulated category of motives over $\mathbb{Q}$. This conjecture is almost certainly well-known to practitioners, nevertheless motivation for making it explicit comes from the phenomenon of mirror symmetry in the theory of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Given a one-parameter mirror pair $(M,W)$ of Calabi-Yau threefolds, the prepotential of the complexified Kahler moduli space of $M$ (which has flat coordinate $t$) admits an expansion that has a constant term $-\,Y_{000}/6$ and a cubic term $-\,Y_{111}\,t^3/6$. Here `one-parameter' means that the deformation space of $W$ is one-dimensional. The number $Y_{111}$ is a non-zero integer, while in all examples where $Y_{000}$ has been computed, it is always of the form $$-3\, \chi (M) \,\zeta(3)/(2\,\pi\,i)^3+r,\,r \in \mathbb{Q}$$ where $\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$. This paper uses mirror symmetry to deduce that the dual of the limit mixed Hodge structure at the large complex structure limit of $W$ has a direct summand that is an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(0)$ by $\mathbb{Q}(3)$ whose period in $\mathbb{C}/(2 \pi i )^3\,\mathbb{Q}$ is the coset of $-(2\,\pi\,i)^3 \, Y_{000}/(3\,Y_{111})$. If further the deformation space of $W$ forms part of a one-parameter algebraic family defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, the computations in this paper provide evidence for the motivic conjecture as well as a motivic interpretation of the occurrence of $\zeta(3)$ in mirror symmetry.
