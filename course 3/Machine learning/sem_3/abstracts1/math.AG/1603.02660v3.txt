We prove the Landau-Ginzburg/Calabi-Yau correspondence between the Gromov-Witten theory of each elliptic orbifold curve and its Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory counterpart via modularity. We show that the correlation functions in these two enumerative theories are different representations of the same set of quasi-modular forms, expanded around different points on the upper-half plane. We relate these two representations by the Cayley transform.
