Consider zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a toric threefold or toric Calabi-Yau fourfold. In the second case, invariants can be defined using a tautological insertion. In both cases, the generating series can be expressed in terms of the MacMahon function. In the first case, by a theorem of Maulik-Nekrasov-Okounkov-Pandharipande. In the second case, by a conjecture of the authors and a (more general $K$-theoretic) conjecture by Nekrasov.   In this paper, we consider formal analogues of these invariants in any dimension $d \not\equiv 2\ \mathrm{mod}\, 4$. The direct analogues of the above-mentioned conjectures fail in general when $d>4$, showing that dimensions 3 and 4 are special. Surprisingly, after appropriate specialization of the equivariant parameters, the conjectures seem to hold in all dimensions.
