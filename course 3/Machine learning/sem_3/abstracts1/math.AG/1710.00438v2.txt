We introduce an algebraic group $\sf G$ that acts from right on the moduli space $\textsf{T}$ of Calabi-Yau $n$-folds arising from Dwork family enhanced with differential forms, and describe its Lie algebra ${\rm Lie}({\sf G})$. We observe that ${\rm Lie}({\sf G})$ together with a modular vector field ${\sf R}$ on $\textsf{T}$ generates another Lie algebra $\mathfrak{G}$, called AMSY-Lie algebra, such that $\dim \mathfrak{G}=\dim {\sf T}$. We find $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{G}$ that contains $\sf R$.
