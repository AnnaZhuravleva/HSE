Let $X = X_\Sigma$ be a toric surface and $(\check{X}, W)$ be its Landau-Ginzburg mirror where $W$ is the Hori-Vafa potential. In this paper, we study the extended deformation theory of $(\check{X}, W)$. We prove that the leading order terms in asymptotic expansions of the Fourier modes of Maurer-Cartan solutions with specific inputs are in bijective correspondences with tropical disks in $X$ of Maslov index 0 or 2. The Maslov index 2 tropical disks give rise naturally to an $n$-th order perturbation $W_n$ of $W$; for $X = \mathbb{P}^2$ this reproduces Gross' perturbed potential which gives the universal unfolding of $W$ in canonical coordinates. We also describe how the extended deformation theory dictates the jumping of $W_n$ across the walls of a scattering diagram formed from the Maslov index 0 tropical disks.
