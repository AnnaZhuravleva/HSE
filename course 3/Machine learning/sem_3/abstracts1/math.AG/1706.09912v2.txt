We compute the $g=1, n=1$ B-model Gromov-Witten invariant of an elliptic curve E directly from the derived category D(E). More precisely, we carry out the computation of the categorical Gromov-Witten invariant defined by Costello using as target a cyclic $A_\infty$ model of D(E) described by Polishchuk.   This is the first non-trivial computation of a positive genus categorical Gromov-Witten invariant, and the result agrees with the prediction of mirror symmetry: it matches the classical (non-categorical) Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic 2-torus computed by Dijkgraaf.
