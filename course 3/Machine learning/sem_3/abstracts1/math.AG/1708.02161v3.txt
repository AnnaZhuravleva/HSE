Inspired by mirror symmetry, we investigate some differential geometric aspects of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on a Calabi-Yau triangulated category. The aim is to develop theory of Weil-Petersson geometry on the stringy K\"ahler moduli space. A few basic examples are studied. In particular, we identify our Weil-Petersson metric with the Bergman metric on a Siegel modular variety in the case of the self-product of an elliptic curve.
