We find an explicit formula for the elliptic stable envelope in the case of the Hilbert scheme of points on a complex plane. The formula has a structure of a sum over trees in Young diagrams. In the limit we obtain the formulas for the stable envelope in equivariant $K$-theory (with arbitrary slope) and equivariant cohomology.
