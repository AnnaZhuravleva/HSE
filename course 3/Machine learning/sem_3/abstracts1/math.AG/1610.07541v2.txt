In this article we study odd deformations of an $\mathcal N =1$ super Riemann surface. We begin with odd, infinitesimal deformations with the objective being to describe the Kodaira-Spencer map for them and explore the consequences of the vanishing thereof. Our intent is to relate the deformation theory of a super Riemann surface with the obstruction theory of the deformation (itself to be thought of as a complex supermanifold). Illustrations are provided in low genus. Subsequently, we investigate deformations of higher order with a view to further understand this relation between obstruction theory and deformation theory. By way of motivation, a detailed study of odd, second order deformations is presented, leading naturally to a question on the characterisation odd deformations of any order.
