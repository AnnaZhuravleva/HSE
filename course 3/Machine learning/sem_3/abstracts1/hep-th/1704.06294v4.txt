We outline a holographic recipe to reconstruct $\alpha'$ corrections to AdS (quantum) gravity from an underlying CFT in the strictly planar limit ($N\rightarrow\infty$). Assuming that the boundary CFT can be solved in principle to all orders of the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$, for scalar primary operators, the $\lambda^{-1}$ expansion of the conformal dimensions can be mapped to higher curvature corrections of the dual bulk scalar field action. Furthermore, for the metric pertubations in the bulk, the AdS/CFT operator-field isomorphism forces these corrections to be of the Lovelock type. We demonstrate this by reconstructing the coefficient of the leading Lovelock correction, aka the Gauss-Bonnet term in a bulk AdS gravity action using the expression of stress-tensor two-point function up to sub-leading order in $\lambda^{-1}$.
