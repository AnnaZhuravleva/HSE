We investigate the Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the energy-momentum tensor for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in $(D+1)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with an arbitrary number of compactified spatial dimensions. Both cases of periodicity and antiperiodicity conditions along the compactified dimensions are considered. Recurrence formulae are derived which express the vacuum expectation values for the dS spacetime of topology $\mathrm{R}^{p}\times (\mathrm{S}^{1})^{q}$ in the form of the sum of the vacuum expectation values in the topology $\mathrm{R}^{p+1}\times (\mathrm{S}^{1})^{q-1}$ and the part induced by the compactness of the $(p+1)$th spatial dimension. The behavior of the topological parts is investigated in various asymptotic regions of the parameters. In the early stages of the cosmological evolution the topological parts dominate the contribution in the expectation values due to the uncompactified dS part. In this limit the behavior of the topological parts does not depend on the curvature coupling parameter and coincides with that for a conformally coupled massless field. At late stages of the cosmological expansion the expectation values are dominated by the part corresponding to uncompactified dS spacetime. The vanishing of the topological parts is monotonic or oscillatory in dependence of the mass and the curvature coupling parameter of the field.
