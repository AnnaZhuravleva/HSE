Radial vibrations of charge one hedgehog Skyrmions in the full Skyrme model are analysed. We investigate how the properties of the lowest resonance modes (quasi normal modes) - their frequencies and widths - depend on the form of the potential (value of the pion mass as well as the addition of further potentials) and on the inclusion of the sextic term. Then we consider the inverse problem, where certain values for the frequencies and widths are imposed, and the field theoretic Skyrme model potential giving rise to them is reconstructed. This latter method allows to reproduce the physical Roper resonances, as well as further physical properties of nucleons, with high precision.
