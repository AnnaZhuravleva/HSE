The Yang-Lee edge singularity is investigated by the determinant method of the conformal field theory. The critical dimension Dc, for which the scale dimension of scalar Delta_phi is vanishing, is discussed by this determinant method. The result is incorporated in the Pade analysis of epsilon expansion, which leads to an estimation of the value Delta_phi between three and six dimensions. The structure of the minors is viewed from the fixed points.
