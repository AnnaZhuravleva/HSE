We employ stochastic quantization for a self-interacting nonminimal massive scalar field in curved spacetime. The covariant background field method and local momentum space representation are used to obtain the Euclidean correlation function and evaluate multi-loop quantum corrections through simultaneous expansions in the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives and in the noise fields. The stochastic correlation function reproduces the well-known result by Bunch and Parker and is used to construct the effective potential in curved spacetime in an arbitrary dimension $D$ up to the first order in curvature. Furthermore, we present a sample of numerical simulations for $D=3$ in the first order in curvature.
