We consider the scattering of kinks of the sinh-deformed $\varphi^4$ model, which is obtained from the well-known $\varphi^4$ model by means of the deformation procedure. Depending on the initial velocity $v_{in}$ of the colliding kinks, different collision scenarios are realized. There is a critical value $v_{cr}$ of the initial velocity, which separates the regime of reflection (at $v_{in}>v_{cr}$) and that of a complicated interaction (at $v_{in}<v_{cr}$) with kinks' capture and escape windows. Besides that, at $v_{in}$ below $v_{cr}$ we observe the formation of a bound state of two oscillons, as well as their escape at some values of $v_{in}$.
