For extended $\mathcal{N}\leq 8$ supersymmetry we classify all possible gauge groups for a scalar multiplet allowed by the algebras of global and local supersymmetry in three dimensions. A detailed discussion of supersymmetry enhancement is included. For the corresponding topologically massive gravity with negative cosmological constant the mass of the graviton is determined algebraically as a function of $\mathcal{N}$ and the possible gauge couplings.
