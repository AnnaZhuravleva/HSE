We study generalized Kahler structures on N = (2, 2) supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten models; we use the well known case of SU(2) x U(1) as a toy model and develop tools that allow us to construct the superspace action and uncover the highly nontrivial structure of the hitherto unexplored case of SU(3); these tools should be useful for studying many other examples. We find that different generalized Kahler structures on N = (2, 2) supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten models can be found by T-duality transformations along affine isometries.
