We investigate massless n-point one-loop amplitudes of the open RNS superstring with two external fermions and determine their worldsheet integrands. The contributing correlation functions involving spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 operators from the fermion vertices are evaluated to any multiplicity. Moreover, we introduce techniques to sum these correlators over the spin structures of the worldsheet fermions such as to manifest all cancellations due to spacetime supersymmetry. These spin sums require generalizations of the Riemann identities among Jacobi theta functions, and the results can be expressed in terms of doubly-periodic functions known from the mathematics literature on elliptic multiple zeta values. On the boundary of moduli space, our spin-summed correlators specialize to compact representations of fermionic one-loop integrands for ambitwistor strings.
