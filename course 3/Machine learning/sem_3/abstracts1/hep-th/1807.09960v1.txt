The 3D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with planar, single-edged, boundary is considered. It is shown that its holographic reduction on a flat euclidean 2D spacetime is a scalar field theory describing a conserved chiral current, which corresponds to the electric continuity equation. Differently from the theory with planar, double-edged boundary, in this holographic bulk-boundary approach physical quantities like the chiral velocity of the edge excitations depend also on the non-topological Maxwell term.
