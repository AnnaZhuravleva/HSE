We describe a class of wormholes that generically become traversable after incorporating gravitational back-reaction from linear quantum fields satisfying appropriate (periodic or anti-periodic) boundary conditions around a non-contractible cycle, but with natural boundary conditions at infinity (i.e., without additional boundary interactions). The class includes both asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS examples. Simple asymptotically AdS$_3$ or asymptotically AdS$_3 \times S^1$ examples with a single periodic scalar field are then studied in detail. When the examples admit a smooth extremal limit, our perturbative analysis indicates the back-reacted wormhole remains traversable at later and later times as this limit is approached. This suggests that a fully non-perturbative treatment would find a self-supporting eternal traversable wormhole. While the general case remains to be analyzed in detail, the likely relation of the above effect to other known instabilities of extreme black holes may make the construction of eternal traversable wormholes more straightforward than previously expected.
