We study the relationship between the strength of fifth forces and the origin of scale breaking in the Standard Model of particle physics. We start with a light scalar field that is conformally coupled to a toy SM matter sector through a Weyl rescaling of the metric. After canonically normalizing the would-be Standard Model fields, the conformally-coupled scalar only interacts directly with the Higgs field through kinetic-mixing and Higgs-portal terms. We find that tree-level fifth forces only emerge if there is mass mixing between the conformally-coupled scalar and the Higgs field, and the strength of the fifth force mediated by the light scalar depends on whether the mass of the Higgs arises from an explicit symmetry-breaking term or a spontaneous mechanism of scale breaking. Solar System tests of gravity and the non-observation of fifth forces therefore have the potential to provide information about the structure of the Higgs sector and the origin of its symmetry breaking (as well as that of chiral symmetry breaking), setting an upper bound on the magnitude of any explicit scale-breaking terms. These results demonstrate the phenomenological importance (both for cosmology and high-energy physics) of considering how scalar-tensor modifications of gravity are embedded within extensions of the Standard Model, in this case, as light Higgs-portal theories.
