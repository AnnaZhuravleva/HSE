Quantum nonlocality provides an uniquely witness of nonlocal correlations, whose quantum nature can be revealed by the experimentally violation of Bell-type inequalities. In this Letter, we explore the quantum nonlocality as a witness to intrinsic correlation of non-Bunch-Davies (BD) vacua in de Sitter space. By the violation of CHSH inequality on localized state of two free falling Unruh-DeWitt detectors, we find that quantum nonlocality can be generated through Markovian evolution of system and overcome Gibbons-Hawking (GH) decoherence in de Sitter space. In particular, while CHSH bound monotonously degrades with growing GH temperature for BD-vacuum sector, we find that the amount of violation of CHSH inequality can drastically increase after certain turning points for non-BD vacua sectors, as a result of competition between GH decoherence and intrinsic correlation of $\alpha-$vacua. Remarkably, we show that quantum nonlocality in some non-BD sectors can even survive at infinite GH temperature, contrasting sharply with previous results employing global field modes. To further illustrate our result, we calculate another quantum witness, i.e., entropic uncertainty bound, for non-BD vacua, and show certain residual quantum correlation can be utilized as a physical resource in practical quantum information process. Finally, a discussion on manifestation of invariant Planck-scale by quantum nonlocality is given.
