We study solutions for boson stars in the multi-scalar field theory with global symmetry $[U(1)]^N$. The properties of the boson stars are investigated by the Newtonian approximation with the large coupling limit. Our purpose is to study the models bringing about exotic mass distributions which explain flat rotation curves of galaxies. We propose plausible models in which coupling matrices are associated with various graphs in graph theory.
