I discuss various aspects of background independence in the context of string theory, for which so far we have no manifestly background independent formulation. After reviewing the role of background independence in classical Einstein gravity, I discuss recent results implying that there is a conflict in string theory between manifest background independence and manifest duality invariance when higher-derivative corrections are included. The resolution of this conflict requires the introduction of new gauge degrees of freedom together with an enlarged gauge symmetry. This suggests more generally that a manifestly background independent and duality invariant formulation of string theory requires significantly enhanced gauge symmetries.
