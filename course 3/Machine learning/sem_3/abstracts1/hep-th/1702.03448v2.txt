By using the ultra-spinning limit as a generating solution technique, we construct a novel class of charged rotating asymptotic AdS black holes. That describes the exact D-dimnsioanl solutions of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton theory in the presence of negative cosmological constant. The obtained geometries possess some punctures, describing a noncompact horizon, but has a finite area. We then explicitly investigate the validity of the Kerr/CFT correspondence for all dimensional cases. We find a main result for the central charges associated to $[(d-1)/2]$ copies of dual $2D$ CFTs. We then argue the existence of a precise agreement between the microscopic entropy of dual CFTs and the entropy of the noncompact horizon.
