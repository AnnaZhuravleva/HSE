We use the isomorphism between the BMS${}_3$ and the $W(2,2)$ algebras to reconsider some generic aspects of CFTs with the BMS${}_3$ algebra defined as a chiral symmetry. For unitarity theories, it is known that the extended symmetry generator acts trivially, and the resulting theory is equivalent to a CFT with a Virasoro symmetry only. For nonunitary CFTs, we define an operator depending on a nilpotent variable, and we organize the Verma module through the action of this new operator. Finally, we find the conditions imposed by the modified Ward identity.
