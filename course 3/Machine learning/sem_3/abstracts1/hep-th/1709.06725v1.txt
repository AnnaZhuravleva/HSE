The completeness, together with the orthonormality, of the eigenfunctions of the Dirac Hamiltonian with a step potential is shown explicitly. These eigenfunctions describe the scattering process of a relativistic fermion off the step potential and the resolution of the identity in terms of them (completeness) is shown by explicitly summing them up, where appropriate treatments of the momentum integrations are crucial. The result would bring about a basis on which a field theoretical treatment for such a system can be developed.
