In this paper, we propose a systematic way to construct the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators at tree level, based on the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) forms of tree amplitudes. We observe that the number of independent coefficients in a given differential operator depends solely on the number of external lines. Based on this observation and adopting the differential operator designed for evaluating the CHY forms in our previous work, the construction of the BCJ numerators is translated to the decomposition of the differential operator associated with a given CHY integrand into the widely-used minimal basis. The decomposition is rendered highly efficient by employing the reduction matrices multiple times. This method is theory-independent and for Yang-Mills theory in particular, the non-local BCJ numerators in the minimal basis, expressed in terms of the reduction matrices, enjoy the manifest gauge invariance in $(n-2)$ legs for an $n$-point amplitude.
