Applying AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the effect of a constant magnetic field $\mathcal{B}$ on the drag force associated with a heavy quark moving through a strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma. The quark is considered moving transverse and parallel to $\mathcal{B}$, respectively. It is shown that for transverse case, the drag force is linearly dependent on $\mathcal{B}$ in all regions. While for parallel case, the drag force increases monotonously with increasing $\mathcal{B}$ and also reveals a linear behavior in the regions of strong $\mathcal{B}$. In addition, we find that $\mathcal{B}$ has important effect for transverse case than parallel.
