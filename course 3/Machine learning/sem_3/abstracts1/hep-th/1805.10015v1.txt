We argue that the flavor dependence of the QCD phase diagram presents universal properties in the heavy quark limit. For the wide class of models where the quarks are treated at the one-loop level, we show explicitly that the flavor dependence of the critical quark masses---for which the confinement-deconfinement transition is second order---is insensitive to the details of the (confining) gluon dynamics and that the critical temperature is constant along the corresponding critical line. We illustrate this with explicit results in various such one-loop models studied in the literature: effective matrix models for the Polyakov loop, the Curci-Ferrari model, and a recently proposed Gribov-Zwanziger-type model. We further observe that the predictions which follow from this one-loop universality property are well satisfied by different calculations beyond one-loop order, including lattice results. For degenerate quarks, we propose a simple but robust law for the flavor dependence of the critical mass which is well verified by all approaches.
