We formulate Nielsen's geometric approach to complexity in the context of two dimensional conformal field theories, where series of conformal transformations are interpreted as "unitary circuits". We argue that, at large central charge, this approach naturally leads to the geometric action on the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro group. This action is directly connected to the Polyakov action of two dimensional gravity, which therefore sets the rules for optimal quantum computation in conformal field theories.
