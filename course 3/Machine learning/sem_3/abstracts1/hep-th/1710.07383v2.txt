Bottomonium and charmonium, representing quarkonia states, are scrutinized under the point of view of the information theory, in the AdS/QCD holographic setup. A logarithmic measure of information, comprised by the configurational entropy, is here employed to quantitatively study quarkonia radially excited S-wave states. The configurational entropy provides data regarding the relative dominance and the abundance of the bottomonium and charmonium states, whose underlying information is more compressed, in the Shannon's theory meaning. The derived configurational entropy, therefore, identifies the lower phenomenological prevalence of higher S-wave resonances and higher masses quarkonia in Nature.
