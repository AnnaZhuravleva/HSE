We study fluctuations around equilibrium in a class of strongly interacting non-conformal plasmas using holographic techniques. In particular we calculate the quasi-normal mode spectrum of black hole backgrounds that approach to Chamblin-Reall plasmas in the IR. In a specific limit, related to the exact linear-dilaton background in string theory, we observe that the plasma approaches criticality and we obtain the quasi-normal spectrum analytically. We regulate the critical limit by gluing the IR geometry that corresponds to the non-conformal plasma to a part of AdS space-time in the UV. Near criticality, we find two sets of quasi-normal modes, related to the IR and UV parts of the geometry. In the critical limit, the quasi-normal modes accumulate to form a branch cut in the correlators of the energy-momentum tensor on the real axis of the complex frequency plane.
