We consider the model of modified gravity with dynamical torsion. This model was found to have promising stability properties about various backgrounds. The model admits a self-accelerating solution. We have shown previously that if the parameters are adjusted in such a way that the torsion is much greater than the effective cosmological constant, the self-accelerating solution is unstable: there are exponentially growing modes. Here we study the scalar perturbations in the case when the torsion is of the order of the effective cosmological constant. We find that there are no exponential instabilities.
