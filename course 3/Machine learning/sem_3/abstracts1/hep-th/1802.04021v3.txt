We initiate a systematic method to calculate both the finite volume energy levels and form factors from the momentum space finite volume two-point function. By expanding the two point function in the volume we extracted the leading exponential volume correction both to the energy of a moving particle state and to the simplest non-diagonal form factor. The form factor corrections are given in terms of a regularized infinite volume 3-particle form factor and terms related to the L\"usher correction of the momentum quantization. We tested these results against second order Lagrangian and Hamiltonian perturbation theory in the sinh-Gordon theory and we obtained perfect agreement.
