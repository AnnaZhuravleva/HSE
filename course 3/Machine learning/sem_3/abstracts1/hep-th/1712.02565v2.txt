The Lagrangian for a non-abelian gauge theory with an $SU(N_{\! c})$ symmetry and a linear covariant gauge fixing is constructed in eight dimensions. The renormalization group functions are computed at one loop with the special cases of $N_{\! c}$ $=$ $2$ and $3$ treated separately. By computing the critical exponents derived from these in the large $N_{\! f}$ expansion at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point it is shown that the Lagrangian is in the same universality class as the two dimensional non-abelian Thirring model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As the eight dimensional Lagrangian contains new quartic gluon operators not present in four dimensional QCD, we compute in parallel the mixing matrix of four dimensional dimension $8$ operators in pure Yang-Mills theory.
