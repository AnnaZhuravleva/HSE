We continue to investigate the dual description of the Virasoro conformal blocks arising in the framework of the classical limit of the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence. To give such an interpretation in previous studies, certain restrictions were necessary. Our goal here is to consider more general situation available through the worldline approximation to the dual AdS gravity. Namely, we are interested in computing the spherical conformal blocks without the previously imposed restrictions on the conformal dimensions of the internal channels. The duality is realised as an equality of the so-called heavy-light limit of the n-point conformal block and the action of n-2 particles propagating in some AdS-like background with either a conical singularity or a BTZ black hole. We describe a procedure that allows relaxing the constraint on the intermediate channels. To obtain an explicit expression for the conformal block on the CFT side, we use a recently proposed recursion procedure and find full agreement between the results of the boundary and bulk computations.
