In the context of dilaton coupled Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant and a Born-Infeld field, we study heat engines where charged black hole is the working substance. Using the existence of a notion of thermodynamic mass and volume (which depend on the dilaton coupling), the mechanical work takes place via the pdV terms present in the first law of extended gravitational thermodynamics. Efficiency is analyzed as a function of dilaton and Born-Infeld couplings, and results are compared with analogous computations in the related conformal solutions in the Brans-Dicke Born-Infeld theory and black holes in Anti de Sitter space-time.
