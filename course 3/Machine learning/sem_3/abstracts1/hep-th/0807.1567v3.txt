In general there are a large number of light scalar fields in the theories going beyond standard model, such as string theory, and some of them can be taken as the candidates of curvatons. For simplicity, we assume all of curvatons have the same decay rate and suddenly decay into radiation at the same time. In order to distinguish this scenario from the more general case, we call it "N-vaton". We use $\delta {\cal N}$ formalism to calculate the primordial power spectrum and bispectrum in N-vaton model and investigate various bounds on the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{NL}$. A red tilted primordial power spectrum and a large value of $f_{NL}$ can be naturally obtained if the curvature perturbation generated by inflaton also makes a significant contribution to the primordial power spectrum. As a realistic N-vaton model, we suppose that the axions in the KKLT compactifications of Type IIB string theory are taken as curvatons and a rich phenomenology is obtained.
