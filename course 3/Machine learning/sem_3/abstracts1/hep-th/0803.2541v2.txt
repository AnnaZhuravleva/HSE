We present a new perspective on the nature of quark and gluon condensates in quantum chromodynamics. We suggest that the spatial support of QCD condensates is restricted to the interiors of hadrons, since these condensates arise due to the interactions of confined quarks and gluons. An analogy is drawn with order parameters like the Cooper pair condensate and spontaneous magnetization experimentally measured in finite samples in condensed matter physics. Our picture explains the results of recent studies which find no significant signal for the vacuum gluon condensate. We also give a general discussion of condensates in asymptotically free vectorial and chiral gauge theories.
