We examine the holographic entanglement entropy in hyperscaling violating backgrounds. Precisely in such theories by semi-analytic computation, we use holographic methods to derive the universal terms of entanglement entropy in various dimensions. We also find such terms when the bulk action includes higher-order curvature terms. We make further comments on the mutual information in hyperscaling violating backgrounds with higher curvature interactions. We explore the sign of tripartite information which results in a monogamy property on mutual information. It is shown that for various hyperscaling parameters, the mutual and tripartite information are always positive and negative, respectively. This indicates that mutual information is monogamous in theories with hyperscaling violation.
