We have studied the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of a hot QCD medium as well as its subsequent expansion in the presence of a strong magnetic field, which may be produced in the noncentral events of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, along with the inception of the medium. For that purpose we have first computed the quark and gluon self-energies in the strong magnetic field to obtain the effective propagators for quarks and gluons, respectively, which, in turn, together give the free energy of the medium. The free energy thus obtained has been used to determine the equation of state, wherein we found that the (square) speed of sound increases due to the presence of magnetic field, thus it may affect the expansion of the medium. The above free energy also facilitates to study the magnetic properties by calculating the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility from it. We found that the magnetization increases linearly with the magnetic field, hence the magnetic susceptibility increases with the magnetic field whereas the magnetization increases with the temperature very slowly, so the increase of susceptibility with the temperature is meagre. Finally, using the abovementioned equation of state, we have studied the effect of strong magnetic field on the Bjorken boost-invariant expansion of the medium. We have noticed that in the presence of magnetic field, the energy density of the magnetized thermal QCD medium evolves faster than a pure thermal QCD medium. This can be understood by the aforesaid observation on the enhancement of the speed of sound in the presence of strong magnetic field.
