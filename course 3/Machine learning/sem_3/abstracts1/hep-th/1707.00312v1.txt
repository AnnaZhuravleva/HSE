We explore several consequences of the recently discovered intrinsic non-commutativity of the zero-mode sector of closed string theory. In particular, we illuminate the relation between T-duality and this intrinsic non-commutativity and also note that there is a simple closed string product, equivalent to the splitting-joining interaction of the pants diagram, that respects this non-commutativity and is covariant with respect to T-duality. We emphasize the central role played by the symplectic form $\omega$ on the space of zero modes. Furthermore, we begin an exploration of new non-commutative string backgrounds. In particular, we show that a constant non-geometric background field leads to a non-commutative space-time. We also comment on the non-associativity that consequently arises in the presence of non-trivial flux. In this formulation, the $H$-flux as well as the `non-geometric' $Q$-, $R$- and $F$-fluxes are simply the various components of the flux of an almost symplectic form.
