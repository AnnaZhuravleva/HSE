In this paper, we investigate the effects of non-commutative phase-space on the quintom cosmological model. In that case, we discuss $\Lambda_{1}$, $\Lambda_{2}$ and other cosmological parameters and show that they are associated to deformation parameters $\theta$ and $\beta$. Generally one can say that, the non-commutative parameter plays important role in physics and here also help us to arrange the divergency of cosmological constant. We draw time-dependent scale factor and investigate the effect of non-commutative parameters. Finally, we take advantage from non-commutative phase-space and obtain the deformed Lagrangian for the quintom model. In order to discuss some cosmological phenomena as dark energy and inflation, we employ Neother symmetry.
