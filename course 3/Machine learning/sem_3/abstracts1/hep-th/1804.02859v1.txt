The integrable 1+1-dimensional SU(2) principal chiral model (PCM) serves as a toy-model for 3+1-dimensional Yang-Mills theory as it is asymptotically free and displays a mass gap. Interestingly, the PCM is 'pseudo-dual' to a scalar field theory introduced by Zakharov and Mikhailov and Nappi that is strongly coupled in the ultraviolet and could serve as a toy-model for non-perturbative properties of theories with a Landau pole. Unlike the semi-direct product of su(2) and abelian current algebras of the PCM, its pseudo-dual is based on a nilpotent current algebra. Recently, Rajeev and Ranken obtained a mechanical reduction by restricting the nilpotent scalar field theory to a class of constant energy-density classical waves expressible in terms of elliptic functions, whose quantization survives the passage to the strong-coupling limit. We study the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of this model and its classical integrability, identifying Darboux coordinates, Lax pairs, classical r-matrices and a degenerate Poisson pencil. We identify Casimirs as well as a complete set of conserved quantities in involution and the canonical transformations they generate. They are related to Noether charges of the field theory and are shown to be generically functionally independent, implying Liouville integrability. We also find an interesting relation between this model and the Neumann model allowing us to discover a new Hamiltonian formulation of the latter.
