A deconstructed holographic model for an $s$-wave superconductor in $2+1$ dimensions has been proposed in the literature. Here, we consider solutions in the presence of perpendicular magnetic fields, where vortex formed. We calculate the expectation value of the Cooper pair condensate as a function of radial distance from the center of the vortex for different numbers of lattice points.
