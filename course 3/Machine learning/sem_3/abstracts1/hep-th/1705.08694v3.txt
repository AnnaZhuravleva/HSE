We study a general flat space/boson star transition model in quasi-local ensemble through approaches familiar from holographic superconductor theories. We manage to find a parameter $\psi_{2}$, which is proved to be useful in disclosing properties of phase transitions. In this work, we explore effects of the scalar mass, scalar charge and St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg mechanism on the critical phase transition points and the order of transitions mainly from behaviors of the parameter $\psi_{2}$. We mention that properties of transitions in quasi-local gravity are strikingly similar to those in holographic superconductor models. We also obtain an analytical relation $\psi_{2}\varpropto(\mu-\mu_{c})^{1/2}$, which also holds for the condensed scalar operator in the holographic insulator/superconductor system in accordance with mean field theories.
