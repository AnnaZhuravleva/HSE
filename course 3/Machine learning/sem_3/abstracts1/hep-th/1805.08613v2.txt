We construct a family of quantum scalar fields over a $p-$adic spacetime which satisfy $p-$adic analogues of the G\aa rding--Wightman axioms. Most of the axioms can be formulated the same way in both, the Archimedean and non-Archimedean frameworks; however, the axioms depending on the ordering of the background field must be reformulated, reflecting the acausality of $p-$adic spacetime. The $p-$adic scalar fields satisfy certain $p-$adic Klein-Gordon pseudo-differential equations. The second quantization of the solutions of these Klein-Gordon equations corresponds exactly to the scalar fields introduced here.
