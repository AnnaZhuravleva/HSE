We present perturbative calculation of the width of the energy profile of stiff strings up to two loops in D dimensions. The perturbative expansion of the extrinsic curvature term signifying the rigidity of the string in Polyakov-Kleinert action is taken around the free Nambu-Goto string. The mean-square width of the string field is derived for open strings with Dirichlet boundary condition.
