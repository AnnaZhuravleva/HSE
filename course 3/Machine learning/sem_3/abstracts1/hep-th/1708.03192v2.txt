Following the canonical quantization procedure for a tachyon field, the usual Hamiltonian and the creation and annihilation operators are obtained. The observation that the mass hyperboloid $p^2-m^2=0$ is one-sheeted, as opposed to the case of bradyons where $p^2+m^2=0$ is two-sheeted, leads to the construction of a base which is unbounded for negative as well as for positive energies. There is a zero-energy eigenfunction from which all other states can be constructed by repeated application of decreasing or increasing operators, within this Fock space the vacuum expectation value of the chronological product of field operators is shown to coincide with Cauchy's principal-value Green's function.
