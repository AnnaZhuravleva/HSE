In this note we study the U-duality invariant coefficient functions of higher curvature corrections to the four-graviton scattering amplitude in type IIB string theory compactified on a torus. The main focus is on the $D^6R^4$ term that is known to satisfy an inhomogeneous Laplace equation. We exhibit a novel method for solving this equation in terms of a Poincar\'e series ansatz and recover known results in $D=10$ dimensions and find new results in $D<10$ dimensions. We also apply the method to modular graph functions as they arise from closed superstring one-loop amplitudes.
