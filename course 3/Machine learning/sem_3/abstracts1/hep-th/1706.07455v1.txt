We have analyzed in detail the propagation of a minimally coupled massless scalar field in the gravitational background of a four-dimensional Einstein-Born-Infeld dilaton charged black hole. We have obtained analytical expressions for the absorption cross section as well as for the decay rate for the scalar field in the aforementioned spacetime, and we have shown graphically its behavior for different values of the free parameters of the theory.
