We present a deformation theory approach to the classification of kinematical Lie algebras in 3+1 dimensions and present calculations leading to the classifications of all deformations of the static kinematical Lie algebra and of its universal central extension, up to isomorphism. In addition we determine which of these Lie algebras admit an invariant symmetric inner product. Among the new results, we find some deformations of the centrally extended static kinematical Lie algebra which are extensions (but not central) of deformations of the static kinematical Lie algebra. This paper lays the groundwork for two companion papers which present similar classifications in dimension D + 1 for all D>3 and in dimension 2+1.
