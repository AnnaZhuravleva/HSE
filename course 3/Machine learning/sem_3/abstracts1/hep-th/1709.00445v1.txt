Scalar fields in anti de Sitter space whose masses lie between the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound and the unitarity bound are considered to be dual to two distinct CFTs depending on the choice of boundary conditions, and these CFTs are related by Legendre transforms. The same relationship is expected to hold when the theory is considered on ${\bf R}^{d-1} \times S_1$ with thermal periodicity imposed on $S_1$. The zero momentum susceptibility of the Legendre pair is such that one of the pair always has negative susceptibility. We show that this negative susceptibility corresponds the distribution of an observable being non-normalizable. The dichotomy of this Legendre transform pair can be extended by including double trace deformations. We show that the Legendre transform and the double trace deformation combines to form an $SL(2,{\bf R})$ family of theories. The three generators of $SL(2,{\bf R})$ are shown to correspond to double trace deformation, contact term deformation, and overall scaling. We provide an explicit description of the region in $SL(2,{\bf R})$ theory space where the susceptibility is negative and the theory is unbounded. We also map out the region in theory space where a tachyon appears in the spectrum. These two regions overlap partly, but are not identical. We also discuss implications of these findings to AdS/CMT applications and the correlated stability conjecture.
