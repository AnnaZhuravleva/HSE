We calculate the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) in Euclidean asymptotic AdS3 spacetime using surgery. The treatment is intrinsically three-dimensional. In the BTZ black hole background, several different bipartitions are applied. For the bipartition along the horizon between two single-sided black holes, TEE is exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which supports the ER=EPR conjecture in the Euclidean case. For other bipartitions, we derive an Entangling-Thermal relation for each single-sided black hole, which is of topological origin. After summing over genus-one classical geometries, we compute TEE in the high-temperature regime. In the case where k=1, we find that TEE is the same as that for a Moonshine double state, given by the maximally-entangled superposition of 194 types of "anyons" in the 3d bulk, labeled by the irreducible representations of the Monster group. We propose this as the bulk analogue of the thermofield double state in the Euclidean spacetime. Comparing the TEE between thermal AdS3 and BTZ solutions, we discuss the implication of TEE on the Hawking-Page transition in 3d.
