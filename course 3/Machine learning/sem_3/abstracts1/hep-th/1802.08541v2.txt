We study, by using tools of the dynamical system theory, a fermionic string streched from a non-commutative D2-brane (stack of D0-branes in the BFSS model) to a probe D0-brane as a quantum system driven by a chaotic system, the (classical and quantum) chaos being induced in the D2-brane dynamics by quantum fluctuations. We show that this dynamics with fluctuations induces a decoherence phenomenon on the reduced density matrix of the fermionic string which is characteristic of the chaotic behaviour since it presents an horizon of coherence. Moreover we show that this dynamics is associated with an invariant torus which involves extradimensions emerging from the fluctuations for the viewpoint of the fermionic string, extending a three dimensional space by six compact dimensions. The situation studied can be considered as a model of qubit (supported by the fermionic string) in interaction with a quantum black hole (modelized by the non-commutative D2-brane).
