We look at simple BPS systems involving more than one field. We discuss the conditions that have to be imposed on various terms in the Lagrangians involving many fields to produce BPS systems and then look in more detail at the simplest of such cases. We analyse in detail a BPS system involving 2 sine-Gordon like fields and study its properties when we take its solitonic static solutions and use them as initial conditions for their evolution in Lorentz covariant versions of the model.
