We consider string baryon model in the framework of modified measure theory, a theory that does not use the determinant of the metric to construct the invariant volume element. A baryon is modeled by two strings with a charge at each endpoint that represent a quark. It is shown that the discontinuity of the tension leads to the termination of a string, and Neumann boundary conditions naturally arise at these endpoints. We connect the endpoint of one string with the internal part of the other one. That way a system of three effective strings is constructed. Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are obtained dynamically in the point of intersection. When tensions are chosen in such way that two of them are much greater than the third one then a diquark is obtained. In that case two quarks are tightly bound while the third quark is bound by a tension which is smaller to the vertex of the interaction.
