In the $(2,5)$ minimal model, the partition function for genus $g=2$ Riemann surfaces is expected to be given by a quintuplet of Siegel modular forms that extend the Rogers-Ramanujan functions on the torus. Their expansions around the $g=2$ boundary components of the moduli space are obtained in terms of standard modular forms. In the case where a handle of the $g=2$ surface is pinched, our method requires knowledge of the $2$-point function of the fundamental lowest-weight vector in the non-vacuum representation of the Virasoro algebra, for which we derive a third order ODE.
