We study the nontrivial topological dynamics inherent in the Minkowskian Higgs model with vacuum BPS monopoles quantized by Dirac. It comes to persistent collective solid rotations inside the physical BPS monopole vacuum, accompanied by never vanishing vacuum "electric" fields (vacuum monopoles) $\bf E$. The enumerated rotary effects inside the physical BPS monopole vacuum suffered the Dirac fundamental quantization are the specific display of the Josephson effect, whose nature will be reveal in the present study.
