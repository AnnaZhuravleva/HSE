We derive a new class of exact time dependent solutions in a warped six dimensional supergravity model. Under the assumptions we make for the form of the underlying moduli fields, we show that the only consistent time dependent solutions lead to all six dimensions evolving in time, implying the eventual decompactification or collapse of the extra dimensions. We also show how the dynamics affects the quantization of the deficit angle.
