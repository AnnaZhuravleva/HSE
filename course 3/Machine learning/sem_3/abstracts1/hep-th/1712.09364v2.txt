Using the blackfold effective theory applied to extremal Kerr branes we provide evidence for the existence of new stationary extremal black hole solutions in asymptotically flat spacetime with both single and multiple disconnected horizons. These include extremal doubly-spinning black rings, black saturns, di-rings and bi-rings in five spacetime dimensions as well as extremal Myers-Perry black holes and black saturns in dimensions greater than five. Some of these constructions constitute the first examples of black hole solutions with extremal disconnected horizons in vacuum Einstein gravity.
