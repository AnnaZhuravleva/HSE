The fundamental ingredients that build the observables in conformal field theory are the spectrum of operators and the OPE coefficients, or equivalently, the two- and three-point functions of the theory. Recently an inversion formula solving the OPE coefficients by a convolution over the light-cone double-discontinuities of the correlator has been found by Simon Caron-Huot. Taking into account that the same OPE data determine the Mellin amplitude representation of the correlator, motivate us to look for an analogous inversion formula in Mellin space, which we develops partially on this paper.
