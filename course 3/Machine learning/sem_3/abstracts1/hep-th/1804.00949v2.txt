We show that by studying the flat spacetime limit of the Mellin amplitude associated with the four-point correlation function of scalar operators in the stress tensor multiplet of ABJM theory, one can produce the momentum expansion of the M-theory four-graviton S-matrix elements. Using CFT data previously obtained from the supersymmetric localization method, we carry out this procedure explicitly to the second nontrivial order in the momentum expansion, and recover precisely the known $R^4$ contribution to the scattering amplitude of super-gravitons in M-theory in eleven dimensions.
