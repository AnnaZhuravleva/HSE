We propose a novel gauge-invariant regularization for the perturbative chiral gauge theory.Our method consists of the two ingredients: use of the domain-wall fermion to describe a chiral fermion with Pauli-Villars regulators and application of the di- mensional regularization only to the gauge field. This regularization is implemented in the Lagrangian level, unlike other gauge-invariant regularizations (eg. the covariant regularizations). We show that the Abelian (fermion number) anomaly is reproduced correctly in this formulation. We also show that once we add the counter terms to the full theory, then the renormalization in the chiral gauge theory is automatically achieved.
