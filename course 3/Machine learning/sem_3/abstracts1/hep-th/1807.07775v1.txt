We investigate low energy string excitations in AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times$T$^4$. When the worldsheet is decompactified, the theory has gapless modes whose spectrum at low energies is determined by massless relativistic integrable S matrices of the type introduced by Al. B. Zamolodchikov. The S matrices are non-trivial only for excitations with identical worldsheet chirality, indicating that the low energy theory is a CFT$_2$. We construct a Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) for these excitations and show how the massless modes' wrapping effects may be incorporated into the low energy AdS$_3$ spectral problem. Using the TBA and its associated Y-system, we determine the central charge of the low energy CFT$_2$ to be $c=0$ ($c=6$) for the sector with (anti)periodic fermions and find the energies of some excited states.
