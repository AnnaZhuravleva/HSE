String theory dynamics on certain fivebrane supertube backgrounds is described by an exactly solvable null-gauged WZW model. We use this description to compute the spectrum of closed string excitations on the three-charge non-supersymmetric solution found by Jejjala, Madden, Ross and Titchener, as well as its supersymmetric limit. The low-lying spectrum matches that of supergravity modes in the effective geometry and exhibits an underlying group-theoretic structure. Winding sectors describe strings carrying the same charges as the background; processes whereby strings turn into flux or vice-versa are mediated by large gauge transformations on the worldsheet. The S-matrix of such wound strings probes microstructure of the fivebrane source that is hidden in the supergravity approximation.
