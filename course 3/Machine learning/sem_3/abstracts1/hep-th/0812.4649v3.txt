We present a detailed systematics for comparing warped brane inflation with the observations, incorporating the effects of both moduli stabilization and ultraviolet bulk physics. We explicitly construct an example of the inflaton potential governing the motion of a mobile D3 brane in the entire warped deformed conifold. This allows us to precisely identify the corresponding scales of the cosmic microwave background. The effects due to bulk fluxes or localized sources are parametrized using gauge/string duality. We next perform some sample scannings to explore the parameter space of the complete potential, and first demonstrate that without the bulk effects there can be large degenerate sets of parameters with observationally consistent predictions. When the bulk perturbations are included, however, the observational predictions are generally spoiled. For them to remain consistent, the magnitudes of the bulk effects need to be highly suppressed via fine tuning.
