Within a holographic framework, we consider vector mesons riding on a gravity-dilaton background. The latter one is determined directly from a Schr\"odinger equivalent potential which delivers a proper $\rho$ meson Regge trajectory. The mapping on the dilaton potential yields a thermodynamic phase structure with a first-order transition.
