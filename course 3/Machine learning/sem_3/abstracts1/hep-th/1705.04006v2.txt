The modular properties of the simple vertex operator superalgebra associated to the affine Kac-Moody superalgebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{osp}} \left( 1 \middle\vert 2 \right)$ at level $-\frac{5}{4}$ are investigated. After classifying the relaxed highest-weight modules over this vertex operator superalgebra, the characters and supercharacters of the simple weight modules are computed and their modular transforms are determined. This leads to a complete list of the Grothendieck fusion rules by way of a continuous superalgebraic analogue of the Verlinde formula. All Grothendieck fusion coefficients are observed to be non-negative integers. These results indicate that the extension to general admissible levels will follow using the same methodology once the classification of relaxed highest-weight modules is completed.
