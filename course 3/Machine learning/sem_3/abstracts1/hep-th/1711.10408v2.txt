We investigate the possibility that the inflaton, in particular in conformal inflation models, is also a chameleon, i.e. that it couples to the energy density of some heavy non-relativistic matter present during inflation. We find new and interesting attractor behaviours, either prolonging inflation, or changing the observables $n_s,r$, depending on the sign of the chameleon coupling exponent.
