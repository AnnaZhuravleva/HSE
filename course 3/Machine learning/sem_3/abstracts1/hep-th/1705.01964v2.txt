In this paper we apply the discrete gravity and Regge calculus to tensor networks and Anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We construct the boundary many-body quantum state $|\Psi\rangle$ using random tensor networks as the holographic mapping, applied to the Wheeler-deWitt wave function of bulk Euclidean discrete gravity in 3 dimensions. The entanglement R\'enyi entropy of $|\Psi\rangle$ is shown to holographically relate to the on-shell action of Einstein gravity on a branch cover bulk manifold. The resulting R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ of $|\Psi\rangle$ approximates with high precision the R\'enyi entropy of ground state in 2-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). In particular it reproduces the correct $n$ dependence. Our results develop the framework of realizing the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence on random tensor networks, and provide a new proposal to approximate CFT ground state.
