We investigate the curvaton dynamics and the non-linearity parameters in curvaton model with potential slightly deviating from the quadratic form in detail. The non-linearity parameter $g_{NL}$ will show up due to the curvaton self-interaction. We also point out that the leading order of non-quadratic term in the curvaton potential can be negative, for example in the axion-type curvaton model. If a large positive $g_{NL}$ is detected, the axion-type curvaton model will be preferred.
