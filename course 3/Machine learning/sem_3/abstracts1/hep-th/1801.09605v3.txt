In this paper we further study the 1d Schwarzian theory, the universal low-energy limit of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models, using the link with 2d Liouville theory. We provide a path-integral derivation of the structural link between both theories, and study the relation between 3d gravity, 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, 2d Liouville and the 1d Schwarzian. We then generalize the Schwarzian double-scaling limit to rational models, relevant for SYK-type models with internal symmetries. We identify the holographic gauge theory as a 2d BF theory and compute correlators of the holographically dual 1d particle-on-a-group action, decomposing these into diagrammatic building blocks, in a manner very similar to the Schwarzian theory.
