In this paper we investigate the possible supersymmetric extensions for the massive (bi)gravity theories in the lowest non-trivial order. For this purpose we construct the cubic interaction vertices for massive spin-2 and one or two massive spin-3/2 fields restricting ourselves with the terms containing no more than one derivative so that such models can be considered as the smooth deformations for the usual (spontaneously broken) supergravity. Also we investigate all possible limits where one of the fields becomes massless.
