We describe the atom mirrors in terms of a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt harmonic-oscillator detector theory in (1+1) dimensions. Without introducing the Dirichlet boundary condition to the field, the reflectivity of our atom mirror is dynamically determined by the interaction of the detector's internal oscillator and the field. When the oscillator-field coupling is strong, a broad frequency range of the field modes can be mostly reflected by the atom mirror at late times. Constructing a cavity model with two such atom mirrors, we can see how the quantum field inside the cavity evolves from a continuous to a quasi-discrete spectrum which gives a negative Casimir energy density at late times. In our numerical calculations, the Casimir energy density in the cavity does not converge until the UV cutoff is sufficiently large, with which the two internal oscillators are always separable.
