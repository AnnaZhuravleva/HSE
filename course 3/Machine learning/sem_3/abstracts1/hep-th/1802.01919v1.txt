We study the effect of a constant magnetic field on the imaginary part of a quarkonia potential in a strongly-coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma. We consider the pair axis to be aligned perpendicularly and parallel to the magnetic field, respectively. For both cases, we find that the presence of the magnetic field tends to enhance the imaginary potential thus decreasing the the thermal width. In addition, the magnetic field has a stronger effect on the imaginary potential when the pair axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field rather than parallel.
