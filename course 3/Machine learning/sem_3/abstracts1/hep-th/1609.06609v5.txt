We advance a holographic conjecture for the entanglement negativity of bipartite quantum states in $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories in the $AdS_3/CFT_2$ framework. Our conjecture exactly reproduces the replica technique results in the large central charge limit, for both the pure state described by the $CFT_{1+1}$ vacuum dual to bulk the pure $AdS_3$ geometry and the finite temperature mixed state dual to a Euclidean BTZ black hole respectively. The holographic entanglement negativity characterizes the distillable entanglement and reduces to a specific sum of holographic mutual informations. We briefly allude to a possible higher dimensional generalization of our conjecture in a generic $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_{d}$ scenario.
