In this work, we compute analytically the infrared divergences of massless O($N$) self-interacting scalar field theories with Lorentz violation, which are exact in the Lorentz-violating $K_{\mu\nu}$ coefficients, for evaluating the corresponding next-to-leading order critical exponents. For that, we apply three distinct and independent field-theoretic renormalization group methods. We find that the outcomes for the critical exponents are the same in the three methods and, furthermore, are identical to their Lorentz invariant counterparts. We generalize the results for all loop levels by employing a general theorem arising from the exact procedure and give the corresponding physical interpretation.
