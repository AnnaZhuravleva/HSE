We construct global solutions to Type IIB supergravity with 16 residual supersymmetries whose space-time is $AdS_6 \times S^2$ warped over a Riemann surface. Families of solutions are labeled by an arbitrary number $L\geq 3$ of asymptotic regions, in each of which the supergravity fields match those of a $(p,q)$ five-brane, and may therefore be viewed as near-horizon limits of fully localized intersections of five-branes in Type IIB string theory. These solutions provide compelling candidates for holographic duals to a large class of five-dimensional superconformal quantum field theories which arise as non-trivial UV fixed points of perturbatively non-renormalizable Yang-Mills theories, thereby making them more directly accessible to quantitative analysis.
