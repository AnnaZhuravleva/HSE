The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group is the asymptotic symmetry group of asymptotically flat gravity. Recently, Donnay et al. have derived an analogous symmetry group acting on black hole event horizons. For a certain choice of boundary conditions, it is a semidirect product of ${\rm Diff}(S^2)$, the smooth diffeomorphisms of the two-sphere, acting on $C^\infty(S^2)$, the smooth functions on the two-sphere. We observe that the same group appears in fluid dynamics as symmetries of the compressible Euler equations. We relate these two realizations of ${\rm Diff}(S^2)\ltimes C^\infty(S^2)$ using the black hole membrane paradigm. We show that the Lie-Poisson brackets of membrane paradigm fluid charges reproduce the near-horizon BMS algebra. The perspective presented here may be useful for understanding the BMS algebra at null infinity.
