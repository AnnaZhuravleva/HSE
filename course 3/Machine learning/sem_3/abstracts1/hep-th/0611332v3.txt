We present a new way to construct de Sitter vacua in type IIB flux compactifications, in which the interplay of the leading perturbative and non-perturbative effects stabilize all moduli in dS vacua at parametrically large volume. Here, the closed string fluxes fix the dilaton and the complex structure moduli while the universal leading perturbative quantum correction to the Kahler potential together with non-perturbative effects stabilize the volume Kahler modulus in a dS_4-vacuum. Since the quantum correction is known exactly and can be kept parametrically small, this construction leads to calculable and explicitly realized de Sitter vacua of string theory with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.
