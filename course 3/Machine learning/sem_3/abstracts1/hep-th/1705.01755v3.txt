We give an algebraic quantization, in the sense of quantum groups, of the complex Minkowski space, and we examine the real forms corresponding to the signatures $(3,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(4,0)$, constructing the corresponding quantum metrics and providing an explicit presentation of the quantized coordinate algebras. In particular, we focus on the Kleinian signature $(2,2)$. The quantizations of the complex and real spaces come together with a coaction of the quantizations of the respective symmetry groups. We also extend such quantizations to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersetting.
