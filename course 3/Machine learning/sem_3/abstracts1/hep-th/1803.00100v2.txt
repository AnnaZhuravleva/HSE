We study Zamolodchikov's TT* deformation of two dimensional quantum field theories in a 't Hooft-like limit, in which we scale the number of degrees of freedom c to infinity and the deformation parameter t to zero, keeping their product t*c fixed (more precisely, we keep energies and distances fixed in units of t*c). In this limit the Hagedorn temperature remains fixed, but other non-local aspects of the theory disappear. We show that in this limit correlation functions may be computed exactly, and they are local in space and polynomials in t. We compute explicitly the deformed three-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor for a TT*-deformed conformal field theory.
