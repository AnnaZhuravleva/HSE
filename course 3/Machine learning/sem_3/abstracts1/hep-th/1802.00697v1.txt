In this paper, we study the holography of quasi-topological gravity in several aspects. We redo the calculation of shear viscosity on the boundary CFT with a new method and show that it has only one mode explicitly. Then we study the butterfly effect in AdS planar black hole and find it has two butterfly velocity modes. We obtain new black hole solution through introducing matter fields. We calculate the thermoelectric DC conductivity with momentum dissipation in quasi-topological gravity and find its results are the same with those of Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravities. These results show us explicit similarities and differences between quasi-topological term and actual topological term.
