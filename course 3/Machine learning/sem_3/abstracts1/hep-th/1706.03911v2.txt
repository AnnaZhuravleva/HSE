Planck scale inspired theories which are also often accompanied with maximum energy and/or momentum scale predict deformed dispersion relations compared to ordinary special relativity and quantum mechanics. In this paper we resort to the methods of statistical mechanics in order to determine the effects of a deformed dispersion relation along with upper bound in partition function as maximum energy and/or momentum scale can have on the thermodynamics of photon gas. We have analyzed two distinct quantum gravity models in this paper
