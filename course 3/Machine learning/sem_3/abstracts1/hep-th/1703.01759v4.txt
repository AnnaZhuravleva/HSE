The relation between kinematic space metric and entanglement entropy provides us with a differential equation for entanglement entropy. For BCFT on upper half plane we solve this equation to obtain an expression for entanglement entropy consistent with known results in the literature. We also discuss how this relation can be used to recast the RG flow, under relevant deformations of a CFT, as a flow in the space of kinematic space metrics.
