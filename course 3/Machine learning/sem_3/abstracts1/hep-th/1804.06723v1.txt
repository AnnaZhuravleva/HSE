In this paper we have shown that the connection between the number of bits and the area of the holographic screen, where both were established in Verlinde's theory of entropic gravity, may depend on the thermostatistics theory previously chosen. Starting from the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) theory, we have reobtained the usual dependency of both, bits number and area. After that, using Tsallis' entropy concept within the entropic gravity formalism, we have derived another relation between the bits number and the holographic screen area. Moreover, we have used this new relation to derive three Newtonian-type accelerations in the context of Tsallis' statistics. Moreover, we have used this new relation to derive three Newtonian-type acceleration in the context of Tsallis statistics which are a modified gravitational acceleration, a modified MOND theory and a modified Friedmann equation. We have obtained the nonextensive version of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation which shows a dependency of the distance of the star in contrast to the standard TF expression. The BG limit gives the standard TF law.
