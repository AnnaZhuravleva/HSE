We analyse scale invariant quadratic quantum gravity incorporating non-minimal coupling to a multiplet of scalar fields in a gauge theory, with particular emphasis on the consequences for its interpretation resulting from a transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. The result is the natural emergence of a de Sitter space solution which, depending the gauge theory and region of parameter space chosen, can be free of ghosts and tachyons, and completely asymptotically free. In the case of an SO(10) model, we present a detailed account of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, and we calculate the leading (two-loop) contribution to the dilaton mass.
