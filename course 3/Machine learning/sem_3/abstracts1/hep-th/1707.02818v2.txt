Meson spectroscopy at finite gauge coupling - whereat any perturbative QCD computation would break down - and finite number of colors, from a top-down holographic string model, has thus far been entirely missing in the literature. This paper fills in this gap. Using the delocalized type IIA SYZ mirror (with $SU(3)$ structure) of the holographic type IIB dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD of arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 as constructed in arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at finite coupling and number of colors ($N_c$ = Number of $D5(\overline{D5}$)-branes wrapping a vanishing two-cycle in the top-down holographic construct of arXiv:hep-th/0902.1540 = ${\cal O}(1)$ in the IR in the MQGP limit of arXiv:hep-th/1306.4339 at the end of a Seiberg duality cascade), we obtain analytical (not just numerical) expressions for the vector and scalar meson spectra and compare our results with previous calculations of hep-th/0412141, arXiv:1409.0559 [hep-th], and obtain a closer match with the Particle Data Group (PDG) results (Chin. Phys. C, 38, 090001 (2014) and 2015 update). Through explicit computations, we verify that the vector and scalar meson spectra obtained by the gravity dual with a black hole for all temperatures (small and large) are nearly isospectral with the spectra obtained by a thermal gravity dual valid for only low temperatures; the isospectrality is much closer for vector mesons than scalar mesons. The black hole gravity dual (with a horizon radius smaller than the deconfinement scale) also provides the expected large-$N$ suppressed decrease in vector meson mass with an increase of temperature.
