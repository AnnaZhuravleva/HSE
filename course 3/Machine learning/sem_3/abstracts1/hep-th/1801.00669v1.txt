Following hep-th/0412336 we use the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and its vector representation to construct brane dynamics. The brane moves through a spacetime which arises in the non-linear realisation from the vector representation and it contains the usual embedding coordinates as well as the world volume fields. The resulting equations of motion are first order in derivatives and can be thought of as duality relations. Each brane carries the full E11 symmetry and so the Cremmer-Julia duality symmetries. We apply this theory to find the dynamics of the IIA and IIB strings, the M2 and M5 branes, the IIB D3 brane as well as the one and two branes in seven dimensions.
