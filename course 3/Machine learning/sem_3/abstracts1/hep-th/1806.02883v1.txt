This paper describes generalized polylogarithms, multiple polylogarithms, and multiple zeta values, along with their implementation in Maple 2018. This set of related functions is of interest in high energy physics as well as in number theory. Algorithms for the analytical manipulation and numerical evaluation of these functions are described, along with the way these features are implemented in Maple.
