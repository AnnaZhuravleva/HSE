We present the general exact solutions for non-extremal rotating charged black holes in the Godel universe of five-dimensional minimal supergravity theory. They are uniquely characterized by four non-trivial parameters, namely the mass $m$, the charge $q$, the Kerr equal rotation parameter $a$, and the Godel parameter $j$. We calculate the conserved energy, angular momenta and charge for the solutions and show that they completely satisfy the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We also study the symmetry and separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi and the massive Klein-Gordon equations in these Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Godel black hole backgrounds.
