We construct a Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory for relativistic hydrodynamics for charged matter in a thermal background using a superspace formalism. Superspace allows us to efficiently impose the symmetries of the problem and to obtain a simple expression for the effective action. We show that the theory we obtain is compatible with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition, which in turn implies that Green's functions obey the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our approach complements and extends existing formulations found in the literature.
