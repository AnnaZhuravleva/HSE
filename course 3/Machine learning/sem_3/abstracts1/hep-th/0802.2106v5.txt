We describe new no-go theorems for producing four-dimensional accelerating universes from warped dimensional reduction. The new theorems improve upon previous results by including dynamical extra dimensions and by treating four-dimensional universes that are not precisely de Sitter. The theorems show there exists a threshold four-dimensional equation-of-state parameter w below which the number of e-foldings of expansion is bounded, and give expressions for the maximum number of allowed e-foldings. In the generic case, the bound must be satisfied if the higher-dimensional theory satisfies the strong energy condition. If the compactification manifold M is one-dimensional, or if its (intrinsic) Ricci scalar R is identically zero, then the bound must be satisfied if the higher-dimensional theory satisfies the null energy condition.
