We study a model described by a single real scalar field in the two-dimensional space-time. The model is specified by a potential which is non-polynomial and supports analytical kink-like solutions that are similar to the standard kink-like solutions that appear in the $\varphi^4$ model when it develops spontaneous symmetry breaking. We investigate the kink-antikink scattering problem in the non-polynomial model numerically and highlight some specific features, which are not present in the standard case.
