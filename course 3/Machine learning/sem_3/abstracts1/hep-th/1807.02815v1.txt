The Palatini $f(|\hat{\Omega}|)$ gravity is a generalized theory of the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity, where $|\hat{\Omega}|$ is constructed with the spacetime metric and independent connection. In this paper, we study $f(|\hat{\Omega}|)$ theory in the thick brane scenario. The analytic solution of the thick brane generated by a single scalar field is obtained for $f(|\hat{\Omega}|)=|\hat{\Omega}|^{\frac{1}{2}+n}$. For the case of $n>1/2$, the warp factor is divergent at the boundary of the extra dimension, while the brane system is asymptotically anti-de Sitter. Besides, the asymptotically de Sitter bulk spacetime can be obtained at the region of $0<n<1/2$ and of $-1/2<n<0$, with the warp factor convergent at the boundary of the extra dimension. In particular, because of the constraints we use, the cases $n=0$ and $n=1/2$ are excluded from our analytic solution. Since the integral of the energy density of the brane should not diverge, the case $n<-1/2$ is excluded, too. The investigation around the negative energy density we obtained implies the localization of ordinary matter on the brane. It is shown that the tensor perturbation of the brane is stable and the massless graviton is localized on the thick brane. Therefore, the effective Einstein-Hilbert action on the brane can be rebuilt in low-energy approximation.
