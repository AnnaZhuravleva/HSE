In this letter we present a new N-flation model constructed by making use of multiple scalar fields which are being described by their own DBI action. We show that the dependence of the e-folding number and of the curvature perturbation on the number of fields changes compared with the normal N-flation model. Our model is also quite different from the usual DBI N-flation which is still based on one DBI action but involves many moduli components. Some specific examples of our model have been analyzed.
