We investigate the phase diagram of QCD-like gauge theories at strong coupling at finite magnetic field $B$, temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu$ using the improved holographic QCD model including the full backreaction of the quarks in the plasma. In addition to the phase diagram we study the behavior of the quark condensate as a function of $T$, $B$ and $\mu$ and discuss the fate of (inverse) magnetic catalysis at finite $\mu$. In particular we observe that inverse magnetic catalysis exists only for small values of the baryon chemical potential. The speed of sound in this holographic quark-gluon plasma exhibits interesting dependence on the thermodynamic parameters.
