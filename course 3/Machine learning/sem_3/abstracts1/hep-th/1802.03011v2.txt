We make progress towards a derivation of a low energy effective theory for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This low energy action is computed to 1-loop using the renormalization group technique, taking proper care of the Slavnov-Taylor identities in the Maximal Abelian Gauge. After that, we perform the Spin-Charge decomposition in a way proposed by L.D. Fadeev and A.J. Niemi. The resulting action describes a pair of non-linear O(3) nonlinear sigma models interacting with a scalar field. The potential of the scalar field is a Mexican hat and the location of the minima sets the energy scale of solitonic configurations of the sigma model fields whose excitations correspond to glueball states.
