We analyze the chiral phase structure of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and density by using the functional renormalization group (FRG). The renormalization group (RG) equation for the fermionic effective potential $V(\sigma;t)$ is given as a partial differential equation, where $\sigma:=\bar \psi\psi$ and $t$ is a dimensionless RG scale. When the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) occurs at a certain scale $t_c$, $V(\sigma;t)$ has singularities originated from the phase transitions, and then one cannot follow RG flows after $t_c$. In this study, we introduce the weak solution method to the RG equation in order to follow the RG flows after the D$\chi$SB and to evaluate the dynamical mass and the chiral condensate in low energy scales. It is shown that the weak solution of the RG equation correctly captures vacuum structures and critical phenomena within the pure fermionic system. We show the chiral phase diagram on temperature, chemical potential and the four-Fermi coupling constant.
