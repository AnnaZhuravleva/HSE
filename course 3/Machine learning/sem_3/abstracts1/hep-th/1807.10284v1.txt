We study various properties of a Proca field coupled to gravity through minimal and quadrupole interactions, described by a 2-parameter family of Lagrangians. Stueckelberg decomposition of the effective theory spells out a model-dependent upper bound on the ultraviolet cutoff, parametrically larger than the Proca mass. A shock-wave analysis of the theory constrains its parameter space by requiring null-energy condition and the absence of negative time delays in high-energy scattering. Derived from unitarity and analyticity of scattering amplitudes, positivity bounds on the effective theory have an important bearing on the ultraviolet cutoff.
