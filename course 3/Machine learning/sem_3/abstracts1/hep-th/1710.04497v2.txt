In previous work we demonstrated that the enlarged super-Poincare algebras which underlie p-brane and D-brane actions in superstring theory can be directly determined based on the integrability of supersymmetry transformations assigned to fields appearing in Wess-Zumino terms. In that work we derived p-brane superalgebras for p = 2 and 3. Here we extend our previous results and give a compact expression for superalgebras for all valid p.
