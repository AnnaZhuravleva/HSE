We study the SYK model with complex fermions, in the presence of an all-to-all $q$-body interaction, with a non-vanishing chemical potential. We find that, in the large $q$ limit, this model can be solved exactly and the corresponding Lyapunov exponent can be obtained semi-analytically. The resulting Lyapunov exponent is a sensitive function of the chemical potential $\mu$. Even when the coupling $J$, which corresponds to the disorder averaged values of the all to all fermion interaction, is large, values of $\mu$ which are exponentially small compared to $J$ lead to suppression of the Lyapunov exponent.
