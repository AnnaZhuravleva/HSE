The paper discusses back reaction effects in cosmology, (\'{a} la Buchert et. al.), induced by noncommutative geometry effects in fluid. We have used generalizations of an action formulation of noncommutative fluid model, proposed earlier by us. We show that the noncommutative effects, depending on its nature, can play either roles of (kinematical) dark matter or Cosmological Constant.
