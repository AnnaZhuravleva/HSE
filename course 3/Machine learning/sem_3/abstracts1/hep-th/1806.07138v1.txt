Anomalous transport coefficients are known to be universal in the absence of dynamical gauge fields. We calculate the corrections to these universal values due to dynamical gluon fields at strong coupling, at finite temperature and finite density, using the holographic duality. We show that the consistent chiral magnetic and chiral vortical currents receive no corrections, while we derive a semi-analytic formula for the chiral separation conductivity. We determine these corrections in the large color, large flavor limit, in terms of a series expansion in the anomalous dimension of the axial current $\Delta$ in terms of physical parameters $\Delta$, temperature, electric and chiral chemical potentials and the flavor to color ratio $\frac{N_f}{N_c}$. Our results are applicable to a generic class of chiral gauge theories that allow for a holographic description in the gravity approximation. We also determine the dynamical gluon corrections to the chiral vortical separation current in a particular example in the absence of external axial fields.
