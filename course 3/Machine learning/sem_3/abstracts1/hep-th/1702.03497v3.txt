Linear stability of braneworld models constructed with multi-scalar fields is very different from that of single-scalar field models. It is well known that both the tensor and scalar perturbation equations of the later can always be written as a supersymmetric Schr\"{o}dinger equation, so it can be shown that the perturbations are stable at linear level. However, in general it is not true for multi-scalar field models and especially there is no effective method to deal with the stability problem of the scalar perturbations for braneworld models constructed with non-minimally coupled multi-scalar fields. In this paper we present a method to investigate the stability of such braneworld models. It is easy to find that the tensor perturbations are stable. For the stability problem of the scalar perturbations, we present a systematic covariant approach. The covariant quadratic order action and the corresponding first-order perturbed equations are derived. By introducing the orthonormal bases in field space and making the Kaluza-Klein decomposition, we show that the Kaluza-Klein modes of the scalar perturbations satisfy a set of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, with which the stability of the scalar perturbations and localization of the scalar zero modes can be analyzed according to nodal theorem. The result depends on the explicit models. For superpotential derived barane models, the scalar perturbations are stable, but there exist normalizable scalar zero modes, which will result in unaccepted fifth force on the brane. We also use this method to analyze the $f(R)$ braneworld model with an explicit solution and find that the scalar perturbations are stable and the scalar zero modes can not be localized on the brane, which ensure that there is no extra long-range force and the Newtonian potential on the brane can be recovered.
