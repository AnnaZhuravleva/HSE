Starting from the pseudo-${\cal B}_0$ gauge solution for marginal deformations in OSFT, we analytically compute the relation between the perturbative deformation parameter $\tilde\lambda$ in the solution and the BCFT marginal parameter $\lambda$, up to fifth order, by evaluating the Ellwood invariants. We observe that the microscopic reason why $\tilde\lambda$ and $\lambda$ are different is that the OSFT propagator renormalizes contact term divergences differently from the contour deformation used in BCFT
