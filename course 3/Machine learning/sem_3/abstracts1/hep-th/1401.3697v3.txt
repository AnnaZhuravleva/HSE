The $\mathcal{N}=1$ AdS-Lorentz superalgebra is studied and its relationship to semigroup expansion developed. Using this mathematical tool, the invariant tensors and Casimir operators are found. In terms of these invariants, a three-dimensionnal Chern--Simons supergravity action with AdS-Lorentz symmetry is constructed. The Killing spinors for a BTZ black-hole like solution of the theory are discussed.
