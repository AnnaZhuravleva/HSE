In this paper we discuss the boson/vortex duality by mapping the (3+1)D Gross-Pitaevskii theory into an effective string theory in the presence of boundaries. Via the effective string theory, we find the Seiberg-Witten map between the commutative and the noncommutative tachyon field theories, and consequently identify their soliton solutions with $D$-branes in the effective string theory. We perform various checks of the duality map and the identification of soliton solutions. This new insight between the Gross-Pitaevskii theory and the effective string theory explains the similarity of these two systems at quantitative level.
