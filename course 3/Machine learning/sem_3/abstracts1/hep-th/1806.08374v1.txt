Large classes of warped AdS$_6$ solutions were constructed recently in Type IIB supergravity, and identified as holographic duals for five-dimensional superconformal field theories realized by $(p,q)$ five-brane webs. We confront holographic results for the five sphere partition functions obtained from these solutions with computations for the putative dual field theories. We obtain the sphere partition functions and conformal central charges in gauge theory deformations of the superconformal field theories numerically using supersymmetric localization, and extrapolate the results to the conformal fixed points. In the appropriate large $N$ limits, the results match precisely to the supergravity computations, providing strong support for the proposed dualities.
