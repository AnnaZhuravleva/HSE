Traditional quantum field theory can lead to enormous zero-point energy, which markedly disagrees with experiment. Unfortunately, this situation is built into conventional canonical quantization procedures. For identical classical theories, an alternative quantization procedure, called affine field quantization, leads to the desirable feature of having a vanishing zero-point energy. This procedure has been applied to renormalizable and nonrenormalizable covariant scalar fields, fermion fields, as well as general relativity. Simpler models are offered as an introduction to affine field quantization.
