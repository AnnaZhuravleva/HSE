We show that BCFW recursion relations can be used to compute all tree level scattering amplitudes in terms of $2\rightarrow2$ scattering amplitude in $U(N)$ ${\mathcal N}=2$ Chern-Simons (CS) theory coupled to matter in fundamental representation. As a byproduct, we also obtain a recursion relation for the CS theory coupled to regular fermions, even though in this case standard BCFW deformations do not have a good asymptotic behavior. Moreover at large $N$, $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering can be computed exactly to all orders in 't Hooft coupling as was done in earlier works by some of the authors. In particular, for ${\mathcal N}=2$ theory, it was shown that $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering is tree level exact to all orders except in the anyonic channel \cite{Inbasekar:2015tsa}, where it gets renormalized by a simple function of 't Hooft coupling. This suggests that it may be possible to compute the all loop exact result for arbitrary higher point scattering amplitudes at large $N$.
