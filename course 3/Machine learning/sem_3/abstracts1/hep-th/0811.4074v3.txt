Recently, a Hamilton-Jacobi method beyond semiclassical approximation in black hole physics was developed by \emph{Banerjee} and \emph{Majhi}\cite{beyond0}. In this paper, we generalize their analysis of black holes to the case of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. It is shown that all the higher order quantum corrections in the single particle action are proportional to the usual semiclassical contribution. The corrections to the Hawking-like temperature and entropy of apparent horizon for FRW universe are also obtained. In the corrected entropy, the area law involves logarithmic area correction together with the standard inverse power of area term.
