In this paper, we derive the energy momentum tensor for the translation invariant noncommutative Tanasa scalar field model. The Wilson regularization procedure is used to improve this tensor and the local conservation property is recovered. The same question is addressed in the case where the Moyal star product is deformed including the tetrad fields. It provides with an extension of the recent work [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 (2010) 155202], regarding the computation and properties of the Noether currents to the renormalizable models.
