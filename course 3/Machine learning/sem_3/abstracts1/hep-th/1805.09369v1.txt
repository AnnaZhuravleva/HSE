This work deals with models described by a single real scalar field in two-dimensional spacetime. The aim is to propose potentials that support massless minima and investigate the presence of kinklike structures that engender polynomial tails. The results unveil the presence of families of asymmetric solutions with energy density and linear stability that behave adequately, enhancing the importance of the analytical study. We stress that the novel topological structures which we find in this work engender long range interactions that are of current interest to statistical mechanics, dipolar quantum gases and the study of quantum information with Rydberg atoms.
