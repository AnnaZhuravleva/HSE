The study of Feynman rules is much facilitated by the two Symanzik polynomials, homogeneous polynomials based on edge variables for a given Feynman graph. We review here the role of a recently discovered third graph polynomial based on half-edges which facilitates the transition from scalar to gauge theory amplitudes: the corolla polynomial. We review in particular the use of graph homology in the construction of this polynomial.
