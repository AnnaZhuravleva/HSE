We treat the topic of the closures of the nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebras of Exceptional groups through their descriptions as moduli spaces, in terms of Hilbert series and the highest weight generating functions for their representation content. We extend the set of known Coulomb branch quiver theory constructions for Exceptional group minimal nilpotent orbits, or reduced single instanton moduli spaces, to include all orbits of Characteristic Height 2, drawing on extended Dynkin diagrams and the unitary monopole formula. We also present a representation theoretic formula, based on localisation methods, for the normal nilpotent orbits of the Lie algebras of any Classical or Exceptional group. We analyse lower dimensioned Exceptional group nilpotent orbits in terms of Hilbert series and the Highest Weight Generating functions for their decompositions into characters of irreducible representations and/or Hall Littlewood polynomials. We investigate the relationships between the moduli spaces describing different nilpotent orbits and propose candidates for the constructions of some non-normal nilpotent orbits of Exceptional algebras.
