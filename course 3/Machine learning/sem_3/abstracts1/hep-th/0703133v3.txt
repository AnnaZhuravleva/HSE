We suggest that the (small but nonvanishing) cosmological constant, and the holographic properties of gravitational entropy, may both reflect unconventional quantum spin-statistics at a fundamental level. This conjecture is motivated by the nonlocality of quantum gravity and the fact that spin is an inherent property of spacetime. As an illustration we consider the `quon' model which interpolates between fermi and bose statistics, and show that this can naturally lead to an arbitrarily small cosmological constant. In addition to laboratory tests, we briefly discuss the possible observable imprint on cosmological fluctuations from inflation.
