We study Virasoro minimal-model 4-point conformal blocks on the sphere and 0-point conformal blocks on the torus (the Virasoro characters), as solutions of Zamolodchikov-type recursion relations. In particular, we study the singularities due to resonances of the dimensions of conformal fields in minimal-model representations, that appear in the intermediate steps of solving the recursion relations, but cancel in the final results.
