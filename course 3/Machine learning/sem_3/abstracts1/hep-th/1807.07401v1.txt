Dirac's original solution of the nontrivial Bianchi identity for magnetic monopoles [Dirac 1948], which redefines the fieldstrength along the Dirac string, diagonalizes the gauge and monopole degrees of freedom. We provide a variant of the Dirac string, which we motivate through a formal expansion of the Bianchi identity. We show how to use our variant prescription to study monopole electrodynamics without reference to a dual potential and provide some applications.
