We study two dimensional conformal field theory with a left-moving conserved current $J$, perturbed by an irrelevant, Lorentz symmetry breaking operator with the quantum numbers of $J\bar{T}$, using a combination of field and string theoretic techniques. We show that the spectrum of the theory has some interesting features, which may shed light on systems of interest for holography and black hole physics.
