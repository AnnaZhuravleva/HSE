The influence of quantum vacuum fluctuations of a real massless scalar field over the motion of a test particle that interacts with the field in the presence of a perfectly reflecting flat boundary is here investigated. There is no quantum induced dispersions of the velocity of the particle when it is alone in the empty space. However, when a reflecting wall is introduced, dispersions occur with magnitude dependent on how fast the system evolves between these two setups. A possible way of implementing this process would be by means of an idealized sudden switching, for which the wall is assumed to be instantaneously placed near the particle and instantaneously removed after a finite interval of time. Although the sudden process is a simple and mathematically convenient idealization it brings some divergences to the results, particularly at a time corresponding to a round trip of a light signal between the particle and the wall. It is shown that the use of smooth switching functions, besides regularizing such divergences, enables us to understand better the behavior of the quantum dispersions induced on the motion of the particle.
