We present a holographic method for computing the response of R\'enyi entropies in conformal field theories to small shape deformations around a flat (or spherical) entangling surface. Our strategy employs the stress tensor one-point function in a deformed hyperboloid background and relates it to the coefficient in the two-point function of the displacement operator. We obtain explicit numerical results for $d=3,\dots,6$ spacetime dimensions, and also evaluate analytically the limits where the R\'enyi index approaches 1 and 0 in general dimensions. We use our results to extend the work of 1602.08493 and disprove a set of conjectures in the literature regarding the relations between the R\'enyi shape dependence and the conformal weight of the twist operator. We also extend our analysis beyond leading order in derivatives in the bulk theory by studying Gauss-Bonnet gravity.
