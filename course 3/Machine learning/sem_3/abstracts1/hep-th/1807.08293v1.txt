In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy of single interval on a cylinder in two-dimensional $T\overline{T}$-deformed conformal field theory. For such case, the (R\'enyi) entanglement entropy takes a universal form in a CFT. We compute the correction due to the deformation up to the leading order of the deformation parameter in the framework of conformal perturbation theory. We find that the correction to the entanglement entropy is nonvanishing in the finite temperature case, while it is vanishing in the finite size case. For the deformed holographic large $c$ CFT, which is proposed to be dual to a AdS$_3$ gravity in a finite region, we find the agreement with the holographic entanglement entropy via the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Moreover, we compute the leading order correction to the R\'enyi entropy, and discuss its holographic picture as well.
