In order to generalize the integration rules to general CHY integrands which include higher order poles, algorithms are proposed in two directions. One is to conjecture new rules, and the other is to use the cross-ratio identity method. In this paper,we use the cross-ratio identity approach to re-derive the conjectured integration rules involving higher order poles for several special cases: the single double pole, single triple pole and duplex-double pole. The equivalence between the present formulas and the previously conjectured ones is discussed for the first two situations.
