Light-cone cuts have recently been proposed as a method to reconstruct the conformal metric of a holographic spacetime. We explore how additional information about the bulk geometry gets encoded in the structure of these light-cone cuts. In particular, we study how the hyperbolic angle related to a cusp in the light-cone cut encodes information about the matter content of the spacetime. We provide an explicit numerical example reconstructing the metric for a 4- dimensional spacetime composed by the superposition of a boson star and a gas of radiation in AdS.
