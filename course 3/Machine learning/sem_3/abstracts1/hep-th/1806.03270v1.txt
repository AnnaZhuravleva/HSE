We point out that there is a generalization to higher dimensions $d=2h>2$ of the two-dimensional Dotsenko-Fateev formula \DF\ for particular Coulomb gas conformal invariant integrals. These expressions represent structure constants of 3-point functions of vertex operators related to a higher dimensional generalization of the Liouville theory. The Coulomb gas formulae admit two different analytic continuations generalizing the DOZZ formula, i.e., the theory is not selfdual for $d>2$.
