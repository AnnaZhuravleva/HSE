A class of nonlocal Lorentzian quantum field theories is introduced in arXiv:1502.01655 and arXiv:1411.6513, where the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ is replaced by a non-analytic function of the d'Alembertian, $f(\Box)$. This is inspired by the Causal Set program where such an evolution arises as the continuum limit of a wave equation on causal sets. The spectrum of these theories contains a continuum of massive excitations. This is perhaps the most important feature which leads to distinct/interesting phenomenology. In this paper, we study properties of the continuum massive modes in depth. We derive the path integral formulation of these theories. Meanwhile, this derivation introduces a dual picture in terms of local fields which clearly shows how continuum massive modes of the nonlocal field interact. The dual picture, in principle, provides a path to extension beyond scalar fields and addressing the issue of renormalization.
