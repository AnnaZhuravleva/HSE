In this paper we discuss a Landau levels problem within the framework of noncommutative configuration space and phase space. We show that the associated energy levels are being shifted in terms of the noncommutative parameter and can be directly obtained from its associated generalized Landau Hamiltonian. A straight forward way of constructing the shifted energy levels is just via a proper defined Bopp shift applied onto the spatial and momenta operators that are used to describe the Landau levels in symmetric gauge potential.
