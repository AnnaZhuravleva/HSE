In this paper we study the dynamical generation of mass in the Lorentz-violating $CP^{(N-1)}$ model defined in two and three-dimensional aether-superspace. We show that even though the model presents a phase structure similar to the usual, Lorentz invariant case, the dynamically generated mass by quantum corrections has a dependence on the Lorentz violating background properties, except for spacelike LV vector parameter. This is to be contrasted with the behavior of the quantum electrodynamics in the two-dimensional aether-superspace, where the dynamical generation of mass was shown to exhibit an explicit dependence on the aether parameters in every possible case.
