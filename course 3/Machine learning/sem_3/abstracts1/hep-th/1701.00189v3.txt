We study generalized gauge theories engineered by taking the low energy limit of the $Dp$ branes wrapping $X \times T^{p-3}$, with $X$ a possibly singular surface in a Calabi-Yau fourfold $Z$. For toric $Z$ and $X$ the partition function can be computed by localization, making it a statistical mechanical model, called the gauge origami. The random variables are the ensembles of Young diagrams. The building block of the gauge origami is associated with a tetrahedron, whose edges are colored by vector spaces. We show the properly normalized partition function is an entire function of the Coulomb moduli, for generic values of the $\Omega$-background parameters. The orbifold version of the theory defines the $qq$-character operators, with and without the surface defects. The analytic properties are the consequence of a relative compactness of the moduli spaces $M({\vec n}, k)$ of crossed and spiked instantons, demonstrated in arXiv:1608.07272.
