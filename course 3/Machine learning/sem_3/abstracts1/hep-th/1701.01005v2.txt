We consider charged rotating BTZ black holes in noncommutative space by use of Chern-Simons theory formulation of $2+1$ dimensional gravity. The noncommutativity between the radial and the angular variables is introduced through the Seiberg-Witten map for gauge fields, and the deformed geometry to the first order in the noncommutative parameter is derived. It is found that the deformation also induces nontrivial torsion, and the Einstein-Cartan theory appears to be a suitable framework to investigate the equations of motion. Though the deformation is indeed nontrivial, the deformed and the original Einstein equations are found to be related by a rather simple coordinate transformation.
