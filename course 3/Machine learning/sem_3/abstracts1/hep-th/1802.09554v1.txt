We consider implications of the quantum extension of the inflationary no hair theorem. We show that when the quantum state of inflation is picked to ensure the validity of the EFT of fluctuations, it takes only ${\cal O}(10)$ efolds of inflation to erase the effects of the initial distortions on the inflationary observables. Thus the Bunch-Davies vacuum is a very strong quantum attractor during inflation. We also consider bouncing universes, where the initial conditions seem to linger much longer and the quantum `balding' by evolution appears to be less efficient.
