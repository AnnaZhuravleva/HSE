We perform conformal perturbation theory by marginal operators to first order. A suitable renormalization method is needed that makes the conformal invariance of the deformed correlation functions manifest. Combining the embedding space formalism with the dimensional regularization, we explicitly check that the deformed and renormalized two and three point functions are conformally invariant.
