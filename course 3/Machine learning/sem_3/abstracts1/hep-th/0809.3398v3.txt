Recently it has been shown that the thermal holographic fluctuations can give rise to an almost scale invariant spectrum of metric perturbations since in this scenario the energy is proportional to the area of the boundary rather than the volume. Here we calculate the non-Gaussianity of the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations in holographic phase, which can imprint on the radiation dominated universe by an abrupt transition. We find that if the matter is phantom-like, the non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{equil}$ can reach ${\cal O}(1)$ or even be larger than ${\cal O}(1)$. Especially in the limit $\omega\to -5/3$, the non-Gaussianity is very large and negative. Furthermore, since the energy is proportional to the area, the thermal holographic non-Gaussianity depends linearly on $k$ if we neglect the variation in $T$ during the transition (fixed temperature).
