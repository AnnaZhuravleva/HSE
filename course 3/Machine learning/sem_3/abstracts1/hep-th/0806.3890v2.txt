A class of dynamical dark energy models, dubbed Spinor Quintom, can be constructed by a spinor field $\psi$ with a nontraditional potential. We find that, if choosing suitable potential, this model is able to allow the equation-of-state to cross the cosmological constant boundary without introducing any ghost fields. In a further investigation, we show that this model is able to mimic a perfect fluid of Chaplygin gas with $p=-c/\rho$ during the evolution, and also realizes the Quintom scenario with its equation-of-state across -1.
