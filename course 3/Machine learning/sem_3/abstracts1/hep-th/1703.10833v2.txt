We present BPS black hole solutions in a four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity with an abelian dyonic gauging of the universal hypermultiplet moduli space. This supergravity arises as the SU(3)-invariant subsector in the reduction of massive IIA supergravity on a six-sphere. The solutions are supported by non-constant scalar, vector and tensor fields and interpolate between a unique $\textrm{AdS}_{2} \,\times\, \textrm{H}^2$ geometry in the near-horizon region and the domain-wall DW$_{4}$ (four-dimensional) description of the D2-brane at the boundary. Some special solutions with charged AdS$_{4}$ or non-relativistic scaling behaviours in the ultraviolet are also presented.
