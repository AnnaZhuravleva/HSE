We study the large $N$ 't Hooft expansion of the partition function of 2d $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory on a torus. We compute the $1/N$ genus expansion of both the chiral and the full partition function of 2d Yang-Mills using the recursion relation found by Kaneko and Zagier with a slight modification. Then we study the large order behavior of this genus expansion, from which we extract the non-perturbative correction using the resurgence relation. It turns out that the genus expansion is not Borel summable and the coefficient of 1-instanton correction, the so-called Stokes parameter, is pure imaginary. We find that the non-perturbative correction obtained from the resurgence is reproduced from a certain analytic continuation of the grand partition function of a system of non-relativistic fermions on a circle. Our analytic continuation is different from that considered in hep-th/0504221.
