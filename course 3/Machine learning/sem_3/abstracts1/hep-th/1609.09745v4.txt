We give a general review of extended supergravities and their gauging using the duality-covariant embedding tensor formalism. Although the focus is on four-dimensional theories, an overview of the gauging procedure and the related tensor hierarchy in the higher-dimensional models is given. The relation of gauged supergravities to flux compactifications is discussed and examples are worked out in detail.
