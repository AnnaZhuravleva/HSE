We propose a modified version of the Faddeev-Popov quantization approach for non-Abelian gauge field theory to avoid the Gribov ambiguity. We show that by means of introducing a new method to insert the correct identity into the Yang-Mills generating functional and considering the identity generated by an integral through a subgroup of the gauge group, the problem of the Gribov ambiguity can be removed naturally. Meanwhile by handling the absolute value of the Faddeev-Popov determinant with the method introduced by Williams and collaborators, we lift the Jacobian determinant together with the absolute value and obtain a local Lagrangian. The new Lagrangian have a nilpotent symmetry which can be viewed as an analogue of the BRST symmetry.
