We investigate the off-diagonal sector of eigenstate thermalization using both local and non-local probes in 2-dimensional conformal field theories. A novel analysis of the asymptotics of OPE coefficients via the modular bootstrap is performed to extract the behaviour of the off-diagonal matrix elements. We also probe this sector using semi-classical heavy-light Virasoro blocks. The results demonstrate signatures of thermality and confirms the entropic suppression of the off-diagonal elements as necessitated by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.
