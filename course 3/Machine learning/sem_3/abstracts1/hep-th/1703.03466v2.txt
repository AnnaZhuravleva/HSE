We show that a quantum subsystem can become significantly entangled with a classical background through a process with little or none semi-classical back-reactions. We study two quantum harmonic oscillators coupled to each other in a time-independent Hamiltonian. We compare it to its semi-classical approximation in which one of the oscillators is treated as the classical background. In this approximation, the remaining quantum oscillator has an effective Hamiltonian which is time-dependent, and its evolution appears to be unitary. However, in the fully quantum model, the two oscillators can entangle with each other. Thus the unitarity of either individual oscillator is never guaranteed. We derive the critical time scale after which the unitarity of either individual oscillator is irrevocably lost. In particular, we give an example that in the adiabatic limit, unitarity is lost before other relevant questions can be addressed.
