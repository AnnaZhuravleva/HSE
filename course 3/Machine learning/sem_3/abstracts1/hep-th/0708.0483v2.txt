We derive the semiclassical evolution of massless conformally coupled scalar matter in the de Sitter space-time from the Born-Oppenheimer reduction of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We find a remarkable difference with respect to the minimally coupled case: the effect of the quantum gravitational corrections do not depend on the momentum of the scalar mode up to second order in the Planck length and, therefore, there are no relevant corrections to the dispersion relation.
