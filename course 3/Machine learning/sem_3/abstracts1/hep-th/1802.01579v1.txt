Starting with a four-dimensional gauge theory approach to rational, elliptic, and trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, we determine the corresponding quantum group deformations to all orders in $\hbar$ by deducing their RTT presentations. The arguments we give are a mix of familiar ones with reasoning that is more transparent from the four-dimensional gauge theory point of view. The arguments apply most directly for $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ and can be extended to all simple Lie algebras other than $\mathfrak{e}_8$ by taking into account the self-duality of some representations, the framing anomaly for Wilson operators, and the existence of quantum vertices at which several Wilson operators can end.
