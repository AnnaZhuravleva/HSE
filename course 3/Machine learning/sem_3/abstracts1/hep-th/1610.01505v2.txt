The content of this paper includes studying holographical and thermodynamical aspects of dyonic black holes in the presence of massive gravity. For the first part of paper, thermodynamical properties of the bulk which includes black holes are studied and the main focus is on critical behavior. It will be shown that the existence of massive gravitons introduces remnant for temperature after evaporation of black holes, van der Waals phase transition for non-spherical black holes and etc. The consistency of different thermodynamical approaches toward critical behavior of the black holes is presented and the physical properties near the region of thermal instability are given. Next part of the paper studies holographical aspects of the boundary theory. Magnetization and susceptibility of the boundary are extracted and the conditions for having diamagnetic and paramagnetic behaviors are investigated. It will be shown that generalization to massive gravity results into the existence of diamagnetic/paramagnetic phases in phase structure of the hyperbolic and horizon flat of boundary conformal field theory.
