We calculate the rate of thermal Schwinger pair production at arbitrary coupling in weak external fields. Our calculations are valid independently of many properties of the charged particles produced, in particular their spin and whether they are electric or magnetic. Using the worldline formalism, we calculate the logarithm of the rate to leading order in the weak external field and to all orders in virtual photon exchange, taking us beyond the perturbative expansion about the leading order, weak coupling result.
