We propose higher spin supercurrent multiplets for ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric field theories in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdS). Their explicit realisations are derived for various supersymmetric theories, including a model of $N$ massive chiral scalar superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix. We also present new off-shell gauge formulations for the massless ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric multiplet of integer superspin $s$ in AdS, where $s =2,3,\dots$, as well as for the massless gravitino multiplet (superspin $s=1$) which requires special consideration.
