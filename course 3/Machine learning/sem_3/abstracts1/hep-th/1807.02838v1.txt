The relativistic quantum dynamics of a spinless charged particle interacting with both Aharonov-Bohm and Coulomb-type potentials in the G\"odel-type spacetime is considered. The dynamics of the system is governed by the Klein-Gordon equation with interactions. We verify that it is possible to establish a quantum condition between the energy of the particle and the parameter that characterizes the vorticist of the spacetime. We rigorously analyze the ground state of the system and determine the corresponding wave functions to it.
