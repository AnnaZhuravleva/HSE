The microscopic formula for the degeneracy of BMPV black hole microstates contains a series of exponentially suppressed corrections to the leading Bekenstein Hawking expression. We identify saddle points of the quantum entropy function for the BMPV black hole which are natural counterparts to these corrections and discuss the matching of leading and next-to-leading terms from the microscopic and macroscopic sides in a limit where the black hole charges are large.
