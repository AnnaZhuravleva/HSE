In this paper we present the generalization of Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity (CSLTG) to spin-3. We propose a Lagrangian describing the spin-3 fields coupled to Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity. Then we obtain conserved charges of these theories by using a quasi-local formalism. We find a general formula for entropy of black holes solutions of Spin-3 CSLTG. As an example, we apply our formalism to the spin-3 Generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG) model. We analysis this model at linearized level and show that this model propagate two massive spin-2 modes and two massive spin-3 modes. We find no-ghost and no-tachyon conditions, which can be satisfy in the parameter space of the model. Then we find energy, angular momentum and entropy of a special black hole solution of this model.
