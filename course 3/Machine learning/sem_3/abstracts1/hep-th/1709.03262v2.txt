We present a new operator in the ambitwistor string which glues together correlators with fewer points or of lower genus. It underpins the recursive construction of tree-level CHY scattering amplitudes by Dolan \& Goddard, as well as the computation of loop integrands on a Riemann sphere by Geyer et al. The gluing operator is a tractable object due to the finiteness of the spectrum. In particular, we demonstrate how it gives rise to the complete one-loop integrand in SYM and SUGRA. The operator is conjectured to be the path integral incarnation of the ambitwistor string propagator, and to coincide with the field theory limit of the standard string theory propagator.
