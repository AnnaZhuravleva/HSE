Some time ago we have suggested that positive vacuum energy exhibits a finite quantum break time, which can be a signal that a positive cosmological constant is inconsistent. From the requirement that Universe never undergoes through quantum breaking, we have derived an absolute lower bound on the speed of variation of positive vacuum energy. The same suggestion about exclusion of positive cosmological constant was made recently. We show that the new bound represents a particular string theoretic version of the old bound, which is more general. In this light, we show that the existing window still provides a large room for the inflationary and dark energy model building. In particular, the inflationary models with gravitational strength interactions, are protected against fast quantum breaking.
