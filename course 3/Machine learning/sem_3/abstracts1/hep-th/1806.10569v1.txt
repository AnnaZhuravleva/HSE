We consider Type IIB 5-brane configurations for 5d rank 2 superconformal theories which are classified recently by geometry in arXiv:1801.04036. We propose all the 5-brane web diagrams for these rank 2 theories and show dualities between some of different gauge theories with explicit duality map of mass parameters and Coulomb branch moduli. In particular, we explicitly construct 5-brane configurations for $G_2$ gauge theory with six flavors and its dual $Sp(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories. We also present 5-brane webs for $SU(3)$ theories of Chern-Simons level greater than 5.
