We find a new supersymmetric solution of type IIB supergravity which is the uplift of the GPPZ solution of maximal SO$(6)$ gauged supergravity in five dimensions. This background is expected to be holographically dual to an $\mathcal{N}=1^{*}$ supersymmetric mass deformation of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. The ten-dimensional solution is singular in the region corresponding to the IR regime of the dual gauge theory and we discuss the physics of the singularity in some detail.
