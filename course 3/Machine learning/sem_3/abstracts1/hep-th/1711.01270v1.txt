We present a unified mathematical framework that elegantly describes minimally SUSY gauge theories in even dimension, ranging from $6d$ to $0d$, and their dualities. This approach combines recent developments on graded quiver with potentials, higher Ginzburg algebras and higher cluster categories (also known as $m$-cluster categories). Quiver mutations studied in the context of mathematics precisely correspond to the order $(m+1)$ dualities of the gauge theories. Our work suggests that these equivalences of quiver gauge theories sit inside an infinite family of such generalized dualities, whose physical interpretation is yet to be understood.
