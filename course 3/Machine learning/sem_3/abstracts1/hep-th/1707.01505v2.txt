We examine magnetotransport in a holographic Dirac-Born-Infeld model, taking into account the effects of backreaction on the geometry. The theory we consider includes axionic scalars, introduced to break translational symmetry and generate momentum dissipation. The generic structure of the DC conductivity matrix for these theories is extremely rich, and is significantly more complex than that obtained in the probe approximation. We find new classes of black brane solutions, including geometries that exhibit Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling violation, and examine their implications on the transport properties of the system. Depending on the choice of theory parameters, these backgrounds can lead to metallic or insulating behavior. Negative magnetoresistance is observed in a family of dynoic solutions. Some of the new backreacted geometries also support magnetic-field-induced metal-insulator transitions.
