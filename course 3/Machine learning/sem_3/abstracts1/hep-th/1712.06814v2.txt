The N=4 superconformal algebra is derived from the symmetry transformations of fields in the N=4 SYM action in D=4. We use a Majorana-Weyl spinor in D=10 instead of four Weyl spinors in D=4. This makes it transparent to relate generators of the N=4 superconformal algebra to those of the super-AdS_5XS^5 algebra. Especially, we obtain the concrete map from the supersymmetries Q and conformal supersymmetries S in N=4 SYM to the supersymmetries (Q_1, Q_2) in the AdS_5XS^5 background.
