Within the context of the extended bi-spinor gauge theory we describe a new off-shell realization of scalar supersymmetry (s-susy) of massless interacting fields with U(1), U(1) x SU(N) and U(1) x SU(N_1) x SU(N_2) gauge groups. S-susy acts in the space of graded differential forms. The realization is non-linear in the non-abelian case. S-susy would not require the doubling of the SM particle spectrum. Instead, essentially only the forth generation of quarks and leptons would be needed as extra field content. The theory is by construction globally U(2,2) invariant and is an example of a supersymmetric CFT.
