We discuss the cosmological constant problem in the light of dilatation symmetry and its possible anomaly. For dilatation symmetric quantum theories realistic asymptotic cosmology is obtained provided the effective potential has a non-trivial minimum. For theories with dilatation anomaly one needs as a non-trivial "cosmon condition" that the energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum is purely anomalous. Such a condition is related to the short-distance renormalization group behavior of the fundamental theory. Observable deviations from the standard hot big bang cosmology are possible.
