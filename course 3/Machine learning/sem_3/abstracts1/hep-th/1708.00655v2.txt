Harmonic oscillator in noncommutative two dimensional lattice are investigated. Using the properties of non-differential calculus and its applications to quantum mechanics, we provide the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding Hamiltonian. First we consider the case of ordinary quantum mechanics, and we point out the thermodynamic properties of the model. Then we consider the same question when both coordinates and momentums are noncommutative.
