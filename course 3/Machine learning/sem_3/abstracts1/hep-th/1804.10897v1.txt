We study the charge response in complex frequency plane and the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of the boundary quantum field theory with momentum dissipation dual to a probe generalized Maxwell system with Weyl correction. When the strength of the momentum dissipation $\hat{\alpha}$ is small, the pole structure of the conductivity is similar to the case without the momentum dissipation. The qualitative correspondence between the poles of the real part of the conductivity of the original theory and the ones of its electromagnetic (EM) dual theory approximately holds when $\gamma\rightarrow -\gamma$ with $\gamma$ being the Weyl coupling parameter. While the strong momentum dissipation alters the pole structure such that most of the poles locate at the purely imaginary axis. At this moment, the correspondence between the poles of the original theory and its EM dual one is violated when $\gamma\rightarrow -\gamma$. In addition, for the dominant pole, the EM duality almost holds when $\gamma\rightarrow -\gamma$ for all $\hat{\alpha}$ except for a small region of $\hat{\alpha}$.
