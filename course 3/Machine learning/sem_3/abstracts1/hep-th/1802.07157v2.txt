In a recent preprint [ArXiv 1802.02319], Meneses et al. challenge our proof that scale invariance implies conformal invariance for the three-dimensional Ising model [B. Delamotte, M. Tissier and N. Wschebor, Phys. Rev. E 93 (2016), 012144.]. We refute their arguments. We also point out a mistake in their one-loop calculation of the dimension of the vector operator $V_\mu$ of lowest dimension which is not a total derivative.
