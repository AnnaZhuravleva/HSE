We propose an alternative anthropic probability for calculating the probabilities in eternal inflation. This anthropic probability follows naturally from the weak anthropic principle, and does not suffer the freak observer or the typicality problems. The problem that our observed cosmological constant is not at the peak of the usual anthropic probability distribution is also solved using this proposal.
