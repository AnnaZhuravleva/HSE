We study asymptotic charges associated to a spin-zero analogue of Weinberg's soft photon and graviton theorems in even dimensions. Simple spacetime expressions for the charges are given, but unlike gravity or electrodynamics, the symmetry interpretation for the charges remains elusive. This work is a higher dimensional extension of the four dimensional case studied in arXiv:1703.07885 .
