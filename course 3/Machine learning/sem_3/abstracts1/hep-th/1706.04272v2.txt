Light scalar fields can form gravitationally bound compact objects called boson stars. The profile of boson stars in the Newtonian limit is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equations. We present a semi-analytic solution to these equations and construct the profile of boson stars formed by a non-interacting scalar field. Our solution is stable with respect to numerical errors and has accuracy better than $10^{-6}$ over the entire range.
