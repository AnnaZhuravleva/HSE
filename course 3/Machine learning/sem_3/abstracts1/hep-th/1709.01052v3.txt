Holographic theories with classical gravity duals are maximally chaotic; i.e., they saturate the universal bound on the rate of growth of chaos. It is interesting to ask whether this property is true only for leading large $N$ correlators or if it can show up elsewhere. In this Letter we consider the simplest setup to tackle this question: a Brownian particle coupled to a thermal ensemble. We find that the four-point out-of-time-order correlator that diagnoses chaos initially grows at an exponential rate that saturates the chaos bound, i.e., with a Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L=2\pi/\beta$. However, the scrambling time is parametrically smaller than for plasma excitations, $t_*\sim\beta \log \sqrt{\lambda}$ instead of $t_*\sim\beta \log N^2$. Our result shows that, at least in certain cases, maximal chaos can be attained in the probe sector without the explicit need of gravitational degrees of freedom.
