The infrared dynamics of the SYK model, as well as its associated tensor models, exhibit some of the non trivial features expected of a holographic dual of near extremal black holes. These include developing certain symmetries of the near horizon geometry and exhibiting maximal chaos. In this paper we present a generalization of these tensor models to include fields with fewer tensor indices and which can be thought of as describing probes in a black hole background. In large $N$ limit, dynamics of the original model remain unaffected by the probe fields and the four point functions of the probe fields exhibit maximal chaos, a non trivial feature expected of a black hole probe. Interestingly probe primaries have the same dimensions as primaries of the original fields.
