We present a low entry-level introduction to the Conformal Bootstrap. We review and obtain several basic bounds using Linear Programming in machine precision in Mathematica, making the results accessible even to the most uneducated computer user. The Extremal Functional Method and the method of determinants are also explored. Finally, we make an attempt at writing modular invariance statements as crossing symmetry equations for twist operators and perform Modular Bootstrap using 4-pt correlators.
