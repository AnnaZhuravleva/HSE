Linear Maxwell equations, corresponding to the first-power deviations from a constant-field background, are studied within the infrared approximation. Linear magnetic responses, linearly induced currents and vector potentials to an imposed static finite-sized charge in an arbitrary combination of constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields are discussed. Two class of solutions are found, namely, magnetically neutral responses whose corresponding magnetic charges are zero, as a result of the fulfillment of the Bianchi identity at every point of the space and a magnetically charged one, in which the latter identity fails at the origin $\mathbf{x}=0$, resulting to a nontrivial magnetic charge thereby. The vector potential associated with the magnetically neutral responses are free of divergence while, for the latter case, are found to be Dirac strings, associated with an infinite number of points, in which the potential is singular and restricted to half-axes. All coefficients, proportional to the effective lagrangian and derivatives of it, are specialized to Quantum Electrodynamics, wherein the strong magnetic background regime is discussed in detail.
