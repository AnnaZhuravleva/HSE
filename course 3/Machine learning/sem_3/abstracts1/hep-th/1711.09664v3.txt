We introduce ABJM quantum field theory in the noncommutative spacetime by using the component formalism and show that it is N=6 supersymmetric. For the U(1)_{\kappa} x U(1)_{-\kappa} case, we compute all one-loop 1PI two and three point functions in the Landau gauge and show that they are UV finite and have well-defined commutative limits theta^{\mu\nu} -> 0, corresponding exactly to the 1PI functions of the ordinary ABJM field theory. This result also holds for all one-loop functions which are UV finite by power counting. It seems that the quantum noncommutative ABJM field theory is free from the noncommutative IR instabilities.
