We describe a broad class of time-dependent exact wave solutions to 6D gauged chiral supergravity with two compact dimensions. These 6D solutions are nontrivial warped generalizations of 4D pp-waves and Kundt class solutions and describe how a broad class of previously-static compactifications from 6D to 4D (sourced by two 3-branes) respond to waves moving along one of the uncompactified directions. Because our methods are generally applicable to any higher dimensional supergravity they are likely to be of use for finding the supergravity limit of time-dependent solutions in string theory. The 6D solutions are interesting in their own right, describing 6D shock waves induced by high energy particles on the branes, and as descriptions of the near-brane limit of the transient wavefront arising from a local bubble-nucleation event on one of the branes, such as might occur if a tension-changing phase transition were to occur.
