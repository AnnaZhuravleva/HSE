We study violations of the Null Energy Condition (NEC) in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and their implications. For the first part of the project, we examine these violations for classes of already known and novel (first discussed here) QFT states. Next, we discuss the implications of these violations focusing on the example of Wormhole Traversability. After reviewing the current literature on the existing restrictions on these violations, we conjecture that NEC violating states are incompatible with the Semi-Classical Gravity approximation. We argue that this conjecture provides the only way out of the problems introduced by the violations of NEC in this regime. Building on this, we propose a bound that should hold for all QFT states. Finally, we show that both our conjecture and bound hold for some relevant classes of QFT states.
