We study polygonal bounces, field solutions that describe tunneling in quantum or thermal field theory, characterized by a poly-linear potential with an arbitrary number of segments. The usual shooting procedure is transformed into a single parameter algebraical root search, significantly simplified in $D = 2, 3, 4, 6$ and 8 space-time dimensions. We implement this approach and demonstrate its performance on some examples. The results are compared with other methods, tools and exact solutions. We also develop a systematic perturbative expansion beyond the leading poly-linear approximation, such that higher orders are taken into account. In addition, we extend (semi)analytically the known two segment approximation in $D = 4$ to arbitrary dimensions.
