Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute analytically the late-time behavior of two-point functions, Wilson loops and entanglement entropy in a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills plasma undergoing a boost-invariant expansion. We take into account the effects of first order dissipative hydrodynamics and investigate the effects of the (time-dependent) shear viscosity on the various observables. The two-point functions decay exponentially at late times and are unaffected by the viscosity if the points are separated along the transverse directions. For longitudinal separation we find a much richer structure. In this case the exponential is modulated by a nonmonotonic function of the rapidities and a dimensionless combination of the shear viscosity and proper time. We show that this peculiar behavior constrains the regime of validity of the hydrodynamical expansion. In addition, similar results are found for certain Wilson loops and entanglement entropies.
