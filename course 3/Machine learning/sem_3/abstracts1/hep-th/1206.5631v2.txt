We analyze the problem of black body radiation in the presence of quantum gravity effects encoded in modified dispersion relations and in a model universe with large extra dimensions. In this context, modified form of Planck distribution, Jeans number, equipartition theorem, spectral energy density, Stefan-Boltzmann law and Wien's law are found and the corresponding results are interpreted. Then, entropy and specific heat of black body radiation are obtained in this setup. Finally, the modified form of Debye law and Dulong-Petit law are investigated in this framework.
