The Hilbert series is a generating function that enumerates gauge invariant chiral operators of a supersymmetric field theory with four supercharges and an R-symmetry. In this article I review how counting dressed 't Hooft monopole operators leads to a formula for the Hilbert series of a 3d $\mathcal{N}\geq 2$ gauge theory, which captures precious information about the chiral ring and the moduli space of supersymmetric vacua of the theory.
