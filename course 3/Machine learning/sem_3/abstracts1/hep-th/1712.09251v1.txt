Notes on holographic renormalization as a tool for UV analysis and derivation of the two-point Ward identity encoding symmetry breaking. Goldstone theorem is reviewed, discussing in particular the modifications required by its extension to non-relativistic field theories. The Ward identity encoding both spontaneous and explicit breaking are derived by general principles. Holographic renormalization is presented in a quite operational fashion. The derivation of the Ward identity in holography is illustrated by an example.
