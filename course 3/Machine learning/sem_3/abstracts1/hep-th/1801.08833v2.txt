We consider the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetric extremal black holes in un-gauaged and gauged 5-dimensional supergravity, coupled to abelian vector multiplets. By analyzing the global properties of the Killing spinors, we prove that the near-horizon geometries undergo a supersymmetry enhancement. This follows from a set of generalized Lichnerowicz-type theorems we establish, together with an index theory argument. As a consequence, these solutions always admit a $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry group.
