We examine how the breaking of shift symmetry affects the formation of caustics for the standard canonical kinetic theory as well as for the DBI theory. We show in this case, that the standard canonical kinetic theory is caustic free but the same does not always apply for the DBI model. We make similar arguments about the conformal Galileons. Finally, it is shown that the simple wave condition is not invariant under field redefinitions and the meaning of simple waves after symmetry breaking is discussed.
