We show that all fermions of one generation of the Standard Model (SM) can be elegantly described by a single fixed parity (say even) inhomogeneous real-valued differential form in seven dimensions. In this formalism the full kinetic term of the SM fermionic Lagrangian is reproduced as the appropriate dimensional reduction of (Psi, D Psi) where Psi is a general even degree differential form in R^7, the inner product is as described in the main text, and D is essentially an appropriately interpreted exterior derivative operator. The new formalism is based on geometric constructions originating in the subjects of generalised geometry and double field theory.
