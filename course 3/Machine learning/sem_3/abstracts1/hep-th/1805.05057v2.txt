We study the partition function of the matrix model of finite size that realizes the irregular conformal block for the case of the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_f =2$. This model has been obtained in [arXiv:1008.1861 [hep-th]] as the massive scaling limit of the $\beta$ deformed matrix model representing the conformal block. We point out that the model for the case of $\beta =1$ can be recast into a unitary matrix model with log potential and show that it is exhibited as a discrete Painlev\'{e} system by the method of orthogonal polynomials. We derive the Painlev\'{e} II equation, taking the double scaling limit in the vicinity of the critical point which is the Argyres-Douglas type point of the corresponding spectral curve. By the $0$d-$4$d dictionary, we obtain the time variable and the parameter of the double scaled theory respectively from the sum and the difference of the two mass parameters scaled to their critical values.
