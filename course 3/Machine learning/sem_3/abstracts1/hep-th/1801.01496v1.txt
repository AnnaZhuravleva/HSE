We present a bottom-up construction of vector effective field theories using the infrared structure of scattering amplitudes. Our results employ two distinct probes of soft kinematics: multiple soft limits and single soft limits after dimensional reduction, applicable in four and general dimensions, respectively. Both approaches uniquely specify the Born-Infeld (BI) model as the only theory of vectors completely fixed by certain infrared conditions which generalize the Adler zero for pions. These soft properties imply new recursion relations for on-shell scattering amplitudes in BI theory and suggest the existence of a wider class of vector effective field theories.
