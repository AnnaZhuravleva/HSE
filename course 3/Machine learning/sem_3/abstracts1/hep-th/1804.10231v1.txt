We provide a very brief review of the description of colored invariants for the Hopf link in terms of characters, which need to be taken at a peculiar deformation of the topological locus, depending on one of the two representations associated with the two components of the link. Most important, we extend the description of this locus to conjugate and, generically, to composite representations and also define the "adjoint" Schur functions emerging in the dual description.
