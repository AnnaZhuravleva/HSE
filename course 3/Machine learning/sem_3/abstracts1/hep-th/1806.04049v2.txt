Entanglement is one of the most intriguing features of quantum theory and a main resource in quantum information science. Ground states of quantum many-body systems with local interactions typically obey an "area law" meaning the entanglement entropy proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional when the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated by at most a logarithm for over two decades. Recent discovery of Motzkin and Fredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant violation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of the volume in spite of local interactions. Although importance of intensive study of the models is undoubted to reveal novel features of quantum entanglement, it is still far from their complete understanding. In this article, we first analytically compute the Renyi entropy of the Motzkin and Fredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The Renyi entropy is an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is reconstructed once the Renyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter. We find non-analytic behavior of the Renyi entropy with respect to the parameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin model studied so far. The Renyi entropy grows proportionally to the volume in one phase, whereas it scales as a logarithm of the volume in another phase. The transition point itself forms the third phase of the square-root scaling.
