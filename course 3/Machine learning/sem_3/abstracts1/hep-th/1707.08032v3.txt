The sigma-model of closed strings spinning in the $\eta$-deformation of $AdS_{5} \times S^{5}$ leads to an integrable deformation of the one-dimensional Neumann-Rosochatius mechanical system. In this article we construct general solutions to this system that can be written in terms of elliptic functions. The solutions correspond to closed strings with non-constant radii rotating with two different angular momenta in an $\eta$-deformed three-sphere. We analyse the reduction of the elliptic solutions for some limiting values of the deformation parameter. For the case of solutions with constant radii we find the dependence of the classical energy of the string on the angular momenta as an expansion in the 't Hooft coupling.
