In this paper, we present general method for the solving the field equation of Einstein - Power law Maxwell-Scalar gravity in $n+1$ dimension with Liouvill potential. The corresponding solution lead us to achieve some thermodynamics quantity of black hole. On the other hand, in QCD the $Q\bar{Q}$ bound state represents a balance between repulsive kinetic and attractive potential energy. Also, in a hot quark-gluon plasma, the interaction potential experiences medium effects. In that case, the color screening modifies the attractive binding force between the quarks, while the increase of entropy with $Q\bar{Q}$ separation gives rise to a growing repulsion. The jet quenching and entropic force parameters play important role in binding and dissociation length of quark-antiquark. For this reason, we take advantage from $AdS/CFT$ correspondence and obtain the jet quenching and entropic force for the Einstein - Power law Maxwell-Scalar gravity solution. We note that, the effects of $p$ from power law Maxwell field on the jet quenching and entropic force parameters are shown by some figures.
