We develop a framework for deriving Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSEs) and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The starting point is a modified form (with auxiliary fields) of QCD generating functional. This framework provides a natural order-by-order truncation scheme for DSEs and BSE, and the kernels of the equations up to any order are explicitly given. Chiral symmetry (at chiral limit) is preserved in any order truncation, so it exemplifies the symmetry preserving truncation scheme. It provides a method to study DSEs and BSE beyond the Rainbow-Ladder truncation, and is especially useful to study contributions from non-Abelian dynamics (those arise from gluon self-interactions). We also derive the equation for the quark-ghost scattering kernel, and discuss the Slavnov-Taylor identity connecting the quark-gluon vertex, the quark propagator and the quark-ghost scattering kernel.
