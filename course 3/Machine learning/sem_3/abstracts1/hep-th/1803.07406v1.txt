We investigate the observational consequences of the light-like deformations of the Poincar\'e algebra induced by the jordanian and the extended jordanian classes of Drinfel'd twists. Twist-deformed generators belonging to a Universal Enveloping Algebra close non-linear $W$-algebras. In some cases the $W$-algebra is responsible for the existence of bounded domains of the deformed generators. The Hopf algebra coproduct implies associative non-linear additivity of the multi-particle states. A subalgebra of twist-deformed observables is recovered whenever the twist-deformed generators are either hermitian or pseudo-hermitian with respect to a common invertible hermitian operator.
