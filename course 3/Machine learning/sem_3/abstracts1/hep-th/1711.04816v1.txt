We obtain new constraints for the modular energy of general states by using the monotonicity property of relative entropy. In some cases, modular energy can be related to the energy density of states and these constraints lead to interesting relations between energy and entropy. In particular, we derive new quantum energy inequalities that improve some previous bounds for the energy density of states in a conformal field theory. Additionally, the inequalities derived in this manner also lead us to conclude that the entropy of the state further restricts the possible amount of negative energy allowed by the theory.
