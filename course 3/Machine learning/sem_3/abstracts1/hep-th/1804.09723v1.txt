Thus far, all known ghost-free interactions of multiple spin-2 fields have involved at most pairwise couplings of the fields, which are direct generalizations of bimetric interactions. Here we present a class of spin-2 theories with genuine multi-field interactions, and explicitly demonstrate the absence of ghost instabilities. The construction involves integrating out a nondynamical field in a theory of spin-2 fields with only pairwise ghost-free interactions. The new multi-vierbein interactions generated are not always expressible in terms of the associated metrics.
