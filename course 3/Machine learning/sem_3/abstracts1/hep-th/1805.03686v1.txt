For the general renormalizable ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory we investigate renormalization of the Faddeev--Popov ghosts using the higher covariant derivative regularization. First, we find the two-loop anomalous dimension defined in terms of the bare coupling constant in the general $\xi$-gauge. It is demonstrated that for doing this calculation one should take into account that the quantum gauge superfield is renormalized in a nonlinear way. Next, we obtain the two-loop anomalous dimension of the Faddeev--Popov ghosts defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant and examine its dependence on the subtraction scheme.
