In this paper we apply supersymmetric localization to study gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) describing supermanifold target spaces. We use the localization method to show that A-twisted GLSM correlation functions for certain supermanifolds are equivalent to A-twisted GLSM correlation functions for hypersurfaces in ordinary spaces under certain conditions. We also argue that physical two-sphere partition functions are the same for these two types of target spaces. Therefore, we reproduce the claim of arXiv:hep-th/9404186, arXiv:hep-th/9506070. Furthermore, we explore elliptic genera and (0,2) deformations and find similar phenomena.
