We provide general arguments regarding the connection between low-energy theories (gravity and quantum field theory) and a hypothetical fundamental theory of quantum gravity, under the assumptions of (i) validity of the holographic bound and (ii) preservation of unitary evolution at the level of the fundamental theory. In particular, the appeal to the holographic bound imposed on generic physical systems by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy implies that both classical geometry and quantum fields propagating on it should be regarded as phenomena emergent from the dynamics of the fundamental theory. The reshuffling of the fundamental degrees of freedom during the unitary evolution then leads to an entanglement between geometry and quantum fields. The consequences of such scenario are considered in the context of black hole evaporation and the related information-loss issue: we provide a simplistic toy model in which an average loss of information is obtained as a consequence of the geometry-field entanglement.
