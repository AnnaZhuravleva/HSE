We construct a set of quasi-local measurement operators in 2D CFT, and then use them to proceed the quantum energy teleportation (QET) protocol and show it is viable. These measurement operators are constructed out of the projectors constructed from shadow operators, but further acting on the product of two spatially separated primary fields. They are equivalently the OPE blocks in the large central charge limit up to some UV-cutoff dependent normalization but the associated probabilities of outcomes are UV-cutoff independent. We then adopt these quantum measurement operators to show that the QET protocol is viable in general. We also check the CHSH inequality a la OPE blocks.
