We compute the parity violating three point amplitudes with one scalar leg in higher spin gravity and compare results with those of Chern-Simons matter theories. The three-point correlators of the free boson, free fermion, critical vector model and Gross-Neveu model are reproduced including the dependence on the Chern-Simons coupling. We also perform a simple test of the modified higher spin equations proposed in arXiv:1605.02662 [hep-th] and find that the results are consistent with the AdS/CFT correspondence.
