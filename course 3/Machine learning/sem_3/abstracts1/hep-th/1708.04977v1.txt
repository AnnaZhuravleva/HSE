The quantum Batalian-Vilkovisky master action for closed string field theory consists of kinetic term and infinite number of interaction terms. The interaction strengths (coupling constants) are given by integrating the off-shell string measure over the distinct string diagrams describing the elementary interactions of the closed strings. In the first paper of this series, it was shown that the string diagrams describing the elementary interactions can be characterized using the Riemann surfaces endowed with hyperbolic metric with constant curvature -1. In this paper, we construct the off-shell string measure as a function of the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. We also describe an explicit procedure for integrating the off-shell string measure over the region inside the moduli space that corresponds to the elementary interactions of the closed strings.
