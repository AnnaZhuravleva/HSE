We study a description of the large N limit of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in terms of quantum mechanics without quenched disorder. Instead of random couplings, we introduce massive scalar fields coupled to fermions, and study a small mass limit of the theory. We show that, under a certain condition, the correlation functions of fermions reproduce those of the SYK model with a temperature dependent coupling constant in the large N limit. We also discuss a supersymmetric generalization of our quantum mechanical model. As a byproduct, we develop an efficient way of estimating the large N behavior of correlators in the SYK model.
