We present a careful study of accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter spacetime, formulating the thermodynamics and resolving discrepancies that have appeared in previous investigations of the topic. We compute the dual stress-energy tensor for the spacetime and find that it corresponds to a relativistic fluid with a non-trivial viscous shear tensor. We demonstrate that both the holographic computation and the method of conformal completion yield the same result for the mass. We compare to previous work on black funnels and droplets, showing that the boundary region can be endowed with non-compact geometry, and comment on this novel holographic dual geometry.
