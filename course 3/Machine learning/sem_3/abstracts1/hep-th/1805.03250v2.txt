We investigate the presence of magnetic monopoles in a model that extends the non Abelian model originally studied by 't Hooft and Polyakov with the inclusion of an extra neutral field. The investigation includes modifications of the dynamics of the gauged fields, and the main results unveil a route to construct solutions that engender internal structure and live in a compact space.
