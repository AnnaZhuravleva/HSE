Lorentz and CPT symmetries may be violated in new physics that emerges at very high energy scale, i.e., at the Planck scale. The differential cross section of the M\"oller scattering, due to Lorentz violation at finite temperature is calculated. Lorentz-violating effects emerge from an interaction vertex due to a CPT-odd nonminimal coupling in the covariant derivative. The finite temperature effects are determined using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism.
