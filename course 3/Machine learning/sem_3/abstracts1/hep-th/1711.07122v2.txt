It is argued that in the context of geometric quantization holomorphic part of zero-mode wave functions in abelian Chern-Simons theory on the torus can naturally be considered as modular forms of weight 2. In the geometric quantization the zero-mode wave function can be defined as $\Psi [ a, {\bar a} ] = e^{- \frac{K(a, {\bar a})}{2}} f (a)$ where $K(a ,{\bar a} )$ denotes a K\"ahler potential for the zero-mode variable $a \in \mathbb{C}$ on the torus. We first review that $f(a)$ can be described in terms of Jacobi theta functions by imposing gauge invariance on $\Psi [ a, {\bar a} ]$ where gauge transformations are induced by doubly periodic translations of $a$. We discuss that $f(a)$ is quantum theoretically characterized by ($i$) an operative relation in the $a$-space representation and ($ii$) an inner product of $\Psi [ a, {\bar a} ]$'s including ambiguities in the choice of $K(a ,{\bar a} )$. We then consider a similar gauge invariance condition on $\Psi [ a, {\bar a} ]$ associated with modular transformations of $a$. We choose the modular parameter $\tau = i \tau_2 $ of the torus such that the number density of the zero modes is preserved under the modular transformations of $a$. The results illustrate that we can quantum theoretically identify $f(a)$ as a modular form of weight 2. We confirm this statement by use of a specific representation of $f(a)$ in terms of the Jacobi theta function. We also indicate that the wave-function inner product gives rise to a quantum version of the Petersson inner product for the modular forms of weight 2.
