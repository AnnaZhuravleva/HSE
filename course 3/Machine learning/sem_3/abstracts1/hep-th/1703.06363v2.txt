In this work we start from the Higgs prototype model to introduce a new model, which makes a smooth transition between systems with well located minima and systems that support no minima at all. We implement this possibility using the deformation procedure, which allows the obtention of a sine-Gordon-like model, controlled by a real parameter that gives rise to a family of models, reproducing the sine-Gordon and the so-called vacuumless models. We also study the thick brane scenarios associated with these models and investigate their stability and renormalization group flow. In particular, one shows how gravity can change from the 5-dimensional warped geometry with a single extra dimension of infinite extent to the conventional 5-dimensional Minkowski geometry.
