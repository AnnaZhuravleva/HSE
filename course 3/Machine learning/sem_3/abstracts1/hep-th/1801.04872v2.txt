In the high energy limit of scattering amplitudes in Quantum Chromodynamics and supersymmetric theories the dominant Feynman diagrams are characterized by a hidden integrability. A well-known example is that of Odderon exchange, which can be described as a bound state of three reggeized gluons and corresponds to a closed spin chain with periodic boundary conditions. In the $N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory a similar spin chain arises in the multi-Regge asymptotics of the eight-point amplitude in the planar limit. We investigate the associated open spin chain in transverse momentum and rapidity variables solving the corresponding effective Feynman diagrams. We introduce the concept of complexity in the high energy effective field theory and study its emerging scaling laws.
