The issue intensively claimed in the literature on the generation of a CPT-odd and Lorentz violating Chern-Simons-like term by radiative corrections owing to a CPT violating interaction -- the axial coupling of fermions with a constant vector field $b_\m$ -- is mistaken. The presence of massless gauge field triggers IR divergences that might show up from the UV subtractions, therefore, so as to deal with the (actual physical) IR divergences, the Lowenstein-Zimmermann subtraction scheme, in the framework of BPHZL renormalization method, has to be adopted. The proof on the non generation of such a Chern-Simons-like term is done, independent of any kind of regularization scheme, at all orders in perturbation theory.
