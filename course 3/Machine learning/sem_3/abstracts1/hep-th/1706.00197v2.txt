We consider a Hamiltonian system which has its origin in a generalization of exact renormalization group flow of matrix scalar field theory and describes a non-linear generalization of the shock-wave equation that is known to be integrable. Analyzing conserved currents of the system the letter shows, that these follow a nice pattern governed by coefficients of Motzkin polynomials, where each integral of motion corresponds to a path on a unit lattice.
