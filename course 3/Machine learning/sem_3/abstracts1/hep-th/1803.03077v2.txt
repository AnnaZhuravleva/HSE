We construct a vector gauge invariant transverse field configuration $V^H$, consisting of the well-known superfield $V$ and of a Stueckelberg-like chiral superfield. The renormalizability of the Super Yang Mills action in the Landau gauge is analyzed in the presence of a gauge invariant mass term $m^2 \int dV \mathcal{M}(V^H)$, with $\mathcal{M}(V^H)$ a power series in $V^H$. Unlike the original Stueckelberg action, the resulting action turns out to be renormalizable to all orders.
