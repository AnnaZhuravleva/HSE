Quantum $\mathcal{R}$-matrices are the building blocks for the colored HOMFLY polynomials. In the case of three-strand braids with an identical finite-dimensional irreducible representation $T$ of $SU_q(N)$ associated with each strand one needs two matrices: $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$. They are related by the Racah matrices $\mathcal{R}_2 = \mathcal{U} \mathcal{R}_1 \mathcal{U}^{\dagger}$. Since we can always choose the basis so that $\mathcal{R}_1$ is diagonal, the problem is reduced to evaluation of $\mathcal{R}_2$-matrices. This paper is one more step on the road to simplification of such calculations. We found out and proved for some cases that $\mathcal{R}_2$-matrices could be transformed into a block-diagonal ones. The essential condition is that there is a pair of accidentally coinciding eigenvalues among eigenvalues of $\mathcal{R}_1$-matrix. The angle of the rotation in the sectors corresponding to accidentally coinciding eigenvalues from the basis defined by the Racah matrix to the basis in which $\mathcal{R}_2$ is block-diagonal is $\pm \frac{\pi}{4}$.
