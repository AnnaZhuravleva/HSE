This review is dedicated to some modern applications of the remarkable paper written in 1918 by E. Noether. On a single paper, Noether discovered the crucial relation between symmetries and conserved charges as well as the impact of gauge symmetries on the equations of motion. Almost a century has gone since the publication of this work and its applications have permeated modern physics. Our focus will be on some examples that have appeared recently in the literature. This review is aim at students, not researchers. The main three topics discussed are (i) global symmetries and conserved charges (ii) local symmetries and gauge structure of a theory (iii) boundary conditions and algebra of asymptotic symmetries. All three topics are discussed through examples.
