We present new AdS4 black hole solutions in N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to vector and hypermultiplets. We focus on a particular consistent truncation of M-theory on the homogeneous Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifold M111, characterized by the presence of one Betti vector multiplet. We numerically construct static and spherically symmetric black holes with electric and magnetic charges, corresponding to M2 and M5 branes wrapping non-contractible cycles of the internal manifold. These configurations have nonzero temperature and are moreover surrounded by a massive vector field halo. For these solutions we verify the first law of black hole mechanics and we analyze the thermodynamics and phase transitions in the canonical ensemble, interpreting the process in the corresponding dual field theory.
