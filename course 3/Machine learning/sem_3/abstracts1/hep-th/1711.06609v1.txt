Conformal blocks are the central ingredient of the conformal bootstrap programme. We elaborate on our recent observation that uncovered a relation with wave functions of an integrable Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian in order to develop a systematic theory of conformal blocks. Our main goal here is to review central ingredients of the Heckman-Opdam theory for scattering states of Calogero-Sutherland models with special emphasis to the relation with scalar 4-point blocks. We will also discuss a number of direct consequences for conformal blocks, including a new series expansion for blocks of arbitrary complex spin and a complete analysis of their poles and residues. Applications to the Froissart-Gribov formula for conformal field theory, as well as extensions to spinning blocks and defects are briefly discussed before we conclude with an outlook on forthcoming work concerning algebraic consequences of integrability.
