The influence of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and extended uncertainty principle (EUP) on the thermodynamics of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe has been investigated. It is shown that the entropy of the apparent horizon of the FRW universe gets a correction if one considers the effect of the GUP or EUP. Moreover, starting with the modified entropy and applying the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=TdS$, to the apparent horizon of the FRW universe, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations. The influence of the GUP or EUP on the thermodynamics of the FRW universe provides a deep insight into the understanding of the quantum gravity or large length scale corrections to the dynamics of the FRW universe.
