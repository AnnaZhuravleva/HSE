In this paper we are concerned with completely integrable Hamiltonian systems in the setting of contact geometry. Unlike the symplectic case, contact structures are automatically Hamiltonian. Using the Jacobi brackets defined on contact manifolds, we discuss the commutativity of the first integrals for contact Hamiltonian systems and introduce the generalized contact action-angle variables. We exemplify the general scheme in the case of the five-dimensional toric Sasaki-Einstein spaces $T^{1,1}$ and $Y^{p,q}$.
