A classical solution for a magnetic monopole is found in a specific multi-vector boson theory. We consider the model whose $[SU(2)]^{N+1}$ gauge group is broken by sigma-model fields (\`a la dimensional deconstruction) and further spontaneously broken by an adjoint scalar (\`a la triplet Higgs mechanism). In this multi-vector boson theory, we find the solution for the monopole whose mass is $M_N\sim\frac{4\pi v}{g}\sqrt{N+1}$, where $g$ is the common gauge coupling constant and $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the triplet Higgs field, by using a variational method with the simplest set of test functions.
