We study the holographic entanglement entropy evolution after a global sharp quench of thermal state. After the quench, the system comes to equilibrium and the temperature increases from $T_i$ to $T_f$. Holographic dual of this process is provided by an injection of a thin shell of matter in the black hole background. The quantitative characteristics of the evolution depend substantially on the size of the initial black hole. We show that characteristic regimes during non-equilibrium heating do not depend on the initial temperature and are the same as in thermalization. Namely these regimes are pre-local-equilibration quadratic growth, linear growth and saturation regimes of the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy. We study the initial temperature dependence of quantitative characteristics of these regimes and find that the critical exponents do not depend on the temperature, meanwhile the prefactors are the functions on the temperature.
