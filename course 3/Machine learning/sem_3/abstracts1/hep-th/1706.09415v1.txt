We present a prototype model that resolves the cosmological constant problem using matter alone, i.e., without modifying gravity. Its generic cosmological solutions adjust an arbitrarily large, negative dark energy to a positive value parametrically suppressed by an initial field velocity. Inflationary initial conditions lead to a positive dark energy exponentially smaller in magnitude than any model parameter, or any scale in the initial conditions.
