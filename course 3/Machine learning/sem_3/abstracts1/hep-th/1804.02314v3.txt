We study the loop effects on the geometry and boundary conditions of several black hole spacetimes one of which is time-dependent and analyze the energy measured by an infalling observer near their horizons. The finding in the previous works that the loop effects can be drastic is reinforced: they play an important role in the boundary conditions and non-perturbative geometry deformation. One of the channels through which the quantum gravitational effects enter is generation of the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant feeds the time-dependence of a solution. We obtain a trans-Planckian energy in the time-dependent case. The importance of time-dependence for the trans-Planckian energy and black hole information is discussed.
