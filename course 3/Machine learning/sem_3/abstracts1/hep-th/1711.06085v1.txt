We show that the non-locality recently identified in quantum gravity using resummation techniques propagates to the matter sector of the theory. We describe these non-local effects using effective field theory techniques. We derive the complete set of non-local effective operators at order $N G^2$ for theories involving scalar, spinor, and vector fields. We then use recent data from the Large Hadron Collider to set a bound on the scale of space-time non-locality and find $M_\star> 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV.
