We propose equations of motion of real-valued scalar fields on $p$AdS, which is a $p$-adic version of AdS space-time alternative to the Bruhat-Tits tree. The analytical expressions of the Green's functions are given for a particular parameter, and the limiting behaviors are studied for general cases. Difference between $p$AdS and the Bruhat-Tits tree is also pointed out in the calculation of correlation functions by the AdS/CFT method.
