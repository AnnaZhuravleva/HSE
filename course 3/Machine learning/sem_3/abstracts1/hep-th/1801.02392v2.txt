We propose an ansatz for a class of regular axially-symmetric solutions in SU(3) QCD. After averaging over time period the solution can be treated as a non-topological monopole-antimonopole pair. We demonstrate that QCD Lagrangian on the space of such solutions is explicitly Weyl symmetric and reduces to a generalized phi^4 model with four independent fields. All solutions possess quantum stability under vacuum gluon fluctuations.
