The t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole mass can be substantially altered, in the thick GS and HC brane-world setup, and can be employed to constrain the brane thickness limit. In this work, we comprise a brief review regarding gauge fields localization in the string-like six dimensional brane-world models setup. The correction to the Coulomb's law in two models is studied. Besides, the monopole features are investigated from the point of view of the gauge fields localization in the string-like brane-worlds and its thickness.
