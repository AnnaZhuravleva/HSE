We consider computational complexity of AdS_5 black holes. Our system contains a particle moving on the boundary of AdS. This corresponds to the insertion of a fundamental string in AdS_5 bulk spacetime. Our results give a constraint for complexity. This gives us a hint for defining complexity in quantum field theories.
