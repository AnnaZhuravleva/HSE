We have analyzed in detail four and five point functions of the string theory amplitudes, including a closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR) in an asymmetric picture and either two or three transverse scalar fields in both IIA and IIB. The complete forms of these S-matrices are derived and these asymmetric S-matrices are also compared with their own symmetric results. This leads us to explore two different kinds of bulk singularity structures as well as various new couplings in asymmetric picture of the amplitude in type II string theory. All order $\alpha'$ higher derivative corrections to these new couplings have been discovered as well. Several remarks for these two new bulk singularity structures and for contact interactions of the S-Matrix have also been made.
