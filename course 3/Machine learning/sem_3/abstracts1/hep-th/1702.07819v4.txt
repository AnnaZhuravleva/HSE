Recently, Antoniadis, Konitopoulos and Savvidy introduced, in the context of the so-called extended gauge theory, a procedure to construct background-free gauge invariants, using non-abelian gauge potentials described by higher degree forms. In this article it is shown that the extended invariants found by Antoniadis, Konitopoulos and Savvidy can be constructed from an algebraic structure known as Free Differential Algebra. In other words, we show that the above mentioned non abelian gauge theory, where the gauge fields are described by p-forms with p>1, can be obtained by gauging Free Differential Algebras.
