We study duality twisted reductions of the Double Field Theory (DFT) of the RR sector of massless Type II theory, with twists belonging to the duality group $Spin^+(10,10)$. We determine the action and the gauge algebra of the resulting theory and determine the conditions for consistency. In doing this, we work with the DFT action constructed by Hohm, Kwak and Zwiebach, which we rewrite in terms of the Mukai pairing: a natural bilinear form on the space of spinors, which is manifestly $Spin(n,n)$ invariant. If the duality twist is introduced via the $Spin^+(10,10)$ element $S$ in the RR sector, then the NS-NS sector should also be deformed via the duality twist $U = \rho(S)$, where $\rho$ is the double covering homomorphism between $Pin(n,n)$ and $O(n,n)$. We show that the set of conditions required for the consistency of the reduction of the NS-NS sector are also crucial for the consistency of the reduction of the RR sector, owing to the fact that the Lie algebras of $Spin(n,n)$ and $SO(n,n)$ are isomorphic. In addition, requirement of gauge invariance imposes an extra constraint on the fluxes that determine the deformations.
