We establish the large central charge behaviour of the entanglement negativity for a mixed state configuration of a single interval enclosed between two intervals in a holographic $CFT_{1+1}$. To this end we utilize the monodromy technique to elucidate the large central charge limit of a four point twist correlator which characterizes the negativity of the mixed state configuration. Subsequently we analyze the large central charge limit of the six point twist correlator which reduces to the above four point correlator in a specific limit. The results provide a strong consistency check for our recently proposed holographic entanglement negativity conjecture in the $AdS_3/CFT_2$ scenario.
