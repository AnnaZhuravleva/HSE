In isotropic but Lorentz- and CPT-violating electrodynamics, it is known that a charge in unifom motion does not lose any energy to Cerenkov radiation. This presents a puzzle, since the radiation appears to be kinematically allowed for many modes. Studying the Fourier transforms of the most important terms in the modified magnetic field and Poynting vector, we confirm the vanishing of the the radiation rate. Moreover, we show that the Fourier transform of the field changes sign between small and large wave numbers. This enables modes with very long wavelengths to carry negative energies, which cancel out the positive energies carried away by modes with shorter wavelengths. This cancelation had previously been inferred but never explicitly demonstrated.
