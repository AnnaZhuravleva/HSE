We study non-analytic behavior in the static charge susceptibility in finite density states of the ABJM theory using its holographic dual. Emphasis is placed on a particular state characterized by vanishing entropy density at zero temperature, and Fermi surface-like singularities in various fermionic correlation functions. The susceptibility exhibits branch points in the complex momentum plane, with a real part quantitatively very similar to the location of the Fermi surface singularities.
