In this paper we explain the relation between the free energy of the SYK model for $N$ Majorana fermions with a random $q$-body interaction and the moments of its spectral density. The high temperature expansion of the free energy gives the cumulants of the spectral density. Using that the cumulants are extensive we find the $p$ dependence of the $1/N^2$ correction of the $2p$-th moments obtained in arXiv:1801.02696. Conversely, the $1/N^2$ corrections to the moments give the $1/q^3$ correction of the high temperature expansion of the free energy obtained by Tarnopolsky using a mean field expansion. These considerations also lead to a more powerful method for solving the moment problem and intersection-graph enumeration problems. We take advantage of this and push the moment calculation to $1/N^3$ order and find surprisingly simple enumeration identities for intersection graphs. The $1/N^3$ corrections to the moments, give $O(1/q^4)$ corrections to high temperature expansion of the free energy which have not been calculated before.
