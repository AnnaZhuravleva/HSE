Our goal in this work is to present the variational method of fictitious parameters and its connection with the BRST symmetry. Firstly we implement the method in QED at zero temperature and then we extend the analysis to GQED at finite temperature. As we will see the core of the study is the general statement in gauge theories at finite temperature, assigned by Tyutin work, that the physics does not depend on the gauge choices, covariant or not, due to BRST symmetry.
