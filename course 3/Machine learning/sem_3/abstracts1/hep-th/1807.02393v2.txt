In this article we consider simultaneous T-dualization of type II superstring action in pure spinor formulation. Simultaneous T-dualization means that we make T-dualization at the same time along some subset of initial coordinates marked by $x^a$. The only imposed assumption stems from the applicability of the Buscher T-dualization procedure - background fields do not depend on dualized directions $x^a$. In this way we obtain the full form of the T-dual background fields and T-dual transformation laws, which show that two chiral sectors transform differently. Consequently, there are two sets of vielbeins and gamma matrices connected by the local Lorentz transformation. Its spinorial representation is the same as in the constant background case.
