We study string quantum corrections to the ratio of latitude and circular Wilson loops in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling. Conformal gauge for the corresponding minimal surface in AdS(5)xS(5) is singular and we show that an IR anomaly associated with the divergence in the conformal factor removes previously reported discrepancy with the exact field-theory result. We also carefully check conformal anomaly cancellation and recalculate fluctuation determinants by directly evaluating phaseshifts for all the fluctuation modes.
