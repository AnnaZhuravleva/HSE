We consider the 6d superconformal field theory realized on M5-branes probing the $E_8$ end-of-the-world brane on the deformed and resolved $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_k$ singularity. We give an explicit algorithm which determines, for arbitrary holonomy at infinity, the 6d quiver gauge theory on the tensor branch, the type-A class S description of the $T^2$ compactification, and the star-shaped quiver obtained as the mirror of the $T^3$ compactification.
