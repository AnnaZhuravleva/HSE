We propose a class of two-field cosmological models derived from gravity coupled to non-linear sigma models whose target space is a non-compact and geometrically-finite hyperbolic surface, which provide a wide generalization of so-called $\alpha$-attractor models and can be studied using uniformization theory. We illustrate cosmological dynamics in such models for the case of the hyperbolic triply-punctured sphere.
