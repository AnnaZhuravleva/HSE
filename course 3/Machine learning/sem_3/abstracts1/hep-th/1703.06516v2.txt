The Scale Magnetic Effect (SME) is the generation of electric current due to conformal anomaly in external magnetic field in curved spacetime. The effect appears in a vacuum with electrically charged massless particles. Similarly to the Hall effect, the direction of the induced anomalous current is perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field $\bf B$ and to the gradient of the conformal factor $\tau$, while the strength of the current is proportional to the beta function of the theory. In massive electrodynamics the SME remains valid, but the value of the induced current differs from the current generated in the system of massless fermions. In the present paper we use the Wigner--Weyl formalism to demonstrate that in accordance with the decoupling property of heavy fermions the corresponding anomalous conductivity vanishes in the large-mass limit with $m^2 \gg |e {\bf B}|$ and $m \gg |\nabla \tau|$.
