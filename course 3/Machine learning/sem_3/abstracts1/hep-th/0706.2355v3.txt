We consider the supergravity origin of the recently proposed MSSM inflationary model, which relies on the existence of a saddle point along a dimension six flat direction. We derive the conditions that the Kahler potential has to satisfy for the saddle point to exist irrespective of the hidden sector vevs. We show that these conditions are satisfied by a simple class of Kahler potentials, which we find to have a similar form as in various string theory compactifications. For these potentials, slow roll MSSM inflation requires no fine tuning of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters.
