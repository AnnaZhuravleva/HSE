We derive the timescale for two initially pure subsystems to become entangled with each other through an arbitrary Hamiltonian that couples them. The entanglement timescale is inversely proportional to the "correlated uncertainty" between the two subsystems, a quantity which we will define and analyze in this paper. Our result is still applicable when one of the subsystems started in an arbitrarily mixed state, thus it generalizes the well-known "decoherence timescale" while coupled to a thermal state.
