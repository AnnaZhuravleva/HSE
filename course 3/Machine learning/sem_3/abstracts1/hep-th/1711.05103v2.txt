The applications of Unruh-Fulling (UF) effect are mostly studied by considering the interaction of Unruh-DeWitt (UD) detector and single matter field. In this work we aim to study the transition rate of a system, by considering an interacting picture of a point like UD detector and multiple massive scalar fields of different masses. Our study reveals that for large number of scalar fields with $m_i/a\ll 1$ ($m_i$ denotes the mass of the $i^{th}$ scalar field and $a$ is the acceleration of the detector), the transition rate of the system significantly depends on the acceleration of the UD detector. It is being predicted that there exist a {\it critical acceleration} of the UD detector, beyond which the transition rate becomes drastically high in comparison to the condition below the critical acceleration. We argue that in this theoretical framework, the presence of critical acceleration and the drastic change in the transition rate around the critical point, can be better understood by analytically stretching the number of scalar fields to infinity. The appearance of such critical point never occurs in case of the interaction of UD detector and single scalar field. On the other hand, in the limit $m_i/a\gg 1$, the transition rate of the system ceases to zero which in turn signifies that there is no detection of particle excitation by the UD detector.
