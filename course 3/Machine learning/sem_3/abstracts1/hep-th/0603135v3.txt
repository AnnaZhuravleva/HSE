We construct the Lagrangian of the ${\cal N}=1$ four-dimensional generalized supersymmetric Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (SNJL) model, which has ${\cal N}=1/2$ supersymmetry (SUSY) on non(anti)commutative superspace. A special attention is paid to the examination on the nonperturbative quantum dynamics: The phenomenon of dynamical-symmetry-breaking/mass-generation on the deformed superspace is investigated. The model Lagrangian and the method of SUSY auxiliary fields of composites are examined in terms of component fields. We derive the effective action, examine it, and solve the gap equation for self-consistent mass parameters.
