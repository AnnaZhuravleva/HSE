In this work we generalize the entanglement of purification and its conjectured holographic dual to conditional and multipartite versions of the same, where the optimization defining the entanglement of purification is now optimized in either a constrained way or over multiple parties. We separately derive new constraints on both the conditional entanglement of purification and its conjectured holographic dual object that match, further reinforcing the likelihood of this conjecture. We also show that the multipartite objects we define, despite obeying several of the same inequalities, are not holographic duals of each other. Further, we find inequalities that are true only for the bulk objects, and thus could provide additional consistency checks for states dual to (semi)-classical bulk geometries.
