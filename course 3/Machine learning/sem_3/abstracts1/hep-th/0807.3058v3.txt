We investigate consistency relations for non-Gaussianity. We provide a model-independent dynamical proof for the consistency relation of 3-point correlation functions from the Hamiltonian and field redefinition. This relation can be applied to single field inflation, multi-field inflation and the curvaton scenario. This relation can also be generalized to $n$-point correlation functions up to arbitrary order in perturbation theory and with arbitrary number of loops.
