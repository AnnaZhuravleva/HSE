In this paper we look for AdS solutions to generalised gravity theories in the bulk in various spacetime dimensions. The bulk gravity action includes the action of a non-minimally coupled scalar field with gravity, with higher-derivative terms. The usual Einstein-Hilbert gravity is induced when the scalar acquires a non-zero vacuum expectation value. The equation of motion in the bulk shows scenarios where AdS geometry emerges on-shell. We further obtain the action of the fluctuation fields on the background at quadratic and cubic orders.
