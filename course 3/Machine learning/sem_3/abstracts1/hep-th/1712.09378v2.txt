It is well known that a physical medium that sets a Lorentz frame generates a Lorentz-breaking gap for a graviton. We examine such generated "mass" terms in the presence of a fluid medium whose ground state spontaneously breaks spatial translation invariance in $d = D+1$ spacetime dimensions, and for a solid in $D = 2$ spatial dimensions. By requiring energy positivity and subluminal propagation, certain constraints are placed on the equation of state of the medium. In the case of $D = 2$ spatial dimensions, classical gravity can be recast as a Chern-Simons gauge theory and motivated by this we recast the massive theory of gravity in AdS$_3$ as a massive Chern-Simons gauge theory with an unusual mass term. We find that in the flat space limit the Chern-Simons theory has a novel gauge invariance that mixes the kinetic and mass terms, and enables the massive theory with a non-compact internal group to be free of ghosts and tachyons.
