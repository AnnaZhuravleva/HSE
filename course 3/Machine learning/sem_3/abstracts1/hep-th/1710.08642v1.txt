In this paper, we calculate thermodynamical quantity of Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole solution in quintessence matter. Then, we show that how the rotation and cosmological parameters effect to the thermodynamics properties of black hole. Also, we investigate both types of phase transition for different values of $\omega$ parameter in extended phase space. We notice that type one of phase transition occurs for $P<0.42$ and $a<0.5$. And also we see that the phase transition point shifts to higher entropy when pressure $P$, rotation parameter $a$ and $\alpha$ increase. Also, we find that by changing parameter $\omega$ from -1 to $-\frac{1}{3}$, the critical point shifts to higher entropy. Then we study type two of phase transition and show critical points increase by increasing parameter $\alpha$. Also, we show that the critical point shifts to higher entropy when $\alpha$, $\omega$ and rotation parameter $a$ decrease. Finally, we find that by decreasing pressure the first critical point shifts to lower entropy and second critical point shifts to higher entropy.
