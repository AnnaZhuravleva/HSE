We explain how a generic HKT geometry can be derived using the language of N = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics. To this end, one should consider a Lagrangian involving several (4,4,0) multiplets defined in harmonic superspace and subject to nontrivial harmonic constraints. Conjecturally, this general construction worked out earlier by Delduc and Ivanov gives a complete classification of all HKT geometries. Each such geometry is generated by two different functions (potentials) of a special type that depend on harmonic superfields and on harmonics.   Given these two potentials, one can derive the vielbeins, metric, connections and curvatures, but this is not so simple: one should solve rather complicated differential equations. We illustrate the general construction by giving a detailed derivation of the metric for the hyper-Kaehler Taub-NUT manifold. In the generic case, we arrive at an HKT geometry. In this paper, we give a simple proof of this assertion.
