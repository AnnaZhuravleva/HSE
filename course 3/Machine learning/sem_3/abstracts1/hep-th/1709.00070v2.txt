We show that the equality of 2d $\mathcal{N}$=(2,2) supersymmetric indices in Seiberg-type duality leads to a new integrable Ising-type model. The emergence of the new model is the result of correspondence between the supersymmetric $SU(2)$ quiver gauge theories and the Yang-Baxter equation. Using this correspondence, we solve the star-triangle relation and obtain the two-dimensional exactly solvable spin model. The model corresponding to our solution possesses continuous spin variables on the circle and the Boltzmann weights are demonstrated in terms of Jacobi theta function. Using the solution of the star-triangle relation, we also construct interaction-round-a-face and vertex models.
