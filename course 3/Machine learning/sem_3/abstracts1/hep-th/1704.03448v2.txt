We find a new example of an asymptotically $AdS_5 \times S^5$ geometry which has an entanglement shadow: that is, a region of spacetime which no Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surface enters. Our example is a particular case of the supersymmetric LLM geometries. Our results illustrate how minimal surfaces, which holographically geometrize entanglement entropy, can fail to probe the whole of spacetime, posing a challenge for attempts to directly reconstruct holographic geometries from the entanglement entropies of the dual field theory. We also comment on the relation to previous investigations of minimal surfaces localised in the $S^5$ factor of AdS$_5 \times S^5$.
