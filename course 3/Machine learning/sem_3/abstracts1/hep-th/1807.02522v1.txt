We study the kinematics of correlation functions of local and extended operators in a conformal field theory. We present a new method for constructing the tensor structures associated to primary operators in an arbitrary bosonic representation of the Lorentz group. The recipe yields the explicit structures in embedding space, and can be applied to any correlator of local operators, with or without a defect. We then focus on the two-point function of traceless symmetric primaries in the presence of a conformal defect, and explain how to compute the conformal blocks. In particular, we illustrate various techniques to generate the bulk channel blocks either from a radial expansion or by acting with differential operators on simpler seed blocks. For the defect channel, we detail a method to compute the blocks in closed form, in terms of projectors into mixed symmetry representations of the orthogonal group.
