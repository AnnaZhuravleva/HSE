By making use of a covariant formulation of the chiral kinetic theory in the relaxation-time approximation, we derive the first-order dissipative hydrodynamics equations for a uniformly rotating chiral plasma in a magnetic field. We identify the global equilibrium state for the corresponding chiral plasma confined to a cylindrical region with realistic boundary conditions. Then, by using linearized hydrodynamic equations, supplemented by the Maxwell equations, we study hydrodynamic modes of the chiral plasma in the regimes of high temperature and high density. We find that nonzero vorticity has profound effects on both the global equilibrium state of the plasma and the spectrum of its hydrodynamic modes. Possible applications of the main results are briefly discussed.
