A Gadget, more precisely a scalar Gadget, is defined as a mathematical calculation acting over a domain of one or more adinkra graphs and whose range is a real number. A 2010 work on the subject of automorphisms of adinkra graphs, implied the existence of multiple numbers of Gadgets depending on the number of colors under consideration. For four colors, this number is two. In this work, we verify the existence of a second such Gadget and calculate (both analytically and via explicit computer-enabled algorithms) its 1,358,954,496 matrix elements over 36,864 minimal valise adinkras related to the Coxeter Group BC4.
