After reviewing Gribov ambiguity of non-Abelian gauge theories, a phenomenon related to the topology of the bundle of gauge connections, we show that there is a similar feature for noncommutative QED over Moyal space, despite the structure group being Abelian, and we exhibit an infinite number of solutions for the equation of Gribov copies. This is a genuine effect of noncommutative geometry which disappears when the noncommutative parameter vanishes.
