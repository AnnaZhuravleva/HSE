We study entanglement entropy in gravity theory with quantum effects. A simplest model is a two dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action . We use an $n$-sheet manifold to obtain an area term of entanglement entropy by summing over all background fields. A strongly coupled conformal field theory is expected to describe perturbative quantum gravity theory. Thus, we also use two dimensional conformal field theory to discuss a factorization of a Hilbert space. We find that a coefficient of a universal term of the entanglement entropy is independent of a choice of an entangling surface in two dimensional conformal field theory for one interval and also argue the result possibly be extended to multiple intervals. Finally, we discuss that translational invariance possibly be a necessary condition in a quantum gravity theory by ruing out a volume law of entanglement entropy.
