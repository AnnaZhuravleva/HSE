The Carnot heat engine sets an upper bound on the efficiency of a heat engine. As an ideal, reversible engine, a single cycle must be performed in infinite time, and so the Carnot engine has zero power. However, there is nothing in principle forbidding the existence of a heat engine whose efficiency approaches that of Carnot while maintaining finite power. Such an engine must have very special properties, some of which have been discussed in the literature, in various limits. While recent theorems rule out a large class of engines from maintaining finite power at exactly the Carnot efficiency, the approach to the limit still merits close study. Presented here is an exactly solvable model of such an approach that may serve as a laboratory for exploration of the underlying mechanisms. The equations of state have their origins in the extended thermodynamics of electrically charged black holes.
