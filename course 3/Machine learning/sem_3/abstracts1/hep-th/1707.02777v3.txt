We use AdS/CFT holography to study how a strongly-coupled plasma polarizes when the geometry where it resides is not flat. We compute the linear-response polarization coefficients, which are directly related to the static two-point correlation function of the stress-energy tensor. In the gravitational dual description, these parameters correspond to the tidal deformation coefficients---the Love numbers---of a black brane. We also compute the coefficients of static electric polarization of the plasma.
