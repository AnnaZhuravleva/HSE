We apply the average null energy condition to obtain upper bounds on the three-point function coefficients of stress tensors and a scalar operator, $\langle TT {\cal O } \rangle,$ in general CFTs. We also constrain the gravitational anomaly of $U(1)$ currents in four-dimensional CFTs, which are encoded in three-point functions of the form $\langle TT J \rangle$. In theories with a large $N$ AdS dual we translate these bounds into constraints on the coefficient of a higher derivative bulk term of the form $\int \phi\hspace{.5mm} W^2 $. We speculate that these bounds also apply in de-Sitter. In this case our results constrain inflationary observables, such as the amplitude for chiral gravity waves that originate from higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian of the form $\phi \hspace{.5mm}W W^*$.
