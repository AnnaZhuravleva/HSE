We show that the problem of ghosts in critical gravity and its higher dimensional extensions can be resolved by giving dynamics to the symmetric rank two auxiliary field existing in the action of these theories. These New Bi-Gravities, at linear level around the AdS vacuum, are free of Boulware-Deser ghost, kinetic ghost and tachyonic instability within the particular range of parameters. Moreover, we show that the energy and entropy of AdS-Schwarzschild black hole solutions of these new models are positive in the same range of parameters. This may be the sign that these new models are also free of ghost instabilities at the non-linear level.
