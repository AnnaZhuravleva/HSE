In this paper, we derive the general leading-order classical Lagrangian covering all fermion operators of the nonminimal Standard-Model Extension (SME). Such a Lagrangian is considered to be the point-particle analog of the effective field theory description of Lorentz violation that is provided by the SME. First of all, a suitable Ansatz is made for the Lagrangian of the spin-degenerate operators $\hat{a}$, $\hat{c}$, $\hat{e}$, and $\hat{f}$ at leading order in Lorentz violation. The latter is shown to satisfy the set of five nonlinear equations that govern the map from the field theory to the classical description. After doing so, the second step is to propose results for the spin-nondegenerate operators $\hat{b}$, $\hat{d}$, $\hat{H}$, and $\hat{g}$. Although these are more involved than the Lagrangians for the spin-degenerate ones, an analytical proof of their validity is viable, nevertheless. The final step is to combine both findings to produce a generic Lagrangian for the complete set of Lorentz-violating operators that is consistent with the known minimal and nonminimal Lagrangians found in the literature so far. The outcome reveals the leading-order structure of the classical SME analog. It can be of use for both phenomenological studies of classical bodies in gravitational fields and conceptual work on explicit Lorentz violation in gravity. Furthermore, there may be a possible connection to Finsler geometry.
