In this paper, we investigate imaginary part of the potential for a moving quarkonia in plasma. In order to verify the validity of imaginary part of the potential we employ hyperscaling violation metric background. In QCD system the imaginary part of potential shows the decay behaviour and the corresponding potential should be negative. The corresponding potential always appears in QCD as an exponential function. We find general constraints for Im$V_{Q\bar{Q}}$ at the near horizon limit and apply them for some known cases. Finally, we find the suitable spatial dimension d, z and $\theta$ also rapidity $\eta$ for two interesting cases. Our calculation with AdS/CFT guarantees the dynamical parameter as a $\theta$ in hyperscaling violation metric background. We also present the hyperscaling violationg metric in this context very close to YM theory with finite temperature.
