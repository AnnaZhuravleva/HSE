We explore the program of the construction of the dual bulk theory in the flow equation approach. We compute the vacuum expectation value of the Einstein operator at the next to leading order in the 1/n expansion using a free O(n) vector model. We interpret the next to leading correction as the quantum correction to the cosmological constant of the AdS space. We finally comment on how to generalize this computation to matrix elements of the Einstein operator for excited states.
