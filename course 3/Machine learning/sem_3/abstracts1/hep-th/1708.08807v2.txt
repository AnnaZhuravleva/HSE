In this work, we derive exact self-consistent solutions to the gap equations of the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ model on a finite interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the large-$N$ approximation. We find two classes of solutions describing an unbroken-confining phase and a broken-Higgs phase, favoured for larger and smaller sizes of the system, respectively. We compute the vacuum energy and the Casimir force and observe that the sign of the force is attractive in the Higgs phase, while it can change from repulsive to attractive in the confining phase.
