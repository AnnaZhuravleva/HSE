In this note we investigate Gra{\ss}mannian formulas for form factors of the chiral part of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal Yang-Mills theory. We present an all-$n$ contour for the $G(3,n+2)$ Gra{\ss}mannian integral of NMHV form factors derived from on-shell diagrams and the BCFW recursion relation. In addition, we study other $G(3,n+2)$ formulas obtained from the connected prescription introduced recently. We find a recursive expression for all $n$ and study its properties. For $n \geq 6$, our formula has the same recursive structure as its amplitude counterpart, making its soft behaviour manifest. Finally, we explore the connection between the two Gra{\ss}mannian formulations, using the global residue theorem, and find that it is much more intricate compared to scattering amplitudes.
