In this paper we investigate spectral flow symmetry in asymptotically flat spacetimes both from a gravity as well as a putative dual quantum field theory perspective. On the gravity side we consider models in Einstein gravity and supergravity as well as their "reloaded" versions, present suitable boundary conditions, determine the respective asymptotic symmetry algebras and the thermal entropy of cosmological solutions in each of these models. On the quantum field theory side we identify the spectral flow symmetry as automorphisms of the underlying symmetry algebra of the theory. Using spectral flow invariance we then determine the thermal entropy of these quantum field theories and find perfect agreement with the results from the gravity side. In addition we determine logarithmic corrections to the thermal entropy.
