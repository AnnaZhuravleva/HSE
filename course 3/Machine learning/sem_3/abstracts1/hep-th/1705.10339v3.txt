The characteristics of tree level scattering amplitudes in theories with nonlinear (super)symmetries were recently proposed by Kallosh to be encoded in a simple way directly from the action, based on a background field method. We check this conjecture to lowest non-trivial order in the Volkov-Akulov theory, where the local 6-point diagram cancels and the results up to 6 points indeed are in agreement with S-matrix computations.
