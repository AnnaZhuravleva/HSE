We study non-topological Q-ball solutions of the (3+1)-dimensional Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin two-component model. The limiting case of vanishing potential term yields an example of hairy Q-balls, which possess a long range massless real field. We discuss the properties of these stationary field configurations and determine their domain of existence. Considering Friedberg-Lee-Sirlin model we present numerical evidence for the existence of spinning axially symmetric Q-balls with different parity. Solution of this type exist also in the limiting case of vanishing scalar potential. We find that the hairy Q-balls are classically stable for all range of values of angular frequency.
