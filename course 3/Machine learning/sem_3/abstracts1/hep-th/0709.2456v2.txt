A general holographic relation between UV and IR cutoff of an effective field theory is proposed. Taking the IR cutoff relevant to the dark energy as the Hubble scale, we find that the cosmological constant is highly suppressed by a numerical factor and the fine tuning problem seems alleviative. We also use different IR cutoffs to study the case in which the universe is composed of matter and dark energy.
