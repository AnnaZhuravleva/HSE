We initiate the continuum description of a non-perturbative 5d lattice Yang-Mills model with 4d boundaries using the $\varepsilon$-expansion. In its simplest version classically the bulk has an $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry and on the boundary there is an Abelian-Higgs system with zero scalar potential. In part I we compute the Renormalization Group flows and related quantities in a limit where the boundary decouples from the bulk.
