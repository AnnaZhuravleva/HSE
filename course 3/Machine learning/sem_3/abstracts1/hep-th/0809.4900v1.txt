We clearly formulate and study further a conjecture of effective field theory interaction with gravity in the cosmological context. The conjecture stems from the fact that the melding of quantum theory and gravity typically indicates the presence of an inherent UV cutoff. Taking note of the physical origin of this UV cutoff, that the background metric fluctuations does not allow QFT to operate with a better precision than the background space resolution, we conjecture that the converse statement might also be true. That is, an effective field theory could not perceive the background space with a better precision than it is allowed by its intrinsic UV scale. Some of the subtleties and cosmological implications of this conjecture are explored.
