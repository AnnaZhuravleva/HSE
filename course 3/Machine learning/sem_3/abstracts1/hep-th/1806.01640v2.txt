We formulate the conditions defining the irreducible continuous spin representation of the four-dimensional Poincar\'e group based on spin-tensor fields with dotted and undotted indices. Such a formulation simplifies analysis of the Bargmann-Wigner equations and reduces the number of equations from four to three. Using this formulation we develop the BRST approach and derive the covariant Lagrangian for the continuous spin fields.
