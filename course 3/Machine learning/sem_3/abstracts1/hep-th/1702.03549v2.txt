We show how to deal with the generalized q-Schr\"odinger and q-Klein-Gordon fields in a variety of scenarios. These q-fields are meaningful at very high energies (TeVs) for for $q=1.15$, high ones (GeVs) for $q=1.001$, and low energies (MeVs)for $q=1.000001$ [Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 948} (2016) 19, Nucl. Phys. A {\bf 955} (2016) 16]. We develop here the quantum field theory (QFT) for the q-Schr\"odinger and q-Klein-Gordon fields, showing that both reduce to the customary Schr\"odinger and Klein-Gordon QFTs for q close to unity. Further, we analyze the q-Klein-Gordon field for $2q-1=n$ (n integer $\ge 2$) and analytically compute the self-energy and the propagator up to second order.
