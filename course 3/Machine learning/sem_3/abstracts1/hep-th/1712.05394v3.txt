By using a projective connection over the space of two-dimensional affine connections, we are able to show that the metric interaction of Polyakov 2D gravity with a coadjoint element arises naturally through the projective Ricci tensor. Through the curvature invariants of Thomas-Whitehead, we are able to define an action that could describe dynamics to the projective connection. We discuss implications of the projective connection in higher dimensions as related to gravitation.
