In \cite{2} and \cite{1} intersecting $D$-branes in flat space were studied at finite temperature in the Yang-Mills approximation. The one-loop correction to the tachyon mass was computed and the critical temperature at which the tachyon becomes massless was obtained numerically. In this paper we extend the computation of one-loop two-point amplitude to the case of intersecting stacks of $D3$-branes in flat space. The motivation for this calculation is to study the strong coupling holographic BCS model proposed in \cite{3} at finite temperature. We show that the analytical results of \cite{2} and \cite{1} can be embedded into this more general setup. The main technicality involved here is keeping track of the extra color factors coming from the unbroken gauge groups. We further discuss the issues involved in the computation of two point amplitude for case of multiple intersecting stacks of branes.
