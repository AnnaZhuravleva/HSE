In this manuscript we describe a hidden conformal symmetry of smooth Sine-Gordon Braneworld scenarios. We generalize our previous conformal model (arXiv:1705.09331) to the case of two real scalar fields no-minimally coupled to gravity which has conformal symmetry. We show that two possibilities emerge for the internal symmetry of the scalar fields: $SO(2)$ or $SO(1,1)$. We show that by choosing a gauge this system provides the standard action for gravity minimally coupled to one real scalar field $\phi$, with the correct signal for its kinetic part plus a cosmological constant. This is important since models with conformal no-minimal couplings has the wrong sign for the dynamical term of the scalar field. By breaking the internal symmetry and preserving the conformal one we get an effective potential that is an arbitrary function of hyperbolic or trigonometric functions, depending on the internal symmetry chosen. For the case of $SO(2)$ internal symmetry we explicitly construct a Sine-Gordon smooth Braneworld. Therefore this hidden conformal symmetry is a natural way to introduce standard scalar field models with unnatural nonlinear hyperbolic or trigonometric potentials.
