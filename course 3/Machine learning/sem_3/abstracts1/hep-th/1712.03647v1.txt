One of spectacular results in mathematical physics is the expression of Racah matrices for symmetric representations of the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ through the Askey-Wilson polynomials, associated with the $q$-hypergeometric functions ${_4\phi_3}$. Recently it was shown that this is in fact the general property of symmetric representations, valid for arbitrary $SU_q(N)$, at least for exclusive Racah matrices $\bar S$. The natural question then is what substitutes the conventional $q$-hypergeometric polynomials when representations are more general? New advances in the theory of matrices $\bar S$, provided by the study of differential expansions of knot polynomials, suggest that these are multiple sums over Young sub-diagrams of the one, which describes the original representation of $SU_q(N)$. A less trivial fact is that the entries of the sum are not just the factorized combinations of quantum dimensions, as in the ordinary hypergeometric series, but involve non-factorized quantities, like the skew characters and their further generalizations -- as well as associated additional summations with the Littlewood-Richardson weights.
