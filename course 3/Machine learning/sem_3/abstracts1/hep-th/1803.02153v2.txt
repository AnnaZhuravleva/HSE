We study the correlator of concentric circular Wilson loops for arbitrary radii, spatial and internal space separations. For real values of the parameters specifying the dual string configuration, a typical Gross-Ooguri phase transition is observed. In addition, we explore some analytic continuation of a parameter $\gamma$ that characterizes the internal space separation. This enables a ladder limit in which ladder resummation and string theory computations precisely agree in the strong coupling limit. Finally, we find a critical value of $\gamma$ for which the correlator is supersymmetric and ladder diagrams can be exactly resummed for any value of the coupling constant.
