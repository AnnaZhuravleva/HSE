How can a Schwarzschild-sized matter system avoid a fate of gravitational collapse? To address this question, we critically reexamine the arguments that led to the "Buchdahl bound", which implies that the minimal size of a stable, compact object must be larger than nine eighths of its own Schwarzschild radius. Following Mazur and Mottola, and in line with other counterexamples to the singularity theorems, we identify negative radial pressure as the essential ingredient for evading the Buchdahl bound. It is shown, in particular, that an external observer would attribute a negative pressure to a Schwarzschild-sized bound state of highly excited, long, closed, interacting strings and thus the ability to resist gravitational collapse.
