We introduce $3d$ printing, a new algorithm for generating $2d$ $\mathcal{N}=(0, 2)$ gauge theories on D1-branes probing singular toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds using $4d$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theories on D3-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds as starting points. Equivalently, this method produces brane brick models starting from brane tilings. $3d$ printing represents a significant improvement with respect to previously available tools, allowing a straightforward determination of gauge theories for geometries that until now could only be tackled using partial resolution. We investigate the interplay between triality, an IR equivalence between different $2d$ $\mathcal{N}=(0, 2)$ gauge theories, and the freedom in $3d$ printing given an underlying Calabi-Yau 4-fold. Finally, we present the first discussion of the consistency and reduction of brane brick models.
