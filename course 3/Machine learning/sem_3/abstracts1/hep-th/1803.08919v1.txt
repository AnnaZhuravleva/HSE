We show that a gravitationally collapsing object will emit classical radiation at a rate equal to the quantum Hawking radiation rate if suitable initial conditions are chosen for two classical fields. We then solve for the coupled dynamics of gravitational collapse and radiation in a toy model, illustrating how the classical system may be used to gain insight into Hawking evaporation.
