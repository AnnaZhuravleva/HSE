We study moduli stabilization of the F-theory compactified on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfold. Our setup is based on the mirror symmetry framework including brane deformations. The complex structure moduli dependence of the resulting 4D N=1 effective theory is determined by the associated fourfold period integrals. By turning on appropriate G-fluxes, we explicitly demonstrate that all the complex structure moduli fields can be stabilized around the large complex structure point of the F-theory fourfold.
