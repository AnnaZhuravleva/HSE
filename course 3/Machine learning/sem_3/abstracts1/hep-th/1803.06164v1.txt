I show that holographic calculations of entanglement entropy in the context of AdS bulk space modified by wormhole geometries provide the expected entanglement magnitude. This arises in the context of string theory by means of additional geometric structure that is seen by the string in its bulk evolution. The process can be described as a net entanglement flow towards stringy geometry. I make use of the fact that as opposed to quantum field theory, strings have additional winding mode states around small extra dimensions which modify the area computation given by the standard application of the Ryu-Takayanagi entanglement entropy formula.
