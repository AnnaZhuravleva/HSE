In the previous paper arXiv:1711.07122, we show that a holomorphic zero-mode wave function in abelian Chern-Simons theory on the torus can be considered as a quantum version of a modular form of weight 2. Motivated by this result, in this paper we consider an action of a Hecke operator on such a wave function from a gauge theoretic perspective. This leads us to obtain some physical views on the Hecke operators in number theory.
