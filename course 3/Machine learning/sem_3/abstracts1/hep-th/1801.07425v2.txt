Starting from simple observations regarding heat flows for static black holes (or any thermodynamic system with $C_V=0$), we get inequalities which restrict their change in energy and adiabatic curves in the $p-T$ plane. From these observations we then derive an exact efficiency formula for virtually any holographic heat engine defined by a cycle in the $p-V$ plane, whose working substance is a static black hole. Moreover, we get an upper bound for its efficiency and show that for a certain class of black holes, this bound is universal and achieved by an "ideal gas" hole. Finally, we compute exact efficiencies for some particular and new engines.
