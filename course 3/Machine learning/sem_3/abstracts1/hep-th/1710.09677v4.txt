The field equations of elementary domains proposed by Yukawa in 1968 are studied from the viewpoint of particle embedded $\mbox{AdS}_5$ spacetime with warp factor. The fifth dimension in $\mbox{AdS}_5$ is known to produce the branes associated with the energy hierarchy through the warp factor in the spacetime. By the boundary conditions in the fifth dimension, the orbifold $S^1/Z_2$, the particles embedded in this spacetime can not escape to the outside the boundaries in analogy with the particle in an infinite square well potential. This fact adds a new insight to the fields in this spacetime by considering the superposition of the fields for those particles confined in this dimension; that is, the fields living on the IR brane, the low energy boundary of the fifth dimension, are able to obey a difference equation like Yukawa's elementary domain under suitable conditions. We investigate those conditions in detail to make clear the relation between those conditions and underlying conformal field theories on the IR brane.
