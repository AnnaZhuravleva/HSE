We compute finite 't Hooft coupling corrections to observables related to charged quantities in a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The coupling corrected equations of motion of gauge fields are explicitly derived and differ from findings of previous works, which contained several small errors with large impact. As a consequence the $\mathcal{O}(\gamma)$-corrections to the observables considered, including the conductivity, quasinormal mode frequencies, in and off equilibrium spectral density and photoemission rates, become much smaller. This suggests that infinite coupling results obtained within AdS/CFT are little modified for the real QCD coupling strength.
