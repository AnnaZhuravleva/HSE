We provide a simple holographic description for a Warped Conformal Field Theory (WCFT) at finite temperature. To this end we study the counterpart of warped Anti-de Sitter black holes in three dimensions using a lower-spin $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})\oplus\mathfrak{u}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. We determine the asymptotic symmetries, thermal entropy as well as holographic entanglement entropy and show that all these quantities are in perfect agreement with the expectations from the dual WCFT perspective. In addition we provide a metric interpretation of our results in order to put the assumptions made in the Chern-Simons formulation on a solid footing.
