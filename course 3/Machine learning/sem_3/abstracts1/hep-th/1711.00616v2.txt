It is known that a single quantum harmonic oscillator is characterized by a hidden spectrum generating superconformal symmetry, but its origin has remained rather obscure. We show how this hidden superconformal symmetry can be derived by applying a nonlocal Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation to three extended systems with fermion degrees of freedom. The associated systems have essentially different nature from the point of view of conventional supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and generate the desired hidden symmetry in three different ways. We also trace out how the hidden superconformal symmetry of the quantum free particle system is produced in the limit of zero frequency.
