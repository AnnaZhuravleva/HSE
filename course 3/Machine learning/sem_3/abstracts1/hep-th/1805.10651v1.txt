We revisit the calculation of multi-interval modular Hamiltonians for free fermions using a Euclidean path integral approach. We show how the multi-interval modular flow is obtained by glueing together the single interval modular flows. Using this relation, we obtain an exact expression for the multi-interval modular Hamiltonian and entanglement entropy in agreement with previous work. Our procedure allows for a simple derivation of the non-local field theory describing the reduced density matrix, and makes manifest it's non-local conformal symmetry and $U(1)$ Kacs-Moody symmetry.
