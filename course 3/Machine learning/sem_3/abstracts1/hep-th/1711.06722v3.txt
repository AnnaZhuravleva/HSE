We analyze the moduli spaces near N=4 supersymmetric AdS4 vacua of string theory by combining and comparing various approaches: (a) the known exact solutions of Type IIB string theory with localized 5-brane sourcees, (b) the holographically dual 3d quiver gauge theories; (c) gauged supergravity, and (d) the representations of the superconformal algebra Osp(4|4). Short multiplets containing the marginal N=2 deformations transform in the (2;0), (0;2) or (1;1) representations of the R-symmetry group SU(2)_H x SU(2)_C. The first two are classified by the chiral rings of the Higgs and Coulomb branches, while the latter contain mixed-branch operators. We identify the origin of these moduli in string theory, matching in particular the operators of the chiral rings with open strings on the magnetized 5-brane sources. Our results provide new evidence for the underlying holographic duality. The existence of a large number of bound-state moduli highlights the limitations of effective supergravity.
