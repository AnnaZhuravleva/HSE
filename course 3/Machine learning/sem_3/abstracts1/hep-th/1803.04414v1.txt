We consider relativistic (2+1)-QFTs on a product of time with a two-space and study the vacuum free energy as a functional of the temperature and spatial geometry. We focus on free scalar and Dirac fields on arbitrary perturbations of flat space, finding that the free energy difference from flat space is finite and always negative to leading order in the perturbation. Thus free (2+1)-QFTs appear to always energetically favor a crumpled space on all scales; this is true both as a purely quantum effect at zero temperature and as a purely thermal effect at high temperature. Importantly, we show that this quantum effect is non-negligible for the relativistic Dirac degrees of freedom on monolayer graphene even at room temperature, so we argue that this vacuum energy effect should be included for a proper analysis of the equilibrium configuration of graphene or similar materials.
