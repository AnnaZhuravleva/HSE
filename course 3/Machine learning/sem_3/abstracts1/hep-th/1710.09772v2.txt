We consider new Abelian twists of Poincare algebra describing non-symmetric generalization of the ones given in [1], which lead to the class of Lie-deformed quantum Minkowski spaces. We apply corresponding twist quantization in two ways: as generating quantum Poincare-Hopf algebra providing quantum Poincare symmetries, and by considering the quantization which provides Hopf algebroid describing the class of quantum relativistic phase spaces with built-in quantum Poincare covariance. If we assume that Lorentz generators are orbital i.e.do not describe spin degrees of freedom, one can embed the considered generalized phase spaces into the ones describing the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebras.
