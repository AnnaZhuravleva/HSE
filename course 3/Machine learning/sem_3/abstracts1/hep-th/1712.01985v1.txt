We conjecture that the Fourier coefficients of a degree three Siegel form, $1/\sqrt{\chi_{18}}$, count the degeneracy of three-center BPS bound states in type II string theory compactified on $K3 \times T^2$. We provide evidence for our conjecture in the form of consistency with physical considerations of wall-crossing, holographic bounds, and the appearance of suitable counting functions (involving the inverse of the modular discriminant $\Delta$ and the inverse of the Igusa cusp form $\Phi_{10}$) in limits where the count degenerates to involve single-center or two-center objects.
