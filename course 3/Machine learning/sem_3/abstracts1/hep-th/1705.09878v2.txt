The supersymmetry arises in certain theories of fermions coupled to gauge fields and gravity in a spacetime of 11 dimensions. The dynamical brane background has mainly been studied for the class of purely bosonic solutions only, but recent developments involving a time-dependent brane solution have made it clear that one can get more information by asking what happens on supersymmetric systems. In this paper, we construct an exact supersymmetric solution of a dynamical M-brane background in the 11-dimensional supergravity and investigate supersymmetry breaking, the geometric features near the singularity and the black hole horizon.
