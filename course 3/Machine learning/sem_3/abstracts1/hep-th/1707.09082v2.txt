By modifying and generalizing known supersymmetric models we are able to find four different sets of one-dimensional Hamiltonians for the inverted harmonic oscillator. The first set of Hamiltonians is derived by extending the supersymmetric quantum mechanics with reflections to non-Hermitian supercharges. The second set is obtained by generalizing the supersymmetric quantum mechanics valid for non-Hermitian supercharges with the Dunkl derivative instead of $\frac{d}{dx}$. Also, by changing the derivative $\frac{d}{dx}$ by the Dunkl derivative in the creation and annihilation-type operators of the standard inverted Harmonic oscillator $H_{SIO}=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dx^2}-\frac{1}{2}x^2$, we generate the third set of Hamiltonians. The fourth set of Hamiltonians emerges by allowing a parameter of the supersymmetric two-body Calogero-type model to take imaginary values. The eigensolutions of definite parity for each set of Hamiltonians are given.
