We review the unification of early-time inflation with late-time acceleration in several local modified gravity models which pass Solar System and cosmological tests. It is also demonstrated that account of non-local gravitational corrections to the action does not destroy the possibility of such unification. Dark matter effect is caused by composite graviton degree of freedom in such models.
