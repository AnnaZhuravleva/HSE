We compute semi-classical corrections to the energy of rotating Nambu-Goto strings with masses at the ends, using methods from quantum field theory on curved space-times. In the limit of large angular momentum, we recover the Regge intercept $a = 1 + \frac{D-2}{24}$ for $D$ dimensional target space previously found for the open and closed string.
