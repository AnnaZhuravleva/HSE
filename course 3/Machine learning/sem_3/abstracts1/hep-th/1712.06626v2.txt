If there exist higher-spin particles during inflation which are light compared to the Hubble rate, they may leave distinct statistical anisotropic imprints on the correlators involving scalar and graviton fluctuations. We characterise such signatures using the dS/CFT$_3$ correspondence and the operator product expansion techniques. In particular, we obtain generic results for the case of partially massless higher-spin states.
