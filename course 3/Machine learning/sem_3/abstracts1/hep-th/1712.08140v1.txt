We study various duality webs involving the 3d T[U(N)] theory and its mirror dual. We first map the partition functions of the 3d mirror theories to a pair of dual q-Toda conformal blocks. Then we show how to obtain the T[U(N)] partition function by Higgsing a 5d linear quiver. 3d mirror symmetry in this context descends from 5d spectral duality. Finally we discuss the 2d reduction of the 3d mirror pair and study the corresponding limits on the q-Toda side. In particular we obtain a new direct map between the partition function of the 2d T[U(N)] GLSM and an N+2 point Toda conformal block.
