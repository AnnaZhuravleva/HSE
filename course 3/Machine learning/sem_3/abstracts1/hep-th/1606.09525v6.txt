In non-supersymmetric covariant quantum gravity theory, for each system of gravity coupled with single field is one-loop divergent. Since adding other fields or other interactions to each system generates more possible counter-Lagrangian terms, there is room for improvement to restore renormalizability. In this paper, we consider Einstein-Maxwell fields coupled with electrically charged scalar which is the simplest model among the systems of gravity coupled with multiple fields having their own interaction. First, we introduce how to calculate the possible one-loop diagrams in Einstein-SQED system and show that this system is non-renormalizable.
