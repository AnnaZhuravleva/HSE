In this paper we propose a very special relativity (VSR)-inspired description of the axion electrodynamics. This proposal is based upon the construction of a proper study of the SIM$(2)$--VSR gauge-symmetry. It is shown that the VSR nonlocal effects give a health departure from the usual axion field theory. The axionic classical dynamics is analysed in full detail, first by a discussion of its solution in the presence of an external magnetic field. Next, we compute photon-axion transition in VSR scenario by means of Primakoff interaction, showing the change of a linearly polarized light to a circular one. Afterwards, duality symmetry is discussed in the VSR framework.
