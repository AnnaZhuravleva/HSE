We construct a supergravity-Maxwell theory with a novel embedding of the Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term, leading to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The gauging of the R-symmetry is not required and a gravitino mass is allowed for a generic vacuum. When matter couplings are introduced, an uplift through a positive definite contribution to the scalar potential is obtained. We observe a notable similarity to the $\overline{D3}$ uplift constructions and we give a natural description in terms of constrained multiplets.
