In this note, we explicitly illuminate that the velocity bound in the gravity corresponds to the chaos bound in the quantum system by studying the particle free falling in hyperscaling violating (HV) black brane. We also study the particle falling in a repulsive potential in HV black brane and in the AdS soliton geometry, respectively. We find that the momentum doesn't grow exponentially and chaos is suppressed in the two cases. It is attributed to that when the repulsive potential is introduced or the black hole horizon is absent, the particle is slow down and its trajectory seen by a comoving observer is timelike, which corresponds a weak chaos system.
