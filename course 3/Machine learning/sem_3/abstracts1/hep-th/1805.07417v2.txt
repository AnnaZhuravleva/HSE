A common approach to the quantization of integrable models starts with the formal substitution of the Yang-Baxter Poisson algebra with its quantum version. However it is difficult to discern the presence of such an algebra for the so-called non-ultralocal models. The latter includes the class of non-linear sigma models which are most interesting from the point of view of applications. In this work, we investigate the emergence of the Yang-Baxter Poisson algebra in a non-ultralocal system which is related to integrable deformations of the Principal Chiral Field.
