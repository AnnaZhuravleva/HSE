We introduce a general method to construct classes of dynamical systems invariant under generalizations of the Carroll and of the Galilei groups. The method consists in starting from a space-time in $D+1$ dimensions and partitioning it in two parts, the first Minkowskian and the second Euclidean. Tha action consist of two terms that are separately invariant the Minkwoskian and Euclidean partitioning. One of those contains a system of lagrangian multiplies that confine the system to a subspace. The other term defines the dynamics of the system. The total lagrangian is invariant under the Carroll or the Galilei groups with zero central charge.
