When a charged particle encircles around an Alice string, it changes the sign of the electric charge. In this paper we find a BPS-saturated Alice string in $U(1)\times SO(3)$ gauge theory with charged complex scalar fields belonging to the vector representation. After performing BPS completion we solve the BPS equations numerically. We further embed the Alice string into an ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory to show that it is half BPS.
