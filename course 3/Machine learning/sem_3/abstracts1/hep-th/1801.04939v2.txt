We elaborate on the recent claim [arXiv:1702.03583] that non-perturbative effects in $\alpha'$, which are at the core of the FZZ duality, render the region just behind the horizon of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole singular already at the classical level ($g_s=0$). We argue that the 2D classical $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_k/U(1)$ black hole could shed some light on quantum black holes in higher dimensions including large black holes in $AdS_5\times S^5$.
