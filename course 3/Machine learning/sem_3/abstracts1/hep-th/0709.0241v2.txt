We study the emission of scalars into the bulk from a higher-dimensional rotating black hole. We obtain an analytic solution to the field equation by employing matching techniques on expressions valid in the near-horizon and far-field regimes. Both analytic and numerical results for the absorption probability, in the low-energy and low-angular momentum limit, are derived and found to be in excellent agreement. We also compute the energy emission rate, and show that the brane-to-bulk ratio of the energy emission rates for scalar fields remains always larger than unity in the aforementioned regime.
