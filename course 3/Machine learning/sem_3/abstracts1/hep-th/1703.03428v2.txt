We use the gauge gravity correspondence to study the renormalization group flow of a double trace fermionic operator in a quark-gluon plasma subject to the influence of a strong magnetic field and compare it with the results for the case at zero temperature and no magnetic field, where the flow between two fixed points is observed. Our results show that the energy necessary to access the physics of the ultraviolet theory increases with the intensity of the magnetic field under which the processes happen. We provide arguments to support that this increase is scheme independent, and to exhibit further evidence we do a very simple calculation showing that the dimensional reduction expected in the gauge theory in this scenario is effective up to an energy scale that grows with the strength of such a background field. We also show that independently of the renormalization scheme, the coupling of the double trace operators in the ultraviolet fixed point increases with the intensity of the background field. These effects combined can change both, the processes that are expected to be involved in a collision experiment at a given energy and the azimuthal anisotropy of the measurements resulting of them.
