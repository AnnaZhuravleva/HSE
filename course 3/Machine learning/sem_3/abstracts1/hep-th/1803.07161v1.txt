We introduce non-trivial two-point functions of the super Schur polynomials in the ABJM matrix model and study their exact values with the Fermi gas formalism. We find that, although defined non-trivially, these two-point functions enjoy two simple relations with the one-point functions. One of them is associated with the Littlewood-Richardson rule, while the other is more novel. With plenty of data, we also revisit the one-point functions and study how the diagonal BPS indices are split asymmetrically by the degree difference.
