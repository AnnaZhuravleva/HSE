We establish our recently proposed holographic entanglement negativity conjecture for mixed states of adjacent subsystems in conformal field theories with concrete higher dimensional examples. In this context we compute the holographic entanglement negativity for mixed states of adjacent subsystems in $d$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to bulk $AdS_{d+1}$ vacuum and $AdS_{d+1}$-Schwarzschild black holes. These representative examples provide strong indication for the universality of our conjecture which affirms significant implication for diverse applications.
