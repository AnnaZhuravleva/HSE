We reconsider over-charging the higher-dimensional nearly extremal charged black holes using the new version of gedanken experiment proposed recently by Sorce and Wald. As a result, we find that cosmic censorship conjecture associated with such black holes is restored by taking into account the second-order correction, albeit violated by the first-order perturbation. Namely, the higher-dimensional nearly extremal charged black holes cannot be over-charged.
