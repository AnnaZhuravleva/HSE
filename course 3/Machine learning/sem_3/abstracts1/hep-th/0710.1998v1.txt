The concept of black hole entropy is one of the most important enigmas of theoretical physics. It relates thermodynamics to gravity and allows substantial hints toward a quantum theory of gravitation. Although Bekenstein conjecture -assuming the black hole entropy to be a measure of the number of precollapse configurations- has proved to be extremely fruitful, a direct and conclusive proof is still missing. This article computes accurately the entropy evaporated by black holes in (4+n) dimensions taking into account the exact greybody factors. This is a key process to constrain and understand the entropy of black holes as the final state is unambiguously defined. Those results allow to generalize Zurek's important argument, in favor of the Bekenstein conjecture, to multi-dimensional scenarios.
