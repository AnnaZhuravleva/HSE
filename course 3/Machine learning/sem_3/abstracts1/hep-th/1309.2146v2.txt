In the extended quasidilaton massive gravity we perform a nonlinear transformation of the shift vector and then calculate the second derivatives of the Hamiltonian density with respect to the lapse function and the (nonlinearly transformed) shift vector. It is then shown that the $4\times 4$ Hessian matrix is invertible, meaning that the equations of motion for the lapse function and the shift vector simply determine themselves. Therefore, there is no primary constraint that removes the Boulware-Deser ghost.
