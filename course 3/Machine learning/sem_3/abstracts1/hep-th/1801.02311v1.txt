We review two off-shell models for spontaneously broken ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity proposed in arXiv:1702.02423 and arXiv:1707.07390. The ${\cal N}=1$ model makes use of a real scalar superfield subject to three nilpotency conditions. The ${\cal N}=2$ theory is formulated in terms of a reduced chiral superfield obeying a cubic nilpotency condition. New results on nilpotent ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity are also included.
