Motivated by recent developments of black hole thermodynamics in de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley(dRGT) massive gravity, we study the critical behaviors of four-dimensional topological Anti-de Sitter(AdS) black holes in the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics by treating the cosmological constant as pressure and the corresponding conjugate quantity is interpreted as thermodynamic volume. It shows that besides the Van der Waals-like SBH/LBH phase transitions appears, the so-called reentrant phase transitions (RPTs) are also observed when the coupling coefficients $c_i m^2$ of massive potential and Born-Infeld parameter $b$ satisfy some certain conditions.
