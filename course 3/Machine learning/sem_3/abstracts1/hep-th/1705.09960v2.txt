We present covariant quantization rules for nonsingular finite dimensional classical theories with flat and curved configuration spaces. In the beginning, we construct a family of covariant quantizations in flat spaces and Cartesian coordinates. This family is parametrized by a function $\omega(\theta)$, $\theta\in\left( 1,0\right)$, which describes an ambiguity of the quantization. We generalize this construction presenting covariant quantizations of theories with flat configuration spaces but already with arbitrary curvilinear coordinates. Then we construct a so-called minimal family of covariant quantizations for theories with curved configuration spaces. This family of quantizations is parametrized by the same function $\omega \left( \theta \right)$. Finally, we describe a more wide family of covariant quantizations in curved spaces. This family is already parametrized by two functions, the previous one $\omega(\theta)$ and by an additional function $\Theta \left( x,\xi \right)$. The above mentioned minimal family is a part at $\Theta =1$ of the wide family of quantizations. We study constructed quantizations in detail, proving their consistency and covariance. As a physical application, we consider a quantization of a non-relativistic particle moving in a curved space, discussing the problem of a quantum potential. Applying the covariant quantizations in flat spaces to an old problem of constructing quantum Hamiltonian in Polar coordinates, we directly obtain a correct result.
