The richness of 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories with a UV fixed point at infinite coupling is due to the existence of local disorder operators known as instanton operators. By considering the Higgs branch of $SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_f \leq 7$ flavours at finite and infinite coupling, we write down the explicit chiral ring relations between instanton operators, the glueball superfield and mesons. Exciting phenomena appear at infinite coupling: the glueball superfield is no longer nilpotent and the classical chiral ring relations are quantum corrected by instanton operators bilinears. We also find expressions for the dressing of instanton operators of arbitrary charge. The same analysis is performed for $USp(2k)$ with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet and pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories.
