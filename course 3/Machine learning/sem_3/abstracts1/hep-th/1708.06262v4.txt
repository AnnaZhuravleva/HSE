We investigate cubic interactions between a chiral superfield and higher spin superfield corresponding to irreducible representations of the $4D,\, \mathcal{N}=1$ super-Poincar\'{e} algebra. We do this by demanding an invariance under the most general transformation, linear in the chiral superfield. Following Noether's method we construct an infinite tower of higher spin supercurrent multiplets which are quadratic in the chiral superfield and include higher derivatives. The results are that a single, massless, chiral superfield can couple only to the half-integer spin supermultiplets $(s+1,s+1/2)$ and for every value of spin there is an appropriate improvement term that reduces the supercurrent multiplet to a minimal multiplet which matches that of superconformal higher spins. On the other hand a single, massive, chiral superfield can couple only to higher spin supermultiplets of type $(2l+2\hspace{0.3ex},\hspace{0.1ex}2l+3/2)$ and there is no minimal multiplet. Furthermore, for the massless case we discuss the component level higher spin currents and provide explicit expressions for the integer and half-integer spin conserved currents together with a R-symmetry current.
