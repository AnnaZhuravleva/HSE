We investigate the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a nonlocal version of the scalar QED. When the mass parameter $m^2$ satisfies the requirement $m^2>0$, we find that all fields, including the Nambu-Goldstone field, acquire a non-zero mass dependent on the nonlocal scales. On the other hand, when $m^2=0$, we find that the nonlocal corrections to the masses are very small and can be neglected.
