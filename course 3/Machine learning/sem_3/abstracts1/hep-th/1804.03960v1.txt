We present an analytical study of chaos in a charged black hole in the extended phase space in the context of the Poincare-Melnikov theory. Along with some background on dynamical systems, we compute the relevant Melnikov function and find its zeros. Then we analyse these zeros either to identify the temporal chaos in the spinodal region, or to observe spatial chaos in the small - large black hole equilibrium configuration. As a byproduct, we derive a constraint on the Black hole charge required to produce chaotic behaviour. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first endeavour to understand the correlation between chaos and phase picture in black holes.
