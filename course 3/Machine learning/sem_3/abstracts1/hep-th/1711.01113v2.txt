We consider the Riemann-Hilbert factorization approach to solving the field equations of dimensionally reduced gravity theories. First we prove that functions belonging to a certain class possess a canonical factorization due to properties of the underlying spectral curve. Then we use this result, together with appropriate matricial decompositions, to study the canonical factorization of non-meromorphic monodromy matrices that describe deformations of seed monodromy matrices associated with known solutions. This results in new solutions, with unusual features, to the field equations.
