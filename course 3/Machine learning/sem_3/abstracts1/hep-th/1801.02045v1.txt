The variational Hamiltonian approach to Quantum Chromodynamics in Coulomb gauge is investigated within the framework of the canonical recursive Dyson--Schwinger equations. The dressing of the quark propagator arising from the variationally determined non-perturbative kernels is expanded and renormalized at one-loop order, yielding a chiral condensate compatible with the observations.
