We propose a covariant holographic entanglement negativity conjecture for time dependent mixed states of adjacent subsystems in conformal field theories dual to non-static bulk AdS configurations. Our conjecture applied to $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to non-extremal and extremal rotating BTZ black holes exactly reproduces the corresponding replica technique results, in the large central charge limit.
