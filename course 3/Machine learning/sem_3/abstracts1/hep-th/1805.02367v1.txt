Particle creation by time-dependent boundary conditions is of special importance in variety of physics involving quantum fields. In this paper, we consider an idealized but fundamental system, in which the boundary condition in a finite or semi-infinite cavity for a $1+1$ dimensional free massless scalar field instantaneously changes from Neumann to Dirichlet or reversely. Then, we estimate the vacuum expectation value of energy-momentum tensor for the quantized scalar field to obtain it in analytic form for every case considered. It is revealed that two kind of non-renormalizable diverging flux can emanate from the point where the boundary condition changes, one of which has been overlooked in past studies. Such a thunderbolt-like flux would destroy or destabilize the system if its back-reaction is taken into account. The result in this paper can be a guideline in that most models of particle creation by time-dependent boundary conditions should reproduce it when the models have an instantaneous limit.
