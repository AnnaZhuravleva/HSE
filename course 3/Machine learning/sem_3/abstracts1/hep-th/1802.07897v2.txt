The gradient flow is the evolution of fields and physical quantities along a dimensionful parameter~$t$, the flow time. We give a simple argument that relates this gradient flow and the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow. We then illustrate the Wilsonian RG flow on the basis of the gradient flow in two examples that possess an infrared fixed point, the 4D many-flavor gauge theory and the 3D $O(N)$ linear sigma model.
