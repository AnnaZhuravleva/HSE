We make a theoretical prediction for the ratio of the dark energy to other components in the Universe based on the scenario of the sequestering mechanism which was recently proposed as one possible way to solve the cosmological constant problem. In order to evaluate the value of dark energy and the others, we assume a specific scale factor which describes the Big-Crunch scenario in the scalar-tensor theory. We specify the parameter region where the one can explain the observed dark energy-matter ratio.
