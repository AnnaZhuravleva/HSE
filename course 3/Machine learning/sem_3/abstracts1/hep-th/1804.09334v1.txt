We study conformal partial waves (CPWs) in Mellin space with totally symmetric external operators of arbitrary integer spin. The exchanged spin is arbitrary, and includes mixed symmetry and (partially)-conserved representations. In a basis of CPWs recently introduced in arXiv:1702.08619, we find a remarkable factorisation of the external spin dependence in their Mellin representation. This property allows a relatively straightforward study of inversion formulae to extract OPE data from the Mellin representation of spinning 4pt correlators and in particular, to extract closed-form expressions for crossing kernels of spinning CPWs in terms of the hypergeometric function ${}_4F_3$. We consider numerous examples involving both arbitrary internal and external spins, and for both leading and sub-leading twist operators. As an application, working in general $d$ we extract new results for ${\cal O}\left(1/N\right)$ anomalous dimensions of double-trace operators induced by double-trace deformations constructed from single-trace operators of generic twist and integer spin. In particular, we extract the anomalous dimensions of double-trace operators $[\mathcal{O}_J\Phi]_{n,l}$ with ${\cal O}_J$ a single-trace operator of integer spin $J$.
