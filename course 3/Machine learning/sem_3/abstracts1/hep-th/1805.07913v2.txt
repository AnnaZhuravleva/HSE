We consider a holographic model with the charge current dual to a general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) field. Taking into account the backreaction of the NLED field on the geometry and introducing axionic scalars to generate momentum dissipation, we obtain expressions for DC conductivities with a finite magnetic field. The properties of the in-plane resistance are examined in several NLED models. For Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics, negative magneto-resistance and Mott-like behavior could appear in some parameter space region. Depending on the sign of the parameters, we expect the NLED models to mimic some type of weak or strong interactions between electrons. In the latter case, negative magneto-resistance and Mott-like behavior can be realized at low temperatures. Moreover, the Mott insulator to metal transition induced by a magnetic field is also observed at low temperatures.
