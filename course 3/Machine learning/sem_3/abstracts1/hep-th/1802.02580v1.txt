We show that the holographic description of a class of AdS black holes with scalar hair involves dual field theories with a double well effective potential. Black hole microstates have significant support around both vacua in the dual, which correspond to perturbative degrees of freedom on opposite sides of the horizon. A solvable toy-model version of this dual is given by a quantum mechanical particle in a double well potential. In this we show explicitly that the interactions replace the state-dependence that is needed to describe black hole microstates in a low energy effective model involving the tensor product of two decoupled harmonic oscillators. A naive number operator signals the presence of a firewall but a careful construction of perturbative states and operators extinguishes this.
