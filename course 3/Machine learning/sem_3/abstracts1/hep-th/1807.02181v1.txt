Motivated by the conformal anomaly, a new generalization of the Exact RG to curved space is proposed. At fixed-points, in the flat space limit, the equation reduces to the recently discovered conformal fixed-point equation which, unlike the traditional Exact RG equation, enforces full conformal invariance rather than just scale invariance. Vacuum terms require regularization beyond that present in the canonical formulation of the Exact RG, which can be accomplished by adding certain free fields, each at a non-critical fixed-point. This, together with the fact that the ERG's cutoff regularization respects global but not local Weyl invariance, is the origin of the conformal anomaly within the approach. Taking the Legendre transform, the sole effect of the regulator fields is to remove a divergent vacuum term and they do not otherwise appear in the effective average action. Consistency is demonstrated by recovering the conformal anomaly for the Gaussian theory in d=2, both from the Wilsonian effective action and the effective average action.
