Using the boundary string field theory (BSFT) techniques we study the boundary state and partition function for a dynamical (rotating-moving) D$p$-brane coupled to the electromagnetic and tachyonic background fields in superstring theory. By making use of the created partition function, the super BSFT action with a tachyonic field and Dirac-Born-Infeld type action will be constructed. By analyzing the obtained action interesting features will be revealed.
