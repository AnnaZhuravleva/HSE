Using the concept of Jacobi-Lie group and Jacobi-Lie bialgebra, we generalize the definition of Poisson-Lie symmetry to Jacobi-Lie symmetry. In this regard, we generalize the concept of Poisson-Lie T-duality to Jacobi-Lie T-duality and present Jacobi-Lie T-dual sigma models on Lie groups, which have Jacobi-Lie symmetry. Using this symmetry, new cases of duality appear and some examples are given. This generalization may provide insights to understand the quantum features of Poisson-Lie T-duality, in a more satisfactory way.
