The spectrum of masses of the colorless (color neutral) states of the DW (De Donder-Weyl) Hamiltonian operator of quantum SU(2) Yang-Mills field theory on $\mathbb{R}^D$ obtained via the precanonical quantization is shown to be purely discrete and bounded from below. The scale of the mass gap is estimated to be of the order of magnitude of the scale of the ultra-violet parameter $\varkappa$ introduced by precanonical quantization on dimensional grounds.
