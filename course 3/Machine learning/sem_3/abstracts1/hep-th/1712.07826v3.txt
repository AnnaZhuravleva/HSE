Recently, all 1,358,954,496 values of the Gadget between the 36,864 adinkras with four colors, four bosons, and four fermions have been computed in 1701.00304. In this paper, we further analyze these results in terms of $BC_3$, the signed permutation group of three elements, and $BC_4$, the signed permutation group of four elements. It is shown how all 36864 adinkras can be generated via $BC_4$ boson $\times$ $BC_3$ color transformations of two quaternion adinkras that satisfy the quaternion algebra. An adinkra inner product has been used for some time, known as the gadget, that is used to distinguish adinkras. We show how 96 equivalence classes of adinkras that are based on the gadget emerge in terms of $BC_3$ and $BC_4$. We also comment on the importance of the gadget as it relates to separating out dynamics in terms of K\"ahler-like potentials.
