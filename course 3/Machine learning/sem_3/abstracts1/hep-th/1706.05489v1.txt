We have investigated the attractor structure for the CMB fluctuations in composite inflation scenario within the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Such composite inflation represents an attractor which can not be found in a fundamental scalar model. As is known, the number of inflationary models contains the attractor classified by the $\alpha$-attractor model. It is found that the attractor inflation in the gauged NJL model corresponds to the $\alpha = 2$ case.
