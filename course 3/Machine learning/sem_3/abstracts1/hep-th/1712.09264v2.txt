Conventional descriptions of higher-spin fermionic gauge fields appear in two varieties: the Aragone-Deser-Vasiliev frame-like formulation and the Fang-Fronsdal metric-like formulation. We review, clarify and elaborate on some essential features of these two. For frame-like free fermions in Anti-de Sitter space, one can present a gauge-invariant Lagrangian description such that the constraints on the field and the gauge parameters mimic their flat-space counterparts. This simplifies the explicit demonstration of the equivalence of the two formulations at the free level. We comment on the subtleties that may arise in an interacting theory.
