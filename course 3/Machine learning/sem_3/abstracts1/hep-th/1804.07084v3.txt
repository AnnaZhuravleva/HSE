We study dual strong coupling description of integrability-preserving deformation of the $O(N)$ sigma model. Dual theory is described by a coupled theory of Dirac fermions with four-fermion interaction and bosonic fields with exponential interactions. We claim that both theories share the same integrable structure and coincide as quantum field theories. We construct a solution of Ricci flow equation which behaves in the UV as a free theory perturbed by graviton operators and show that it coincides with the metric of the $\eta-$deformed $O(N)$ sigma-model after $T-$duality transformation.
