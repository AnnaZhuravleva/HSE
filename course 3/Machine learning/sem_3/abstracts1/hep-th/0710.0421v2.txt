In this note we present global string solutions which are a generalization of the usual field theory global vortices when the kinetic term is DBI. Such vortices can result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the potential felt by a D3-brane. In a previous paper (0706.0485), the DBI instanton solution was constructed which develops a "wrinkle" for stringy heights of the potential. A similar effect is also seen for the DBI vortex solution. The wrinkle develops for stringy heights of the potential. One recovers the usual field theory global string for substringy potentials. As an example of the symmetry breaking, we consider a mobile D3-brane on the warped deformed conifold. Symmetry breaking can occur if the structure of the vacuum manifold of the potential for the D3-brane changes as it moves through the throat region.
