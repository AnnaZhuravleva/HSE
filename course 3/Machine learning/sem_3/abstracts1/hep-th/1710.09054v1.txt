We investigate the heat engine defined via black hole with momentum relaxation, which is introduced by massless axion fields. We first study the extended thermodynamical properties of the black hole and then apply it to define a heat engine. Then, we analyze how the momentum relaxation affects the efficiency of the heat engine in the limit of high temperature. We find that depending on the schemes of specified parameters in the engine circle, the influence of momentum relaxation on the efficiency of the heat engine behaves novelly, and the qualitative behaviors do depend on the dimension of the gravity theory.
