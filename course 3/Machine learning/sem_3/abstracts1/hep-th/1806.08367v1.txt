We consider finite deformations of the Hull--Strominger system. Starting from the heterotic superpotential, we identify complex coordinates on the off-shell parameter space. Expanding the superpotential around a supersymmetric vacuum leads to a third-order Maurer--Cartan equation that controls the moduli. The resulting complex effective action generalises that of both Kodaira--Spencer and holomorphic Chern--Simons theory. The supersymmetric locus of this action is described by an $L_3$ algebra.
