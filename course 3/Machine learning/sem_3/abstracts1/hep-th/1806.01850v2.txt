We extend our previous study of a toy model for coupling classical Yang-Mills equations for describing overoccupied gluons at the saturation scale with a strongly coupled infrared sector modeled by AdS/CFT. Including propagating modes in the bulk we find that the Yang-Mills sector loses its initial energy to a growing black hole in the gravity dual such that there is a conserved energy-momentum tensor for the total system while entropy grows monotonically. This involves a numerical AdS simulation with a backreacted boundary source far from equilibrium.
