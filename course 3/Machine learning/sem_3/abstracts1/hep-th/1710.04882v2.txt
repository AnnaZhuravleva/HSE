We derive the complete set of off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to the combined "scalar" and "vector" gauge symmetry transformations for the (3+1)-dimensional (4D) topologically massive non-Abelian $(B \wedge F)$ theory with the help of geometrical superfield formalism. For this purpose, we use three horizontality conditions (HCs). The first HC produces the (anti-)BRST transformations for the 1-form gauge field and corresponding (anti-)ghost fields whereas the second HC yields the (anti-)BRST transformations for 2-form field and associated (anti-)ghost fields. The integrability of second HC produces third HC. The latter HC produces the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the compensating auxiliary vector field and corresponding ghosts. We obtain five (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF)-type conditions which emerge very naturally as the off-shoots of superfield formalism. Out of five CF-type conditions, two are fermionic in nature. These CF-type conditions play a decisive role in providing the absolute anticommutativity of the (anti-)BRST transformations and also responsible for the derivation of coupled but equivalent (anti-)BRST invariant Lagrangian densities. Furthermore, we capture the (anti-)BRST invariance of the coupled Lagrangian densities in terms of the superfields and translation generators along the Grassmannian directions $\theta$ and $\bar \theta$.
