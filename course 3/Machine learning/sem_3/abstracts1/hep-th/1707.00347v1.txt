Hawking, Perry and Strominger recently invoked BMS symmetry charges in an attempt to resolve the black hole information paradox. Here we propose an alternative scenario that is based on the Kac-Moody charges. We show that the role of BMS charges can be played by an infinite set of symmetries that emerge from the space-time foam predicted by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus on Yang-Mills fields embedded in the gravity described by the Holst formulation, and argue that the Yang-Mills and gravitational self-duality conditions in space-time bubbles are related to a new infinite dimensional global symmetry, hidden in the Lagrangian. Such a symmetry is manifested by the Kac-Moody algebra, with zero central charges. This implies the existence, in the space-time foam, of an infinite number of different instantons that are interconnected by the Kac-Moody symmetry. These modes puncture the horizons of the building block of the space-time bubbles. On the other hand, the same Kac-Moody symmetry is retried in non-perturbative regime at the level of the gravitational quantum loops. The new result carries consequences on the no-hair theorem and on the study of quantum black holes. In particular, instantonic moduli of the Kac-Moody charges are quantum hairs encoding the missing black hole information, subtly compatible with the no hair theorem.
