Infinite-dimensional Galilean conformal algebras can be constructed by contracting pairs of symmetry algebras in conformal field theory, such as $W$-algebras. Known examples include contractions of pairs of the Virasoro algebra, its $N=1$ superconformal extension, or the $W_3$ algebra. Here, we introduce a contraction prescription of the corresponding operator-product algebras, or equivalently, a prescription for contracting tensor products of vertex algebras. With this, we work out the Galilean conformal algebras arising from contractions of $N=2$ and $N=4$ superconformal algebras as well as of the $W$-algebras $W(2,4)$, $W(2,6)$, $W_4$, and $W_5$. The latter results provide evidence for the existence of a whole new class of $W$-algebras which we call Galilean $W$-algebras. We also apply the contraction prescription to affine Lie algebras and find that the ensuing Galilean affine algebras admit a Sugawara construction. The corresponding central charge is level-independent and given by twice the dimension of the underlying finite-dimensional Lie algebra. Finally, applications of our results to the characterisation of structure constants in $W$-algebras are proposed.
