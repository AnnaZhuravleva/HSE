We show that the internal stationary state of a black hole for massless Dirac fields can be represented by an entangled state of collapsing matter and infalling Hawking radiation. This implies that the Horowitz-Maldacena conjecture for the black hole final state originally proposed for the massless scalar fields is also applicable to fermionic fields as well. For an initially mixed state we find that the measure of mixedness is expected to decrease under evaporation.
