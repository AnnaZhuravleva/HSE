It is well known that Kasner geometry with space-like singularity can be extended to bulk AdS-like geometry, furthermore one can study field theory on this Kasner space via its gravity dual. In this paper, we show that there exists a Kasner-like geometry with timelike singularity for which one can construct a dual gravity description. We then study various extremal surfaces including space-like geodesics in the dual gravity description. Finally, we compute correlators of highly massive operators in the boundary field theory with a geodesic approximation.
