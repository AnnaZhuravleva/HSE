Local measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ are at odds with $\Lambda$CDM analysis of Planck data and this tension is increasing. This suggests the presence of potentially new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Recently, it has been conjectured that de Sitter vacua inhabit the Swampland of inconsistent low-energy effective theories coupled to gravity. Viewing this proposal through the prism of data, we abandon the notion of stable de Sitter vacua, which allows us to alleviate the $H_0$ tension, but at the cost of violating the Swampland criteria.
