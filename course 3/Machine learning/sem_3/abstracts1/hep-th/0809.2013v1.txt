Motivated by brane physics, we consider the non-linear Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) extension of the Abelian-Higgs model and study the corresponding cosmic string configurations. The model is defined by a potential term, assumed to be of the mexican hat form, and a DBI action for the kinetic terms. We show that it is a continuous deformation of the Abelian-Higgs model, with a single deformation parameter depending on a dimensionless combination of the scalar coupling constant, the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field at infinity, and the brane tension. By means of numerical calculations, we investigate the profiles of the corresponding DBI-cosmic strings and prove that they have a core which is narrower than that of Abelian-Higgs strings. We also show that the corresponding action is smaller than in the standard case suggesting that their formation could be favoured in brane models. Moreover we show that the DBI-cosmic string solutions are non-pathological everywhere in parameter space. Finally, in the limit in which the DBI model reduces to the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Abelian-Higgs model, we find that DBI cosmic strings are no longer BPS: rather they have positive binding energy. We thus argue that, when they meet, two DBI strings will not bind with the corresponding formation of a junction, and hence that a network of DBI strings is likely to behave as a network of standard cosmic strings.
