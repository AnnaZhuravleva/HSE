We study maximally supersymmetric Anti-de Sitter backgrounds in consistent N=2 truncations of type IIB supergravity compactified on the Sasaki-Einstein manifold $T^{1,1}$. In particular, we focus on truncations that contain fields coming from the nontrivial second and third cohomology forms on $T^{1,1}$. These give rise to N=2 supergravity coupled to two vector- and two hypermultiplets (Betti-vector truncation) or one vector- and three hypermultiplets (Betti-hyper truncation), respectively. We find that both truncations admit AdS$_5$ backgrounds with the gauge group always being broken but containing at least an $U(1)_R$ factor. Moreover, in both cases we show that the moduli space of AdS vacua is nontrivial and of maximal dimension. Finally, we explicitly compute the metrics on these moduli spaces.
