We discuss certain features of cosmology in a generalised RS II braneworld scenario. In this scenario, the bulk is given by a Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter or a Vaidya-anti de Sitter black hole in which an FRW brane is consistently embedded, resulting in modifications of the 4-dimensional Friedmann equations. We analyse how the scenario can be visualised and discuss the significance of each term in these modified equations both for early time and for late time cosmology. We further analyse the perturbation equations, based on Newtonian as well as relativistic perturbations and show that the scenario has the potentiality to explain structure formation by the ``Weyl fluid'' arising from embedding geometry. The results thus obtained are confronted with observations as well.
