The two-loop (order $\alpha'$) $\beta$-function equations, which are equivalent to the equations of motion of $\alpha'$-corrected string effective action, are considered for anisotropic homogeneous space-times. These equations are solved for all Bianchi-type models in two schemes of effective action, namely $R^2$ and Gauss-Bonnet schemes with zero cosmological constant and then the metric, dilaton and $B$-field are found at $\alpha'$ perturbative corrections.
