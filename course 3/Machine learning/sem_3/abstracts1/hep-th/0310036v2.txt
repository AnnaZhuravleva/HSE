The complete set of Maxwell equations is represented by a single equation using Riemann-Silberstein complex vector of electromagnetic field. The consistent derivation of the Lorenz gauge condition is presented. We demonstrate that Fourier form of invariants ${\bf EB}$ and $E^{2}-B^{2}$ are proportional to dissipated power and equal to zero respectively.
