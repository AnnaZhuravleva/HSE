Using holography, we analyse deep inelastic scattering of a flavor current from a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma with a background magnetic field. The aim is to show how the magnetic field affects the partonic picture of the plasma. The flavored constituents of the plasma are described using D3-D7 brane model at finite temperature. We find that the presence of a background magnetic field makes it harder to detect the plasma constituents. Our calculations are in agreement with those calculated from other approaches. Besides the resulting changes for plasma structure functions a criteria will be obtained for the possibility of deep inelastic process in the presence of magnetic field.
