An intersecting D3-D3' system contains magnetic monopole solutions due to D-strings stretched between two branes. These magnetic charges satisfy usual Dirac quantization relation. We show that this quantization condition can also be obtained directly by SUSY and gauge invariance arguments of the theory and conclude that independence of physics on shift of holonomy exactly equals to regarding {\it Fayet-Iliopoulos gauge} for our setup. So we are led to conjecture that there is a correspondence between topological point of view of magnetic charges and SYM considerations of their theories. This picture implies that one can attribute a definite quantity to the integration of vector multiplet over singular region such that we can identify it with magnetic flux. It also indicates that FI-parameter is proportional to magnetic charge so it is a quantized number.
