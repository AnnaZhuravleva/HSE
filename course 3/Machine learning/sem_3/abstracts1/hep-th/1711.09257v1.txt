Using the $u$-plane integral as a tool, we derive a formula for the partition function of the simplest nontrivial (topologically twisted) Argyres-Douglas theory on compact, oriented, simply connected, four-manifolds without boundary and with $b_2^+>0$. The result can be expressed in terms of classical cohomological invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. Our results hint at the existence of standard four-manifolds that are not of Seiberg-Witten simple type.
