The Rindler horizon in Minkowski spacetime can be implanted with supertranslation hair by a matter shock wave without planar symmetry, and the hair is observable as a supertranslation memory on the Rindler family of uniformly linearly accelerated observers. We show that this classical memory is accompanied by a supertranslation quantum memory that modulates the entanglement between the opposing Rindler wedges in quantum field theory. A corresponding phenomenon across a black hole horizon may play a role in Hawking, Perry and Strominger's proposal for supertranslations to provide a solution to the black hole information paradox.
