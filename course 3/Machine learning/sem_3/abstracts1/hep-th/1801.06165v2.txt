We study hydrodynamics of four-dimensional non-conformal holographic plasma with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point. We compute equation of state, the speed of sound waves, transport coefficients (shear and bulk viscosities), and discuss causality. We study the asymptotic character of the hydrodynamic series for the homogeneous and isotropic expansion of the plasma. We perform computations for finite $c-a\ne 0$, but to leading nonvanishing order in the conformal symmetry breaking coupling.
