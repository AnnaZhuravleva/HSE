Abstract: We show that boundary string field theory realizes the minimal model of open string field theory. More precisely, we observe that the expansion of the (co)homological vector field, $Q$ of boundary string field theory in the cohomology of its linear part reproduces the S-matrices of perturbative string theory. In mathematical terms, boundary string field theory realizes the minimal model map of the cohomological perturbation lemma.
