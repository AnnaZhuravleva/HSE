The static magnetic susceptibility with strong-coupling is studied via a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS geometry. The analyticity of the susceptibility on the complex momentum-plane in relation to the Friedel-like oscillation in coordinate space is explored. In contrast to the branch-cuts crossing the real momentum-axis for a Fermi liquid, we prove that the holographic magnetic susceptibility remains an analytic function of the complex momentum around the real axis in the limit of zero temperature, implying that the exponential decay behaviour of the Friedel-like oscillation is sustained then in strong coupling. We also obtained the asymptotic forms of the susceptibility in large and small-momentum, respectively. The large momentum result at zero temperature reveals two branch-cuts parallel to the imaginary momentum-axis but far away from the real axis corresponding to the condensation of the asymptotic poles found previously at a nonzero temperature.
