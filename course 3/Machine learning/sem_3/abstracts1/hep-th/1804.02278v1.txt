In this article we focus on constructing a new family of spatially anisotropic Lifshitz spacetimes with arbitrary dynamical exponent z and constant negative curvature in d+1 dimensions within the framework of the Einstein-Proca theory. The constructed metric tensor depends on both the spacetime dimensionality and the critical exponent, while the curvature scalar depends just on the number of dimensions. We also obtained a novel spectrum with negative squared mass that respects the corresponding Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. Hence these new solutions are stable and can be useful within the gravity/condensed matter theory holographic duality, since the spectrum with negative squared mass is complementary to the positive ones already known in the literature.
