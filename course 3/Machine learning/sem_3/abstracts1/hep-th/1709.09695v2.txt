We discuss the extent to which it is necessary to include higher-derivative operators in the effective field theory of general scalar-tensor theories. We explore the circumstances under which it is correct to restrict to second-order operators only, and demonstrate this using several different techniques, such as reduction of order and explicit field redefinitions. These methods are applied, in particular, to the much-studied Horndeski theories. The goal is to clarify the application of effective field theory techniques in the context of popular cosmological models, and to explicitly demonstrate how and when higher-derivative operators can be cast into lower-derivative forms suitable for numerical solution techniques.
