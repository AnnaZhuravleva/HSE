A Rayleigh-Schrodinger type of perturbation scheme is employed to study weak self-interacting scalar potential perturbations occurring in scalar field models describing 1D domain kinks and 3D domain walls. The solutions for the unperturbed defects are modified by the perturbing potentials. An illustration is provided by adding a cubic potential to the familiar quartic kink potential and solving for the first order correction to the kink solution, using a "slab approximation". A result is the appearance of an asymmetric scalar potential with different, nondegenerate, vacuum values and the subsequent formation of vacuum bubbles.
