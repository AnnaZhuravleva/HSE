We study the consequences of Entanglement Wedge Nesting for CFTs with holographic duals. The CFT is formulated on an arbitrary curved background, and we include the effects of curvature-squared couplings in the bulk. In this setup we find necessary and sufficient conditions for Entanglement Wedge Nesting to imply the Quantum Null Energy Condition in $d\leq 5$, extending its earlier holographic proofs. We also show that the Quantum Focusing Conjecture yields the Quantum Null Energy Condition as its nongravitational limit under these same conditions.
