In this work we study the main properties and the one-loop renormalization of a Yang-Mills theory in which the kinetic term contains also a fourth-order differential operator; in particular, we add to the Yang-Mills Lagrangian the most general contribution of mass dimension six, weighted with a dimensionful parameter. This model is renormalizable; in the literature two values for the beta function for the gauge coupling have been reported, one obtained using the heat kernel approach and one with Feynman diagrams. In this work we repeat the computation using heat kernel techniques confirming the latter result. We also considered coupling with matter.   We then study the supersymmetric extension of the model; this is a nontrivial task because of the complicate structure of the higher-derivative term. Some partial results were known, but a computation of the beta functions for the full supersymmetric non-Abelian higher-derivative gauge theory was missing. We make use of the (unextended) supersymmetric higher-derivative Lagrangian density for the Yang-Mills field in six spacetime dimensions derived in arXiv:hep-th/0505082; by dimensional reduction we obtain the N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric higher-derivative super-Yang-Mills Lagrangian in four spacetime dimensions, whose beta function we evaluate using heat kernels. We also deduce the beta function for N=4 supersymmetry.
