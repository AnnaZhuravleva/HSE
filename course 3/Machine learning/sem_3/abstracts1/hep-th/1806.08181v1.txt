We calculate, for the first time, three-point correlation functions involving "heavy" operators in the Schrodinger/null-dipole CFT correspondence at strong coupling. In particular, we focus on the three-point functions of the dilaton modes and two "heavy" operators. The heavy states are dual to the single spin and dyonic magnon, the single spin and dyonic spike solutions or to two novel string solutions which do not have an undeformed counterpart. Our results provide the leading term of the correlators in the large $\lambda$ expansion and are in perfect agreement with the form of the correlator dictated by non-relativistic conformal invariance. We also specify the scaling function which can not be fixed by using conformal invariance.
