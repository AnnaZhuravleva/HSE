We show that N = 8 supergravity may possess an even larger symmetry than previously believed. Such an enhanced symmetry is needed to explain why this theory of gravity exhibits ultraviolet behaviour reminiscent of the finite N = 4 Yang-Mills theory. We describe a series of three steps that leads us to this result.
