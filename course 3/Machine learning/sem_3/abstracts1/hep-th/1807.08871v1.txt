We construct the lattice AdS geometry. The lattice AdS$_2$ geometry and AdS$_3$ geometry can be extended from the lattice AdS$_2$ induced metric, which provided the lattice Schwarzian theory at the classical limit. Then we use the lattice embedding coordinates to rewrite the lattice AdS$_2$ geometry and AdS$_3$ geometry with the manifest isometry. The lattice AdS$_2$ geometry can be obtained from the lattice AdS$_3$ geometry through the compactification without the lattice artifact. The lattice embedding coordinates can also be used in the higher dimensional AdS geometry. Because the lattice Schwarzian theory does not suffer from the issue of the continuum limit, the lattice AdS$_2$ geometry can be obtained from the higher dimensional AdS geometry through the compactification, and the lattice AdS metric does not depend on the angular coordinates, we expect that the continuum limit should exist in the lattice Einstein gravity theory from this geometric lattice AdS geometry.
