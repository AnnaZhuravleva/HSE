Gauge field configuration for a magnetic monopole and its dual configuration are studied in SU(2) gauge theory. We present a relation between the monopole field and its dual field. Since these fields can become massive, their massive Lagrangians are derived. In the dual case, an additional term appears. We show this term is necessary to produce a linear potential between a monopole charge and an antimonopole charge.
