In this paper, we use deformation approach and obtain the corresponding Lagrangian of charged test particle. Also, we show the effect of NC parameters on the Lagrangian of test particle in HL background with charge and without charge. Also, we see in case of $\beta=\theta$ and without charge, the deformed and non-deformed Lagrangian will be same. Also in case of $\beta=\theta$ and with charge will be the same but the charge or field need some scaling. Finally, We show that two theories in case of $\beta\neq\theta$ with charge is completely different. It means that in case of NC geometry in addition to have time components of field we have $r$ and $x_{i}$ components.
