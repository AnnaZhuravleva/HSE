We discuss various symmetry properties of the ${\cal N} = 2$ supersymmetric quantum spherical model in one (0 + 1)-dimension of spacetime and provide their relevance in the realm of the mathematics of differential geometry. We show one-to-one mapping between the continuous symmetry transformations (and corresponding generators) and de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. One of the novel observations is the existence of discrete symmetry transformations which play a crucial role in providing the physical realization of the Hodge duality ($\star$) operation. Thus, the present model provides a toy model for the Hodge theory.
