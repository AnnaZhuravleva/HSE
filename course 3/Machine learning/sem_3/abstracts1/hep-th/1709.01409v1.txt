In this paper, we base on the formalism of Symbolic Gauge Theory in the case of General relativity; we calculate the Feynman diagrams for the interaction between harmonic gravitational connections in the topological field theory. These calculations provide insights to interactions between gravity and dark energy. They could, therefore, have important repercussions for current cosmological problems.
