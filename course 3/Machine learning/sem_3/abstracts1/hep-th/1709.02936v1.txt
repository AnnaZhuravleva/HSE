We consider an expression for the supercurrent in the superconformal formulation of N=1 supergravity. A chiral compensator provides the supersymmetric formulation of the Callan-Coleman-Jackiw (CCJ) improved stress energy tensor, when the conformal gauge is used. Superconformal and non-superconformal matter give different conservation laws of the supercurrent, when coupled to the curvature supermultiplets which underlie the local superspace geometry. This approach can be applied to any set of auxiliary fields and it is useful to classify rigid curved superspace geometries. Examples with four supersymmetries are briefly described.
