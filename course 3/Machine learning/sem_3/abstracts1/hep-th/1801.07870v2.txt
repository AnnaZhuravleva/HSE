We clarify the relation between the Noether charge associated to an arbitrary vector field and the equations of motions by revisiting Wald formalism. For a time-like Killing vector, aspects of the Noether charge suggest that it is dual to the heat current in the boundary for general holographic theories. For a space-like Killing vector, we interpret the Noether charge (at the transverse direction) as shear stress of the dual fluid so we can compute the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density by simply using the infrared data on the black hole event horizon. We test the new method for Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity and find that it produces correct results for both cases even in the presence of additional matter fields.
