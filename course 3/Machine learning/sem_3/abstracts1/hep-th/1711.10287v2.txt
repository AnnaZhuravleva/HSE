We probe D1D5 micro-state geometries with massless particles, waves and strings. To this end, we study geodetic motion, Klein-Gordon equation and string scattering in the resulting gravitational background. Due to the reduced rotational symmetry, even in the simple case of a circular fuzzball, the system cannot be integrated elementarily. Yet, for motion in the plane of the string profile or in the orthogonal plane to it, one can compute the deflection angle or the phase shift and identify the critical impact parameter, at which even a massless probe is captured by the fuzzball if its internal momentum is properly tuned. We find agreement among the three approaches, thus giving further support to the fuzzball proposal at the dynamical level.
