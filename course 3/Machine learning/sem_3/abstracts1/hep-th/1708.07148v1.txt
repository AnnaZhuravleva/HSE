A Double Field Theory (DFT) description of gauge symmetry enhancing-breaking in the heterotic string is presented. The construction, based on previous results for the bosonic string, relies on the extension of the tangent frame of DFT. The fluxes of a Scherk-Schwarz like generalized toroidal compactification are moduli dependent and become identified with the structure constants of the enhanced group at fixed "self-dual" points in moduli space. Slight displacements from such points provide the breaking of the symmetry, gauge bosons acquiring masses proportional to fluxes. The inclusion of fermions is also discussed.
