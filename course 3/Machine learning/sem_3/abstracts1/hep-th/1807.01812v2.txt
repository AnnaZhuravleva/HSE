We present a gauge field theory for unitary infinite dimensional tachyonic representations of the Poincar\'e group. It was obtained by a dimensional reduction from the gauge field theory for continuous spin particles in a cotangent bundle over Minkowski space-time. We discuss its BRST formulation and compute the partition function. Some cubic vertices are also presented and their properties discussed. In the massless limit the gauge theory for continuous spin tachyons reduces to the gauge theory for continuous spin particles.
