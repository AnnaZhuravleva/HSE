We illustrate the analogue of the Unruh effect for a quantum system on the real line. Our derivation relies solely on basic elements of representation theory of the group of affine transformations without a notion of time or metric. Our result shows that a thermal distribution naturally emerges in connecting quantum states belonging to representations associated to distinct notions of translational symmetry. The existence of inaccessible regions of configuration space determined by the different action of translation generators is the key ingredient of the analysis presented.
