We studied the holographic entanglement entropy for a strip and sharp wedge entangling regions in momentum relaxation systems. In the case of strips, we found analytic and numerical results for the entanglement entropy and showed the effect on the minimal surface by the electric field. We also studied the entanglement entropy of wedges and confirmed that there is a linear change in the electric field. This change is proportional to the thermoelectric conductivity, $\bar\alpha$, that can be measured.
