We investigate a Dirac action with extra dimensions. We first show that an $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum mechanical supersymmetry is hidden in the four-dimensional (4D) spectrum of the Kaluza-Klein decomposition for the higher dimensional Dirac field, that is, Kaluza-Klein mode functions of 4D right-handed spinors and 4D left-handed ones form $\mathcal{N}=2$ supermultiplets. In addition to $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY, we discover that an $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetry ($\mathcal{N} = d+2\ (d+1)$ for $d=$ even (odd) extra dimensions) is further hidden in the 4D spectrum. The extended symmetry can explain additional degeneracy of the spectrum. We finally discuss a possibility whether the $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetry can reduce depending on boundary conditions.
