We present a new construction of four dimensional $\mathcal N=3$ theories, given by M5 branes wrapping a $T^2$ in an M-theory U-fold background. The resulting setup generalizes the one used in the usual class $\mathcal S$ construction of four dimensional theories by using an extra discrete symmetry on the M5 worldvolume. Together with the M-theory U-fold description of $(0,2)$ $E$-type six-dimensional SCFTs, this allows to construct new, exceptional, $\mathcal N=3$ theories.
