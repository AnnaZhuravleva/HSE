We investigate early time inflationary scenarios in an Universe filled with a dilute noncommutative bosonic gas at high temperature. A noncommutative bosonic gas is a gas composed of bosonic scalar field with noncommutative field space on a commutative spacetime. Such noncommutative field theories was recently introduced as a generalization of quantum mechanics on a noncommutative spacetime. As key features of these theories are Lorentz invariance violation and CPT violation. In the present study we use a noncommutative bosonic field theory that besides the noncommutative parameter $\theta$ shows up a further parameter $\sigma$. This parameter $\sigma$ controls the range of the noncommutativity and acts as a regulator for the theory. Both parameters play a key role in the modified dispersion relations of the noncommutative bosonic field, leading to possible striking consequences for phenomenology. In this work we obtain an equation of state $p=\omega(\sigma,\theta;\beta)\rho$ for the noncommutative bosonic gas relating pressure $p$ and energy density $\rho$, in the limit of high temperature. We analyse possible behaviours for this gas parameters $\sigma$, $\theta$ and $\beta$, so that $-1\leq\omega<-1/3$, which is the region where the Universe enters an accelerated phase.
