We study the tunneling of massless scalars across black hole horizons in any number of spacetime dimensions greater than three. Our analysis finds that corrections due to backreaction and the inverse dimensional expansion are naturally concomitant, and furnishes a simple proof of the classic relation between entropy and area in all spacetime dimensions, finite or infinite. We conclude with a discussion of the limit in which the the number of spacetime dimensions is taken to infinity, where we find that thermodynamic quantities are related to the "thickness" of the membrane on which all the curvature is localized.
