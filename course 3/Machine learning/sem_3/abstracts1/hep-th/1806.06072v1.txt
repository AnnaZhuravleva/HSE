We derive analytic results for the symbol of certain two-loop Feynman integrals relevant for seven- and eight-point two-loop scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang--Mills theory. We use a bootstrap inspired strategy, combined with a set of second-order partial differential equations that provide powerful constraints on the symbol ansatz. When the complete symbol alphabet is not available, we adopt a hybrid approach. Instead of the full function, we bootstrap a certain discontinuity for which the alphabet is known. Then we write a one-fold dispersion integral to recover the complete result. At six and seven points, we find that the individual Feynman integrals live in the same space of functions as the amplitude, which is described by the 9- and 42-letter cluster alphabets respectively. Starting at eight points however, the symbol alphabet of the MHV amplitude is insufficient for individual integrals. In particular, some of the integrals require algebraic letters involving four-mass box square-root singularities. We point out that these algebraic letters are relevant at the amplitude level directly starting with N$^2$MHV amplitudes even at one loop.
