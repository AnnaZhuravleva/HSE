We discuss the non-equilibrium attractors of systems undergoing Gubser flow within kinetic theory by means of nonlinear dynamical systems. We obtain the attractors of anisotropic hydrodynamics, Israel-Stewart (IS) and transient fluid (DNMR) theories. These attractors are non-planar and the basin of attraction is three dimensional. We compare the asymptotic attractors of each hydrodynamic model with the one obtained from the exact Gubser solution of the Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation. Anisotropic hydrodynamics matches, up to high numerical accuracy, the attractor of the exact theory while the other hydrodynamic theories fail to do so. Thus, anisotropic hydrodynamics is an effective theory for far-from-equilibrium fluids, which consists of the dissipative (nonperturbative) contributions at any order in the gradient expansion.
