We classify the topological terms (in a sense to be made precise) that may appear in a non-linear sigma model based on maps from an arbitrary worldvolume manifold to a homogeneous space $G/H$ (where $G$ is an arbitrary Lie group and $H \subset G$). We derive a new condition for $G$-invariance of topological terms, which is necessary and sufficient (at least when $G$ is connected), and discuss a variety of examples in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. In the present work we discuss only terms that may be written in terms of (possibly only locally-defined) differential forms on $G/H$. Such terms come in one of two types, with prototypical quantum-mechanical examples given by the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Dirac monopole. The classification is based on the observation that, for topological terms, the maps from the worldvolume to $G/H$ may be replaced by singular homology cycles on $G/H$. In forthcoming papers we apply the results to phenomenological models in which the Higgs boson is composite, and use the formalism of differential characters to extend the classification to include terms that cannot be written in terms of differential forms.
