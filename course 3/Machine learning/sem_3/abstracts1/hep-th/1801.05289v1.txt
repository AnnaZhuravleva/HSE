In this paper we propose a space-time random tensor network approach for understanding holographic duality. Using tensor networks with random link projections, we define boundary theories with interesting holographic properties, such as the Renyi entropies satisfying the covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi formula, and operator correspondence with local reconstruction properties. We also investigate the unitarity of boundary theory in spacetime geometries with Lorenzian signature. Compared with the spatial random tensor networks, the space-time generalization does not require a particular time slicing, and provides a more covariant family of microscopic models that may help us to understand holographic duality.
