By comparing entanglement in emergent gauge theories to the bulk in AdS/CFT, I suggest that the Ryu-Takayanagi area term is an entanglement edge term related to a natural measure on the gauge group. The main technical result in this paper is an argument why the "extended Hilbert space" definition of entanglement entropy in a lattice gauge theory is applicable to an emergent gauge theory.
