We propose new topological vertex formalism for Type IIB $(p,q)$ 5-brane web with an O5-plane. We apply our proposal to 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sp(1) gauge theory with $N_f=0,1,8$ flavors to compute the topological string partition functions and check the agreement with the known results. Especially for the $N_f=8$ case, which corresponds to E-string theory on a circle, we obtain a new, yet simple, expression of the partition function with two Young diagram sum.
