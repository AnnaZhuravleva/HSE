Using the concept of 3-Lie bialgebra; we construct the Bagger- Lambert- Gustavson (BLG) model on the Manin triple $\cal D$ of the especial 3-Lie bialgebra $({\cal D},{\cal A}_{\cal G},{\cal A}_{{\cal G}^*}^*)$ which is in correspondence with Manin triple of Lie bialgebra $({\cal D},{\cal G},{\cal G}^*)$. We have shown that the Nahm equation (with Lie bialgebra ${\cal G}$) can be obtained from the Basu-Harvey equation as a boundary condition of BLG model (with 3-Lie bialgebra ${\cal D}$) and vice versa.
