Extending our previous work on the robustness of inflation to perturbations in the scalar field, we investigate the effects of perturbations in the transverse traceless part of the extrinsic curvature on the evolution of an inhomogeneous inflaton field. Focusing on small field models, we show that these additional metric inhomogeneities initially reduce the total number of e-folds as the amplitude increases, but that the reduction saturates and even reverses above a certain amplitude. We present an argument that this is due to the presence of a large initial Hubble friction when metric perturbations are large.
