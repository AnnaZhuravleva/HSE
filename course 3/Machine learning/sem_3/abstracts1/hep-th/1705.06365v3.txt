A unified field theory of all known basic forces and elementary particles is built based on the postulates of gauge invariance and coordinate independence along with general conformal scaling symmetry. The hyper-spin charge of a unified hyper-spinor field is conjectured to correlate with the dimension of hyper-spacetime. The minimal dimension of hyper-spacetime for the unity of quarks and leptons in the standard model is found to be $D_h=19$ with a bimaximal symmetry. A unified fundamental interaction is governed by hyper-spin gauge symmetry SP(1,$D_h$-1). We show gravitational origin of gauge symmetry characterized by gauge-type Goldstone-like hyper-gravifield, which enables us to study gauge gravity and gravity geometry correspondences and to reveal gauge geometry duality.
