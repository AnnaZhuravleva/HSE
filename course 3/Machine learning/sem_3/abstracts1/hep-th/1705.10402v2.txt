The scaling dimension of the first excited state in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) satisfies a universal upper bound. Using the modular bootstrap, we extend this result to CFTs with $W_3$ algebras which are generically dual to higher spin theories in AdS$_3$. Assuming unitarity and modular invariance, we show that the conformal weights $h$, $\bar{h}$ of the lightest charged state satisfy $h < c/12 + O(1)$ and $\bar{h} < \bar{c}/12 + O(1)$ in the limit where the central charges $c$, $\bar{c}$ are large. Furthermore, we show that in this limit any consistent CFT with $W_3$ currents must contain at least one state whose $W_3$ charge $w$ obeys $|w| > 4 |h-c/24| /\sqrt{10 \pi c} + O(1)$. We discuss hints on the existence of stronger bounds and comment on the interpretation of our results in the dual higher spin theory.
