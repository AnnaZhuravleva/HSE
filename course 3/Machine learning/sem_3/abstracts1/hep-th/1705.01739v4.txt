We have proposed a new type of string field theory. The main point of the present article is to cure some technical troubles: missing two out three terms in veneziano amplitude. Our novel string field theory, describes a theory with many strings in terms of "objects",which are not exactly, but close to Charles Thorn's string bits. The new point is that the objects in terms of which the universe states are constructed,and which have an essentially 26-momentum variable called J^{\mu}, can have essentially the energy J^0 be also negative.We get a long way in deriving in this model the veneziano model and obtain all the three terms needed for a four point amplitude.This result strongly indicates that our novel string field theory is indeed string theory.
