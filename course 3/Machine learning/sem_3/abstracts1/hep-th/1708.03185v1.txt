We consider a tachyon field whose Fourier components correspond to spatial momenta with modulus smaller than the mass parameter. The plane wave solutions have them a time evolution which is a real exponential. The field is quantized and the solution of the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian leads to the evaluation of the vacuum expectation value of products of field operators. The propagator turns out to be half-advanced and half-retarded. This completes the proof [4] that the total propagator is the Wheeler Green function [4,7].
