We analyse the asymptotic symmetries of Maxwell theory at spatial infinity through the Hamiltonian formalism. Precise, consistent boundary conditions are explicitly given and shown to be invariant under asymptotic angle-dependent $u(1)$-gauge transformations. These symmetries generically have non-vanishing charges. The algebra of the canonical generators of this infinite-dimensional symmetry with the Poincar\'e charges is computed. The treatment requires the addition of surface degrees of freedom at infinity and a modification of the standard symplectic form by surface terms. We extend the general formulation of well-defined generators and Hamiltonian vector fields to encompass such boundary modifications of the symplectic structure. Our study covers magnetic monopoles.
