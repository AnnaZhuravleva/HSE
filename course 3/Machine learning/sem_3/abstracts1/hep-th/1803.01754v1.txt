We study holographic entanglement entropy in spatially anisotropic field theory. We observe that for the background we consider in this paper, to a good approximation, the holographic entanglement entropy can be decomposed into two terms. One of them is the entanglement entropy of the isotropic field theory at fixed temperature and the other term is only a function of anisotropy parameter. Moreover, for large enough values of anisotropy parameter, our numerical results indicate that the entanglement entropy in the perpendicular direction to anisotropic direction is greater than the parallel case.
