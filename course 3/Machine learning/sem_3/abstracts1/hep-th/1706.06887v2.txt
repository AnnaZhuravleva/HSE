We study the Blume-Capel universality class in $d=\frac{10}{3}-\epsilon$ dimensions. The RG flow is extracted by looking at poles in fractional dimension of three loop diagrams using $\overline{\rm MS}$. The theory is the only nontrivial universality class which admits an expansion to three dimensions with $\epsilon=\frac{1}{3}<1$. We compute the relevant scaling exponents and estimate some of the OPE coefficients to the leading order. Our findings agree with and complement CFT results. Finally we discuss a family of nonunitary multicritical models which includes the Lee-Yang and Blume-Capel classes as special cases.
