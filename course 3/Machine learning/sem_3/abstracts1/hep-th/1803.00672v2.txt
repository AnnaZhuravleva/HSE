The RIM spinors (Restricted Inomata McKinley spinors) constitutes a very particular class of solutions of the non-linear Heisenberg equation. As a matter of fact, a free linear massive or even mass-less Dirac field can be decomposed into a combination of RIM spinors and such a procedure shows up to be useful to describe neutrino physics and neutrinos oscillation. In this paper we show that not only Dirac spinors but also mass-dimension-one spinors can be decomposed into a combination of non-linear Heisenberg spinors. In order to extend the analysis carried out, shedding light to explore mass-dimension-one fermions within Spinor Theory of Gravity scenario.
