We find a class of new supersymmetric dyonic black holes in four-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity which are asymptotic to the ${\rm SU(3)}\times {\rm U(1)}$ invariant AdS$_4$ Warner vacuum. These black holes can be embedded in eleven-dimensional supergravity where they describe the backreaction of M2-branes wrapped on a Riemann surface. The holographic dual description of these supergravity backgrounds is given by a partial topological twist on a Riemann surface of a three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT that is obtained by a mass-deformation of the ABJM theory. We compute explicitly the topologically twisted index of this SCFT and show that it accounts for the entropy of the black holes.
