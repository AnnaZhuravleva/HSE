Superstring theory predicts the potential formation of string networks with bound states ending in junctions. Kinematic constraints for junction formation have been derived within the Nambu-Goto thin string approximation. Here we test these constraints numerically in the framework of the Abelian-Higgs model in the Type-I regime and report on good agreement with the analytical predictions. We also demonstrate that strings can effectively pass through each other when they meet at speeds slightly above the critical velocity permitting bound state formation. This is due to reconnection effects that are beyond the scope of the Nambu-Goto approximation.
