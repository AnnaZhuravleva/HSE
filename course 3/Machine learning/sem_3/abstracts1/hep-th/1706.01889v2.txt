The low-energy expansion of one-loop amplitudes in type II string theory generates a series of world-sheet integrals whose integrands can be represented by world-sheet Feynman diagrams. These integrands are modular invariant and understanding the structure of the action of the modular Laplacian on them is important for determining their contribution to string scattering amplitudes. In this paper we study a particular infinite family of such integrands associated with three-loop scalar vacuum diagrams of tetrahedral topology and find closed forms for the action of the Laplacian. We analyse the possible eigenvalues and degeneracies of the Laplace operator by group- and representation-theoretic means.
