In the presence of a gravitational contribution to the chiral anomaly, the chiral magnetic effect induces an energy current proportional to the square of the temperature in equilibrium. In holography the thermal state corresponds to a black hole. We numerically study holographic quenches in which a planar shell of scalar matter falls into a black hole and rises its temperature. During the process the momentum density (energy current) is conserved. The energy current has two components, a non-dissipative one induced by the anomaly and a dissipative flow component. The dissipative component can be measured via the drag it asserts on an additional auxiliary color charge. Our results indicate strong suppression very far from equilibrium.
