We perform a detailed analysis of holographic entanglement R\'enyi entropy in some modified theories of gravity with four dimensional conformal field theory duals. First, we construct perturbative black hole solutions in a recently proposed model of Einsteinian cubic gravity in five dimensions, and compute the R\'enyi entropy as well as the scaling dimension of the twist operators in the dual field theory. Consistency of these results are verified from the AdS/CFT correspondence, via a corresponding computation of the Weyl anomaly on the gravity side. Similar analyses are then carried out for three other examples of modified gravity in five dimensions that include a chemical potential, namely Born-Infeld gravity, charged quasi-topological gravity and a class of Weyl corrected gravity theories with a gauge field, with the last example being treated perturbatively. Some interesting bounds in the dual conformal field theory parameters in quasi-topological gravity are pointed out. We also provide arguments on the validity of our perturbative analysis, whenever applicable.
