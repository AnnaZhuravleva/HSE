We present a generalized version of holographic dark energy arguing that it must be considered in the maximally subspace of a cosmological model. In the context of brane cosmology it leads to a bulk holographic dark energy which transfers its holographic nature to the effective 4D dark energy. As an application we use a single-brane model and we show that in the low energy limit the behavior of the effective holographic dark energy coincides with that predicted by conventional 4D calculations. However, a finite bulk can lead to radically different results.
