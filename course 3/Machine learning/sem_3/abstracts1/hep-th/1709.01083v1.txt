We start with the recently conjectured 3d bosonization dualities and gauge global symmetries to generate an infinite sequence of new dualities. These equate theories with non-Abelian product gauge groups and bifundamental matter. We uncover examples of Bose/Bose and Fermi/Fermi dualities, as well as a sequence of dualities between theories with scalar matter in two-index representations. Our conjectures are consistent with level/rank duality in massive phases.
