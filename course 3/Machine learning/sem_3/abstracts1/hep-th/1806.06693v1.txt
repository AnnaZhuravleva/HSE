The $\phi^4$ model has been the "workhorse" of the classical Ginzburg--Landau phenomenological theory of phase transitions and, furthermore, the foundation for a large amount of the now-classical developments in nonlinear science. However, the $\phi^4$ model, in its usual variant (symmetric double-well potential), can only possess two equilibria. Many complex physical systems possess more than two equilibria and, furthermore, the number of equilibria can change as a system parameter (e.g., the temperature in condensed matter physics) is varied. Thus, "higher-oder field theories" come into play. This chapter discusses recent developments of higher-order field theories, specifically the $\phi^6$, $\phi^8$ models and beyond. We first establish their context in the Ginzburg--Landau theory of successive phase transitions, including a detailed discussion of the symmetric triple well $\phi^6$ potential and its properties. We also note connections between field theories in high-energy physics (e.g., "bag models" of quarks within hadrons) and parametric (deformed) $\phi^6$ models. We briefly mention a few salient points about even-higher-order field theories of the $\phi^8$, $\phi^{10}$, etc. varieties, including the existence of kinks with power-law tail asymptotics that give rise to long-range interactions. Finally, we conclude with a surprising set of connections between higher-order polynomial field theories and other models of nonlinear science such as the nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries, sine-Gordon equations and their variants.
