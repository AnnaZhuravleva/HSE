Inspired by ER=EPR conjecture, we search for a connection between quantum entanglement and geometry. Starting with several simple postulates, we present a formalism providing decomposition of the vacuum of quantum harmonic oscillator into two maximally entangled states in such a way that both can be interpreted geometrically. The interpretation is based solely on the form of the states, and it reveals certain structures at the boundary and in the bulk of $AdS_3$. The former correspond to world lines of massless particles at the boundary. The latter resemble worldsheets of interacting closed strings.
