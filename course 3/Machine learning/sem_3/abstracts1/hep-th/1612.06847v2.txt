We investigate de Sitter solutions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity with an F-term scalar potential near a no-scale Minkowski point, as they may in particular arise from flux compactifications in string theory. We show that a large class of such solutions has a universal tachyon with $\eta \le -\frac{4}{3}$ at positive vacuum energies, thus forbidding meta-stable de Sitter vacua and slow-roll inflation. The tachyon aligns with the sgoldstino in the Minkowski limit, whereas the sgoldstino itself is generically stable in the de Sitter vacuum due to mass mixing effects. We specify necessary conditions for the superpotential and the K\"{a}hler potential to avoid the instability. Our result may also help to explain why the program of classical de Sitter hunting has remained unsuccessful, while constructions involving instantons or non-geometric fluxes have led to various examples of meta-stable de Sitter vacua.
