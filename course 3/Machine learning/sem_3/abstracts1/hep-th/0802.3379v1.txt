Cosmic superstrings are expected to be formed at the end of brane inflation, within the context of brane-world cosmological models inspired from string theory. By studying properties of cosmic suprestring networks, and comparing their phenomenological consequences against observational data, we aim at pinning down the successful and natural inflationary model and get an insight into the stringy description of our universe.
