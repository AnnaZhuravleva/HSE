We consider a procedure for directly constructing general tree-level four-particle scattering amplitudes of massive spinning particles that are consistent with the usual requirements of Lorentz invariance, unitarity, crossing symmetry, and locality. There are infinitely many such amplitudes, but we can isolate interesting theories by bounding the high-energy growth of the tree amplitudes within the effective field theory. This allows us to set model-independent lower bounds on the growth of tree-level amplitudes in any effective field theory with a given particle content and any interaction terms with an arbitrary but finite number of derivatives. In certain common cases this corresponds to finding the highest possible strong coupling scale. When applied to spin 2, we show that the only amplitudes that saturate this bound are generated by the known ghost-free theories of a massive spin-2 particle, namely dRGT massive gravity and the pseudo-linear theory. We also make a conjecture for the allowed growth of tree amplitudes in a theory with a single massive particle of any integer spin.
