Long ago Coleman, Callan, Wess and Zumino (CCWZ) constructed the general effective lagrangian for nonlinearly realized symmetry by finding all possible nonlinear representations of the broken group G which become linear when restricted to the unbroken group H. However, in the case of a single Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB), which corresponds to a broken U(1), the effective lagrangian can also be obtained by imposing a constant shift symmetry. In this work we generalize the shift symmetry approach to multiple NGBs and show that, when they furnish a linear representation of H that can be embedded in a symmetric coset, it is possible to derive the CCWZ lagrangian by imposing 1) the "Adler's zero condition," which requires scattering amplitudes to vanish when emitting a single soft NGB, and 2) closure of shift symmetry with the linearly realized symmetry; knowledge of the broken group G is not required at all. Using only generators of H, the NGB covariant derivative and the associated gauge field can be computed to all orders in the NGB decay constant f.
