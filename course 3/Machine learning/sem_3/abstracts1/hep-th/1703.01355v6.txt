We propose an unified theory for spinor fields on extended Weyl manifolds taking into account self-interactions to obtain the Relativistic dynamics on a general curved Riemannian background as continuation of the Relativistic Quantum Geometry program, recently introduced. We focuss our attention separately on both, massless and matter fields. We study an example of confined gravitons on a de Sitter (dS) background at Planckian scales.
