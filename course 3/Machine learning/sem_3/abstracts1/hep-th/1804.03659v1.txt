The goal of this work was to investigate the propagation of the constraints in the ghost-free bimetric theory where the evolution equations are in standard 3+1 form. It is established that the constraints evolve according to a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system whose characteristic cone consists of the null cones of the two metrics. Consequently, the constraint evolution equations are well-posed, and the constraints stably propagate.
