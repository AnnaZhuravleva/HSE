Under the influence of standardly used description of Coulomb-hadronic interference proposed by West and Yennie the protons have been interpreted as transparent objects; elastic events have been interpreted as more central than inelastic ones. It will be shown that using eikonal model the protons may be interpreted in agreement with usual ontological conception; elastic processes being more peripheral than inelastic ones. The corresponding results (differing fundamentally from the suggested hitherto models) will be presented by analyzing the most ample elastic data set measured at ISR energy of 52.8 GeV. Detailed analysis of measured differential cross section will be performed and different alternatives of peripheral behavior on the basis of eikonal model will be presented. The impact of recently established electromagnetic form factors on determination of quantities specifying hadron interaction determined from the fits of experimental elastic data will be analyzed. The influence of some assumptions on proton characteristics derived from elastic hadronic amplitude determined on the basis of experimental data will be mentioned, too.
