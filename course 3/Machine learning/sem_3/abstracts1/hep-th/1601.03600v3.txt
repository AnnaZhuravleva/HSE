In this paper, we describe the generation of the CPT-even, aether-like terms via the new CPT-even magnetic-like coupling. We carry out a study the loop corrections generated by this coupling. Previous investigations has been initiated on this issue and we have extended them to studying of higher-point functions, of quantum corrections to vertices of the interaction and to two-point function of the spinor field.
