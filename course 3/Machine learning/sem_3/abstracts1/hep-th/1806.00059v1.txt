Two-dimensional QCD with adjoint fermions has many attractive features, yet its single-particle content remains largely unknown. To lay the foundation for a crucially improved approximation of the theory's spectrum, we developed a method to find the basis of eigenstates using the symmetry structure of the asymptotic theory where pair production is disallowed. This method produces complete sets of multi-dimensional harmonic functions for the massless and the massive theory. Previously only part of such a basis was known. The method presented here should be applicable to other theories and has the promise of factoring out the long-range Coulomb-type part of interactions. The role of pair production and implications for the bosonized theory in the case of adjoint QCD$_2$ are discussed.
