In our previous work arXiv:1704.08675, we pointed out that various multi-cut solutions exist in the Chern-Simons (CS) matrix models at large-$N$ due to a curious structure of the saddle point equations. In the ABJM matrix model, these multi-cut solutions might be regarded as the condensations of the D2-brane instantons. However many of these multi-cut solutions including the ones corresponding to the condensations of the D2-brane instantons were obtained numerically only. In the current work, we propose an ansatz for the multi-cut solutions which may allow us to derive the analytic expressions for all these solutions. As a demonstration, we derive several novel analytic solutions in the pure CS matrix model and the ABJM matrix model. We also develop the argument for the connection to the instantons.
