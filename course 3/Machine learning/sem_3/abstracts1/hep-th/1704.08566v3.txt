We extend the $P$-flux analysis carried out recently on the $T^6/[\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 ]$ type-II orientifold model to include all the possible non-geometric fluxes. By deriving universal T-duality rules for all the fluxes, we are able to write down a complete expression for the superpotential for both the IIB and IIA theories. By exploiting the universal T-duality rules that apply to all the branes in string theory, we then identify all the exotic branes that can be consistently included to cancel the tadpoles induced by the fluxes. Finally, we derive the representations of these branes with respect to the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})^7$ duality symmetry of the model.
