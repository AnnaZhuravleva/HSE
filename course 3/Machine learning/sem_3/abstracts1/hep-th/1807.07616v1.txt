In this Letter we study dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of a generic model with global chiral symmetry. By purely algebraic means we analyze the vacuum structure for different symmetry breaking patterns and show explicitly how non trivial vacuum condensates are required for both mass generation and field mixing phenomena. We stress that the generation of mixing implies the presence of off diagonal condensates in flavor space. In addition, with the help of Ward Takahashi identities, we demonstrate the emergence of Nambu Goldstone modes in the physical spectrum.
