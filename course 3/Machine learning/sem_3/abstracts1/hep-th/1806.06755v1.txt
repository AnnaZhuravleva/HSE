We study vortices in generalized Maxwell-Higgs models, with the inclusion of a quadratic kinetic term with the covariant derivative of the scalar field in the Lagrangian density. We discuss the stressless condition and show that the presence of analytical solutions help us to define the model compatible with the existence of first order equations. A method to decouple the first order equations and to construct the model is then introduced and, as a bonus, we get the energy depending exclusively on a function of the fields calculated from the boundary conditions.
