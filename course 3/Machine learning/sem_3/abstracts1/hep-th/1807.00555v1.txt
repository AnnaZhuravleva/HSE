We study an exhaustive analytic class of massive type IIA backgrounds preserving sixteen real supercharges and enjoying $\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times\textrm{SO}(8)$ bosonic symmetry. The corresponding geometry is described by $\textrm{AdS}_{2}\times S^{7}$ warped over a line, which turns out to emerge from taking the near-horizon limit of D0 $-$ F1 $-$ D8 intersections. By studying the singularity structure of these solutions we find the possible presence of localized O8/D8 sources, as well as of fundamental strings smeared over the $S^{7}$. Finally we discuss the relation between the aforementioned solutions and the known $\textrm{AdS}_{7}\times S^{2}$ class through double analytic continuation.
