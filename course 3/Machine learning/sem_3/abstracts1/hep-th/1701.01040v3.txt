Multivariate residues appear in many different contexts in theoretical physics and algebraic geometry. In theoretical physics, they for example give the proper definition of generalized-unitarity cuts, and they play a central role in the Grassmannian formulation of the S-matrix by Arkani-Hamed et al. In realistic cases their evaluation can be non-trivial. In this paper we provide a Mathematica package for efficient evaluation of multidimensional residues based on methods from computational algebraic geometry. The package moreover contains an implementation of the global residue theorem, which produces relations between residues at finite locations and residues at infinity.
