We use integrability at weak coupling to compute fishnet diagrams for four-point correlation functions in planar $\phi^4$ theory. The results are always multi-linear combinations of ladder integrals, which are in turn built out of classical polylogarithms. The Steinmann relations provide a powerful constraint on such linear combinations, leading to a natural conjecture for any fishnet diagram as the determinant of a matrix of ladder integrals.
