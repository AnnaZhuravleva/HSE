Quantum scale invariant regularization is a variant of dimensional regularization where the renormalization scale is treated as a dynamical field. But, rather than be regarded as a novel regularization method on par with dimensional regularization, momentum cutoff, Pauli-Villars etc., it should be understood as a way to define a subset in the infinite space of nonrenormalizable models of certain type. The subset realizes the demand that renormalization scale, along with any other dimensionful parameters, should be interpreted as a dynamical field's homogeneous background. This restriction is most straightforwardly implemented using dimensional regularization but it can hypothetically be imposed with any regularization method. Theories that satisfy it offer a new perspective on the radiative violation of global scale symmetry associated with RGE functions. As a result of the quantum scale invariant regularization being implemented, the scale symmetry is preserved at the quantum level despite the RGE functions being non-zero, as can be inspected at the level of composite quantum operators that govern dilatation of Green functions. We analyze these statements in explicit detail using a specific but easily generalized toy model with scalar fields.
