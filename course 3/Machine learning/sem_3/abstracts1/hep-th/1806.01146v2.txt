The recently suggested tangle calculus for knot polynomials is intimately related to topological string considerations and can help to build the HOMFLY-PT invariants from the topological vertices. We discuss this interplay in the simplest example of the Hopf link and link $L8n8$. It turns out that the resolved conifold with four different representations on the four external legs, on the topological string side, is described by a special projection of the four-component link $L8n8$, which reduces to the Hopf link colored with two composite representations. Thus, this provides the first {\it explicit} example of non-torus link description through the topological vertex. It is not a real breakthrough, because $L_{8n8}$ is just a cable of the Hopf link, still, it can help to intensify the development of the formalism towards more interesting examples.
