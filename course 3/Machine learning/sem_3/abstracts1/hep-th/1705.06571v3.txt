Implementing Wilsonian renormalization group transformations in an iterative way, we develop a non-perturbative field theoretical framework, which takes into account all-loop quantum corrections organized in the $1/N$ expansion, where $N$ represents the flavor number of quantum fields. The resulting classical field theory is given by an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for a local order parameter field, which appears in one-dimensional higher spacetime. We claim that such all-loop quantum corrections are introduced into an equation of motion for the order parameter field through the evolution in the emergent extra dimension. Based on this non-perturbative theoretical framework, we solve the Kondo effect, where the quantum mechanics problem in the projective formulation is mapped into a Landau-Ginzburg field theory for the hybridization order parameter field with an emergent extra dimension. We confirm the non-perturbative nature of this field theoretical framework, comparing our thermodynamic properties with Bethe ansatz results. Finally, we speculate how our non-perturbative field theoretical framework can be connected with the AdS$_{d+2}$/CFT$_{d+1}$ duality conjecture.
