The technique allowing to obtain conformally-invariant theories within the coset space construction is developed. It reproduces all consequences of the conformal invariance and Lagrangians of widely-known conformal field theories. The method of induced representations, which plays the key role in the construction, allows to reveal a special role of the "Nambu-Goldstone fields" for special conformal transformations. Namely, their dependence on the coordinates turns out to be fixed by the symmetries. This results in the appearance of the constraints on possible forms of Lagrangians, which ensure that discrete symmetries are indeed symmetries of the theory.
