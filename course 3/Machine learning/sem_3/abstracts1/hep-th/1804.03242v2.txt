It is conjectured that in the geometric formulation of quantum computing, one can study quantum complexity through classical entropy of statistical ensembles established non-relativistically in the group manifold of unitary operators. The kinetic-positional decomposition of statistical entropy are conjectured to correspond to the Kolmogorov complexity and computational complexity, respectively, of corresponding quantum circuits. In this paper, we claim that by applying the virial theorem to the group manifold, one can derive a generic relation between Kolmogorov complexity and computational complexity.
