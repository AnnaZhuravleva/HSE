We study half-BPS surface operators in four dimensional N=2 SU(N) gauge theories. We calculate the ramified instanton partition function using equivariant localization and extract the low-energy effective action on the four dimensional Coulomb branch. We also study surface operators as coupled 2d/4d quiver gauge theories with an SU(N) flavour symmetry. In this description, the same surface operator can be described by different quivers that are related to each other by two dimensional Seiberg duality. We argue that these dual quivers correspond, on the localization side, to distinct integration contours that can be determined by the relative magnitudes of the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters of the two dimensional gauge nodes and by the signs of their beta-functions. We verify the proposal by mapping the solutions of the twisted chiral ring equations of the 2d/4d quivers onto individual residues of the localization integrand.
