We use the complexity=action proposal to calculate the rate of complexity growth for field theories which are the holographic duals of asymptotically flat spacetimes. To this aim, we evaluate the on-shell action of asymptotically flat spacetime on the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. This results in the same expression as can be found by taking the flat-space limit from the corresponding formula related to the asymptotically AdS spacetimes. For the bulk dimensions which are greater than three, the rate of complexity growth at late times approaches from above to the Lloyd's bound. However, for the three-dimensional bulks, this rate is a constant and differs from the Lloyd's bound by a logarithmic term.
