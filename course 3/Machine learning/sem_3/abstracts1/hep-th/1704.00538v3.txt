We study holographic RG flow solutions within four-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity obtained from type IIA and IIB string theories compactified on $T^6/\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold with gauge, geometric and non-geometric fluxes. In type IIB non-geometric compactifications, the resulting gauged supergravity has $ISO(3)\times ISO(3)$ gauge group and admits an $N=4$ $AdS_4$ vacuum dual to an $N=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) in three dimensions. We study various supersymmetric RG flows from this $N=4$ SCFT to $N=4$ and $N=1$ non-conformal field theories in the IR. The flows preserving $N=4$ supersymmetry are driven by relevant operators of dimensions $\Delta =1,2$ or alternatively by one of these relevant operators, dual to the dilaton, and irrelevant operators of dimensions $\Delta=4$ while the $N=1$ flows in addition involve marginal deformations. Most of the flows can be obtained analytically. We also give examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions preserving $N=4$ and $N=1$ supersymmetries. These solutions should describe two-dimensional conformal defects within the dual $N=4$ SCFT. Geometric compactifications of type IIA theory give rise to $N=4$ gauged supergravity with $ISO(3)\ltimes U(1)^6$ gauge group. In this case, the resulting gauged supergravity admits an $N=1$ $AdS_4$ vacuum. We also numerically study possible $N=1$ RG flows to non-conformal field theories in this case.
