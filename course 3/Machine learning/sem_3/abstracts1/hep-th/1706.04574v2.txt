Renyi entropy and central charge, $C_T$, are calculated for a coexact p--form on an even sphere with particular reference to the conformally invariant case. It is shown, for example, that the entanglement entropy is minus the standard conformal anomaly with no `shift' being required.   The shift necessary for a conformal p--form, when using a hyperbolic technique, is predicted, on a numerical basis, to be (minus) the entanglement entropy of a conformal (p-1)-form.   The central charges agree numerically with a general formula of Buchel {\it et al}.
