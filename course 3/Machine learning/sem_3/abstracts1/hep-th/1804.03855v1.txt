We study global quantum quenches in a continuous field theoretic system with UV fixed point. Assuming that the characteristic inverse time scale of the smooth quench is much larger than all scales inherent to the system except for the UV-cutoff, we derive the universal scaling behavior of the two-point correlation functions associated with Dirac fields and spin-1 currents. We argue that in certain regimes our results can be recovered using the technique of operator product expansion.
