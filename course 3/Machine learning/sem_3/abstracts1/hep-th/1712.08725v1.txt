In this article we discuss the limit $p$ approaches to one of tree-level $p$-adic open string amplitudes and its connections with the topological zeta functions. There is empirical evidence that $p$-adic strings are related to the ordinary strings in the $p \to 1$ limit. Previously, we established that $p$-adic Koba-Nielsen string amplitudes are finite sums of multivariate Igusa's local zeta functions, consequently, they are convergent integrals that admit meromorphic continuations as rational functions. Denef and Loeser established that the limit $p \to 1$ of a Igusa's local zeta function gives rise to a new object, called topological zeta functions. By using Denef-Loeser's theory of topological zeta functions, we show that limit $p \to 1$ of tree-level $p$-adic string amplitudes give rise to new amplitudes, that we have named open topological string amplitudes. This name is unfortunate since it is used in other physical theories, however, the given name is natural due to the mathematical origin of the new amplitudes. Gerasimov and Shatashvili showed that in this limit the well-known non-local effective Lagrangian (reproducing the tree-level $p$-adic string amplitudes) gives rise to a simple Lagrangian with a logarithmic potential. We show that the Feynman amplitudes of this last Lagrangian are precisely the new open topological string amplitudes. Finally, the open topological string amplitudes for four and five points are computed explicitly.
