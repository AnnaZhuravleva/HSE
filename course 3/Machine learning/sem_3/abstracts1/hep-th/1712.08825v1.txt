We generalize the conformally invariant topological quantum mechanics of a particle propagating on a punctured plane by introducing a potential that breaks both the rotational and the conformal invariance down to a ${\bf Z}_2$ angular-dependent discrete symmetry. We derive a topological quantum mechanics whose localization gauge functions give interesting self-dual equations. The model contains an order parameter and exhibits a spontaneous symmetry breaking with two ground states above a critical scale. Unlike the ordinary $O(2)$-invariant Higgs potential, an angular-dependence is found and saddle points, instead of local maxima, appear, posing subtle questions about the existence of instantons. The supersymmetric quantum mechanical model is constructed in both the path integral and the operatorial frameworks.
