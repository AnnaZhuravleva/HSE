We introduce a UV cutoff into free scalar field theory on the noncommutative (fuzzy) two-sphere. Due to the IR-UV connection, varying the UV cutoff allows us to control the effective nonlocality scale of the theory. In the resulting fuzzy geometry, we establish which degrees of freedom lie within a specific geometric subregion and compute the associated vacuum entanglement entropy. Entanglement entropy for regions smaller than the effective nonlocality scale is extensive, while entanglement entropy for regions larger than the effective nonlocality scale follows the area law. This reproduces features previously obtained in the strong coupling regime through holography. We also show that mutual information is unaffected by the UV cutoff.
