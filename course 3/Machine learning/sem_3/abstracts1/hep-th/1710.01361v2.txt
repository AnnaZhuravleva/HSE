We initiate a systematic investigation of Mellin amplitudes of Witten diagrams to all loop levels, by introducing integral recursion relations among them. Focusing on the scalar effective theories in AdS with the simplest type of interactions, the integral kernel that triggers the recursion obeys universal rules. As a first application, analytic properties of a 4-point triangle diagram is analyzed with this method.
