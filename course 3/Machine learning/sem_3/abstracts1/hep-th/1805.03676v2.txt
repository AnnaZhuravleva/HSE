Gravity duals for a class of UV complete minimally supersymmetric non-conformal gauge theories require deformed conifolds with fluxes. However these manifolds do not allow for the standard Kahler or conformally Kahler metrics on them, instead the metrics are fully non-Kahler. We take a generic such configuration of a non-Kahler deformed conifold with fluxes and ask what constraints do supersymmetry impose in the Baryonic branch. We study the supersymmetry conditions and show that for the correct choices of the vielbeins and the complex structure all the equations may be consistently solved. The constraints now lead not only to the known cases in the literature but also to some new backgrounds. We also show how geometric features of these backgrounds, including the overall warp factor and the resolution parameters, can be seen on the field theory side from perturbative `probe-brane' type calculations by Higgsing the theory and studying one-loop 4-point functions of vector and chiral multiplets. Finally we discuss how UV completions of these gauge theories may be seen from our set-up, both from type IIB as well as from the T-dual type IIA brane constructions.
