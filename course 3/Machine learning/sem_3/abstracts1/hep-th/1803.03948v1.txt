We compute constitutive relations for a charged $(2+1)$ dimensional Schr\"odinger fluid up to first order in derivative expansion, using holographic techniques. Starting with a locally boosted, asymptotically $AdS$, $4+1$ dimensional charged black brane geometry, we uplift that to ten dimensions and perform $TsT$ transformations to obtain an effective five dimensional local black brane solution with asymptotically Schr\"odinger isometries. By suitably implementing the holographic techniques, we compute the constitutive relations for the effective fluid living on the boundary of this space-time and extract first order transport coefficients from these relations. Schr\"odinger fluid can also be obtained by reducing a charged relativistic conformal fluid over light-cone. It turns out that both the approaches result the same system at the end. Fluid obtained by light-cone reduction satisfies a restricted class of thermodynamics. Here, we see that the charged fluid obtained holographically also belongs to the same restricted class.
