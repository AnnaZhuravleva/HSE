In this paper, we investigate the effects of nonlinear exponential electrodynamics as well as backreaction on the properties of one-dimensional $s$-wave holographic superconductors. We continue our study both analytically and numerically. In analytical study, we employ the Sturm-Liouville method while in numerical approach we perform the shooting method. We obtain a relation between the critical temperature and chemical potential analytically. Our results show a good agreement between analytical and numerical methods. We observe that the increase in the strength of both nonlinearity and backreaction parameters causes the formation of condensation in the black hole background harder and critical temperature lower. These results are consistent with those obtained for two dimensional $s$-wave holographic superconductors.
