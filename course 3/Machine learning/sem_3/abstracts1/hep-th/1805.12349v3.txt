We construct detailed AdS$_2$ gravity solutions describing the teleportation through a traversable wormhole sending a state from one side of the wormhole to the other. The traversable wormhole is realized by turning on a double trace interaction that couples the two boundaries of an eternal AdS$_2$ black hole. The horizon radius or the entropy of the black hole is reduced consistently with the boundary computation of the energy change, confirming the black hole first law. To describe teleportee states traveling through the wormhole, we construct Janus deformations which make the Hamiltonians of left-right boundaries differ from each other by turning on exact marginal operators. Combining explicitly the traversable wormhole solution and the teleportee states, we present a complete bulk picture of the teleportation in the context of ER=EPR. The traversability of the wormhole is not lost to the leading order of the deformation parameter. We also consider solutions where the teleportee meets the matter thrown from the other side during teleportation, in accordance with the assertion that the bulk wormhole is experimentally observable.
