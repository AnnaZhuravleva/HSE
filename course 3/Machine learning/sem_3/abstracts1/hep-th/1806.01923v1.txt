In this paper, we study a peculiar model for the scalar field. We add the cuscuton term in a standard model and investigate how this inclusion modifies the usual behavior of kinks. We find the first order equations and calculate the energy density and the total energy of the system. Also, we investigate the linear stability of the model, which is governed by a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation that can be transformed in an equation of the Shcr\"odinger type. The model is also investigated in the braneworld scenario, where a first order formalism is also obtained and the linear stability is investigated.
