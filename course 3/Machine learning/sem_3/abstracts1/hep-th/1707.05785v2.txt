M5-branes on an ADE singularity are described by certain six-dimensional "conformal matter" superconformal field theories. Their Higgs moduli spaces contain information about various dynamical processes for the M5s; however, they are not directly accessible due to the lack of a Lagrangian formulation. Using anomaly matching, we compute their dimensions. The result implies that M5 fractions can recombine in several different ways, where the M5s are leaving behind frozen versions of the singularity. The anomaly polynomial gives hints about the nature of the freezing. We also check the Higgs dimension formula by comparing it with various existing conjectures for the CFTs one obtains by torus compactifications down to four and three dimensions. Aided by our results, we also extend those conjectures to compactifications of theories not previously considered. These involve class S theories with twisted punctures in four dimensions, and affine-Dynkin-shaped quivers in three dimensions.
