It is shown that there is a universal gravitational memory effect measurable by inertial detectors in even spacetime dimensions $d\geq 4$. The effect falls off at large radius $r$ as $r^{3-d}$. Moreover this memory effect sits at one corner of an infrared triangle with the other two corners occupied by Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetries.
