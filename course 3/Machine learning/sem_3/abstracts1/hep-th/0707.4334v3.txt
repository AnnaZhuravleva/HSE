We study cosmological solutions in the low-energy effective heterotic string theory, which is the Einstein gravity with Gauss-Bonnet term and the dilaton. We show that the field equations are cast into an autonomous system for flat internal and external spaces, and derive all the fixed points in the system. We also examine the time evolution of the solutions and whether the solutions can give (transient) accelerated expansion of our four-dimensional space in the Einstein frame.
