A supergravity extension of the $(R+R^2)$ gravity with the additional (Born-Infeld) structure of a massive vector multiplet gives rise to the specific $F(R)$ gravity, whose structure is investigated in detail. The massive vector multiplet has inflaton (scalaron), goldstino and a massive vector field as its field components. The model describes Starobinsky inflation and allows us to extrapolate the $F(R)$ function beyond the inflationary scale (up to Planck scale). We observe some differences versus the $(R+R^2)$ gravity, and several breaking patterns of the well known correspondence between the $F(R)$ gravity and the scalar-tensor gravity.
