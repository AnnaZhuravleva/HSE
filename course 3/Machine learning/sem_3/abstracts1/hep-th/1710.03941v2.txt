We calculate the Adler $D$-function for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD in the three-loop approximation using the higher covariant derivative regularization and the NSVZ-like subtraction scheme. The recently formulated all-order relation between the Adler function and the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields defined in terms of the bare coupling constant is first considered and generalized to the case of an arbitrary representation for the chiral matter superfields. The correctness of this all-order relation is explicitly verified at the three-loop level. The special renormalization scheme in which this all-order relation remains valid for the $D$-function and the anomalous dimension defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant is constructed in the case of using the higher derivative regularization. The analytic expression for the Adler function for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD is found in this scheme to the order $O(\alpha_s^2)$. The problem of scheme-dependence of the $D$-function and the NSVZ-like equation is briefly discussed.
