In this note we explore the possible marginal deformations of general (0,2) non-linear sigma-models, which arise as descriptions of the weakly-coupled (large radius) limits of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}= 1$ compactifications of the heterotic string, to lowest order in $\alpha'$ and first order in conformal perturbation theory. The results shed light from the world-sheet perspective on the classical moduli space of such compactifications. This is a contribution to the proceedings of String-Math 2012.
