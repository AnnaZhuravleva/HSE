We define a new construct in quantum field theory - the causal density matrix - obtained from the singularity structure of correlators of local operators. This object provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum field theory state to have a holographic semiclassical dual causal geometry. By exploiting the causal density matrix, we find that these dual causal geometries quite generally (even away from AdS/CFT) exhibit features of quantum error correction. Within AdS/CFT, we argue that the "reduced" causal density matrix is the natural dual to the causal wedge. Our formalism is very well-suited to generalizations of holography beyond AdS/CFT or even gravity/QFT.
