We study the butterfly effect by considering shock wave solutions near the horizon of the AdS black brane in some of 3-dimensional Gravity models including; 3D Einstein Gravity, Minimal Massive 3D Gravity, New Massive Gravity, Generalized Massive Gravity, Born-Infeld 3D Gravity and New Bi-Gravity. We calculate the butterfly velocities of these models and also we consider the critical points and different limits in some of these models. By studying the butterfly effect in the Generalized Massive Gravity, we observe a correspondence between the butterfly velocities and right-left moving degrees of freedom or the central charges of the dual 2D Conformal Field Theories.
