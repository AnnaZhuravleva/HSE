We expand the holographic studies of momentum relaxation to include non-relativistic scaling symmetries in the ultraviolet. We do so by constructing black branes with Lifshitz asymptotics dressed with axions which explicitly depend on the boundary directions. Such configurations arise as analytic solutions of the Einstein-Proca theory coupled to massless scalar fields in arbitrary dimensions. Studying linear perturbations on these backgrounds, we conclude that there is a dual Ward identity which accounts for the dissipation of momentum in the system. In addition, we numerically compute the frequency dependent thermal conductivity of the branes and verify that its DC limit is finite.
