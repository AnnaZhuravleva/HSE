Conical brane singularities in six-dimensional flux compactification models can be resolved by introducing cylindrical codimension-one branes with regular caps instead of 3-branes (a la Kaluza-Klein braneworlds with fluxes). In this paper, we consider such a regularized braneworld with axial symmetry in six-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory. We derive a low energy effective theory on the regularized brane by employing the gradient expansion approach, and show that standard four-dimensional Einstein gravity is recovered at low energies. Our effective equations extend to the nonlinear gravity regime, implying that conventional cosmology can be reproduced in the regularized braneworld.
