The excitations referred to as oscillons are long-lived time-dependent field configurations which emerge dynamically from non-linear field theories. Such long-lived solutions are of interest in applications that include systems of Condensed Matter Physics, the Standard Model of Particle Physics, Lorentz-symmetry violating scenarios and Cosmology. In this work, we show how oscillons may be accommodated in a supersymmetric scenario. We adopt as our framework simple ($\mathcal{N}=1$) supersymmetry in $D=1+1$ dimensions. We focus on the bosonic sector with oscillon configurations and their (classical) effects on the corresponding fermionic modes, (supersymmetric) partners of the oscillons. The particular model we adopt to pursue our investigation displays cubic self-interactions in the scalar sector.
