We investigate the properties of holographic heat engines with an uncharged accelerating non-rotating AdS black hole as the working substance in a benchmarking scheme. We find that the efficiencies of the black hole heat engines can be influenced by both the size of the benchmark circular cycle and the cosmic string tension as a thermodynamic variable. In general, the efficiency can be increased by enlarging the cycle, but is still constrained by a universal bound $2\pi/(\pi+4)$ as expected. A cross-comparison of the efficiencies of the accelerating black hole heat engines and Schwarzschild-AdS black hole heat engines suggests that the acceleration also increases the efficiency although the amount of increase is not remarkable.
