We examine some inflationary models based on modifications of gravity in the light of Planck 2015 data, such as the generalised Chaplygin inspired inflation, models based in $N=1$ supergravity and braneworld scenarios. We also show that, conversely, potentials with a very flat plateau yield a primordial spectrum similar to that of the Starobinsky model with no need to modify general relativity.
