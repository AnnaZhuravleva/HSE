In this work we study a homogeneous and quasilocal Thermodynamics associated to the Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black hole. The usual thermodynamic description is extended within a Hamiltonian approach with the introduction of the cosmological constant in the thermodynamic phase space. The treatment presented is consistent in as much as it respects the laws of black hole Thermodynamics and accepts the introduction of any thermodynamic potential. We are able to construct new equations of state that characterize the Thermodynamics. Novel phenomena can be expected from the proposed setup.
