We transform superstring scattering amplitudes into the correlation functions of primary conformal fields on two-dimensional celestial sphere. The points on celestial sphere are associated to the asymptotic directions of (light-like) momenta of external particles, with the Lorentz group realized as the SL(2,C) conformal symmetry of the sphere. The energies are dualized through Mellin transforms into the parameters that determine dimensions of the primaries. We focus on four-point amplitudes involving gauge bosons and gravitons in type I open superstring theory and in closed heterotic superstring theory at the tree-level.
