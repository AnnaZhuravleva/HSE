We revisit the generalized connection of Double Field Theory. We implement a procedure that allow us to re-write the Double Field Theory equations of motion in terms of geometric quantities (like generalized torsion and non-metricity tensors) based on other connections rather than the usual generalized Levi-Civita connection and the generalized Riemann curvature. We define a generalized contorsion tensor and obtain, as a particular case, the Teleparallel equivalent of Double Field Theory. To do this, we first need to revisit generic connections in standard geometry written in terms of first-order derivatives of the vielbein in order to obtain equivalent theories to Einstein Gravity (like for instance the Teleparallel Gravity case). The results are then easily extrapolated to DFT. This work supersedes arXiv:1706.09008
