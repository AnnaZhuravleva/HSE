We study multi spin semiclassical strings in $AdS_3\times S^3 \times T^4$ background supported by a mixture of Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) and Ramond-Ramond (R-R) fluxes. This `mixed flux' background has been recently proved to be classically integrable. We start with a particular rigidly spinning fundamental string in $AdS_3\times S^1$ coupled to the NS-NS flux and classify the possible profiles. We also find out how the scaling relation among the energy and angular momenta of such a string changes due to presence of these fluxes. We emphasize on pure NS-NS flux case and discuss the fate of such solutions in that limit.
