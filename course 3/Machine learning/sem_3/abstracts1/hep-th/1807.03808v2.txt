We propose a new bound on the average null energy along a finite portion of a null geodesic. We believe our bound is valid on scales small compared to the radius of curvature in any quantum field theory that is consistently coupled to gravity. If correct, our bound implies that regions of negative energy density are never strongly gravitating, and that isolated regions of negative energy are forbidden.
