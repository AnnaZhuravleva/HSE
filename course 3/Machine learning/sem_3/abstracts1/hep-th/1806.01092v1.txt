We investigate the holographic quantum entanglement of a visible universe in an inflationary cosmology. To do so, we consider an AdS space with a dS boundary which represents an expanding space in time. In an inflationary cosmology, there exists a natural entangling surface called a cosmic event horizon which divides a universe into visible and invisible parts. In this model, cosmic event horizon monotonically decreases and approaches a constant value proportional to the inverse of Hubble constant. We show that the quantum entanglement between the visible and invisible universes divided by cosmic event horizon decreases monotonically in time. After an infinite time evolution, it finally approaches a constant value which is proportional to the inverse square of the Hubble constant for a four-dimensional dS space.
