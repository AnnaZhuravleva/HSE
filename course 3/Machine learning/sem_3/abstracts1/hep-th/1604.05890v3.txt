Constructing M2-brane and its boundary conditions from D2-brane and the related boundary conditions and vice versa has been possible in our recent work by using 3-Lie bialgebra for BLG model with N = 8 supersymmetry. This could be generalized for BL model with N = 6 by the concept of the 3-Leibniz bialgebra. The 3-Lie bialgebra is an especial case of 3-Leibniz bialgebra, then more comprehensive information will be obtained in this work. Consequently, according to the correspondence of these 3-Leibniz bialgebras with Lie bialgebras, we reduce to D2-brane such that with some restrictions on the gauge field this D2-brane is related to the bosonic sector of an N = (4,4) WZW model equipped with one 2-cocycle in its Lie bialgebra structure. Moreover, the Basu-Harvey equation which is found by considering boundary conditions for BL model containing Leibniz bialgebra structure is reduced to Nahm equation and vice versa using this correspondence.
