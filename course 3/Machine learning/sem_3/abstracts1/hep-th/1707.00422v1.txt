We derive bounds on the deformation parameter of the $\kappa$-spacetime by analyzing the effect of non-commutativity on astrophysical model. We study compact stars, taken to be degenerate Fermi gas, in non-commutative spacetime. Using tools of statistical mechanics, we derive the degeneracy pressure of the compact star in $\kappa$-spacetime and from the hydrostatic equilibrium conditions we obtain a bound on the deformation parameter. We independently derive this bound using generalized uncertainty principle, which is a characteristic feature of quantum gravity approaches, strengthening the bound obtained.
