We investigate the Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole solution obtained from Pleba{\'n}ski -Demia{\'n}ski solutions with several assumptions. The origin of the microscopic entropy of this black hole is studied using the conjectured Kerr/CFT correspondence which is first proposed for Kerr extremal black holes. The isometry of the near-horizon extremal Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole shows that the asymptotic symmetry group may be applied to compute the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Furthermore, by assuming Frolov-Thorne vacuum, the temperatures can be obtained which then using Cardy formula, the microscopic entropy is obtained and agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also assume the case when the lowest eigenvalue of the conformal operator $ L_0 $ is non-zero to find the logarithmic correction of the entropy of NHEKNUT black hole. At the limit $ J \rightarrow 0 $, the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-NUT solution is produced and by adding the fibered coordinate we find the 5D solution. The second dual CFT is used to find the entropy and it still produces the area law of 5D black hole solution. So, the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-NUT solution is also holographically dual to the CFT.
