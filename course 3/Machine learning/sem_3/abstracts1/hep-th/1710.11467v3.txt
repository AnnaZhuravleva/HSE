We systematically develop the metric aspects of nonassociative differential geometry tailored to the parabolic phase space model of constant locally non-geometric closed string vacua, and use it to construct preliminary steps towards a nonassociative theory of gravity on spacetime. We obtain explicit expressions for the torsion, curvature, Ricci tensor and Levi-Civita connection in nonassociative Riemannian geometry on phase space, and write down Einstein field equations. We apply this formalism to construct R-flux corrections to the Ricci tensor on spacetime, and comment on the potential implications of these structures in non-geometric string theory and double field theory.
