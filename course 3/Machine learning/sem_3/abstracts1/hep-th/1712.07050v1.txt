We present the Mathematica package MultivariateResidues, which allows for the efficient evaluation of multivariate residues based on methods from computational algebraic geometry. Multivariate residues appear in several contexts of scattering amplitude computations. Examples include applications to the extraction of master integral coefficients from maximal unitarity cuts, the construction of canonical bases of loop integrals and the construction of tree amplitudes from scattering equations.
