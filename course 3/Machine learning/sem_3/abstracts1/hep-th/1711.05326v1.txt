We propose an integrability setup for the computation of correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators at any value of the 't Hooft coupling and at any order in the large Nc 't Hooft expansion in N = 4 SYM theory. In this multi-step proposal, one polygonizes the string worldsheet in all possible ways, hexagonalizes all resulting polygons, and sprinkles mirror particles over all hexagon junctions to obtain the full correlator. We test our integrability-based conjecture against a non-planar four-point correlator of large half-BPS operators at one and two loops.
