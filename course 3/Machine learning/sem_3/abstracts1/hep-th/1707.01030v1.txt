Hydrodynamics is a universal effective theory describing relaxation of quantum field theories towards equilibrium. Massive QFTs in de Sitter spacetime are never at equilibrium. We use holographic gauge theory/gravity correspondence to describe relaxation of a QFT to its Bunch-Davies vacuum - an attractor of its late-time dynamics. Specifically, we compute the analogue of the quasinormal modes describing the relaxation of a holographic toy model QFT in de Sitter.
