We reconsider the renormalizability of topological Yang-Mills field theories in (anti-)self-dual Landau gauges. By employing algebraic renormalization techniques we show that there is only one independent renormalization. Moreover, due to the rich set of Ward identities, we are able to obtain some important exact features of the (connected and one-particle irreducible) two-point functions. Specifically, we show that all two-point functions are tree-level exact.
