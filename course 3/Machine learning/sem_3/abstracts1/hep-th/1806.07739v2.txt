The linear-$T$ resistivity is one of the characteristic and universal properties of strange metals. There have been many progress in understanding it from holographic perspective (gauge/gravity duality). In most holographic models, the linear-$T$ resistivity is explained by the property of the infrared geometry and valid at low temperature limit. On the other hand, experimentally, the linear-$T$ resistivity is observed in a large range of temperatures, up to room temperature. By using holographic models related to the Gubser-Rocha model, we investigate how much the linear-$T$ resistivity is robust at higher temperature above the superconducting phase transition temperature. We find that strong momentum relaxation plays an important role to have a robust linear-$T$ resistivity up to high temperature.
