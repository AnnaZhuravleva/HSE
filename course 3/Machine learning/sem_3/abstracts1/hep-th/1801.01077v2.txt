This work deals with the presence of analytical vortex configurations in generalized models of the Maxwell-Higgs type in the three-dimensional spacetime. We implement a procedure that allows to decouple the first order equations, which we use to solve the model analytically. The approach is exemplified with three distinct models that show the robustness of the construction. In the third model, one finds analytical solutions that exhibit interesting compact vortex behavior.
