The plane-wave limit of ${\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3 \times {\rm S}^3 \times {\rm S}^1$ is analysed for generic null-geodesics that are not necessarily BPS. For the case of pure NS-NS flux it is shown how the resulting spectrum can be reproduced as a suitable limit of the world-sheet description in terms of WZW models. Since supersymmetry is broken, most of the degeneracies are lifted, and thus the identification of states is quite unambiguous.
