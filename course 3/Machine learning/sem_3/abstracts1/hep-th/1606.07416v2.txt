We investigate the classical Brownian motion of a particle in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) space. Using the standard NC algebra embodied by the sympletic Weyl-Moyal formalism we find that noncommutativity induces a non-vanishing correlation between both coordinates at different times. The effect stands out as a signature of spatial noncommutativity and thus could offer a way to experimentally detect the phenomena. We further discuss some limiting scenarios and the trade-off between the scale imposed by the NC structure and the parameters of the Brownian motion itself.
