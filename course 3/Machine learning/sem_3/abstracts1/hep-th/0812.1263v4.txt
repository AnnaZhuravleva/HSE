Casimir energy is calculated for the 5D electromagnetism and 5D scalar theory in the {\it warped} geometry. It is compared with the flat case(arXiv:0801.3064). A new regularization, called {\it sphere lattice regularization}, is taken. In the integration over the 5D space, we introduce two boundary curves (IR-surface and UV-surface) based on the {\it minimal area principle}. It is a {\it direct} realization of the geometrical approach to the {\it renormalization group}. The regularized configuration is {\it closed-string like}. We do {\it not} take the KK-expansion approach. Instead, the position/momentum propagator is exploited, combined with the {\it heat-kernel method}. All expressions are closed-form (not KK-expanded form). The {\it generalized} P/M propagators are introduced. We numerically evaluate $\La$(4D UV-cutoff), $\om$(5D bulk curvature, warp parameter) and $T$(extra space IR parameter) dependence of the Casimir energy. We present two {\it new ideas} in order to define the 5D QFT: 1) the summation (integral) region over the 5D space is {\it restricted} by two minimal surfaces (IR-surface, UV-surface) ; or 2) we introduce a {\it weight function} and require the dominant contribution is given by the {\it minimal surface}. Based on these, 5D Casimir energy is {\it finitely} obtained after the {\it proper renormalization procedure.} The {\it warp parameter} $\om$ suffers from the {\it renormalization effect}. We examine the meaning of the weight function and reach a {\it new definition} of the Casimir energy where {\it the 4D momenta(or coordinates) are quantized} with the extra coordinate as the Euclidean time (inverse temperature). We comment on the cosmological constant term and present an answer to the problem at the end. Dirac's large number naturally appears.
