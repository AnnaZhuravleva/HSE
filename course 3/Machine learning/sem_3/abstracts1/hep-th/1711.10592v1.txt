These notes present an introduction to $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and its possible inflationary precursor, with an emphasis on some of the ways effective field theories are used in its analysis. The intended audience are graduate students in particle physics, such as attended the lectures (prepared for the Les Houches Summer School, Effective Field Theory in Particle Physics and Cosmology, July 2017).
