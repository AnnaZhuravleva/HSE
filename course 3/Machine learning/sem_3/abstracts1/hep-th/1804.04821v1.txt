The near-horizon geometry of evaporation black holes is determined according to the semi-classical Einstein equation. We consider spherically symmetric configurations in which the collapsing star has already collapsed below the Schwarzschild radius. The back-reaction of the vacuum energy-momentum, including Hawking radiation, is taken into account. The vacuum energy-momentum plays a crucial role in a small neighborhood of the apparent horizon, as it appears at the leading order in the semi-classical Einstein equation. Our study is focused on the time-dependent geometry in this region.
