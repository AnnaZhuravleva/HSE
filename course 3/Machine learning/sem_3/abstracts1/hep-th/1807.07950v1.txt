Bulk viscosity is an important transport coefficient that exists in the hydrodynamical limit only when the underlying theory is non-conformal. One example being thermal QCD with large number of colors. We study bulk viscosity in such a theory at low energies and at weak and strong 't Hooft couplings when the temperature is above the deconfinement temperature. The weak coupling analysis is based on Boltzmann equation from kinetic theory whereas the strong coupling analysis uses non-conformal holographic techniques from string and M-theories. Using these, many properties associated with bulk viscosity may be explicitly derived. This is a shortened companion paper that summarizes some of the results of our longer paper arXiv:1807.04713.
