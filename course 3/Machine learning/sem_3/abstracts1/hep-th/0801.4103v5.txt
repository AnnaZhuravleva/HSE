We argue that Einstein gravity coupled to a Born-Infeld theory provides an attractive candidate to represent dark matter and dark energy. For cosmological models, the Born-Infeld field has an equation of state which interpolates between matter, w=0 (small times), and a cosmological constant w=-1 (large times). On galactic scales, the Born-Infeld field predicts asymptotically flat rotation curves.
