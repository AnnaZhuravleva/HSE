We study the world volume Hawking temperature of all type IIB rotating probe Dp-branes, dual to the temperature of different flavors at finite R-charge, in the Ben Ami-Kuperstein-Sonnenschein holographic models including the effects of spontaneous breakdown of the conformal and chiral flavor symmetry. The model embeds type IIB probe flavor Dp-branes into the Klebanov-Witten gravity dual of conformal gauge theory, with the embedding parameter, given by the minimal radial extension of the probes, setting the IR scale of conformal and chiral flavor symmetry breakdown. We show that when the minimal extension is positive definite and additional spin is switched on, the induced world volume metrics of only certain type IIB probe branes admit thermal horizons and Hawking temperatures despite the absence of black holes in the bulk. We find that the world volume black hole nucleation is non-trivial and depends on the world volume dimension and topology of the non-trivial internal cycle wrapped by the probe. We find, in addition, that by varying the minimal extension of the probe, large hierarchies of temperature scales get produced, with the temperature behavior varying dramatically, depending on the type of probe. We also derive the energy-stress tensor of the thermal probes and study their backreaction and energy dissipation. We show that at the IR scale the backreaction is non-negligible and find the energy can flow from the probes to the bulk, dual to the energy dissipation from the flavor sectors into the gauge theory.
