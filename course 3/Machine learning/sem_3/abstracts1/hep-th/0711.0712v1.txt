We investigate the link between the warp function and the potential in DBI cosmologies in connection with the possibility they represent power-law solutions. A prescription is given to take advantage of the known result that given a warp factor there is always a choice of potential resulting in a constant ratio between pressure and energy density. The method is illustrated with examples with interesting models for either the warp factor or the potential. We complete this investigation by giving a recipe to exploit symmetries in order to generate new solutions from existing ones; this method can be applied, for instance, to the power-law cosmologies obtained using our prescription.
