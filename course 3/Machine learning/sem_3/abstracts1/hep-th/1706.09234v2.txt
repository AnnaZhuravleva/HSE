We discuss similarity between oscillons and oscillational mode in perturbed $\phi^4$. For small depths of the perturbing potential it is difficult to distinguish between oscillons and the mode in moderately long time evolution, moreover one can transform one into the other by adiabatically switching on and off the potential. Basins of attraction are presented in the parameter space describing the potential and initial conditions.
