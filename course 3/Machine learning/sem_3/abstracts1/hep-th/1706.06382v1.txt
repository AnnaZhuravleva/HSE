Due to integrability, baryon-baryon scattering in the massless Gross-Neveu model at large N features only forward elastic scattering. A bare mass term breaks integrability and is therefore expected to induce backward elastic scattering as well as inelastic reactions. We confirm these expectations by a study of baryon-baryon scattering in the massive Gross-Neveu model near the non-relativistic limit. This restriction enables us to solve the time-dependent Hartree-Fock equations with controlled approximations, using a combination of analytical methods from an effective field theory and the numerical solution of partial differential equations.
