We present a new family of charged black holes with hyperscaling violating asymptotics and non-trivial horizon topology, for arbitrary Lifshitz exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation parameter $\theta$. They are $(d+2)$-dimensional analytic solutions to a generalized Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory with an additional vector field supporting spherical or hyperbolic horizons. The hyperbolic solutions are only consistent with the null energy condition for $1 \le z < 2$ and $\theta = d(z-1)$, which explains why they are absent in the pure Lifshitz case. We further study the (extended) thermodynamics of these black holes, both in the fixed charge and fixed potential ensemble, and find that phase transitions only occur for spherical black holes with $1 \le z \le 2$ and any $\theta$.
