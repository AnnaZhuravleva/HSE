Killing spinor identities relate components of equations of motion to each other for supersymmetric backgrounds. The only input required is the field content and the supersymmetry transformations of the fields, as long as an on-shell supersymmetrization of the action without additional fields exists. If we consider off-shell supersymmetry it is clear that the same relations will occur between components of the equations of motion independently of the specific action considered, in particular the Killing spinor identities can be derived for arbitrary, including higher derivative, supergravities, with a specified matter content. We give the Killing spinor identities for five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ ungauged supergravities coupled to Abelian vector multiplets, and then using spinorial geometry techniques so that we have explicit representatives for the spinors, we discuss the particular case of the time-like class of solutions to theories with perturbative corrections at the four derivative level. We also discuss the maximally supersymmetric solutions in the general off-shell case.
