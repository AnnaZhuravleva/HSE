In QCD both the quark and ghost propagators are important for governing the non-perturbative dynamics of the theory. It turns out that the dynamical properties of the quark and ghost fields impose non-perturbative constraints on the analytic structure of these propagators. In this work we explicitly derive these constraints, and in doing so we establish that the corresponding spectral densities include components which are multiples of discrete mass terms, and that the propagators are permitted to contain singular terms involving derivatives of $\delta(p)$, a feature which is particularly relevant in the context of confinement.
