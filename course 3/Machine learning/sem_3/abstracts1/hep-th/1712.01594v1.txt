Spin raising and lowering operators for massless field equations constructed from twistor spinors are considered. Solutions of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ massless Rarita-Schwinger equation from source-free Maxwell fields and twistor spinors are constructed. Constraints to construct spin raising and lowering operators for Rarita-Schwinger fields are found. Symmetry operators for Rarita-Schwinger fields via twistor spinors are obtained.
