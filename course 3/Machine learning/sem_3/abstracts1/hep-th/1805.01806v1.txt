We use holography to study finite-temperature deformations of RG flows that have exotic properties from an RG viewpoint. The holographic model consists of five-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field with a potential. Each negative extrema of the potential defines a dual conformal field theory. We find all the black brane solutions on the gravity side and use them to construct the thermal phase diagrams of the dual theories. We find an intricate phase structure that reflects and extends the exotic properties at zero temperature.
