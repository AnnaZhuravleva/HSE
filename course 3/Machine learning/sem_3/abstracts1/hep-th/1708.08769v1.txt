We study the vacuum condensate characterizing many physical phenomena. We show that such a condensate may leads to non-trivial components of the dark energy and of the dark matter and may induces the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, in a supersymmetric context. In particular, we consider the condensate induced by thermal states, fields in curved space-time and mixed particles.
