Recent advancement of rainbow tensor models based on their superintegrability (manifesting itself as the existence of an explicit expression for a generic Gaussian correlator) has allowed us to bypass the long-standing problem seen as the lack of eigenvalue/determinant representation needed to establish the KP/Toda integrability. As the mandatory next step, we discuss in this paper how to provide an adequate designation to each of the connected gauge-invariant operators that form a double coset, which is required to cleverly formulate a tree-algebra generalization of the Virasoro constraints. This problem goes beyond the enumeration problem per se tied to the permutation group, forcing us to introduce a few gauge fixing procedures to the coset. We point out that the permutation-based labeling, which has proven to be relevant for the Gaussian averages is, via interesting complexity, related to the one based on the keystone trees, whose algebra will provide the tensor counterpart of the Virasoro algebra for matrix models. Moreover, our simple analysis reveals the existence of nontrivial kernels and co-kernels for the cut operation and for the join operation respectively that prevent a straightforward construction of the non-perturbative RG-complete partition function and the identification of truly independent time variables. We demonstrate these problems by the simplest non-trivial Aristotelian RGB model with one complex rank-3 tensor, studying its ring of gauge-invariant operators, generated by the keystone triple with the help of four operations: addition, multiplication, cut and join.
