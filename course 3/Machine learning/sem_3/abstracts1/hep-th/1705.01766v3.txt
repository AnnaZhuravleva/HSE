We study the thermoelectric DC conductivities of Horndeski holographic models with momentum dissipation. We compute the butterfly velocity $v_B$ and we discuss the existence of universal bounds on charge and energy diffusivities in the incoherent limit related to quantum chaos. We find that the Horndeski coupling represents a subleading contribution to the thermoelectric conductivities in the incoherent limit and therefore it does not affect any of the proposed bounds.
