In this technical note we introduce a manifestly gauge-invariant and supersymmetric procedure to regularize and renormalize one-loop divergences of chiral multiplets in two-dimensional N=(2,2) theories in curved spacetime. We apply the method, a version of Pauli-Villars regularization, to known examples of supersymmetric localization and demonstrate that the partition functions are renormalized. An accompanying ancillary file, a Mathematica notebook, implements the relevant supergravity transformations.
