In this work, we compute one-loop planar five-point functions in $\mathcal{N}$=4 super-Yang-Mills using integrability. As in the previous work, we decompose the correlation functions into hexagon form factors and glue them using the weight factors which depend on the cross ratios. The main new ingredient in the computation, as compared to the four-point functions studied in the previous paper, is the two-particle mirror contribution. We develop techniques to evaluate it and find agreement with the perturbative results in all the cases we analyzed. In addition, we consider next-to-extremal four-point functions, which are known to be protected, and show that the sum of one-particle and two-particle contributions at one loop adds up to zero as expected. The tools developed in this work would be useful for computing higher-particle contributions which would be relevant for more complicated quantities such as higher-loop corrections and non-planar correlators.
