We study the effects of quenched one-dimensional disorder on the holographic Weyl semimetal quantum phase transition (QPT), with a particular focus on the quantum critical region. We observe the smearing of the sharp QPT linked to the appearance of rare regions at the horizon where locally the order parameter is non-zero. We discuss the role of the disorder correlation and we compare our results to expectations from condensed matter theory at weak coupling. We analyze also the interplay of finite temperature and disorder. Within the quantum critical region we find indications for the presence of log-oscillatory structures in the order parameter hinting at the existence of an IR fixed point with discrete scale invariance.
