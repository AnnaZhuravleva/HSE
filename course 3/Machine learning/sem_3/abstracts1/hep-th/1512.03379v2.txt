We propose new gauge invariant actions for open NS, heterotic NS, and closed NS-NS superstring field theories. They are based on the large Hilbert space, and have Wess-Zumino-Witten-like expressions which are the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-reversed versions of the conventional WZW-like actions. On the basis of the procedure proposed in arXiv:1505.01659, we show that our new WZW-like actions are completely equivalent to $A_{\infty }/L_{\infty }$ actions proposed in arXiv:1403.0940 respectively.
