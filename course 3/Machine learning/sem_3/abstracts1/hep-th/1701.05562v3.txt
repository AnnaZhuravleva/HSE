A brane construction of an integrable lattice model is proposed. The model is composed of Belavin's R-matrix, Felder's dynamical R-matrix, the Bazhanov-Sergeev-Derkachov-Spiridonov R-operator and some intertwining operators. This construction implies that a family of surface defects act on supersymmetric indices of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetric field theories as transfer matrices related to elliptic quantum groups.
