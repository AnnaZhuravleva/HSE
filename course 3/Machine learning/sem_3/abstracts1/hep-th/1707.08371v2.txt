A multi-parameter integrable deformation of the principal chiral model is presented. The Yang-Baxter and bi-Yang-Baxter sigma-models, the principal chiral model plus a Wess-Zumino term and the TsT transformation of the principal chiral model are all recovered when the appropriate deformation parameters vanish. When the Lie group is SU(2), we show that this four-parameter integrable deformation of the SU(2) principal chiral model corresponds to the Lukyanov model.
