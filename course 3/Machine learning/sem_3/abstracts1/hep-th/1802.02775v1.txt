In a holographic braneworld universe a cosmological fluid occupies a 3+1 dimensional brane located at the boundary of the asymptotic AdS$_5$ bulk. The AdS/CFT correspondence and the second Randall-Sundrum model are combined to establish a relationship between the RSII braneworld cosmology and the boundary metric induced by the time dependent bulk geometry. Some physically interesting scenarios are discussed in the framework of the Friedmann Robertson Walker cosmology involving the RSII and holographic braneworlds.
