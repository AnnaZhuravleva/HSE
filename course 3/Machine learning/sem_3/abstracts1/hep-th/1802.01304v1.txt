Methods of Hamiltonian dynamics are applied to study the geodesic flow on the resolved conifolds over Sasaki-Einstein space $T^{1,1}$. We construct explicitly the constants of motion and prove complete integrability of geodesics in the five-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space $T^{1,1}$ and its Calabi-Yau metric cone. The singularity at the apex of the metric cone can be smoothed out in two different ways. Using the small resolution the geodesic motion on the resolved conifold remains completely integrable. Instead, in the case of the deformation of the conifold the complete integrability is lost.
