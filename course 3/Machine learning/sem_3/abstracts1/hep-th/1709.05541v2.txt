We consider a gauged $CP(2)$ theory in the presence of the Chern-Simons action, focusing our attention on those time-independent solutions possessing radial symmetry. In this context, we develop a coherent first-order framework via the Bogomol'nyi prescription, from which we obtain the corresponding energy lower-bound and the first-order equations the model supports. We use these expressions to introduce effective BPS scenarios, solving the resulting first-order equations by means of the finite-difference scheme, this way attaining genuine field solutions engendering topological configurations. We depict the new profiles, commenting on the main properties they engender.
