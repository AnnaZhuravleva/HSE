We investigate the phase diagram of quantum gravity with a vertex expansion about constantly-curved backgrounds. The graviton two- and three-point function are evaluated with a spectral sum on a sphere. We obtain, for the first time, curvature-dependent UV fixed point functions of the dynamical fluctuation couplings $g^*(R)$, $\mu^*(R)$, and $\lambda_3^*(R)$, and the background $f(R)$-potential. Based on these fixed point functions we compute solutions to the quantum and the background equation of motion with and without Standard Model matter. We have checked that the solutions are robust against changes of the truncation.
