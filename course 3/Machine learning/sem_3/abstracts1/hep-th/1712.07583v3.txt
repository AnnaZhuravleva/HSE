Applying the "Complexity=Action" conjecture, we study the holographic complexity close to crossover/phase transition in a holographic QCD model proposed by Gubser et al. This model can realize three types of phase transition, crossover or first and second order, depending on the parameters of the dilaton potential. The re-scaled late-time growth rate of holographic complexity density for the three cases is calculated. Our results show that it experiences a fast drop/jump close to the critical point while approaching constants far beyond the critical temperature. Moreover, close to the critical temperature, it shows a behavior characterizing the type of the transition. These features suggest that the growth rate of the holographic complexity may be used as a good parameter to characterize the phase transition. The Lloyd's bound is always satisfied for the cases we considered but only saturated for the conformal case.
