We continue to study the BPS gauge five-brane solutions of codimension two in ten-dimensional heterotic supergravity. The geometry including the dilaton and the NS-NS $B$-field are sourced from the monopole chain in $\mathbb{R}^2 \times S^1$. We find that the geometry is asymptotically Ricci flat and the dilaton is no longer imaginary valued. These properties are contrasted with the smeared counterpart discussed in our previous paper. We perform the T-duality transformations of the solution and find that it never results in a non-geometric object.
