We consider relativistic hydrodynamics in the limit where the number of spatial dimensions is very large. We show that under certain restrictions, the resulting equations of motion simplify significantly. Holographic theories in a large number of dimensions satisfy the aforementioned restrictions and their dynamics are captured by hydrodynamics with a naturally truncated derivative expansion. Using analytic and numerical techniques we analyze two and three-dimensional turbulent flow of such fluids in various regimes and its relation to geometric data.
