We show how to generalize the previous result of the monopole condensation in SU(2) QCD to SU(3) QCD. We present the gauge independent Weyl symmetric Abelian decomposition of the SU(3) QCD which decomposes the gluons to the color neutral neurons and the colored chromons. The decomposition allows us to separate the gauge invariant and parity conserving monopole background gauge independently, and reduces the non-Abelian gauge symmetry to a discrete color reflection symmetry which is easier to handle. With this we obtain the infra-red finite and gauge invariant integral expression of the one-loop effective action which is Weyl symmetric in three SU(2) subgroups. Integrating it gauge invariantly imposing the color reflection invariance we obtain the SU(3) QCD effective potential which generates the stable monopole condensation and the mass gap. We discuss the physical implications of our result.
