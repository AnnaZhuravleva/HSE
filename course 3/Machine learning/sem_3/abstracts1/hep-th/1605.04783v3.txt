We explore the modification of the entropic formulation of uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics which measures the incompatibility of measurements in terms of Shannon entropy. The deformation in question is the type so called generalized uncertainty principle that is motivated by thought experiments in quantum gravity and string theory and is characterized by a parameter of Planck scale. The corrections are evaluated for small deformation parameters by use of the Gaussian wave function and numerical calculation. As the generalized uncertainty principle has proven to be useful in the study of the quantum nature of black holes, this study would be a step toward introducing an information theory viewpoint to black hole physics.
