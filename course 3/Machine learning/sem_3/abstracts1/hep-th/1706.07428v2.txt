We show that Schwarzschild black hole metrics are, asymptotically, Weyl equivalent to $AdS_2 \times S^{D-2}$ where the spherical factor is the horizon. The holographic entanglement entropy of $AdS_2$ exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild black hole entropy which implies that black hole degrees of freedom live at asymptotic infinity. In generalized theories of gravity, the same procedure reproduces Wald entropy.
