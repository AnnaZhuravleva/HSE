In this paper, we will consider a cosmological model with two topological transitions of the space. The smooth 4-dimensional spacetime of the model admits topological transitions of its 3-dimensional slices. The whole approach is inspired by a class of exotic smoothness structure on $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$. In particular, this class of smoothness structures induces two topological transitions. Then, we are able to calculate the energy scales as associated to these topological transitions. For the first transition we will get the value of the GUT scale and the energy of the second transition is at the electroweak scale. The topology of of the exotic $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$ determines both, the energy of the scales by certain topological invariants, and the existence of the right-handed sterile neutrino. It is the input for the seesaw mechanism. Secondly, based on this model, we are able to calculate the neutrino masses which are in a very good agreement with experiments. Finally, we will speculate, again based on topology, why there are three generations of neutrinos and an asymmetry between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos.
