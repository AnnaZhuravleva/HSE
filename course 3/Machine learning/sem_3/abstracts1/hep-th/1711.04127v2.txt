We revisit the classical theory of a relativistic massless charged point particle with spin and interacting with an external electromagnetic field. In particular, we give a proper definition of its kinetic energy and its total energy, the latter being conserved when the external field is stationary. We also write the conservation laws for the linear and angular momenta. Finally, we find that the particle's velocity may differ from $c$ as a result of the spin---electromagnetic field interaction, without jeopardizing Lorentz invariance.
