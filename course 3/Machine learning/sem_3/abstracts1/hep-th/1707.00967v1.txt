We study the time evolution of the expectation value of a rectangular Wilson loop in strongly anisotropic time-dependent plasma using gauge-gravity duality. The corresponding gravity theory is given by describing time evolution of a classical string in the Lifshitz-Vaidya background. We show that the expectation value of the Wilson loop oscillates about the value of the static potential with the same parameters after the energy injection is over. We discuss how the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation depend on the parameters of the theory. In particular, by raising the anisotropy parameter, we observe that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation increase.
