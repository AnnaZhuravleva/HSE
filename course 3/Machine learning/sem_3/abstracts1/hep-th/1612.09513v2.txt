The ER=EPR conjecture is proposed to resolve the black hole information paradox without introducing a firewall in the black hole. The conjecture implies that entanglement of the EPR pair, which is thought to be a quantum mechanical effect, can be captured by classical gravity through the ER bridge. Using Bell inequality as a sharp test of entanglement, we study a holographic model with an EPR pair at the boundary and an ER bridge in the bulk by using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. By revealing how Bell inequality is violated by gravity in the bulk, our study sheds light on the entanglement of the original ER=EPR, which, unlike holography, has both ER and EPR living in the same spacetime dimensions.
