In this work, we report on the possibility of occurrence of oscillon configurations in the fourth state of matter. Oscillons are extremely long-lived, time-periodic, spatially-localised scalar field structures. Starting from a scalar field theory in 1+1 space-time dimensions, we find out that small-amplitude oscillons can be obtained in the framework of a $\phi^6$ self-interacting potential. A connection between our results and ideal MHD theory is established. Perspectives for a development of the present work are pointed out.
