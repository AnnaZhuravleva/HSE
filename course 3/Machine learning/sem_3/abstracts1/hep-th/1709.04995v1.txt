We first detail our previous findings for four classes of Standard Model Extensions (SMEs) violating Super-Symmetry (SuSy) and Lorentz Symmetry (LoSy). The classes differ in the parity of the Charge conjugation-Parity-Time reversal (CPT) symmetry and whether considering the impact of photinos on photon propagation. The violations occurring at the very high energies of the early universe show visible traces in the Dispersion Relations (DRs) at our energy scales of present times. For the CPT odd classes ($V_{\mu}$ breaking vector) associated to the Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) model, the DRs show an effective mass of the photon. Arranging the CPT-odd Lagrangian in a non-explicit covariant form, a massive de Broglie-Proca (dBP), but gauge invariant, term arises. The mass, below $10^{-55}$ kg, is proportional to $|\vec V|$, while the group velocity exhibits a classic dBP dependence on the inverse of the frequency squared. For the CPT even classes ($k_{F}$ breaking tensor), the DRs display a massless but subluminal non-Maxwellian behaviour. All DRs display an angular dependence and lack LoSy invariance. We push forward our past analysis showing herein for the odd CPT sector how i) complex frequencies and superluminal speeds may arise in specific conditions; ii) bi- and tri-refringence emerge; for both CPT sectors, iii) the circumstances for which SuSy and LoSy breakings, possibly along with the presence of an external field, lead to the non-conservation of the photon energy-momentum tensor.
