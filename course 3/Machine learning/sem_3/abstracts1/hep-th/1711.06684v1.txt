We study S-duality of Argyres-Douglas theories obtained by compactification of 6d (2,0) theories of ADE type on a sphere with irregular punctures. The weakly coupled descriptions are given by the degeneration limit of auxiliary Riemann sphere with marked points, among which three punctured sphere represents isolated superconformal theories. We also discuss twisted irregular punctures and their S-duality.
