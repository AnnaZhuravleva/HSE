This is a review of two-dimensional conformal field theory including some of the relations to integrable models. An effort is made to develop the basic formalism in a way which is as elementary and flexible as possible at the same time. Some advanced topics like conformal field theory on higher genus surfaces and relations to the isomonodromic deformation problem are discussed, for other topics we offer a first guide to the literature.
