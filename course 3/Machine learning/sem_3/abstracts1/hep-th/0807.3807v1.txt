We investigate the phase-space structure of the quintom paradigm in the framework of a spatially flat, open, or closed isotropic and homogeneous universe. We examine the dynamical evolution under the assumption of late-time dark energy domination, without specifying the explicit quintom potential form. The obtained cosmological behavior is qualitatively different than that acquired from the single phantom model.
