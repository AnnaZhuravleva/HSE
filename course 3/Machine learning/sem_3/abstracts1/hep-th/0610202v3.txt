The generalized Maxwell equations including an additional scalar field are considered in the first-order formalism. The gauge invariance of the Lagrangian and equations is broken resulting the appearance of a scalar field. We find the canonical and symmetrical Belinfante energy-momentum tensors. It is shown that the traces of the energy-momentum tensors are not equal to zero and the dilatation symmetry is broken in the theory considered. The matrix Hamiltonian form of equations is obtained after the exclusion of the nondynamical components. The canonical quantization is performed and the propagator of the fields is found in the first-order formalism.
