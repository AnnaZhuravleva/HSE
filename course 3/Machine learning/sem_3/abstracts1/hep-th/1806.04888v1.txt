The large dimension ($D$) limit of general relativity has been used in problems involving black holes as an analytical approximation tool. Further it has been proposed that both linear and nonlinear problems involving black holes can be systematically studied in a $1/D$ expansion. As an example, certain quasinormal modes of higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes with $\omega \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ were studied in the large $D$ limit by assuming an expansion for the mode function as a series in $1/D$. In this paper, we critically revisit this linear perturbation problem and compute quasinormal modes without this assumption.We show that for $\omega \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, the general solutions to the perturbation equations cannot be written in a series expansion in $1/D$. This result has ramifications for recent proposals for an effective membrane approach to tackle nonlinear problems in black hole physics in a $1/D$ expansion. We also discuss modes with $\omega \sim \mathcal{O}(D)$ and the difficulties in computing them beyond leading order.
