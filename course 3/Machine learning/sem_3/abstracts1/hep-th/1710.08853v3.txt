We discuss orbifold version of the Schur index defined as the supersymmetric partition function in S^3/Z_n x S^1. We first give a general formula for Lagrangian theories obtained by localization technique, and then suggest a generalization of the Cordova and Shao's IR formula. We confirm the generalized IR formula gives the correct answer for systems with free hypermultiplets if we tune the background fields so that they are invariant under the orbifold action. Unfortunately, we find disagreement for theories with dynamical vector multiplets.
