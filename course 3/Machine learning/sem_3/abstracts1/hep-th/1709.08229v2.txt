We extend the free fermionic classification methodology to the class of standard-like heterotic-string vacua, in which the $SO(10)$ GUT symmetry is broken at the string level to $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)^2$. The space of GGSO free phase configurations in this case is vastly enlarged compared to the corresponding $SO(6)\times SO(4)$ and $SU(5)\times U(1)$ vacua. Extracting substantial numbers of phenomenologically viable models therefore requires a modification of the classification methods. This is achieved by identifying conditions on the GGSO projection coefficients, which are satisfied at the $SO(10)$ level by random phase configurations, and that lead to three generation models with the $SO(10)$ symmetry broken to the $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)^2$ subgroup. Around each of these fertile $SO(10)$ configurations, we perform a complete classification of standard-like models, by adding the $SO(10)$ symmetry breaking basis vectors, and scanning all the associated GGSO phases. Following this methodology we are able to generate some $10^7$ three generation Standard-like Models. We present the results of the classification and one exemplary model with distinct phenomenological properties, compared to previous SLM constructions.
