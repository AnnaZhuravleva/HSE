We generalize the action for point particle motion to a double field theory background. After deriving the general equations of motion for these particle geodesics, we specialize to the case of a cosmological background with vanishing antisymmetric tensor field and constant dilaton. We then show that the geodesics can be extended to infinity in both time directions once we define the appropriate physical clock. Following this prescription, we also show the existence of a singularity-free cosmological solution.
