A self-contained method of obtaining effective theories resulting from the spontaneous breakdown of conformal invariance is developed. It allows to demonstrate that the Nambu-Goldstone fields for special conformal transformations always represent non-dynamical degrees of freedom. The standard approach to the same question, which includes the imposition of the inverse Higgs constraints, is shown to follow from the developed technique. This provides an alternative view on the nature of the inverse Higgs constraints for the conformal group.
