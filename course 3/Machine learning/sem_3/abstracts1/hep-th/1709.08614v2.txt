We consider a holographic model of two 1+1-dimensional heat baths at different temperatures joined at time $t=0$, such that a steady state heat-current region forms and expands in space for times $t>0$. After commenting on the causal structure of the dual 2+1-dimensional spacetime, we present how to calculate the time-dependent entanglement entropy of the boundary system holographically. We observe that the increase rate of the entanglement entropy satisfies certain bounds known from the literature on entanglement tsunamis. Furthermore, we check the validity of several non-trivial entanglement inequalities in this dynamic system.
