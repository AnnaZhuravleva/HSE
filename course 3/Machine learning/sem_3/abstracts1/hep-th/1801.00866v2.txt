Deformed sine-Gordon (DSG) models of the type $\partial_\xi \partial_\eta \, w + \frac{d}{dw}V(w) = 0$, with $V(w)$ being the deformed potential, are considered in the context of the Riccati-type pseudopotential representations. A compatibility condition of the extended system of deformed Riccati-type equations, plus certain auxiliary equations, reproduces the equation of motion of the DSG models. Then, through a deformation of the usual pseudopotential approach to integrable field theories and supported by numerical simulations of soliton scatterings, we show that the DSG models, which have recently been defined as quasi-integrable in the anomalous zero-curvature approach [Ferreira-Zakrzewski, JHEP05(2011)130], possess infinite towers of conservation laws and a related linear system of equations. We compute numerically the first non-trivial and independent charges (beyond energy and momentum) of the DSG model: the two sets of third and fifth order conserved charges, respectively, for kink-kink, kink-antikink and breather configurations for the Bazeia et al. potential $V_{q}(w) = \frac{64}{q^2} \tan^2{\frac{w}{2}} (1-|\sin{\frac{w}{2}}|^q)^2, $ $(q \in R)$, which contains the usual SG potential $V_2(w) = 2[1- \cos{(2 w)}]$. The numerical simulations are performed using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method supplied with non-reflecting boundary conditions.
