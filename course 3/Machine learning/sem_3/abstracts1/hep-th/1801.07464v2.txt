It is known that the L-function of an elliptic curve defined over Q is given by the Mellin transform of a modular form of weight 2. Does that modular form have anything to do with string theory? In this article, we address a question along this line for elliptic curves that have complex multiplication defined over number fields. So long as we use diagonal rational N=(2,2) superconformal field theories for the string-theory realizations of the elliptic curves, the weight-2 modular form turns out to be the Boltzmann-weighted (q^{L_0-c/24}-weighted) sum of U(1) charges with F e^{ \pi i F} insertion computed in the Ramond sector.
