In this note, we refine the racetrack inflation model constructed in arXiv:hep-th/0406230 by including the open string modulus. This modulus encodes the embedding of our braneworld inside some Calabi-Yau throat. We argue that in generic this open string modulus dynamically runs with the inflaton field thanks to its nonlinear coupling. A full analysis becomes difficult because the scalar potential changes progressively during the inflation epoch. Nevertheless, by explicit construction we are still able to build a realistic model through appropriate choices of the initial conditions.
