We apply the method of the large spin bootstrap to analyse fermionic conformal field theories with weakly broken higher spin symmetry. Through the study of correlators of composite operators, we find the anomalous dimensions and OPE coefficients in the Gross-Neveu model in $d=2+\varepsilon$ dimensions and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions, based only on crossing symmetry. Furthermore a non-trivial solution in the $d=2+\varepsilon$ expansion is found for a fermionic theory in which the fundamental field is not part of the spectrum. The results are perturbative in $\varepsilon$ and valid to all orders in the spin, reproducing known results for operator dimensions and providing some new results for operator dimensions and OPE coefficients.
