We extend our recent study on the duality between stringy higher spin theories and free CFTs in the $SU(N)$ adjoint representation to other matrix models namely the free $SO(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ adjoint models as well as the free $U(N)\times U(M)$ bi-fundamental and $O(N)\times O(M)$ bi-vector models. After determining the spectrum of the theories in the planar limit by Polya counting, we compute the one loop vacuum energy and Casimir energy for their respective bulk duals by means of the CIRZ method that we have introduced recently. We also elaborate on possible ambiguities in the application of this method.
