We show that there exist supersymmetric Minkowski vacua on Type IIB toroidal orientifold with general flux compactifications where the RR tadpole cancellation conditions can be relaxed elegantly. Then we present a realistic Pati-Salam like model. At the string scale, the gauge symmetry can be broken down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry, the gauge coupling unification can be achieved naturally, and all the extra chiral exotic particles can be decoupled so that we have the supersymmetric SMs with/without SM singlet(s) below the string scale. The observed SM fermion masses and mixings can also be obtained. In addition, the unified gauge coupling, the dilaton, the complex structure moduli, the real parts of the K\"ahler moduli and the sum of the imaginary parts of the K\"ahler moduli can be determined as functions of the four-dimensional dilaton and fluxes, and can be estimated as well.
