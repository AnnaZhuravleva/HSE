We demonstrate that $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric non-Abelian gauge theories have towers of BPS particles obeying a Regge relation, $J \sim m^{2},$ between their angular momenta, $J,$ and their masses, $m$. For $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theories, we estimate the slope of these Regge trajectories using a non-relativistic quiver quantum mechanics model. Along the way, we also prove various structure theorems for the quiver moduli spaces that appear in the calculation.
