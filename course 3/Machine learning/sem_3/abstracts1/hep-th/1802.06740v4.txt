Using complexity=action proposal we study the growth rate of holographic complexity for Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating geometries. We will consider both one and two sided black branes in an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton gravitational theory. We find that in either case Lloyd's bound is violated and the rate of growth of complexity saturates to a value which is greater than twice the mass of the corresponding black brane. This value reduces to the mass of the black brane in the isotropic case. We show that in two sided black brane the saturation happens from above while for one sided black brane it happens from below.
