We explore thick branes in $f(R,\phi,X)$ gravity. We obtain the linear tensor perturbation equation of $f(R,\phi,X)$ branes and show that the branes are stable against the tensor perturbation under the condition of $\partial f(R,\phi,X)/\partial R>0$. In order to obtain thick brane solutions of the fourth-order field equations in this theory, we employ the reconstruction technique. We obtain the solution of the $f(R,\phi,X)$ thick brane generated by a scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms. It is shown that the zero mode of the graviton for the thick brane is localized on brane under certain conditions, which shows that the four-dimensional Newtonian potential can be recovered on the brane. The effect of the KK modes of the graviton on the specific $f(R,\phi,X)$ brane is also discussed.
