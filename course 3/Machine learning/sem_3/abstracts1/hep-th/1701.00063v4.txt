We use the correspondence between three-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes and two-dimensional contracted conformal field theories (CCFTs) to derive the stress tensor correlators of CCFT$_2$. On the gravity side we use the metric formulation instead of the Chern-Simons formulation of three-dimensional gravity. This method can also be used for four-dimensional case where there is no Chern-Simons formulation for the bulk theory.
