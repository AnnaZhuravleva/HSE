We study $R^2$ corrections to the holographic Schwinger effect in an AdS black hole background and a confining D3-brane background, respectively. The potential analysis for these backgrounds is presented. The critical values for the electric field are obtained. It is shown that for both backgrounds increasing the Gauss-Bonnet parameter the Schwinger effect is enhanced. Moreover, the results provide an estimate of how the Schwinger effect changes with the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, at strong coupling.
