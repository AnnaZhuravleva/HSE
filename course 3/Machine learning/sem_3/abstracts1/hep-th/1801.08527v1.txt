All known examples of 4d quantum field theories with asymptotic freedom or asymptotic safety at weak coupling involve non-abelian gauge interactions. We demonstrate that this is not a coincidence: no weakly coupled fixed points, ultraviolet or otherwise, can be reliably generated in theories lacking gauge interactions. Implications for conformal field theory and phase transitions are indicated.
