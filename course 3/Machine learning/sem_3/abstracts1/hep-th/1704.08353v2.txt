We study simultaneous collisions of two, three, and four kinks and antikinks of the $\phi^6$ model at the same spatial point. Unlike the $\phi^4$ kinks, the $\phi^6$ kinks are asymmetric and this enriches the variety of the collision scenarios. In our numerical simulations we observe both reflection and bound state formation depending on the number of kinks and on their spatial ordering in the initial configuration. We also analyze the extreme values of the energy densities and the field gradient observed during the collisions. Our results suggest that very high energy densities can be produced in multi-kink collisions in a controllable manner. Appearance of high energy density spots in multi-kink collisions can be important in various physical applications of the Klein-Gordon model.
