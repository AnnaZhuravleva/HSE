We study the time evolution of a conformal field theory deformed by a relevant operator under a smooth but fast quantum quench which brings it to the conformal point. We argue that when the quench time scale $\delta t$ is small compared to the scale set by the relevant coupling, the expectation value of the quenched operator scales universally as $\delta g/ \delta t ^{2\Delta-d}$ where $\delta g$ is the quench amplitude. This growth is further enhanced by a logarithmic factor in even dimensions. We present explicit results for free scalar and fermionic field theories, supported by an analytic understanding of the leading contribution for fast quenches. Results from this Letter suggest that this scaling result, first found in holography, is in fact universal to quantum quenches. Our considerations also show that this limit of fast smooth quenches is quite different from an instantaneous quench from one time-independent Hamiltonian to another, where the Schrodinger picture state at the time of the quench simply serves as an initial condition for subsequent evolution with the final Hamiltonian.
