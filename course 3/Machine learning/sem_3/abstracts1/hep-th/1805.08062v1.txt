The massive ODE/IM correspondence is a relation between the linear problem associated with modified affine Toda field equations and two-dimensional massive integrable models. We study the massive ODE/IM correspondence for the $A_r^{(1)}$-type modified affine Toda field equations. Based on the $\psi$-system satisfied by the solutions of the linear problem, we derive the Bethe ansatz equations and determine the asymptotic behavior of the Q-functions for large value of the spectral parameter. We derive the non-linear integral equations for the Q-functions from the Bethe ansatz equations. We compute the effective central charge in the UV limit, which is identified with the one of the non-unitary $WA_r$ minimal models when the solution has trivial monodromy around the origin of the complex plane.
