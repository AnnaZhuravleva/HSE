We consider a general Einstein-scalar-GB theory with a coupling function f(\phi). We demonstrate that black-hole solutions appear as a generic feature of this theory since a regular horizon and an asymptotically-flat solution may be easily constructed under mild assumptions for f(\phi). We show that the existing no-hair theorems are easily evaded, and a large number of regular, black-hole solutions with scalar hair are then presented for a plethora of coupling functions f(\phi).
