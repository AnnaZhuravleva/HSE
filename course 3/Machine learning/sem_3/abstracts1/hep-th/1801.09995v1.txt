During a de Sitter stage of expansion the spectator fields of different spin are constrained by the critical density bound and by further requirements determined by their specific physical nature. The evolution of spectator electric fields in conformally flat background geometries is occasionally concocted by postulating the existence of ad hoc currents but this apparently innocuous trick violates the second law of thermodynamics. Such a problem occurs, in particular, for those configurations (customarily employed for the analysis of the Schwinger effect in four-dimensional de Sitter backgrounds) leading to an electric energy density which is practically unaffected by the expansion of the underlying geometry. The obtained results are compared with more mundane situations where Joule heating develops in the early stages of a quasi-de Sitter phase.
