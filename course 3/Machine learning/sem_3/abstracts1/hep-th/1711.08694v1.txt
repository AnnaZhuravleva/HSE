Analytic calculations in the infrared regime of nonabelian gauge theories are hampered by the presence of Gribov copies which results in some ambiguity in the gauge-fixing procedure. This problem shares strong similarities with the issue of finding the true ground state among a large number of metastable states, a typical situation in the field of statistical physics of disordered systems. Building on this analogy, we propose a new gauge-fixing procedure which, we argue, makes more explicit the influence of the Gribov copies. A 1-loop calculation shows that the dynamics of these copies can lead to the spontaneous generation of a gauge-dependent gluon mass.
