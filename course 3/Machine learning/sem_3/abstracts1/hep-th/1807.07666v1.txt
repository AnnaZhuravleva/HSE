We discuss consequences of the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with massless fundamental quarks. We derive the new discrete 't~Hooft anomaly of massless QCD for generic numbers of color $N_\mathrm{c}$ and flavor $N_\mathrm{f}$, and an exotic chiral-symmetry broken phase without quark-bilinear condensate is ruled out from possible QCD vacua. We show that the $U(1)_\mathrm{B}$ baryon number symmetry is anomalously broken when the $(\mathbb{Z}_{2N_\mathrm{f}})_\mathrm{A}$ discrete axial symmetry and the flavor symmetry are gauged. In the ordinary chiral symmetry breaking, the Skyrmion current turns out to reproduce this 't~Hooft anomaly of massless QCD. In the exotic chiral symmetry breaking, however, the anomalous breaking of $U(1)_\mathrm{B}$ does not take the correct form, and it is inconsistent with anomaly matching. This no-go theorem is based only on symmetries and anomalies, and thus has a wider range of applicability to the QCD phase diagram than the previous one obtained by QCD inequalities. Lastly, as another application, we check that duality of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric QCD with $N_\mathrm{f}\ge N_\mathrm{c}+1$ satisfies the new anomaly matching.
