We introduce a more general set of kinematic renormalization schemes than the original momentum (MOM) subtraction schemes of Celmaster and Gonsalves. These new schemes will depend on a parameter $\omega$ which tags the external momentum of one of the legs of the $3$-point vertex functions in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). In each of the three new schemes we renormalize QCD in the Landau and maximal abelian gauges and establish the three loop renormalization group functions in each gauge. As an application we evaluate two critical exponents at the Banks-Zaks fixed point and demonstrate that their values appear to be numerically scheme independent in a subrange of the conformal window.
