We show that the anomalous dimension $\gamma_G$ of the scalar glueball operator contains information on the mechanism that leads to the onset of conformality at the lower edge of the conformal window in a non-Abelian gauge theory. In particular, it distinguishes whether the merging of an UV and an IR fixed point -- the simplest mechanism associated to a conformal phase transition and preconformal scaling -- does or does not occur. At the same time, we shed light on new analogies between QCD and its supersymmetric version. In SQCD, we derive an exact relation between $\gamma_G$ and the mass anomalous dimension $\gamma_m$, and we prove that the SQCD exact beta function is incompatible with merging as a consequence of the $a$-theorem; we also derive the general conditions that the latter imposes on the existence of fixed points, and prove the absence of an UV fixed point at nonzero coupling above the conformal window of SQCD. Perhaps not surprisingly, we then show that an exact relation between $\gamma_G$ and $\gamma_m$, fully analogous to SQCD, holds for the massless Veneziano limit of large-N QCD. We argue, based on the latter relation, the $a$-theorem, perturbation theory and physical arguments, that the incompatibility with merging may extend to QCD.
