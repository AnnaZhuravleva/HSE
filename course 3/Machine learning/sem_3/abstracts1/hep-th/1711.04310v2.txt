We apply the new version of gedanken experiment designed recently by Sorce and Wald, to over-spin the 5-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. As a result, the extremal black holes cannot be over-spun at the linear order. On the other hand, although the nearly extremal black holes could be over-spun at the linear order, this process is shown to be prohibited by the quadratic order correction. Thus no violation of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture occurs around the 5-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes.
