We construct solutions to the Einstein equations for asymptotically locally Anti-de Sitter spacetimes with four, five, and six dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om boundary metrics. These spacetimes are gravitational duals to "jammed" CFTs on those backgrounds at infinite N and strong coupling. For these spacetimes, we calculate the boundary stress tensor as well as compute entanglement entropies for ball shaped regions as functions of the boundary black hole temperature $T_{BH}$. From this, we see how the CFT prevents heat flow from the black hole to the vacuum at spatial infinity. We also compute entanglement entropies for a three dimensional boundary black hole using the AdS C-metric. We compare our results to previous work done in similar spacetimes.
