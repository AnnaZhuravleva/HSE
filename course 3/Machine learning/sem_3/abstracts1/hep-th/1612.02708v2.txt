We propose a simple geometric algorithm for determining the complete set of branch points of amplitudes in planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory directly from the amplituhedron, without resorting to any particular representation in terms of local Feynman integrals. This represents a step towards translating integrands directly into integrals. In particular, the algorithm provides information about the symbol alphabets of general amplitudes. We illustrate the algorithm applied to the one- and two-loop MHV amplitudes.
