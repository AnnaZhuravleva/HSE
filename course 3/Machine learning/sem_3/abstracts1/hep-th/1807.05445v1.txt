We provide some comments about the constraints on the inflationary models inferred from the two Swampland criteria which have been recently proposed. In particular we argue that, in the absence of any knowledge about the origin of the adiabatic curvature perturbations, within the slow-roll single field models of inflation there is no tension between the swampland criteria and the current lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
