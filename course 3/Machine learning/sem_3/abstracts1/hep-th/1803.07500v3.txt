We revisit the boundary conformal field theory of twist fields. Based on the equivalence between twisted bosons on a circle and the orbifold theory at the critical radius, we provide a bosonized representation of boundary twist fields and thus a free field representation of the latter. One advantage of this formulation is that it considerably simplifies the calculation of correlation functions involving twist fields. At the same time this also gives access to higher order terms in the operator product expansions of the latter which, in turn, allows to explore the moduli space of marginal deformation of bound states of D-branes. In the process we also generalize some results on correlation functions with excited twist fields.
