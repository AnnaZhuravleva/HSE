With the help of the parametric solution of the Maxwell equal-area law for the Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in five dimensions, we find the second analytical solution with the first order phase transition. We analyze the asymptotic behaviors of some characteristic thermodynamic properties for the small and large black holes at the critical and zero temperatures and also calculate the critical exponents and the corresponding critical amplitudes in detail. Moreover, we give the general form of the thermodynamic scalar curvature based on the Ruppeiner geometry and point out that the attractive interaction dominates in both the small and large black hole phases when the first order phase transition occurs in the five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.
