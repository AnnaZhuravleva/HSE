When two spacetimes are stitched together across a null shell placed at the horizon of a black hole, BMS-supertranslation like soldering freedom arises if one demands that, the induced metric on the shell should remain invariant under the translations generated by the null generators of the shell. We revisit this phenomenon for null shells and demonstrate that not only BMS-supertranslation but also BMS-superrotation like symmetry can emerge if we solder two metrics across a null hypersurface for which the induced metric is invariant up to a conformal rescaling. We demonstrate the appearance of this new type of soldering symmetry for the case of BTZ and Schwarzschild black holes. We compute the expression for the conserved charge (Energy) corresponding to this symmetry for BTZ black hole and relate that with the existing results.
