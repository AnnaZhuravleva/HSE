In general a weakly self-interacting curvaton field is expected and the curvaton potential takes the polynomial form. The curvaton potential can be dominated by the self-interaction term during the period of inflation if the curvaton field stays at a large vacuum expectation value. We use the $\delta {\cal N}$ formalism to calculate the primordial curvature perturbation in the various possible scenarios which make the curvaton model much richer.
