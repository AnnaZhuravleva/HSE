In this note we consider the problem of corrections to CFT data induced by the physical exchange of a primary operator and its descendents in the crossed channels. We show how such corrections can be systematically extracted from crossing kernels, providing a re-summation of the large spin expansion. Using the explicit expressions for crossing kernels given recently in arXiv:1804.09334, we determine closed form expressions for the anomalous dimensions of both leading and sub-leading twist operators of the type $[\mathcal{O}_J\mathcal{O}]_{n,\ell}$ in $d$ dimensions. Like their parent crossing kernels, the anomalous dimensions are expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions ${}_4F_3$. We present some applications to CFTs with slightly broken higher-spin symmetry.
