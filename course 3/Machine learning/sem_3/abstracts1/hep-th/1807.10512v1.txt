We discuss quantum black holes in asymptotically safe quantum gravity with a scale identification based on the Kretschmann scalar. After comparing this scenario with other scale identifications, we investigate in detail the Kerr-(A)dS and Schwarzschild-(A)dS space-times. The global structure of these geometries is studied as well as the central curvature singularity and test particle trajectories. The existence of a Planck-sized, extremal, zero temperature black hole remnant guarantees a stable endpoint of the evaporation process via Hawking radiation.
