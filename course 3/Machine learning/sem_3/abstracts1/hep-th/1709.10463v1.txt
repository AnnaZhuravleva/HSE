Motivated by the holographic prescriptions for computing entanglement entropy and complexity, we study the properties of volumes/areas of bulk surfaces. We obtain a simple formula for the shape dependence of holographic entanglement entropy in terms of a certain integral over the entangling surface. This easily generalizes to any bulk codimension-$p$ extremal surface. We study additional properties of bulk codimension-$p$ extremal surfaces corresponding to strip/plane "entangling surfaces" in various geometries. We compute universal terms for codim-one volumes (conjectured to be dual to holographic subregion complexity) arising from performing relevant deformations. Finally, we describe several interesting bulk surface constructions which are presumably related to holographic complexity.
