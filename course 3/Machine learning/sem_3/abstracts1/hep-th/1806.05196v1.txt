We work in the Heisenberg picture to demonstrate the classical-quantum correspondence (CQC) in which the dynamics of a quantum variable is equivalent to that of a complexified classical variable. The correspondence provides a tool for analyzing quantum backreaction problems which we illustrate by a toy model in which a rolling particle slows down due to quantum radiation. The dynamics found using the CQC is in excellent agreement with that found using the much more laborious full quantum analysis.
