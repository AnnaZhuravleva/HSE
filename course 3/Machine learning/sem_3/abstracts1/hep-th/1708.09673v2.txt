Factorization of scattering is the hallmark of integrable 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories. For factorization of scattering to be possible the set of masses and momenta must be conserved in any two-to-two scattering process. We use this fact to constrain the form of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes for integrable supergravity anti-de Sitter backgrounds by analysing tree-level scattering of two AdS bosons into two fermions on the worldsheet of a BMN string. We find a condition which can be efficiently used to rule out integrability of AdS strings and therefore of the corresponding AdS/CFT dualities, as we demonstrate for some simple examples.
