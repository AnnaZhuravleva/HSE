This work presents a generalization of the rotating black hole in two plus one dimensions, in the light of scale--dependent gravitational couplings. In particular, the gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ and the cosmological term $\Lambda_0$ are not forced to be constants anymore. Instead, $\kappa$ and $\Lambda$ are allowed to change along the radial scale $r$. The effective Einstein field equations of this problem are solved by assuming static rotational symmetry and by maintaining the usual structure of the line element. For this generalized solution, the asymptotic behavior, the horizon structure, and the thermodynamic properties are analyzed.
