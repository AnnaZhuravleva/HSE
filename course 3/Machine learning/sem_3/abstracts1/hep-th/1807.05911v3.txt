Supersymmetric partition function of $\mathcal N=1$ superconformal theories on $S^1_{\beta} \times S^3$ is related to the superconformal index receiving contributions from short representations. The leading coefficients in the small $\beta$ (high "temperature") expansion of the index were previously related to the conformal anomaly coefficients of the theory. Assumptions underlying universality of these relations were tested only for simplest low-spin unitary multiplets. Here we consider examples of higher derivative non-unitary $\mathcal N=1$ multiplets that naturally appear in the context of extended conformal supergravities and compute their superconformal index. We compare the coefficients in the small $\beta$ expansion of the index with those proposed earlier for unitary multiplets and suggest some modifications that should apply universally to all types of theories. We also comment on the structure of subleading terms and the case of $\mathcal N=4$ conformal supergravity.
