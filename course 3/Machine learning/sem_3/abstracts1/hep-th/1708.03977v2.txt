The so-called $\Gamma\Gamma$-form of the gravitational Lagrangian, long known to provide its most compact expression as well as the most efficient generation of the graviton vertices, is taken as the starting point for discussing General Relativity as a theory of the self-interacting graviton. A straightforward but general method of converting to a covariant formulation by the introduction of a reference metric is given. It is used to recast the Einstein field equation as the equation of motion of a spin-2 particle interacting with the canonical energy-momentum tensor symmetrized by the standard Belinfante method applicable to any field carrying nonzero spin. This represents the graviton field equation in a form complying with the precepts of standard field theory. It is then shown how representations based on other, at face value completely unrelated definitions of energy-momentum (pseudo)tensors are all related by the addition of appropriate superpotential terms. Specifically, the superpotentials are explicitly constructed which connect to: i) the common definition consisting simply of the nonlinear part of the Einstein tensor; ii) the Landau-Lifshitz definition.
