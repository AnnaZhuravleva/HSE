We construct an analytic solution for a one-parameter family of holographic superconductors in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes. We utilize this solution to explore various properties of the systems such as (1) the superfluid phase background and the grand canonical potential, (2) the order parameter response function or the susceptibility, (3) the London equation, (4) the background with a superfluid flow or a magnetic field. From these results, we identify the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory including numerical coefficients. Also, the dynamic critical exponent $z_d$ associated with the critical point is given by $z_d=2$ irrespective of the value of the Lifshitz exponent $z$.
