Our purpose is to develop a non minimal coupling scalar field in the context of the anti de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. The dynamics of this model are studied by rewriting the cosmological field equations in the form of a system of autonomous differential equations. In particular, the analysis is considered by investigating a minimal coupling, a conformal coupling and a non minimal coupling scalar field to the curvature. We present and discuss issues of stability and viability of this model for different behaviors of our universe.
