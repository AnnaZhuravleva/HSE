We evaluate the four-closed-string scattering amplitude by using the string path integral in the proper-time gauge. Identifying the Fock space representation of the four-closed-string-vertex, we obtain a field theoretic expression of the closed string scattering amplitudes. In the zero-slope limit, the four-closed-string scattering amplitude is shown to reduce to the four-graviton-scattering amplitude of the Einstein gravity. Given that the four-closed-string interaction is generated perturbatively by the three-closed-string interaction, the quantum theory of gravity may be described consistently as a low energy limit of the closed string field theory which contains a cubic closed string interaction only.
