With in the extended thermodynamics, we give a comparative study of critical heat engines for Gauss-Bonnet and charged black holes in AdS in five dimensions, in the limit of large Gauss-Bonnet parameter $\alpha$ and charge $q$, respectively. We show that the approach of efficiency of heat engines to Carnot limit in Gauss-Bonnet black holes is higher(lower) than charged black holes when corresponding parameters are small(large).
