We study the dimensional dependence of the transition-orders associated with the uniform/non-uniform transitions in the large-N bosonic BFSS matrix model with D matrix scalar fields on a one-dimensional circled space. In our analysis, exploiting the 1/D non-perturabative expansion in arXiv:0910.4526, we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau type effective action (GL action) with the Wilson lines as its dynamical variables. The GL action describes the uniform/non-uniform and the non-uniform/gapped transitions. We examine how the connections of the two GL actions varies depending on D at the uniform/non-uniform transition. As the point in the results of this study, we find that the transition-orders is second in larger D, however first in not-larger D. The transitions we investigate are associated with the confinement/deconfinemnt transition, which are related with the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instabilities in the gravities and the Rayleigh-Plateau (RP) instabilities in the fluid dynamics. Critical phenomena in GL and RP instabilities have been examined by many people so far, and the result of the dimensional dependence we obtain this time is consistent with those in the gravities and fluid dynamics. Our result would be interesting in terms of universality of theories, descriptions of gravities using gauge theories and so on.
