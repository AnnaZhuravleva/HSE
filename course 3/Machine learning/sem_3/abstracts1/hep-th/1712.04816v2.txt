We compute structure constants in three-point functions of three string states in AdS_4 x CP^3 in the framework of the semiclassical approach. We consider HHL correlation functions where two of the states are "heavy" string states of finite-size giant magnons carrying one or two angular momenta and the other one corresponds to such "light" states as dilaton operators with non-zero momentum, primary scalar operators, and singlet scalar operators with higher string levels.
