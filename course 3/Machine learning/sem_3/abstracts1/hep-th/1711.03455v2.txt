Any 4d theory possessing $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry admits a so called $\mathcal{S}$-multiplet, containing the conserved energy-momentum tensor and supercurrent. When a defect is introduced into such a theory, the $\mathcal{S}$-multiplet receives contributions localised on the defect, which indicate the breaking of some translation symmetry and consequently also some supersymmetries. We call this the defect multiplet. We classify such terms corresponding to half-BPS defects which can be either three-dimensional, preserving 3d $\mathcal{N}=1$, or two-dimensional, preserving $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$. The new terms localised on the defect furnish multiplets of the reduced symmetry and give rise to the displacement operator.
