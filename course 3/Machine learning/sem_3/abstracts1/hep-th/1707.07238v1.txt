A series of aspects of the quantum gravity predict a modification in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In the present work, using the momentum space representation, we study the behavior of the Kemmer oscillator in the context of the GUP. The wave function, the probability densities, and the energy spectrum are obtained analytically. Furthermore, the thermodynamic properties of the system are investigated via numerical method and the influence of GUP on thermodynamic functions is also discussed.
