In this short review (to appear as a contribution to an edited volume) we discuss perturbative and non-perturbative approaches to the quantization of the Green-Schwarz string in AdS backgrounds with RR-fluxes, where the guiding thread is the use of genuine field theory methods, the search for a good regularization scheme associated to them and the generality of the analysis carried out. We touch upon various computational setups, both analytical and numerical, and on the role of their outcomes in understanding the detailed structure of the AdS/CFT correspondence.
