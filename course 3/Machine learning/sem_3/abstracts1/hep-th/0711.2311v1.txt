We consider the spectrum of mesons for the gauge theory dual to a supergravity configuration of intersecting D3/D7 branes, and use the expression for the Lagrangian of the scalar mesons to compute explicitly the Lagrangian for the lightest states in the infrared limit. Assuming that the matter content of this gauge theory is part of a hidden sector, which interacts with the standard model only via gravity, we explore the cosmological consequences of these lightest scalar mesons for a FRW universe. We show that phantom fields may appear naturally in this kind of scenarios.
