Using the methods of Lie groups and Lie algebras, we solved U(1) gauge potentials in the de Sitter background. Resulted gauge potentials are smooth on the whole spacetime, satisfying the Lorentz gauge condition. It is shown that electromagnetic fields in the de Sitter background could not be source free.
