We give a detailed review of construction of conserved quantities in extended theories of gravity for asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes and carry out explicit computations for various solutions. Our construction is based on the Killing charge method and covers the ADM charges, AD charges and the ADT charges. We also discuss the conformal properties and the behavior of these charges under large gauge transformations as well as the linearization instability issue which explains the vanishing charge problem for extended theories. We devote a long discussion to the quasi-local and off-shell generalization of conserved charges in the 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons like theories and discuss their relevance to the entropy of black holes.
