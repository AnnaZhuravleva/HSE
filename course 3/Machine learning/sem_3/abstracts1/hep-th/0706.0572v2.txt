We investigate the condition for eternal inflation to take place in the noncommutative spacetime. We find that the possibility for eternal inflation's happening is greatly suppressed in this case. If eternal inflation cannot happen in the low energy region where the noncommutativity is very weak (the UV region), it will never happen during the whole inflationary history. Based on these conclusions, we argue that an initial condition for eternal inflation is available from the property of spacetime noncommutativity.
