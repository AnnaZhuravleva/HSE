We provide further evidence that the recently constructed warped $AdS_6$ solutions in Type IIB supergravity are dual to 5d SCFTs that correspond to $(p,q)$ 5-brane webs with large numbers of like-charged external 5-branes. We study a number of specific examples, including the $T_N$ theory, and identify the bulk states dual to a class of operators with ${\cal O}(N)$ scaling dimensions in terms of strings and string-webs embedded in the solutions.
