We study cosmological consequences of the noncommutative approach to the standard model. Neglecting the nonminimal coupling of the Higgs field to the curvature, noncommutative corrections to Einstein's equations are present only for inhomogeneous and anisotropic space-times. Considering the nominimal coupling however, we obtain corrections even for background cosmologies. A link with dilatonic gravity as well as chameleon cosmology are briefly discussed, and potential experimental consequences are mentioned.
