We consider accelerated and rotating media of weakly interacting fermions in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Kinetic properties of this media are described by covariant Wigner function calculated on the basis of relativistic distribution function of particles with spin. We obtain the formulae for axial current beyond the approximation of smallness of thermal vorticity tensor and chemical potential and calculate its divergence. In the massless limit higher order terms in vorticity and chemical potential compensate each other with only the low-order contributions surviving. It is shown, that axial current gets a topological component along the 4-acceleration vector. The similarity between different approaches to baryon polarisation is established.
