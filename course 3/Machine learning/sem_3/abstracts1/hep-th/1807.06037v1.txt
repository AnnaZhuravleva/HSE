Motivated by string field theory, we explore various algebraic aspects of higher spin theory and Vasiliev equation in terms of homotopy algebras. We explain that the unfolded formulation developed for the study of higher spin equation is precisely the Maurer-Cartan equation associated to differential forms on a manifold valued in L-infinity algebras. The elimination of auxiliary variables of Vasiliev equation can be analyzed systematically through homological perturbation theory. This leads to a closed combinatorial graph formula for all the vertices of higher spin equations in the unfolded formulation. We also discover a topological quantum mechanics model whose correlation functions give deformed higher spin vertices at first order.
