We present a detailed discussion of the entanglement structure of vector fields through canonical quantization. We quantize Maxwell theory in Rindler space in Lorenz gauge, discuss the Hilbert space structure and analyze the Unruh effect. As a warm-up, in 1+1 dimensions, we compute the spectrum and prove that the theory is thermodynamically trivial. In d+1 dimensions, we identify the edge sector as eigenstates of horizon electric flux or equivalently as states representing large gauge transformations, localized on the horizon. The edge Hilbert space is generated by inserting a generic combination of Wilson line punctures in the edge vacuum, and the edge states are identified as Maxwell microstates of the black hole. This construction is repeated for Proca theory. Extensions to tensor field theories, and the link with Chern-Simons are discussed.
