This work deals with defect structures in models described by scalar fields. The investigations focus on generalized models, with the kinetic term modified to allow for a diversity of possibilities. We develop a new framework, in which we search for first-order differential equations which solve the equations of motion. The main issue concerns the introduction of a new function, which works like the superpotential usually considered in the standard situation. We investigate the problem in the general case, with an arbitrary number of fields, and we present several explicit examples in the case of a single real scalar field.
