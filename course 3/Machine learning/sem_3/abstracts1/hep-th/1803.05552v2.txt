We explore the fine structure of the holographic entanglement entropy proposal (the Ryu-Takayanagi formula) in AdS$_3$/CFT$_{2}$. With the guidance from the boundary and bulk modular flows we find a natural slicing of the entanglement wedge with the modular planes, which are co-dimension one bulk surfaces tangent to the modular flow everywhere. This gives an one-to-one correspondence between the points on the boundary interval $\mathcal{A}$ and the points on the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface $\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}}$. In the same sense an arbitrary subinterval $\mathcal{A}_2$ of $\mathcal{A}$ will correspond to a subinterval $\mathcal{E}_2$ of $\mathcal{E}_{\mathcal{A}}$. We propose that the length of $\mathcal{E}_2$ captures the contribution from $\mathcal{A}_2$ to the entanglement entropy $S_{\mathcal{A}}$, and compare it with the mutual information between $\mathcal{A}_2$ and the complement $\mathcal{A}^c$.
