We detail the calculation of two-loop all-plus helicity amplitudes for pure Yang-Mills theory. The four dimensional unitarity methods and augmented recursion techniques we have developed, together with a knowledge of the singular structure of the amplitudes allow us to compute these in compact analytic forms. Specifically we present the computation and analytic results for the six- and seven-gluon leading colour two-loop amplitudes these being the first QCD two-loop amplitudes beyond five-points.
