We study the interaction of two dyons in the region of their cores where they are non-linear and non-Abelian. We assume the superposition of two dyons as a solution of the equation of motion. The terms due to the non-linearity of the strength tensor are considered as the perturbation terms which deforms the profile function of two individual dyons. As a result, the profile function of dyons are obtained to be dependent on the polar angle and the spherical symmetry is lost.
