We perform a model-independent analysis of kinetically driven inflation (KDI) which (partially) includes Generalized G-inflation and Ghost inflation. We evaluate the background evolution splitting into the inflationary attractor and the perturbation around it. We also consider the quantum fluctuation of scalar mode with a usual scaling and derive the spectral index ignoring the contribution from the second order products of slow-roll parameters. Using these formalisms, we find that within our generic framework, the models of KDI which possess the shift symmetry of scalar field cannot create the quantum fluctuation consistent to the observation. Breaking the shift symmetry, we obtain a few essential conditions for viable models of KDI associated with the graceful exit.
