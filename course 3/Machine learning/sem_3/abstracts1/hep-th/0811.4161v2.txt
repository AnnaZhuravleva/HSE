Postulating that all massless elementary fields have conformal scaling symmetry removes a conflict between gravitational theory and the standard model of elementary quantum fields. If the scalar field essential to SU(2) symmetry breaking has conformal symmetry, it must depend explicitly on the Ricci curvature scalar of gravitational theory. This has profound consequences for both cosmology and elementary particle physics, since cosmological data determine scalar field parameters. A modified Friedmann equation is derived and solved numerically. The theory is consistent with all relevant data for supernovae redshifts below $z=1$. The implied value of the cosmological constant implies extremely small Higgs mass, far below current empirical lower bounds. Detection of a Higgs boson with large mass would falsify this argument.
