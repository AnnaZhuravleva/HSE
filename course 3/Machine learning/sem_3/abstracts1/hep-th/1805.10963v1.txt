We discuss a covariant extension of interactions between scalar fields and fermions in a flat spacetime. We show, in a covariant theory, how to evade fermionic ghosts appearing because of the extra degrees of freedom behind a fermionic nature even in Lagrangian with first derivatives. We will give a concrete example of a quadratic theory with up to the first derivative of multiple scalar fields and a Weyl fermion. We examine not only the maximally degenerate condition, which makes the number of degrees of freedom correct, but also a supplementary condition guaranteeing that the time evolution takes place properly. We also show that proposed derivative interaction terms between scalar fields and a Weyl fermion cannot be removed by field redefinitions.
