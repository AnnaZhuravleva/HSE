Microscopic description of the vacuum of a pure quantum chromodynamics (QCD) based on a class of regular stationary monopole-like solutions is presented. All solutions are stable against quantum gluon fluctuations in any small vicinity of each space-time point. It has been shown that microscopic structure of the vacuum at zero temperature is determined by a special subclass of Abelian magnetic solutions corresponding to a compact gauge group U_3(1)\times U_8(1). We estimate vacuum gluon condensates and masses of the lowest pure glueballs in the leading order approximation.
