We investigate the holographic dc conductivity of (2+1) dimensional systems while considering hyperscaling violating geometry in the bulk. We consider Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton system with two gauge fields and Liouville type potential for dilaton. We also consider axionic fields in the bulk in order to introduce momentum relaxation in the system. We apply an external magnetic field to study the response of the system and obtain analytic expressions for dc conductivity, Hall angle and (thermo)electric conductivity.
