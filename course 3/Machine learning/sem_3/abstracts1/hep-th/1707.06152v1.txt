We study several different types of BPS flows within minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$, $D=7$ supergravity with $\textrm{SU}(2)$ gauge group and non-vanishing topological mass. After reviewing some known domain wall solutions involving only the metric and the $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ scalar field, we move to considering more general flows involving a "dyonic" profile for the 3-form gauge potential. In this context, we consider flows featuring a $\textrm{Mkw}_{3}$ as well as an $\textrm{AdS}_{3}$ slicing, write down the corresponding flow equations, and integrate them analytically to obtain many examples of asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_7$ solutions in presence of a running 3-form. Furthermore, we move to adding the possibility of non-vanishing vector fields, find the new corresponding flows and integrate them numerically. Finally, we discuss the eleven-dimensional interpretation of the aforementioned solutions as effective descriptions of $\mathrm{M2}-\mathrm{M5}$ bound states.
