This article provides a direct calculation of the 4-particle amplituhedron at 3-loop order, by introducing a set of practical tricks. After delicately rearranging each piece of this calculation, we find a suggestive connection between positivity conditions and Mondrian diagrams, which will be quantitatively defined. Such a pattern can be generalized for all Mondrian diagrams among all those contribute to the 4-particle integrand of planar N=4 SYM to all loop orders, as a subsequent work 1712.09994 will show.
