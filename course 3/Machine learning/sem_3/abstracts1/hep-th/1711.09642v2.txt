In a system with a Bjorken-flow (BF), considering the inside of a BF as a subsystem for the reason explained in the body text, we compute entanglement entropy (EE) appearing in our side. BF is an explosively expanding ball consisting of many concentrically scattering quark-gluon plasmas created by colliding two masses of hadrons. Our BF is defined on the boundary space in a five-dimensional time-evolving asymptoticly Anti de-Sitter space with a Schwartzshild black hole with a growing Hawking temperature with time. We use Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Since BF is a time-evolving non-equilibrium system, this study could be considered as an example of analysis for a dispersion process of a local excitation. This point would be one of points in this study. Then, in the process of the analysis of holographic EE, we can get a description of a parameter prescribing our space-time in terms of variables in QCD. Using that, we can write the $\eta/s$ in BF in terms of variables in QCD. Then it turns out that it dips from $1/4\pi$ just for a moment before reaching infinite large time regime and asymptotes to $1/4\pi$. $1/4\pi$ is the KSS bound which is generally considered as the lowest bound for the value of the $\eta/s$. Therefore, this result we obtain in this study would be intriguing as an example of violation of the KSS bound and a target observation in the actual BF in LHC and RHIC.
