We study the spontaneous baryogenesis scenario in the early universe for three different frameworks of varying constants theories. We replace the constants by dynamical scalar fields playing the role of thermions. We first obtain the results for baryogenesis driven by the varying gravitational constant, $G$, as in the previous literature, then challenge the problem for varying fine structure constant $\alpha$ models as well as for varying speed of light $c$ models. We show that in each of these frameworks the current observational value of the baryon to entropy ratio, $\eta_B \sim 8.6 \cdot 10^{-11}$, can be obtained for large set of parameters of dynamical constants models as well as the decoupling temperature, and the characteristic cut-off length scale.
