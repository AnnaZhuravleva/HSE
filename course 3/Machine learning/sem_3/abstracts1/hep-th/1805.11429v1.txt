We obtain general bounds on scattering processes involving charged particles in 1+1 spacetime dimensions. After a general analysis we derive mostly numerical bounds on couplings in theories with $O(N)$ and $U(N)$ global symmetries. The bounds are consistently saturated by $S$-matrices without particle production, and in many cases by known integrable $S$-matrices. Our work provides a blueprint for a similar analysis in higher dimensions.
