We show that magnetic zero-modes of the Dirac operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ which obey an additional non-linear equation are closely related to vortex configurations on the 2-sphere, and that both are best understood in terms of the geometry induced on the 3-sphere via pull-back of the round geometry with bundle maps of the Hopf fibration. We use this viewpoint to deduce a manifestly smooth formula for square-integrable magnetic zero-modes in terms of two homogeneous polynomials in two complex variables.
