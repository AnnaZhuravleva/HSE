Equations of motion for M2- and M5-branes are written down in the $E_{11}$ current algebra formulation of M-theory. These branes correspond to currents of the second and the fifth rank antisymmetric tensors in the $E_{11}$ representation, whereas the electric and magnetic fields (coupled to M2- and M5-branes) correspond to currents of the third and the sixth rank antisymmetric tensors, respectively. We show that these equations of motion have solutions in terms of the coordinates on M2- and M5-branes. We also discuss the geometric equations, and show that there are static solutions when M2- or M5-brane exists alone and also when M5-brane wraps around M2-brane. This situation is realized because our Einstein-like equation contains an extra term which can be interpreted as gravitational energy contributing to the curvature, thus avoiding the usual intersection rule.
