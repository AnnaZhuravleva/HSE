In the search for QFT's that admit boundstates, we reinvestigate the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model, but with massive fermions. By computing the self-energy for the auxiliary boundstate field and the effective potential, we show that there are no bound states around the lowest minimum, but there is a meta-stable bound state around the other minimum, a local one. The latter decays by tunneling. We determine the dependence of its lifetime on the fermion mass and coupling constant.
