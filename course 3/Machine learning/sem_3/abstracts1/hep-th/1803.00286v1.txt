In this paper we extend work on exotic two-dimensional (2,2) supersymmetric gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) in which, for example, geometries arise via nonperturbative effects, to (0,2) theories, and in so doing find some novel (0,2) GLSM phenomena. For one example, we describe examples in which bundles are constructed physically as cohomologies of short complexes involving torsion sheaves, a novel effect not previuosly seen in (0,2) GLSMs. We also describe examples related by RG flow in which the physical ralizations of the bundles are related by quasi-isomorphism, analogous to the physical realization of quasi-isomorphisms in D-branes and derived categories, but novel in (0,2) GLSMs. Finally, we also discuss (0,2) deformations in various duality frames of other examples.
