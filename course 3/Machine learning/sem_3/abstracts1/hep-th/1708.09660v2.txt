We show that the Higgs and gauge fields for a BPS monopole may be constructed directly from the spectral curve without having to solve the gauge constraint needed to obtain the Nahm data. The result is the analogue of the instanton result: given ADHM data one can reconstruct the gauge fields algebraically together with differentiation. Here, given the spectral curve, one can similarly reconstruct the Higgs and gauge fields. This answers a problem that has remained open since the discovery of monopoles.
