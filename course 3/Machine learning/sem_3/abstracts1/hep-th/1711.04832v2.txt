We consider a non-supersymmetric USp Yang-Mills Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to fundamental flavours. The theory is realised in type IIB string theory via an embedding in a Hanany-Witten brane configuration which includes an orientifold and anti-branes. We argue that the theory admits a magnetic Seiberg dual. Using the magnetic dual we identify dynamics in field theory and brane physics that correspond to various phases, obtaining a better understanding of 3d bosonization and dynamical breaking of flavour symmetry in USp QCD$_3$ theory. In field theory both phases correspond to magnetic 'squark' condensation. In string theory they correspond to open string tachyon condensation and brane reconnection. We also discuss other phases where the magnetic 'squark' is massive. Finally, we briefly comment on the case of unitary gauge groups.
