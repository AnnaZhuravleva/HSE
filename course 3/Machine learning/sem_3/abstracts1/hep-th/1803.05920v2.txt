We analyze BPS black hole attractors in the conformal 4d gauged supergravity formalism and apply the technique known as supergravity localization in order to evaluate Sen's quantum entropy function in the $\mathrm{AdS}_2\!\times\!\mathrm{S}^2$ near-horizon geometry. Under certain assumptions, we reduce the exact expression of the functional integral to a finite-dimensional integral for a number of supersymmetric black holes in gauged supergravity with AdS asymptotics subject to a holographic description via a dual field theory. Examples include the asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4\!\times\!\mathrm{S}^7$ Cacciatori-Klemm black holes in M-theory and the asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_5\!\times\!\mathrm{S}^5$ generalizations of Gutowski-Reall black holes and Benini-Bobev black strings in type IIB, as well as the recently constructed asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4\!\times\!\mathrm{S}^6$ solutions in massive type IIA. Our results provide an important first step towards a gravitational counterpart to the exact evaluation of supersymmetric partition functions at finite $N$ for the holographically dual field theories in these examples.
