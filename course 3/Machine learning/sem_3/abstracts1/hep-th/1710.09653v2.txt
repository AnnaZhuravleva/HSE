We study 7D maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on curved manifolds that admit Killing spinors. If the manifold admits at least two Killing spinors (Sasaki-Einstein manifolds) we are able to rewrite the supersymmetric theory in terms of a cohomological complex. In principle this cohomological complex makes sense for any K-contact manifold. For the case of toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds we derive explicitly the perturbative part of the partition function and speculate about the non-perturbative part. We also briefly discuss the case of 3-Sasaki manifolds and suggest a plausible form for the full non-perturbative answer.
