An approach for $q$-deformed Bogoliubov transformations is presented. Assuming a left-right module action together with an *-operation and deformed commutation relations, we construct a q-deformation of the nonlinear Bogoliubov transformation. Moreover we give a general result which can be applied in Quantum Field Theory. Finally, we introduce a Hopf structure when q is a root of unity.
