A common strategy to investigate the fate of gravitational singularities in asymptotically AdS spacetimes is to translate the question from the gravitational side to a dual field theory using the gauge/gravity correspondence and to do a field theory computation. Given recent progress in singularity resolution via non-perturbative quantum gravity, it is natural to now turn the question around and to ask about field theory signatures of resolved singularities. An investigation along this line has been initiated in a companion paper, where a finite-distance pole exhibited by the two-point correlator in the dual field theory, which has previously been linked directly to the gravitational bulk singularity, has been resolved in this way. In order to perform analytic computations, some simplifications were necessary. In this paper, we lift these restrictions by tackling the problem numerically. Our analysis shows that the pole in the two-point correlator gets resolved in the same manner as before.
