We present the first self-consistent direct calculation of a spectral function in the framework of the Functional Renormalization Group. The study is carried out in the relativistic $O(N)$ model, where the full momentum dependence of the propagators in the complex plane as well as momentum-dependent vertices are considered. The analysis is supplemented by a comparative study of the Euclidean momentum dependence and of the complex momentum dependence on the level of spectral functions. This work lays the groundwork for the computation of full spectral functions in more complex systems.
