We study the scattering of the $\varphi^8$ kinks with power-law asymptotics. We found two critical values of the initial velocity, $v_{cr}^{(1)}$ and $v_{cr}^{(2)}$, which separate different regimes of the kink-antikink collision. At the initial velocities $v_{in}< v_{cr}^{(1)}$ kinks can not collide due to repulsive force between them. At $v_{in}>v_{cr}^{(2)}$ the kinks escape to spatial infinities after one collision. In the range $v_{cr}^{(1)}\le v_{in}\le v_{cr}^{(2)}$ we observed kinks capture and formation of their bound state. Besides that, at these initial velocities we found resonance phenomena -- escape windows.
