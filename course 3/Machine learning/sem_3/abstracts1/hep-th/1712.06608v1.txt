In supergravity compactifications, there is in general no clear prescription on how to select a finite-dimensional family of metrics on the internal space, and a family of forms on which to expand the various potentials, such that the lower-dimensional effective theory is supersymmetric. We propose a finite-dimensional family of deformations for regular Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds $M_7$, relevant for M-theory compactifications down to four dimensions. It consists of integrable Cauchy-Riemann structures, corresponding to complex deformations of the Calabi-Yau cone $M_8$ over $M_7$. The non-harmonic forms we propose are the ones contained in one of the Kohn-Rossi cohomology groups, which is finite-dimensional and naturally controls the deformations of Cauchy-Riemann structures. The same family of deformations can be also described in terms of twisted cohomology of the base $M_6$, or in terms of Milnor cycles arising in deformations of $M_8$. Using existing results on SU(3) structure compactifications, we briefly discuss the reduction of M-theory on our class of deformed Sasaki-Einstein manifolds to four-dimensional gauged supergravity.
