We consider backreacted $AdS_5 \times S^5$ coupled with $N_f$ massive flavors introduced by D7-branes. The backreacted geometry is in the Veneziano limit with fixed $N_f/N_c$. By dividing one of the directions into a line segment with length $l$, we get two subspaces. Then we calculate the entanglement entropy between them. With the method provided by Klebanov, Kutasov and Murugan, we are able to find the cut-off independent part of the entanglement entropy and finally find that this geometry shows no phase transition as the case in pure $AdS_5 \times S^5$.
