We derive the Hawking spectrum of fermions emitted by a minimally geometric deformed (MGD) black hole. The MGD naturally describes quantum effects on the geometry in the form of a length scale related, for instance, to the existence of extra dimensions. The dynamics of the emitted fermions is described in the context of the generalised uncertainty principle (GUP) and likewise contains a length scale associated with the quantum nature of space-time. We then show that the emission is practically indistinguishable from the Hawking thermal spectrum for large black hole masses, but the total flux can vanish for small and finite black hole mass. This suggests the possible existence of black hole remnants with a mass determined by the two length scales.
