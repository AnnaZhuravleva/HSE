We consider the theory space as a manifold whose coordinates are given by the couplings appearing in the Wilson action. We discuss how to introduce connections on this theory space. A particularly intriguing connection can be defined directly from the solution of the exact renormalization group (ERG) equation. We advocate a geometric viewpoint that lets us define straightforwardly physically relevant quantities invariant under the changes of a renormalization scheme.
