We study the stability under scalar perturbations, and we compute the quasinormal modes of the Einstein-Born-Infeld dilaton spacetime in 1+3 dimensions. Solving the full radial equation in terms of hypergeometric functions, we provide an exact analytical expression for the spectrum. We find that the frequencies are purely imaginary, and we confirm our results by computing them numerically. Although the scalar field that perturbs the black hole is electrically neutral, an instability similar to that seen in charged scalar perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is observed.
