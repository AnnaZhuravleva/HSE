We extend to non-static black holes our benchmarking scheme that allows for cross-comparison of the efficiencies of asymptotically AdS black holes used as working substances in heat engines. We use a circular cycle in the p-V plane as the benchmark cycle. We study Kerr black holes in four spacetime dimensions as an example. As in the static case, we find an exact formula for the benchmark efficiency in an ideal-gas-like limit, which may serve as an upper bound for rotating black hole heat engines in a thermodynamic ensemble with fixed angular velocity. We use the benchmarking scheme to compare Kerr to static black holes charged under Maxwell and Born-Infeld sectors.
