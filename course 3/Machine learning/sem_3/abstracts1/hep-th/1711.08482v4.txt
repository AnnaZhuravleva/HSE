These are lecture notes based on a series of lectures presented at the XIII Modave Summer School in Mathematical physics aimed at PhD students and young postdocs. The goal is to give an introduction to some of the recent developments in understanding holography in two bulk dimensions, and its connection to microscopics of near extremal black holes. The first part reviews the motivation to study, and the problems (and their interpretations) with holography for AdS$_2$ spaces. The second part is about the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory and nearly-AdS$_2$ spaces. The third part introduces the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, reviews some of the basic calculations and discusses what features make the model exciting.
