We argue that the entanglement of purification for two dimensional holographic CFT can be obtained from conformal blocks with internal twist operators. First, we explain our formula from the view point of tensor network model of holography. Then, we apply it to bipartite mixed states dual to subregion of AdS${}_3$ and the static BTZ blackhole geometries. The formula in CFT agrees with the entanglement wedge cross section in the bulk, which has been recently conjectured to be equivalent to the entanglement of purification.
