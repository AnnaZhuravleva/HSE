About 45 years ago, Bekenstein proposed that black holes should have entropy proportional to their areas in order to make black-hole physics compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. Hawking strengthened this argument by showing that black holes emit thermal radiation, as succinctly encapsulated in the phrase "a 'black hole' is not completely black". However, the heuristic picture of the microscopic process for this Hawking radiation, creation of pairs of positive- and negative-energy particles, leads to inconsistency among the first law for black holes, Bekenstein's argument, and the conservation law for the entropy. Parikh and Wilczek partially improved this consistency by treating Hawking radiation as tunnelling of particles in a dynamical geometry, but at the expense of the pure thermality of the radiation in Hawking's original proposal. Here we present an equation alternative to Bekenstein's, from a viewpoint of quantum information, rather than thermodynamics. Our alternative argues that the area of a black hole is proportional to the coherent information, which is 'minus' conditional entropy, defined only in the quantum regime, from the outside of the black hole to positive-energy particles inside the black hole. Our equation hints that negative-energy particles inside a black hole behave as if they have 'negative' entropy, and provides complete consistency without changing Hawking's original proposal. These ideas suggest that black holes store purely quantum information, rather than classical information.
