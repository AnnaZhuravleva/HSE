Using a 10D lift of non-perturbative volume stabilization in type IIB string theory we study the limitations for obtaining de Sitter vacua. Based on this we find that the simplest KKLT vacua with a single Kahler modulus stabilized by a gaugino condensate cannot be uplifted to de Sitter. Rather, the uplift flattens out due to stronger backreaction on the volume modulus than has previously been anticipated, resulting in vacua which are meta-stable and SUSY breaking, but that are always AdS. However, we also show that setups such as racetrack stabilization can avoid this issue. In these models it is possible to obtain supersymmetric AdS vacua with a cosmological constant that can be tuned to zero while retaining finite moduli stabilization. In this regime, it seems that de Sitter uplifts are possible with negligible backreaction on the internal volume. We exhibit this behavior also from the 10D perspective.
