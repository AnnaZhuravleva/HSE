We consider Random Matrix Theories with non-Gaussian potentials that have a rich phase structure in the large $N$ limit. We calculate the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) in such models and present them as interesting examples of dynamical models that display multi-criticality at short time-scales and universality at large time scales. The models with quartic and sextic potentials are explicitly worked out. The disconnected part of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) shows a change in its decay behaviour exactly at the critical points of each model. The dip-time of the SFF is estimated in each of these models. The change in the decay behaviour is explained by relating it to the change in the behvaiour of the mean level density at criticality, near the edges of its support, using the Paley-Wiener theorem. The late time behaviour of all polynomial potential matrix models is shown to display a certain universality. This is related to the universality in the short distance correlations of the mean-level densities. We speculate on the implications of such universality for chaotic quantum systems including the SYK model.
