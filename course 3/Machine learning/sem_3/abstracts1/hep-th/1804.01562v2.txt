In this work, we explore the twist operator OPEs of a generic bosonic symmetric product ($S_N$) orbifold CFT. We conjecture that at large $N$ the OPE of bare twist operators contains only bare twists and excitations of bare twists with fractional Virasoro modes. These fractionally excited operators are the only ones that depend exclusively on the lengths of the twists and the central charge, agreeing with the general structure of correlators of bare twists found in the literature. To provide evidence for this, we study the coincidence limit of a four point function of bare twist operators to several non-leading orders. We show how the coefficients of these powers can be reproduced by considering bare twist operators excited by fractional Virasoro modes in the exchange channels.
