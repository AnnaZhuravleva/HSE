Recently a new type of quadratic gauge was introduced in QCD in which the degrees of freedom are suggestive of a phase of abelian dominance. In its simplest form it is also free of Gribov ambiguity. However this gauge is not suitable for usual perturbation theory. The finite field dependent BRST (FFBRST) transformation is a method established to interrelate generating functionals for different effective versions of gauge fixed field theories. In this paper we propose a FFBRST transformation suitable for transforming the theory in the new quadratic gauge into the standard Lorenz gauge Faddeev-Popov version of the effective lagrangian. The task is made interesting by the fact the BRST invariance obeyed by the two effective lagrangians are not the same, however suitable extension of the previous procedures accomplishes the required result. We are thus able to identify a field redefinition to go from a non-perturbative phase of QCD to perturbative QCD.
