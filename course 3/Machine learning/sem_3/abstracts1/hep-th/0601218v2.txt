In this paper it is studied a space-time duality web that maps electric into magnetic (and magnetic into electric) charged classical stationary rotating solutions for $2+1$-dimensional Abelian Einstein Maxwell Chern-Simons theories. A first duality map originally suggested by Kogan for static charged solutions is extended to stationary rotating space-times and are suggested two new space-time dualities maps. The three dualities complete a close duality web. It is also shown that in $3+1$-dimensions these dualities are only possible for systems which exhibit non-projected cylindrical symmetry and are not related to the standard electromagnetic duality of Maxwell equations which acts on the physical fields and charges. Generalization to $N$-form theories in higher dimensional space-times is briefly discussed.
