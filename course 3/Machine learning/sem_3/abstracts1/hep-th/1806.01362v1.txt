We consider SU(2)$\times$ U(1) gauge theory coupled to matter field in adjoints and study RG group flow. We constructed Callan Symanzik equation and subsequent $\beta$ functions and study the fixed points. We find there are two fixed points, showing metallic and antiferromagnetic behaviour. We have shown that metallic phase develops an instability if certain parametric conditions are satisfied.
