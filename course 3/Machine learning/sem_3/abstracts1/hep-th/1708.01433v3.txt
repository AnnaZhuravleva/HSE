We shed some light on the field theory interpretation of C-metric by investigating the minimal surfaces which are homologous to the given boundary regions. The accelerating black holes change the asymptotic structure of the space-time. We focus on the geometry features of the minimal surface and study how deep it reaches into the bulk. The regularized area of the minimal surface is not well defined and we introduce a new quantity $D(m,\theta_0)$, defined as the minimal surface divided by the area of the given boundary region, to study the system.
