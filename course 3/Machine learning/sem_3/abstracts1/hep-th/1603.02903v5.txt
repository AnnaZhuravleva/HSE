We consider the ${\cal N}=4$ Liouville theory by varying the linear dilaton coupling constant $\cal{Q}$. It is known that at two different values of coupling constant ${\cal Q}=\sqrt{{2\over N}},-(N-1)\sqrt{{2\over N}}$ system exhibits two different small ${\cal N}=4$ superconformal symmetries with central charge $c=6$ and $c=6(N-1)$, respectively. In the context of string theory these two theories are considered to describe Coulumb and Higgs branch of the theory and expected to be dual to each other. We study the Mathieu and umbral moonshine phenomena in these two theories and discuss their dual description. We mainly consider the case of $A_N$ type modular invariants.
