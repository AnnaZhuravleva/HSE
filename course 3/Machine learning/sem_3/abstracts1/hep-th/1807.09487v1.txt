Motivated by the recently found realization of the $1+1$ dimensional Bjorken flow in ideal and nonideal relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we use appropriate symmetry arguments, and determine the evolution of magnetic fields arising from the $3+1$ dimensional self-similar and Gubser flows in an infinitely conductive relativistic fluid (ideal MHD). In the case of the $3+1$ dimensional self-similar flow, we arrive at a family of solutions, that are related through a differential equation arising from the corresponding Euler equation. To find the magnetic field evolution from the Gubser flow, we solve the MHD equations of a stationary fluid in a conformally flat $dS^{3}\times E^{1}$ spacetime. The results are then Weyl transformed back into the Minkowski spacetime. In this case, the temporal evolution of the resulting magnetic field is shown to exhibit a transition between an early time $1/t$ decay to a $1/t^{3}$ decay at a late time. Here, $t$ is the time coordinate. Transverse and longitudinal components of the magnetic fields arising from these flows are also found. The latter turns out to be sensitive to the transverse size of the fluid. In contrast to the result arising from the Gubser flow, the radial domain of validity of the magnetic field arising from the self-similar flow is highly restricted. A comparison of the results suggests that the (conformal) Gubser MHD may give a more appropriate qualitative picture of the magnetic field decay in the plasma of quarks and gluons created in heavy ion collisions.
