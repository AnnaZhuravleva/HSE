Using holographic methods in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, it was conjectured that the thermal diffusion in a strongly coupled metal without quasi-particles saturates an universal lower bound that is associated with the chaotic property of the system at infrared (IR) fixed points~\cite{blake:1705}. In this paper, we investigate the thermal transport and quantum chaos in the EMDA theory with a small Weyl coupling term. It is found that the Weyl coupling correct the thermal diffusion constant $D_Q$ and butterfly velocity $v_B$ in different ways, hence resulting a modified relation between the two at IR fixed points. Unlike that in the EMDA case, our results show that the ratio $D_Q/ (v_B^2\tau_L)$ always contains a {\it non-universal} Weyl correction which depends on the matter fields as long as the $U(1)$ current is relevant in the IR.
