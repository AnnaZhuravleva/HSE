We construct topological defects in the Liouville field theory producing jump in the value of cosmological constant. We construct them using the Cardy-Lewellen equation for the two-point function with defect. We show that there are continuous and discrete families of such kind of defects. For the continuous family of defects we also find the Lagrangian description and check its agreement with the solution of the Cardy-Lewellen equation using the heavy asymptotic semiclasscial limit.
