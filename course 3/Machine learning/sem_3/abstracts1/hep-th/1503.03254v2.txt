In this paper, using the techniques of Gauge/gravity duality we explore the hydrodynamic regime of $ z=3 $ Lifshitz fixed points in $ 1+1 $ dimensions. The speed of sound in the non-relativistic plasma turns out to be $\sqrt{3}$, which clearly violates the conjectured upper bound. We identify this as a natural consequence of the Lorentz symmetry breakdown at $ z=3 $ Lifshitz fixed point. In our analysis, we compute bulk viscosity to entropy ratio for quantum field theory dual to Lifshitz gravity in $ 2+1$ dimensions and it turns out that for this particular holographic model this ratio is above the conjectured lower bound.
