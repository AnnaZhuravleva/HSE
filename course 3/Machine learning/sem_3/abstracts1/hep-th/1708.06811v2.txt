We study the relation between quantum computational complexity and general relativity. The quantum computational complexity is proposed to be quantified by the shortest length of geodesic quantum curves. We examine the complexity/volume duality in a geodesic causal ball in the framework of Fermi normal coordinates and derive the full non-linear Einstein equation. Using insights from the complexity/action duality, we argue that the accelerated expansion of the universe could be driven by the quantum complexity and free from coincidence and fine-tunning problems.
