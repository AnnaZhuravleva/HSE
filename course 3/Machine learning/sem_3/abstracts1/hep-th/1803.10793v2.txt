We present a prescription for an effective lightcone (LC) Hamiltonian that includes the effects of zero modes, focusing on the case of Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) deformed by relevant operators. We show how the prescription resolves a number of issues with LC quantization, including i) the apparent non-renormalization of the vacuum, ii) discrepancies in critical values of bare parameters in equal-time vs LC quantization, and iii) an inconsistency at large N in CFTs with simple AdS duals. We describe how LC quantization can drastically simplify Hamiltonian truncation methods applied to some large N CFTs, and discuss how the prescription identifies theories where these simplifications occur. We demonstrate and check our prescription in a number of examples.
