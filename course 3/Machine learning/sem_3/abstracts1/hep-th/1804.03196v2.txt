We propose non-linear equations for the formal Type-B Higher Spin Gravity that is dual to the free fermion or to the Gross-Neveu model, depending on the boundary conditions. The equations are directly obtained from the first principles: the gauge invariance of the CFT partition function on an arbitrary background for single-trace operators. We also get equations describing propagation of certain mixed-symmetry fields over higher spin flat backgrounds.
