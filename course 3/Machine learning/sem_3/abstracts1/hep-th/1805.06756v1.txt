Relativistic fluid hydrodynamics, organized as an effective field theory in the velocity gradients, has zero radius of convergence due to the presence of non-hydrodynamic excitations. Likewise, the theory of elasticity of brittle solids, organized as an effective field theory in the strain gradients, has zero radius of convergence due to the process of the thermal nucleation of cracks. Viscoelastic materials share properties of both fluids and solids. We use holographic gauge theory/gravity correspondence to study all order hydrodynamics of relativistic viscoelastic media.
