Circularly polarized photons have the Berry curvature in the semiclassical regime. Based on the kinetic equation for such chiral photons, we derive the (non)equilibrium expression of the photon current in the direction of the vorticity. We briefly discuss the relevance of this "photonic chiral vortical effect" in pulsars and rotating massive stars and its possible realization in semiconductors.
