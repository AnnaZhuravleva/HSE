A mathematically correct approach to study theories with infinite-dimensional groups of symmetries is presented. It is based on quasi-invariant measures on the groups. In this paper, the properties of the measure on the group of diffeomorphisms are used to evaluate the functional integrals in the Schwarzian theory. As an important example of the application of the new technique, we explicitly evaluate the correlation functions in the Schwarzian theory.
