We study large $N$ tensor models on the lattice without disorder. We introduce techniques which can be applied to a wide class of models, and illustrate it by studying some specific rank-3 tensor models. In particular, we study Klebanov-Tarnopolsky model on lattice, Gurau-Witten model (by treating it as a tensor model on four sites) and also a new model which interpolates between these two models. In each model, we evaluate various four point functions at large $N$ and strong coupling, and discuss their spectrum and long time behaviors. We find similarities as well as differences from SYK model. We also generalize our analysis to rank-$D$ tensor models where we obtain analogous results as $D=3$ case for the four point functions which we computed. For $D>5$, we are able to compute the next-to-subleading ${1 \over N}$ corrections for a specific four point function.
