A new class of shifted homotopy operators in higher-spin gauge theory is introduced. A sufficient condition for locality of dynamical equations is formulated and Pfaffian Locality Theorem identifying a subclass of shifted homotopies that decrease the degree of non-locality in higher orders of the perturbative expansion is proven. Resolution of identity for the total covariant derivative in terms of an arbitrary set of shifted homotopy operators is presented.
