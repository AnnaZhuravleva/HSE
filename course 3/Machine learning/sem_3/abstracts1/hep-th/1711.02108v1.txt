We calculate the scaling dimensions of operators with large global charge and spin in 2+1 dimensional conformal field theories. By the state-operator correspondence, these operators correspond to superfluids with vortices and can be systematically studied using effective field theory. As the spin increases from zero to the unitarity bound, the superfluid state corresponding to the lowest dimension operator passes through three distinct regimes: (1) a single phonon, (2) two vortices, and (3) multiple vortices. We also calculate correlation functions with two such operators and the Noether current.
