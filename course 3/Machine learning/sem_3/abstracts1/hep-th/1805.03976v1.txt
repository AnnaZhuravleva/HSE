In this letter, we propose a novel mechanism with warped extra dimension to solve the hierarchy problem, which is parallel to the famous Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane scenario. Different from the RS scenario, the fundamental scale is TeV scale in this new mechanism and the four-dimensional Planck scale is generated from the exponential warped extra dimension at size of a few TeV$^{-1}$. The explicit realizations are constructed in the nonlocal gravity theory and scalar-tensor theory. The experimental consequences of this scenario are very different from that of the RS scenario.
