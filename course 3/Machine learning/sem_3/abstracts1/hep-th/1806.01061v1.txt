In this paper we will show some applications achieved within type IIB superstring backgrounds since the emergence of the AdS/CFT correspondence. This correspondence relates a super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory, with strong coupling, and a type IIB superstring theory, with weak coupling. The use of the AdS/CFT correspondence allows us to investigate many aspects of hadronic physics described by QCD outside the perturbative regime, for example, glueball masses and the Regge trajectories related to the pomeron and the odderon. Throughout the text we will deal with the AdS/CFT correspondence within the two dynamical versions to the holographic softwall model.
