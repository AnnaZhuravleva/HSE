Because of the presence of a cosmological horizon the dilute instanton gas approximation used for the derivation of the Coleman-De Luccia tunneling rate in de Sitter spacetime receives additional contributions due to the finite instanton separation. Here I calculate the first corrections to the vacuum decay rate that arise from this effect and depend on the parameters of the theory and the cosmological constant of the background spacetime.
