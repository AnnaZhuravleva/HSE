Wavefunctions are proposed for a class of Lagrangian branes in three complex-dimensional space. The branes are asymptotic to Legendrian surfaces of genus g. The expansion of these wavefunctions in appropriate coordinates conjecturally encodes all-genus open Gromov-Witten invariants, i.e. the free energy of the topological open string.   This paper is written in physics language, but tries to welcome mathematicians. Most results stem from joint mathematical works with Linhui Shen and David Treumann.
