Nonlinear transport phenomena induced by the chiral anomaly are explored within a 4D field theory defined holographically as $U(1)_V\times U(1)_A$ Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in Schwarzschild-$AdS_5$. First, in presence of external electromagnetic fields, a general form of vector and axial currents is derived. Then, within the gradient expansion up to third order, we analytically compute all (over 50) transport coefficients. A wealth of new phenomena beyond the Chiral Magnetic and Chiral Separation Effects are discovered. Particularly, the charge diffusion constant and dispersion relation of Chiral Magnetic Wave are found to receive anomaly-induced non-linear corrections due to e/m background fields. Furthermore, there emerges a new gapless mode, which we refer to as {\it Chiral Hall Density Wave}, propagating along the background Poynting vector.
