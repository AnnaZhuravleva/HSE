We study what we call the all-loop anisotropic bosonized Thirring sigma model. This interpolates between the WZW model and the non-Abelian T-dual of the principal chiral model for a simple group. It has an invariance involving the inversion of the matrix parametrizing the coupling constants. We compute the general renormalization group flow equations which assume a remarkably simple form and derive its properties. For symmetric couplings, they consistently truncate to previous results in the literature. One of the examples we provide gives rise to a first order system of differential equations interpolating between the Lagrange and the Darboux-Halphen integrable systems.
