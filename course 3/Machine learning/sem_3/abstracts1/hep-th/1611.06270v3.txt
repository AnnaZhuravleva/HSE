Motivated by the desire to improve our understanding of the Weak Gravity Conjecture, we compute the one-loop correction of charged particles to the geometry and entropy of extremal black holes in 4d. We find that fermion loops provide evidence for the necessity of the `magnetic' WGC cutoff. Moreover, for a certain regime of black holes, we find entropy corrections with unusual area scaling. The corrections are reduced when supersymmetry is present, and disappear in ${\cal N}=4$ supergravity. We further provide some speculative arguments that in a theory with only sub-extremal particles, classical Reissner-Nordstrom black holes actually possess an infinite microcanonical entropy, though only a finite amount is visible to an external observer.
