We study the holographic entanglement entropy of spatial regions having arbitrary shapes in the AdS4/BCFT3 correspondence with static gravitational backgrounds, focusing on the subleading term with respect to the area law term in its expansion as the UV cutoff vanishes. An analytic expression depending on the unit vector normal to the minimal area surface anchored to the entangling curve is obtained. When the bulk spacetime is a part of AdS4, this formula becomes the Willmore functional with a proper boundary term evaluated on the minimal surface viewed as a submanifold of a three dimensional flat Euclidean space with boundary. For some smooth domains, the analytic expressions of the finite term are reproduced, including the case of a disk disjoint from a boundary which is either flat or circular. When the spatial region contains corners adjacent to the boundary, the subleading term is a logarithmic divergence whose coefficient is determined by a corner function that is known analytically, and this result is also recovered. A numerical approach is employed to construct extremal surfaces anchored to entangling curves with arbitrary shapes. This analysis is used both to check some analytic results and to find numerically the finite term of the holographic entanglement entropy for some ellipses at finite distance from a flat boundary.
