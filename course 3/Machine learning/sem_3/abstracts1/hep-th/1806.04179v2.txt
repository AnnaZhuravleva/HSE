The linearized equations of `New Massive Gravity' propagate a parity doublet of massive spin-2 modes in 3D Minkowski spacetime, but a different non-linear extension is made possible by `third-way' consistency.   There is a `Chern-Simons-like' action, as for other 3D massive gravity models, but the new theory is `exotic': its action is parity odd. This `Exotic Massive Gravity' is the next-to-simplest case in an infinite sequence of third-way consistent 3D gravity theories, the simplest being the `Minimal Massive Gravity' alternative to `Topologically Massive Gravity'.
