In this paper, we consider the unitary critical restricted-solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice $\mathcal{M}(5,6)$ model with integrable boundary conditions. We introduce its commuting double row transfer matrix satisfying the universal functional relations, and we use it in order to study the analytic structure of the transfer matrix eigenvalues and plot representative zero configurations of sample eigenvalues of the transfer matrix. We finally conclude with a comparative analysis with the critical and tricritical Ising models with integrable boundary conditions.
