The first law of entanglement has been used to obtain the linearized Einstein equations of the holographic dual spacetimes. In the present paper, the first law of entanglement in quasi-topological gravity is explicitly derived by using the Iyer-Wald formalism. In addition, we investigate the extended first law of entanglement for the special case in Quasi-Topological gravity.
