We argue that the region behind the horizon of a one-sided black hole can be probed by an analogue of the double-trace deformation protocol of Gao-Jafferis-Wall. This is achieved via a deformation of the CFT Hamiltonian by a term of the form ${\cal O} \widetilde{\cal O}$, where $\widetilde{\cal O}$ denote the state-dependent "mirror operators". We argue that this deformation creates negative energy shockwaves in the bulk, which allow particles inside the horizon to escape and to get directly detected in the CFT. This provides evidence for the smoothness of the horizon of black holes dual to typical states. We argue that the mirror operators allow us to perform an analogue of the Hayden-Preskill decoding protocol. Our claims rely on a technical conjecture about the chaotic behavior of out-of-time-order correlators on typical pure states at scrambling time.
