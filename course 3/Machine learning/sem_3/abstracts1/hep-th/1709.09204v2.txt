Motivated by an analysis of the sub-superalgebras of the five-dimensional superconformal algebra $F(4)$, we search for the holographic duals to co-dimension one superconformal defects in 5d CFTs which have $SO(4,2) \oplus U(1)$ bosonic symmetry. In particular, we look for domain wall solutions to six-dimensional $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to a single vector multiplet. It is found that supersymmetric domain wall solutions do not exist unless there is a non-trivial profile for one of the vector multiplet scalars which is charged under the gauged $SU(2)$ R-symmetry. This non-trivial profile breaks the $SU(2)$ to $U(1)$, thus matching expectations from the superalgebra analysis. A consistent set of BPS equations is then obtained and solved numerically. While the numerical solutions are generically singular and thought to be dual to boundary CFTs, it is found that for certain fine-tuned choices of parameters regular Janus solutions may be obtained.
