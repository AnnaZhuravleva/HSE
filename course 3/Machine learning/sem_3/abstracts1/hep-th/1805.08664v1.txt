We argue that the Black Hole-Neutron Star (BH-NS) binaries are the natural astrophysical probes of quantum gravity in the context of the new era of multi-messenger astronomy. In particular, we discuss the observable effect of enhanced black-hole mass loss in a BH-NS binary, due to the presence of an additional length scale tied to the intrinsic non-commutativity of quantum spacetime in quantum gravity.
