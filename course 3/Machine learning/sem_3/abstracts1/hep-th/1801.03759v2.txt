We present a detailed microscopic study of edge excitations for n filled Landau levels. We show that the higher-level wavefunctions possess a non-trivial radial dependence that should be integrated over for properly defining the edge conformal field theory. This analysis let us clarify the role of the electron orbital spin s in the edge theory and to discuss its universality, thus providing a further instance of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We find that the values s_i for each level, i=1,...,n, parameterize a Casimir effect or chemical potential shift that could be experimentally observed. These results are generalized to fractional and hierarchical fillings by exploiting the W-infinity symmetry of incompressible Hall fluids.
