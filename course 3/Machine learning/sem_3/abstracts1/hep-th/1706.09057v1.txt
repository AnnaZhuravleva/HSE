In a low energy approximation of the massless Yukawa theory (Nelson model) we derive a Faddeev-Kulish type formula for the scattering matrix of $N$ electrons and reformulate it in LSZ terms. To this end, we perform a decomposition of the infrared finite Dollard modifier into clouds of real and virtual photons, whose infrared divergencies mutually cancel. We point out that in the original work of Faddeev and Kulish the clouds of real photons are omitted, and consequently their scattering matrix is ill-defined on the Fock space of free electrons. To support our observations, we compare our final LSZ expression for $N=1$ with a rigorous non-perturbative construction due to Pizzo. While our discussion contains some heuristic steps, they can be formulated as clear-cut mathematical conjectures.
