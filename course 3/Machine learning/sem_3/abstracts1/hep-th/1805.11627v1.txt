We consider the planar limit of Chern-Simons theories coupled to a scalar $\phi$ in the fundamental representation of a $U(N)_k$ gauge group, at both the regular and Wilson-Fisher conformal points. These theories have one single-trace scalar operator $J_0=\phi^{\dagger}\phi$. We calculate its connected planar $n$-point functions, when all the external momenta are collinear. More specifically, we derive an algebraic recurrence relation that expresses each such $n$-point function in terms of lower-point ones. As an application, we study the four-point function, which was recently shown to be completely fixed up to three truncated solutions to the conformal bootstrap. We show that those truncated solutions do not contribute in our bosonic Chern-Simons theories. The result matches a recent calculation of the four-point function in Chern-Simons theories coupled to a fermion, providing a new test of 3d bosonization duality.
