We construct a black hole geometry generated by the intersection of $N_c$ color D3- branes and $N_f$ flavor D5-branes along a 2+1 dimensional subspace. Working in the Veneziano limit in which $N_f$ is large and distributing homogeneously the D5-branes in the internal space, we calculate the solution of the equations of motion of supergravity plus sources which includes the backreaction of the flavor branes. The solution is analytic and dual to a 2+1 dimensional defect in a 3+1 dimensional gauge theory, with $N_f$ massless hypermultiplets living in the defect. The smeared background we obtain can be regarded as the holographic realization of a multilayered system. We study the thermodynamics of the resulting spatially anisotropic geometry and compute the first and second order transport coefficients for perturbations propagating along the defect. We find that, in our system, the dynamics of excitations within a layer can be described by a stack of effective D2-branes.
