Integration-by-parts identities between loop integrals arise from the vanishing integration of total derivatives in dimensional regularization. Generic choices of total derivatives in the Baikov or parametric representations lead to identities which involve dimension shifts. These dimension shifts can be avoided by imposing a certain constraint on the total derivatives. The solutions of this constraint turn out to be a specific type of syzygies which correspond to logarithmic vector fields along the Gram determinant formed of the independent external and loop momenta. We present an explicit generating set of solutions in Baikov representation, valid for any number of loops and external momenta, obtained from the Laplace expansion of the Gram determinant. We provide a rigorous mathematical proof that this set of solutions is complete. This proof relates the logarithmic vector fields in question to ideals of submaximal minors of the Gram matrix and makes use of classical resolutions of such ideals.
