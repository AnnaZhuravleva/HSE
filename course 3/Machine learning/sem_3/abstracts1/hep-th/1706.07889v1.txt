We study the time development of strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) theory on cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) backgrounds via the AdS/CFT correspondence. We implement the cosmological background as a boundary metric fulfilling the Friedmann equation with a four-dimensional cosmological constant and a dark radiation term. We analyze the dual bulk solution of the type IIB supergravity and find that the time-dependence of the FRW background strongly influences the dynamical properties of the SYM theory. We in particular find a phase transition between a confined and a deconfined phase. We also argue that some cosmological solutions could be related to the inflationary scenario.
