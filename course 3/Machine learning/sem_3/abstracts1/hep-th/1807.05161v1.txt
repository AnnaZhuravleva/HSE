The Gauss law plays a basic role in gauge theories, enforcing gauge invariance and creating edge states and superselection sectors. This article surveys these aspects of the Gauss law in QED, QCD and nonlinear $G/H$ models. It is argued that nonabelian superselection rules are spontaneously broken. That is the case with $SU(3)$ of colour which is spontaneously broken to $U(1)\times U(1)$. Nonlinear $G/H$ models are reformulated as gauge theories and the existence of edge states and superselection sectors in these models is also established.
