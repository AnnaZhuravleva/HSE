We point out that the $\text{USp}$ symmetry associated to a full twisted puncture of a class S theory of type $A_\text{even}$ has the global anomaly associated to $\pi_4(\text{USp})=\mathbb{Z}_2$. We discuss manifestations of this fact in the context of the superconformal field theory $R_{2,2N}$ introduced by Chacaltana, Distler and Trimm. For example, we find that this theory can be thought of as a natural ultraviolet completion of an infrared-free $\text{SO}(2N+1)$ gauge theory with $2N$ flavors, whose $\text{USp}(4N)$ symmetry clearly has the global anomaly.
