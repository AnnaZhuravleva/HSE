We use conformal symmetry to define an AdS$_3$ proto-field $\phi$ as an exact linear combination of Virasoro descendants of a CFT$_2$ primary operator $\mathcal{O}$. We find that both symmetry considerations and a gravitational Wilson line formalism lead to the same results. The operator $\phi$ has many desirable properties; in particular it has correlators that agree with gravitational perturbation theory when expanded at large $c$, and that automatically take the correct form in all vacuum AdS$_3$ geometries, including BTZ black hole backgrounds. In the future it should be possible to use $\phi$ to probe bulk locality and black hole horizons at a non-perturbative level.
