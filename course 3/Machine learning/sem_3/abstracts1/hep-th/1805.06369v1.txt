We present s-confinement phases for three-index matters in three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. We find that the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(6)$ and $USp(6)$ gauge theories with three-index anti-symmetric matters show confining phases. The exact superpotentials which describe their low-energy dynamics are derived. We check the validity of our analysis in various ways, including superconformal indices and some deformations.
