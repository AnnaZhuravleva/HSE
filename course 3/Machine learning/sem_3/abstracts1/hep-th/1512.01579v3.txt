We explore the distribution of topological numbers in Calabi-Yau manifolds, using the Kreuzer-Skarke dataset of hypersurfaces in toric varieties as a testing ground. While the Hodge numbers are well-known to exhibit mirror symmetry, patterns in frequencies of combination thereof exhibit striking new patterns. We find pseudo-Voigt and Planckian distributions with high confidence and exact fit for many substructures. The patterns indicate typicality within the landscape of Calabi-Yau manifolds of various dimension.
