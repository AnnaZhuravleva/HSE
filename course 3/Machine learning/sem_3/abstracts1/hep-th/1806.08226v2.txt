Within the extended phase space thermodynamics, we study aspects of power Yang-Mills and power Maxwell black holes at criticality, as the corresponding non-linearity power parameters $\gamma$ and $s$ are varied. On comparison, the approach of efficiency of heat engines to Carnot limit in both the systems is shown to coincide when $\gamma =s=1$. For $\gamma=s> (<) 1$, Maxwell (Yang-Mills) system dominates over Yang-Mills (Maxwell). The motion of charged particles in the critical Power Yang-Mills system is then investigated, together with a study of variation of critical mass to charge ratios with the power $\gamma$.
