Statistical average of the axial current is evaluated on the basis of the covariant Wigner function. In the resulting formula, chemical potential $\mu$, angular velocity $\Omega$ and acceleration $a$ enter in combination $\mu \pm (\Omega \pm ia)/2$. The limiting cases of zero mass and zero temperature are investigated in detail. In the zero-mass limit, the axial current is described by a smooth function only at temperatures higher than the Unruh temperature. At zero temperature, the axial current, as a function of the angular velocity and chemical potential, vanishes in a two-dimensional plane region.
