We explore the non-singlet sector of matrix quantum mechanics dual to $c=1$ Liouville theory. The non-singlets are obtained by adding $N_{f}$ fundamental and anti-fundamental fields in the gauged matrix quantum mechanics model as well as a one dimensional Chern - Simons term. The present model is associated with a spin - Calogero model in the presence of external magnetic field. In chiral variables, the low energy excitations-currents satisfy an ${SU(2N_{f})}_{\tilde{k}}$ K\v{a}c Moody algebra at large $N$. We then analyse the canonical partition function, discuss a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition at large $N, N_f$ and study different limits of the parameters. We recognise the grand canonical partition function as a $\tau$- function obeying discrete soliton equations. In a certain limit we also recover the matrix model of Kazakov-Kostov-Kutasov conjectured to describe the two dimensional black hole ($SL(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ coset). Finally, we discuss several implications that our model has for the understanding of the thermodynamics and the physics of such string theory states.
