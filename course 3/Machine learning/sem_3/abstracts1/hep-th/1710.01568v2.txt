In this paper, we first investigated collision of two particles in the massive gravity black hole solution and obtained the center-of-mass energy and the effective potential. The corresponding potential plays an important role for the describing stability and energy spectrum of the system. It that case, we have some figures. Also, here we obtained the corresponding Lagrangian and calculated some canonical relations and conserved quantities. These quantities helped us to make the Hamiltonian for the massive gravity system without charges. In order to apply the non-commutative geometry to the pointed Hamiltonian we modified such quantity in terms of new variables. The new variables lead us to have new Hamiltonian in form of harmonic oscillator model. And then we applied the non-commutative geometry to the corresponding deformed Hamiltonian and obtained the Lagrangian of massive gravity. Finally, we compared Lagrangian of massive gravity in non-commutative geometry with Finsler geometry and also obtained the relation between $\theta$ and $\beta$ with $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$.
