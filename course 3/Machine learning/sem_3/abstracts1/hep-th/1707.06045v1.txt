In this paper, we investigate the center of mass energy of the collision for three neutral particles with different rest masses falling freely from rest at infinity in the background of a Kerr-Modified-Gravity black hole. Further, we discuss the center of mass energy near the horizon(s) of an extremal and non-extremal Kerr-Modified-Gravity black hole and show that an arbitrarily high center of mass energy is achievable under some restrictions.
