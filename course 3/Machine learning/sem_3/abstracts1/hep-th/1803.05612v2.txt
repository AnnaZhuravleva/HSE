We study supersymmetric Wilson loops in $d=3$, $\mathcal{N}=3$ harmonic superspace, leading to a construction of a supersymmetrized generalization of the $\frac{1}{3}$-BPS Wilson loop for $\mathcal{N}=3$ gauge theories. This also includes a generalization of the $\frac{1}{6}$-BPS loop for ABJM theory. We perform a 'one-loop' computation of the vacuum expectation value of this operator directly in superspace and compare with the known $\mathcal{N}=2$ localization results at large $N$. This comparison also lets us identify certain fermionic contributions that do not receive any subleading corrections.
