Linearized supergravity in arbitrary dimension is reformulated into a first order formalism which treats the graviton and its dual on the same footing at the level of the action. This generalizes previous work by other authors in two directions: 1) we work in arbitrary space-time dimension, and 2) the gravitino field and supersymmetry are also considered. This requires the construction of conformally invariant curvatures (the Cotton fields) for a family of mixed symmetry tensors and tensor-spinors, whose properties we prove (invariance; completeness; conformal Poincar\'e lemma). We use these geometric tools to solve the Hamiltonian constraints appearing in the first order formalism of the graviton and gravitino: the constraints are solved through the introduction of prepotentials enjoying (linearized) conformal invariance. These new variables (two tensor fields for the graviton, one tensor-spinor for the gravitino) are injected into the action and equations of motion, which take a geometrically simple form in terms of the Cotton tensor(-spinors) of the prepotentials. In particular, the equations of motion of the graviton are equivalent to twisted self-duality conditions. We express the supersymmetric transformations of the graviton and gravitino into each other in terms of the prepotentials. We also reproduce the dimensional reduction of supergravity within the prepotential formalism. Finally, our formulas in dimension five are recovered from the dimensional reduction of the already known prepotential formulation of the six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$ maximally supersymmetric theory.
