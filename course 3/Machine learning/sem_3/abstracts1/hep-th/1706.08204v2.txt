We investigate the strong coupling limit of a family of Chern-Simons-matter theories in the planar limit. The family consists of ${\cal N}=3$ theories with the gauge group ${\rm U}(N_1)_{k_1}\times{\rm U}(N_2)_{k_2}$ coupled to $n$ bi-fundamental hypermultiplets. All observables which can be determined from the planar resolvent turn out to have finite limits in the large 't Hooft coupling limit. Possible gravity duals are briefly discussed. We observe that Kac-Moody algebras govern the structure of the planar spectral curves of the theories.
