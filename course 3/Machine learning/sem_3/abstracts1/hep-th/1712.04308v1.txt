Reflection positivity constitutes an integral prerequisite in the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem which relates quantum field theories defined on Euclidean space to their Lorentzian signature counterparts. In this work we rigorously prove the violation of reflection positivity in a large class of free scalar fields with a rational propagator. This covers in particular higher-derivative theories where the propagator admits a partial fraction decomposition as well as degenerate cases including e.g. p^4 -type propagators.
