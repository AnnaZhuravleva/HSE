The basic idea and some physical implications of nonlinear supersymmetric general relativity (NLSUSY GR) are presented. NLSUSY GR may give new insights into the origin of mass and the mysterious relations between the cosmology and the low energy particle physics, e.g. the spontaneous SUSY breaking scale, the cosmological constant, the (dark) energy density of the universe and the neutrino mass.
