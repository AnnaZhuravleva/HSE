Aiming at improving our knowledge of the low-energy limit of heterotic orbifold compactifications, we determine at lowest order the Kahler potential of matter fields in the case where more than three bulk Kahler moduli appear. Interestingly, bulk matter fields couple to more than one Kahler modulus, a subtle difference with models with only three Kahler moduli that may provide a tool to address the question of moduli stabilization in these models.
