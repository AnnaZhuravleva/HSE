Solvability of the ubiquitous quantum harmonic oscillator relies on a spectrum generating osp(1|2) superconformal symmetry. We study the problem of constructing all quantum mechanical models with a hidden osp(1|2) symmetry on a given space of states. This problem stems from interacting higher spin models coupled to gravity. In one dimension, we show that the solution to this problem is the Plyushchay family of quantum mechanical models with hidden superconformal symmetry obtained by viewing the harmonic oscillator as a one dimensional Dirac system, so that Grassmann parity equals wavefunction parity. These models--both oscillator and particle-like--realize all possible unitary irreducible representations of osp(1|2).
