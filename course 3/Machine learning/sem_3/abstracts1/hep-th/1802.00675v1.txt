We provide a fuzzball picture for Schwarzshild black holes, in which matters and energy consisting the hole are not positioned on the central point exclusively but oscillate around there in a serial of eigen-modes, each of which features a special level of binding degrees and are quantum mechanically possible to be measured outside the horizon. By listing these modes explicitly for holes as large as $6M_\mathrm{pl}$, we find that their number increases exponentially with the area. Basing on this picture, we present a simple but explicitly unitary derivation of hawking radiations.
