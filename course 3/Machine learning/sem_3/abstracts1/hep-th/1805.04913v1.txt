We consider a gas composed of a single family of standard model leptons which are approximately massless and trapped inside a charged rotating shell. Due to the magnetic vortical effect, the leptons gain momentum in the direction of the magnetic field induced by the rotating shell. We compute this momentum gain in a perturbative expansion and discuss the possible application of it to pulsar kicks.
