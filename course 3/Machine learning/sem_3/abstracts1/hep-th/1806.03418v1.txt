The creation of universes in entangled pairs with opposite values of the momenta conjugated to the configuration variables of the minisuperspace would be favoured in quantum cosmology by the conservation of the total momentum, in a parallel way as particles are created in pairs with opposite values of their momenta in a quantum field theory. Then, the matter fields that propagate in the two universes may become entangled too, the result of which is the appearance of a quasi thermal state that would produce a specific and distinguishable pattern in the spectrum of fluctuations of the matter fields in the early universe.
