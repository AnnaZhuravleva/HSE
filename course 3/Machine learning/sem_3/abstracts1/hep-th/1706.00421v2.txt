We consider the BRST symmetric four dimensional BF theory, a topological theory, containing antysymmetric tensor fields in Landau gauge and extend the BRST symmetry by introducing a shift symmetry to it. Within this formulation, the antighost fields corresponding to shift symmetry coincide with antifields of standard field/antifield formulation. Further, we provide a superspace description for the BF model possessing extended BRST and extended anti-BRST transformations.
