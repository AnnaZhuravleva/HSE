We compute conformal correlation functions with spinor, tensor, and spinor-tensor primary fields in general dimensions with Euclidean and Lorentzian metrics. The spinors are taken to be Dirac spinors, which exist for any dimensions. For this, the embedding space formalism is employed and the polarisation spinors are introduced to simplify the computations. Three-point functions are rewritten in terms of differential operators acting on scalar-scalar-tensor correlation functions. This enables us to determine conformal blocks for four-point functions with scalar and spinor fields by acting the differential operators on scalar conformal blocks, which will be useful in finding their geodesic Witten diagrams.
