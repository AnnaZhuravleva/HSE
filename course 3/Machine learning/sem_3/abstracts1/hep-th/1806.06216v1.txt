The Complexity=Action conjecture is studied for black holes in Warped AdS$_3$ space, realized as solutions of Einstein gravity plus matter. The time dependence of the action of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is investigated, both for the non-rotating and the rotating case. The asymptotic growth rate is found to be equal to the Hawking temperature times the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy; this is in agreement with a previous calculation done using the Complexity=Volume conjecture.
