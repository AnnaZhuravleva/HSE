This paper is devoted to the construction of the Hamiltonian for non-relativistic string in the Newton-Cartan background. We start with the Hamiltonian for relativistic string in general background. Then we perform limiting procedure on the metric that leads to Newton-Cartan background. We determine constraint structure for non-relativistic string and show that these constraints are the first class constraints. Then we determine corresponding Lagrangian and discuss its properties.
