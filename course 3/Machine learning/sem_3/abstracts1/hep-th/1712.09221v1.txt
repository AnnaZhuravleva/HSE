We study asymptotic symmetry algebras for classes of three dimensional supergravities with and without cosmological constant. In the first part we generalise some of the non-Dirichlet boundary conditions of $AdS_3$ gravity to extended supergravity theories, and compute their asymptotic symmetries. In particular, we show that the boundary conditions proposed to holographically describe the chiral induced gravity and Liouville gravity do admit extension to the supergravity contexts with appropriate superalgebras as their asymptotic symmetry algebras. In the second part we consider generalisation of the 3d $BMS$ computation to extended supergravities without cosmological constant, and show that their asymptotic symmetry algebras provide examples of nonlinear extended superalgebras containing the $BMS_3$ algebra.
