In [1,2] it was shown that the subleading soft photon theorem in tree level amplitudes in massless QED is equivalent to a new class of symmetries of the theory parameterized by a vector field on the celestial sphere. In this paper, we extend these results to the subleading soft photon theorem in any Effective Field Theory containing photons and an arbitrary spectrum of massless particles. We show that the charges associated to the above class of symmetries are sensitive to certain three point functions of the theory and are corrected by irrelevant operators of specific dimensions. Our analysis shows that the subleading soft photon theorem in any tree level scattering amplitude is a statement about asymptotic symmetries of the ${\cal S}$-matrix.
