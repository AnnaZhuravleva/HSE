By entangling soft massless particles one can create an arbitrarily large amount of entanglement entropy that carries an arbitrarily small amount of energy. Dropping this entropy into the black hole (b.h.) one can increase the b.h. entropy by an amount that violates Bekenstein bound or any other reasonable bound, leading to a version of b.h. information paradox that does not involve Hawking radiation. Among many proposed solutions of the standard b.h. information paradox with Hawking radiation, only a few can also resolve this version without the Hawking radiation. The assumption that both versions should be resolved in the same way significantly helps to reduce the space of possible resolutions.
