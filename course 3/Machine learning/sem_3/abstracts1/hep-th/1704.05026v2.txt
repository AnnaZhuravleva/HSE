We investigate loop corrections to the primordial fluctuations in the single-field inflationary paradigm from spectator fields that experience a smooth transition of their vacuum expectation values. We show that when the phase transition involves a classical evolution effectively driven by a negative mass term from the potential, important corrections to the curvature perturbation can be generated by field perturbations that are frozen outside the horizon by the time of the phase transition, yet the correction to tensor perturbation is naturally suppressed by the spatial derivative couplings between spectator fields and graviton. At one-loop level, the dominant channel for the production of primordial fluctuations comes from a pair-scattering of free spectator fields that decay into the curvature perturbations, and this decay process is only sensitive to field masses comparable to the Hubble scale of inflation.
