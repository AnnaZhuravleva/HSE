These lecture notes are intended for starting PhD students in theoretical physics who have a working knowledge of General Relativity. The 4 topics covered are (1) Surface charges as conserved quantities in theories of gravity; (2) Classical and holographic features of three-dimensional Einstein gravity; (3) Asymptotically flat spacetimes in 4 dimensions: BMS group and memory effects; (4) The Kerr black hole: properties at extremality and quasi-normal mode ringing. Each topic starts with historical foundations and points to a few modern research directions.
