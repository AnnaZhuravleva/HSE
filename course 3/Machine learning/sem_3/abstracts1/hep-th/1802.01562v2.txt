We consider on the bulk side extensions of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model to Yang--Mills and higher spins. To this end we study generalizations of the Jackiw--Teitelboim (JT) model in the BF formulation. Our main goal is to obtain generalizations of the Schwarzian action, which we achieve in two ways: by considering the on-shell action supplemented by suitable boundary terms compatible with all symmetries, and by applying the Lee--Wald--Zoupas formalism to analyze the symplectic structure of dilaton gravity. We conclude with a discussion of the entropy (including log-corrections from higher spins) and a holographic dictionary for the generalized SYK/JT correspondence.
