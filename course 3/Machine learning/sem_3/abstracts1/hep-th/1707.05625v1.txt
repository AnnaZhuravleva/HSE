The aim of this work is to find exact solutions of the Dirac equation in 1+1 space-time beyond the already known class. We consider exact spin (and pseudo-spin) symmetric Dirac equations where the scalar potential is equal to plus (and minus) the vector potential. We also include pseudo-scalar potentials in the interaction. The spinor wavefunction is written as a bounded sum in a complete set of square integrable basis, which is chosen such that the matrix representation of the Dirac wave operator is tridiagonal and symmetric. This makes the matrix wave equation a symmetric three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction. We solve the recursion relation exactly in terms of orthogonal polynomials and obtain the state functions and corresponding relativistic energy spectrum and phase shift.
