We consider the description of form factors of local and Wilson line operators (reggeon amplitudes) in N=4 SYM within the framework of four dimensional ambitwistor string theory. We present the explicit expressions for string composite operators corresponding to stress-tensor operator supermultiplet and Wilson line operator insertion. It is shown, that corresponding tree-level string correlation functions correctly reproduce previously obtained Grassmannian integral representations. As by product we derive four dimensional tree-level scattering equations representations for the mentioned form factors and formulate a simple gluing procedure used to relate operator form factors with on-shell amplitudes.
