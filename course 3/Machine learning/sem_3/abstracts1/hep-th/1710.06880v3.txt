"Curvepole (2,0)-theory" is a deformation of the (2,0)-theory with nonlocal interactions. A "curvepole" is defined as a two-dimensional generalization of a dipole. It is an object of fixed two-dimensional shape whose boundary is a charged curve that interacts with a two-form gauge field. Curvepole theory was previously only defined indirectly via M-theory. Here we propose a supersymmetric Lagrangian, constructed explicitly up to quartic terms, for an "abelian" curvepole theory, which is an interacting deformation of the free (2,0) tensor mutliplet. This theory contains fields whose quanta are curvepoles (i.e., fixed-shape strings). Supersymmetry is preserved (at least up to quartic terms) if the shape of the curvepoles is (2d) planar. This nonlocal 6d QFT may also serve as a UV completion for certain (local) 5d gauge theories.
