We analyze the Hamiltonian structure of a general theory of bi-gravity where the interaction term is a function of the form $ V(Tr\sqrt{g^{-1}f}) $ or $ V(Tr(g^{-1}f)) $. We give necessary conditions for the interaction term of such a theory to be a ghost free. We show that in the bi-gravity of Hassan and Rosen, there exist enough additional constraints for omitting the ghost and generating diffeomorphism, as well. Our analysis shows that a model with $ V(Tr(g^{-1}f)) $, in principle is possible to be ghost free.
