We perform a canonical analysis of the bimetric theory in the metric formulation, computing the constraints and their algebra explicitly. In particular, we compute a secondary constraint, that has been argued to exist earlier, and show that it has the correct form to eliminate the ghost. We also identify a set of four first class constraints that generate the algebra of general covariance. The covariance algebra naturally determines a spacetime metric for the theory. However, in bimetric theory, this metric is not unique but depends on how the first class constraints are identified.
