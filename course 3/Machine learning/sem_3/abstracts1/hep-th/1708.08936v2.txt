We construct generalised diffeomorphisms for E$_9$ exceptional field theory. The transformations, which like in the E$_8$ case contain constrained local transformations, close when acting on fields. This is the first example of a generalised diffeomorphism algebra based on an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra and an infinite-dimensional coordinate module. As a byproduct, we give a simple generic expression for the invariant tensors used in any extended geometry. We perform a generalised Scherk--Schwarz reduction and verify that our transformations reproduce the structure of gauged supergravity in two dimensions. The results are valid also for other affine algebras.
