In the framework of a bimetric model, we discuss a relation between the (modified) Friedmann equations and a mechanical system similar to the quantum Hall effect problem. Firstly, we show how these modified Friedmann equations are mapped to an anisotropic two-dimensional charged harmonic oscillator in the presence of a constant magnetic field, with the frequencies of the oscillator playing the role of the cosmological constants. This problem has two energy scales leading to the identification of two different regimes, namely, one dominated by the cosmological constants, with exponential expansions for the scale factors, and the other dominated by a magnetic seed, which would be responsible for both a component of dark energy and a primordial magnetic field. The latter regime would be described by a (nonperturbative) mapping between the cosmological evolution and the quantum Hall effect.
