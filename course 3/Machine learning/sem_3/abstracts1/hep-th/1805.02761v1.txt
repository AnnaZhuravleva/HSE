We discuss the relation between knot polynomials and the KP hierarchy. Mainly, we study the scaling 1-hook property of the coloured Alexander polynomial: $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{K}_R(q)=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{K}_{[1]}(q^{\vert R\vert})$ for all 1-hook Young diagrams $R$. Via the Kontsevich construction, it is reformulated as a system of linear equations. It appears that the solutions of this system induce the KP equations in the Hirota form. The Alexander polynomial is a specialization of the HOMFLY polynomial, and it is a kind of a dual to the double scaling limit, which gives the special polynomial, in the sense that, while the special polynomials provide solutions to the KP hierarchy, the Alexander polynomials provide the equations of this hierarchy. This gives a new connection with integrable properties of knot polynomials and puts an interesting question about the way the KP hierarchy is encoded in the full HOMFLY polynomial.
