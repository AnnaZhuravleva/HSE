In this paper, we study $P-V$ criticality for the charged accelerating AdS black hole and determine some critical quantities. Here, we consider two different approaches as heat capacity and thermodynamic geometry and investigate phase transition of corresponding black hole in nonextended and extended phase space. We show that in canonical ensemble (fixed electric charge), the heat capacity approach give us two types of phase transition as type one and two. Then we study thermodynamic geometry of the black hole by two separate methods as thermodynamic metric and metric independent way. By comparing the obtained results, we notice that the thermodynamic metric approach can not describe both phase transition simultaneously and also divergent point of Ricci scalar do'nt coincide with phase transition point for some cases. By investigation of metric independent way we find that curvature scalar (of equilibrium state space geometry) is singular at the point where specific heat diverges and this method is suitable approach to describe thermodynamic geometry of accelerating charged black hole.
