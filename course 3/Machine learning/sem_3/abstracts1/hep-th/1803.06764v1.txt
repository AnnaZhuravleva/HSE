We construct analytic solutions of Einstein gravity coupled to a dilaton field with a potential given by a sum of two exponentials, by rewriting the equations of motion in terms of an integrable Toda chain. Such solutions can be interpreted as domain walls interpolating between different asymptotics, and as such they can have interesting applications in holography. In some cases we can find flows that start from an AdS fixed point. We also find analytic black brane solutions at finite temperature. We discuss the properties of the solutions and the interpretation in terms of RG flow.
