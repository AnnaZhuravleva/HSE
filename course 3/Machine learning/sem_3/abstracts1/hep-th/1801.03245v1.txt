We propose a holographic duality between a 2 dimensional (2d) chiral superconformal field theory and a certain theory of supergravity in 3d with flatspace boundary conditions that is obtained as a double scaling limit of a parity breaking theory of supergravity. We show how the asymptotic symmetries of the bulk theory reduce from the "despotic" Super Bondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra (or equivalently the Inhomogeneous Super Galilean Conformal Algebra) to a single copy of the Super-Virasoro algebra in this limit and also reproduce the same reduction from a study of null vectors in the putative 2d dual field theory.
