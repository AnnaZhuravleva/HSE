We examine the gyromagnetic ratios of rotating and charged AdS black holes in four and higher spacetime dimensions. We compute the gyromagnetic ratio for Kerr-AdS black holes with an arbitrary electric charge in four dimensions and show that it corresponds to g=2 irrespective of the AdS nature of the spacetime. We also compute the gyromagnetic ratio for Kerr-AdS black holes with a single angular momentum and with a test electric charge in all higher dimensions. The gyromagnetic ratio crucially depends on the dimensionless ratio of the rotation parameter to the curvature radius of the AdS background. At the critical limit, when the boundary Einstein universe is rotating at the speed of light, it exhibits a striking feature leading to g=2 regardless of the spacetime dimension. Next, we extend our consideration to include the exact metric for five-dimensional rotating charged black holes in minimal gauged supergravity. We show that the value of the gyromagnetic ratio found in the "test-charge" approach remains unchanged for these black holes.
