We consider a scenario of cosmological inflation coming from a grand unified theory in higher dimensional orbifold. Flatness of the potential is automatically guaranteed in this orbifold setup thanks to the nonlocality of the Wilson line on higher dimensions and the local quantum gravitational corrections are exponentially suppressed. The spectral index of scalar perturbation (n_s =0.92 - 0.97) and a significant production of gravitational waves are predicted (r= T/S= 0.01 - 0.12) in the perturbative regime of gauge interaction, (1/g_4 = (5-20) X 2 pi R Mpl) where the size of compactification is constrained (R Mpl = 20- 45) by the measurement of scalar power spectrum (Delta_R = 5 X 10^-5).
