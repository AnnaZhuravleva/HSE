This is a collection of notes that are about spectral form factors of standard ensembles in the random matrix theory, written for the practical usage of current study of late time quantum chaos. More precisely, we consider Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE), Wishart-Laguerre Unitary Ensemble (LUE), Wishart-Laguerre Orthogonal Ensemble (LOE), and Wishart-Laguerre Symplectic Ensemble (LSE). These results and their physics applications cover a three-fold classification of late time quantum chaos in terms of spectral form factors.
