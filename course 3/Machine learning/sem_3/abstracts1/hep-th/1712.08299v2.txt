In this work, we study the phenomena of quantum entanglement by computing de Sitter entanglement entropy from von Neumann measure. For this purpose we consider a bipartite quantum field theoretic setup in presence of axion originating from ${\bf Type~ II~B}$ string theory. We consider the initial vacuum to be CPT invariant non-adiabatic $\alpha$ vacua state under ${\bf SO(1,4)}$ ismometry, which is characterized by a real one-parameter family. To implement this technique we use a ${\bf S^2}$ which divide the de Sitter into two exterior and interior sub-regions. First, we derive the wave function of axion in an open chart for $\alpha$ vacua by applying Bogoliubov transformation on the solution for Bunch-Davies vacuum state. Further, we quantify the density matrix by tracing over the contribution from the exterior region. Using this result we derive entanglement entropy, R$\acute{e}$nyi entropy and explain the long-range quantum effects in primordial cosmological correlations. We also provide a comparison between the results obtained from Bunch-Davies vacuum and the generalized $\alpha$ vacua, which implies that the amount of quantum entanglement and the long-range effects are larger for non zero value of the parameter $\alpha$. Most significantly, our derived results for $\alpha$ vacua provides the necessary condition for generating non zero entanglement entropy in primordial cosmology.
