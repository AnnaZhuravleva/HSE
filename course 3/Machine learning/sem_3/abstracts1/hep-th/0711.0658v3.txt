We study the mechanism of particle production in the world-volume of a probe anti D6-brane (or D6 with SUSY breaking) moving in the background created by a fixed stack of $D6$-branes. We show that this may occur in a regime of parametric resonance when the probe's motion is non-relativistic and it moves at large distances from the source branes in low eccentricity orbits. This leads to an exponential growth of the particle number in the probe's world-volume and constitutes an effective mechanism for producing very massive particles. We also analyze the evolution of this system in an expanding universe and how this affects the development of the parametric resonance. We discuss the effects of transverse space compactification on the probe's motion, showing that it leads to the creation of angular momentum in a similar way to the Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis. Finally, we describe possible final states of the system and their potential relevance to cosmology.
