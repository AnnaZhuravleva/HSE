We report a systematic study of the stringy interaction between two sets of Dp branes placed parallel at a separation in the presence of two worldvolume fluxes for each set. We focus in this paper on that the two fluxes on one set have the same structure as those on the other set but they in general differ in values, which can be both electric or both magnetic or one electric and one magnetic. We compute the respective stringy interaction amplitude and find that the presence of electric fluxes gives rise to the open string pair production while that of magnetic ones to the open string tachyon mode. The interplay of these two leads to the open string pair production enhancement in certain cases when one flux is electric and the other is magnetic. In particular, we find that this enhancement occurs even when the electric flux and the magnetic one share one common field strength index which is impossible in the one-flux case studied previously by the present author and his collaborator in \cite{Lu:2009au}. This type of enhancement may have realistic physical applications, say, as a means to explore the existence of extra dimensions.
