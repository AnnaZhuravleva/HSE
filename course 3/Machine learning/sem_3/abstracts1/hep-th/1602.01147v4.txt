We investigate the application of our recent holographic entanglement negativity conjecture for higher dimensional conformal field theories to specific examples which serve as crucial consistency checks. In this context we compute the holographic entanglement negativity for bipartite pure and finite temperature mixed state configurations in $d$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to bulk pure $AdS_{d+1}$ geometry and $AdS_{d+1}$-Schwarzschild black holes respectively. It is observed that the holographic entanglement negativity characterizes the distillable entanglement for the finite temperature mixed states through the elimination of the thermal contributions. Significantly our examples correctly reproduce universal features of the entanglement negativity for corresponding two dimensional conformal field theories, in higher dimensions.
