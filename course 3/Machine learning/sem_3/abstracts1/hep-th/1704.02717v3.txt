We study co-existence system of both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. For such system with up to first derivatives in Lagrangian, we find Ostrogradsky-type ghost-free condition in Hamiltonian analysis, which is found to be the same with requiring that the equations of motion of fermions are first-order in Lagrangian formulation. When fermionic degrees of freedom are present, uniqueness of time evolution is not guaranteed a priori because of the Grassmann property. We confirm that the additional condition, which is introduced to close Hamiltonian analysis, also ensures the uniqueness of the time evolution of system.
