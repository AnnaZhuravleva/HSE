Hydrodynamics with both vector and axial currents is under study within a simple holographic model, consisting of canonical $U(1)_V\times U(1)_A$ gauge fields in asymptotically AdS$_5$ black brane. When gravitational backreaction is taken into account, the chiral electric separation effect (CESE), namely the generation of an axial current as the response to an external electric field, is realized naturally. Via fluid/gravity calculation, first-order transports in the hydrodynamic constitutive relations are evaluated analytically in terms of vector chemical potential $\mu$ and axial chemical potential $\mu_5$, as well as the temperature $T$. Apart from the proportionality factor $\mu\mu_5$, the CESE conductivity is found to depend on the dimensionless quantities $\mu/T$ and $\mu_5/T$ nontrivially. As a complementary study, frequency-dependence of the transports within this holographic model is revealed through the linear response analysis, demonstrating agreement with the results obtained from fluid/gravity calculation.
