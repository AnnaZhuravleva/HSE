We employ Mathematica to find $Z_N$-invariant subgroups of $E_8$ for application in M-theory. These $Z_N$-invariant subgroups are phenomenologically important and in some cases they resemble the gauge groups of our real world. We present a specific example of $Z_7$-invariant subgroups of $E_8$, which turn up in orbifold compactification of M-theory. Moreover, the procedure can be applied for any $Z_N$ group that acts by shifts (translations) in the root lattice of semisimple Lie groups with $A_n,B_n,C_n,D_n,E_6,E_7$ and $E_8$ factors.
