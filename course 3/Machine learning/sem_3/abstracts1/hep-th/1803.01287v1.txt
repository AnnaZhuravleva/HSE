We study the imprint of a massive scalar particle on cosmological correlation functions, and suggest the way to determine the mass of the newly introduced particle, which is expected to be around 10^14 GeV. After reviewing the basic theory by Maldacena and the effective field theory (EFT) of inflation by Cheung et al., we apply these two theories to construct new couplings of a massive scalar field with primordial fluctuations including an arbitrary number of gravitons. We compute some correlation functions including these couplings in the soft-graviton limit. We show that when the number of soft-gravitons is getting larger, the peak of the correlation function is shifted to larger mass of the scalar particle. In addition we derive a relation, which relates correlation functions with N+1 to N soft-gravitons when the mass of the scalar particle becomes much higher than 10^14 GeV, and confirm the relation by numerical analysis.
