We summarize our work on constant roll inflationary models. It was understood recently that constant roll inflation, in a regime beyond the slow roll approximation, can give models that are in agreement with the observational constraints. We describe a new class of constant roll inflationary models and investigate the behavior of scalar perturbations in them. We also comment on other non-slow roll regimes of inflation.
