In this note we consider M-theory compactified on a warped Calabi-Yau fourfold including the eight-derivative terms in the eleven-dimensional action known in the literature. We dimensionally reduce this theory on geometries with one Kahler modulus and determine the resulting three-dimensional Kahler potential and complex coordinate. The logarithmic form of the corrections suggests that they might admit a physical interpretation in terms of one-loop corrections to the effective action. Including only the known terms the no-scale condition in three dimensions is broken, but we discuss caveats to this conclusion. In particular, we consider additional new eight-derivative terms in eleven dimensions and show that they are strongly constrained by compatibility with the Calabi-Yau threefold reduction. We examine their impact on the Calabi-Yau fourfold reduction and the restoration of the no-scale property.
