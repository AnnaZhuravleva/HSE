The gluon propagator plays a central role in determining the dynamics of QCD. In this work we use the Schwinger-Dyson equation to put analytic constraints on the structure of this propagator. In doing so, we find that the gluon spectral density contains an explicit massless component, but that the coefficient of this component vanishes in Landau gauge QCD, thus confirming the absence of massless gluons from the spectrum of the theory.
