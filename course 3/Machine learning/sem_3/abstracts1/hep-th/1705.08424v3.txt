Quantum complexity of a thermofield double state in a strongly coupled quantum field theory has been argued to be holographically related to the action evaluated on the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. The growth rate of quantum complexity in systems dual to Einstein-Hilbert gravity saturates a bound which follows from the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. We consider corrections to the growth rate in models with flavor degrees of freedom. They are realized by adding a small number of flavor branes to the system. Holographically, such corrections come from the DBI action of the flavor branes evaluated on the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. We relate corrections to the growth of quantum complexity to corrections to the mass of the system, and observe that the bound on the growth rate is never violated.
