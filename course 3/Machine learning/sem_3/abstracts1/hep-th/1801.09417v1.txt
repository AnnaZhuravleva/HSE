Development of quantum gravity theories rarely takes inputs from experimental physics. In this letter, we take a small step towards correcting this by establishing a paradigm for incorporating putative quantum corrections, arising from canonical quantum gravity (QG) theories, in deriving \textit{falsifiable} modified dispersion relations (MDRs) for particles on a deformed Minkowski space-time. This allows us to differentiate and, hopefully, pick between several quantization choices via \textit{testable, state-of-the-art} phenomenological predictions. Although a few explicit examples from loop quantum gravity (LQG) (such as the regularization scheme used or the representation of the gauge group) are shown here to establish the claim, our framework is more general and is capable of addressing other quantization ambiguities within LQG and also those arising from other similar QG approaches.
