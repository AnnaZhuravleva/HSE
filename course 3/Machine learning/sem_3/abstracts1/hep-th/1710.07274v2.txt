Using our earlier proposal for Ramond-Ramond fields in an H-flux on loop space, we extend the Hori isomorphism of Bouwknegt-Evslin-Mathai from invariant differential forms, to invariant exotic differential forms such that the momentum and winding numbers are exchanged, filling in a gap in the literature. We also extend the compatibility of the action of invariant exact Courant algebroids on the T-duality isomorphism of Cavalcanti-Gualtieri, to the T-duality isomorphism on exotic invariant differential forms.
