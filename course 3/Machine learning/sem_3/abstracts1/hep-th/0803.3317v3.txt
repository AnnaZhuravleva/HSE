We investigate conformal scalar, electromagnetic, and massless Dirac quasinormal modes of a brane-localized black hole. The background solution is the four-dimensional black hole on a 2-brane that has been constructed by Emparan, Horowitz, and Myers in the context of a lower dimensional version of the Randall-Sundrum model. The conformally transformed metric admits a Killing tensor, allowing us to obtain separable field equations. We find that the radial equations take the same form as in the four-dimensional "braneless" Schwarzschild black hole. The angular equations are, however, different from the standard ones, leading to a different prediction for quasinormal frequencies.
