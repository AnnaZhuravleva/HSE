We numerically construct static localized black holes in ten spacetime dimensions with one compact periodic dimension. In particular, we investigate the critical regime in which the poles of the localized black hole are about to merge. When approaching the critical region, the behavior of physical quantities is described by a single real valued exponent giving rise to a logarithmic scaling of the thermodynamic quantities, in agreement with the theoretical prediction derived from the double-cone metric. As a peculiarity, the localized black hole solution in ten dimensions can be related to the spatially deconfined phase of two dimensional N=(8,8) super Yang-Mills theory (SYM) on a spatial circle. We use the localized black hole solutions to determine the SYM phase diagram. In particular, we compute the location of the first order phase confinement/deconfinement transition and the related latent heat to unprecedented accuracy.
