We study the interpretation of O7+ planes in F-theory, mainly in the context of the six-dimensional models. In particular, we study how to assign gauge algebras and matter content to seven-branes and their intersections, and the implication of anomaly cancellation in our construction, generalizing earlier analyses without any O7+ planes. By including O7+ planes we can realize 6d superconformal field theories hitherto unobtainable in F-theory, such as those with hypermultiplets in the symmetric representation of su. We also examine a couple of compact models. These reproduce some famous perturbative models, and in some cases enhance their gauge symmetries non-perturbatively.
