Based on previous insights, we present an ansatz to obtain quantization conditions and eigenfunctions of a family of difference equations which arise from quantized mirror curves in the context of local mirror symmetry of toric Calabi-Yaus. It is a first principles construction, which yields closed expressions for the quantization condition and the eigenfunctions when $\hbar / 2 \pi$ is rational. The key ingredient is the modular duality structure of the underlying quantum system. We use our ansatz to write down explicit results in some examples, which are successfully checked against purely numerical results for both spectrum and eigenfunctions. Concerning the quantization condition, we also provide evidence that, in the rational case, this method yields a resummation of a conjectured quantization condition involving enumerative invariants of the underlying toric Calabi-Yau.
