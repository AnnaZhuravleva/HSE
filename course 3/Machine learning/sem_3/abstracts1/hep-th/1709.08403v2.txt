It has long been appreciated that superalgebras with bosonic and fermionic generators additional to those in the super-Poincare algebra underlie p-brane and D-brane actions in superstring theory. These algebras have been revealed via "bottom up" approaches, involving consideration of Noether charges, and by "top down" approaches, involving the construction of manifestly supersymmetry invariant Wess-Zumino actions. In this paper, we give an alternative derivation of these algebras based on integrability of supersymmetry transformations assigned to fields in order to solve a cohomology problem related to the construction of Wess-Zumino terms for p-brane and D-brane actions.
