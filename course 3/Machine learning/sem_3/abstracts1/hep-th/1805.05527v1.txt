We show how Weyl degrees of freedom, can be introduced in the Nambu-Goto string in the path integral formulation using reparametrization invariant measure. We first identify Weyl degrees in conformal gauge using BFV formulation. Further we change Nambu-Goto string action to Polyakov action. The generating functional in light-cone gauge is then obtained from the generating func- tional corresponding to Polyakov action in conformal gauge by using suitably constructed finite field dependent BRST transformation.
