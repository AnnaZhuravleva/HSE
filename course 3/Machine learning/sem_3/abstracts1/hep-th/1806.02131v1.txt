We discuss the formulation of classical field theoretical models on n-dimensional noncommutative space-time defined by a generic associative star product. A simple derivation of conservation laws is presented and applied to obtain local conservation laws (for the electric charge and for the energy-momentum tensor of free fields) and more generally an energy-momentum balance equation for interacting fields. For free field models an analogy with the damped harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics is pointed out. To conclude, the formulation of field theories on curved noncommutative space is addressed.
