We show that there exists a critical point for the coupling constants in Einsteinian cubic gravity where the linearized equations on the maximally-symmetric vacuum vanish identically. We construct an exact isotropic bounce universe in the critical theory in four dimensions. The comoving time runs from minus infinity to plus infinity, yielding a smooth universe bouncing between two de Sitter vacua. In five dimensions we adopt numerical approach to construct a bounce solution, where a singularity occurred before the bounce takes place. We then construct exact anisotropic bounces that connect two isotropic de Sitter spacetimes with flat spatial sections. We further construct exact AdS black holes in the critical theory in four and five dimensions and obtain an exact AdS wormbrane in four dimensions.
