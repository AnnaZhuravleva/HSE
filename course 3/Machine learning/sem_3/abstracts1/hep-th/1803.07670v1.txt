We revisit the double copy description for linearized gravity and point out various technical issues and subtleties, associated with setting up the double copy description, including the problem of matching degrees of freedom on both sides of the double copy dictionary and the related issue of the constraint between graviton and dilaton sources. We introduce and discuss possible resolutions of these issues.
