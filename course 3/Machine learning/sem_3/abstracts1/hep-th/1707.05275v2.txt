The critcal exponent $\omega$ is evaluated at $O(1/N)$ in $d$-dimensions in the Gross-Neveu model using the large $N$ critical point formalism. It is shown to be in agreement with the recently determined three loop $\beta$-functions of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in four dimensions. The same exponent is computed for the chiral Gross-Neveu and non-abelian Nambu-Jona-Lasinio universality classes.
