In this paper we consider the branching of representations of the `Large' $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra $A_\gamma$ in the Ramond sector, into its zero mode subalgebra which we show to be the finite superalgebra $\mathfrak{su}(2|2)$. We describe how representations of $\mathfrak{su}(2|2)$ may be classified using Young supertableaux, and use this branching to discuss the states which contribute to a supersymmetric index suitable for $A_\gamma$ previously proposed in the literature.
