In this note we attempt to understand Lorentzian tensor networks, as a preparation for constructing tensor networks that can describe more exotic back- grounds such as black holes. We first compare tensor networks with the framework of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), and find that it is a natural arena for AQFT. We then construct simple examples of Lorentzian tensor networks, based on Gaussian models of fermions and integrable models. We discuss how salient features, such as the Unruh effect, well known in QFT in Minkowski space-times can be captured by these skeleton of spacetime, and find physical understanding of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem via these simple constructions. We find interesting subtleties when the same approach is directly applied to bosons-the operator algebra contains commutators that take the wrong sign-resembling bosons behind horizons.
