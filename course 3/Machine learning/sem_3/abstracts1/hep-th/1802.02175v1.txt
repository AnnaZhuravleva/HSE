It is not known what the limitations are on using quantum computation to speed up classical computation. An example would be the power to speed up PSPACE-complete computations. It is also not known what the limitations are on the duration of time over which classical general relativity can describe the interior geometry of black holes. What is known is that these two questions are closely connected: the longer GR can describe black holes, the more limited are quantum computers. This conclusion, formulated as a theorem, is a result of unpublished work done by Scott Aaronson and myself which I explain here.
