We investigate canonical, phantom and quintom models, with the various fields being non-minimally coupled to gravity, in the framework of holographic dark energy. We classify them and we discuss their cosmological implications. In particular, we examine the present value of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and the crossing through the phantom divide, and we extract the conditions for a future cosmological singularity. The combined scenarios are in agreement with observations and reveal interesting cosmological behaviors.
