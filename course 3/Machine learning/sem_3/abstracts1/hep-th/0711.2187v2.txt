A Quintom universe with an equation-of-state crossing the cosmological constant boundary can provide a bouncing solution dubbed the Quintom Bounce and thus resolve the Big Bang singularity. In this paper, we investigate the cosmological perturbations of the Quintom Bounce both analytically and numerically. We find that the fluctuations in the dominant mode in the post-bounce expanding phase couple to the growing mode of the perturbations in the pre-bounce contracting phase.
