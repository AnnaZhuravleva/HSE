We study universality of geometric gauge sectors in the string landscape in the context of F-theory compactifications. A finite time construction algorithm is presented for $\frac43 \times 2.96 \times 10^{755}$ F-theory geometries that are connected by a network of topological transitions in a connected moduli space. High probability geometric assumptions uncover universal structures in the ensemble without explicitly constructing it. For example, non-Higgsable clusters of seven-branes with intricate gauge sectors occur with probability above $1-1.01\times 10^{-755}$, and the geometric gauge group rank is above $160$ with probability $.999995$. In the latter case there are at least $10$ $E_8$ factors, the structure of which fixes the gauge groups on certain nearby seven-branes. Visible sectors may arise from $E_6$ or $SU(3)$ seven-branes, which occur in certain random samples with probability $\simeq 1/200$.
