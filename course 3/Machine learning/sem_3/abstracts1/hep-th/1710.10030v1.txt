In this paper, we review the progress in the analysis of magnetic monopoles as generalized states in quantum mechanics. We show that the considered model contains rich algebraic structure that generates symmetries which have been utilized in different physical contexts. Even though are we focused on quantum mechanics in noncommutative space $\textbf{R}_\lambda^3$, the results can be reconstructed in ordinary quantum mechanics in $\textbf{R}^3$ as well.
