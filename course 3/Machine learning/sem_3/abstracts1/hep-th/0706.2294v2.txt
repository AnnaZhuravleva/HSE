We investigate decaying D-branes as the origin of the thermal string gas of string gas cosmology. We consider initial configurations of low-dimensional branes and argue that they can time evolve to thermal string gas. We find that there is a range in the weak string coupling and fast brane decay time regimes, where the initial configuration could drive the evolution of the dilaton to values, where exactly three spacelike directions grow large.
