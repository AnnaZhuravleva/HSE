A relation between the precanonical quantization of pure Yang-Mills fields and the functional Schr\"odinger representation in the temporal gauge is discussed. It is shown that the latter can be obtained from the former when the ultraviolet parameter $\varkappa$ introduced in precanonical quantization goes to infinity. In this limiting case, the Schr\"odinger wave functional can be expressed as the trace of the Volterra product integral of Clifford-algebra-valued precanonical wave functions restricted to a certain field configuration, and the canonical functional derivative Schr\"odinger equation together with the quantum Gau\ss\ constraint are derived from the Dirac-like precanonical Schr\"odinger equation.
