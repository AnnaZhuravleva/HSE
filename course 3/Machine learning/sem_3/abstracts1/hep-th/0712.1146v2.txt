We study the formation and evolution of an interconnected string network in large-scale field-theory numerical simulations, both in flat spacetime and in expanding universe. The network consists of gauge U(1) strings of two different kinds and their bound states, arising due to an attractive interaction potential. We find that the network shows no tendency to ``freeze'' and appears to approach a scaling regime, with all characteristic lengths growing linearly with time. Bound strings constitute only a small fraction of the total string length in the network.
