A new supersymmetrization of the so-called AdS-Lorentz algebra is presented. It involves two fermionic generators and is obtained as an abelian semigroup expansion of osp(4|1). The peculiar properties of the aforesaid expansion method are then exploited in order to construct a D=4 supergravity action containing a generalized supersymmetric cosmological term in a geometric way, only from the curvatures of the novel superalgebra. The action obtained with this procedure corresponds to a MacDowell-Mansouri like action. The supersymmetry invariance is also analyzed.
