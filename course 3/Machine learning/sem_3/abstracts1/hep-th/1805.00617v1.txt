We linearize nonlinear supersymmetry in the Volkov-Akulov (VA) theory for extended SUSY in two dimensional spacetime ($d = 2$) based on the commutator algebra. Linear SUSY transformations of basic component fields for general vector supermultiplets are uniquely determined from variations of functionals (composites) of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) fermions, which are represented as simple products of powers of the NG fermions and a fundamental determinant in the VA theory. The structure of basic component fields with general auxiliary fields in the vector supermultiplets and transitions to $U(1)$ gauge supermultiplets through recombinations of the functionals of the NG fermions are explicitly shown both in $N = 2$ and $N = 3$ theories as the simplest and general examples for extended SUSY theories in $d = 2$.
