We revisit the Coleman-Hill theorem in the context of reduced planar QED, which can be supplemented with background electromagnetic fields. Using the global U(1) Ward identity for this non-local but still gauge invariant theory, we can confirm that the topological piece of the photon self-energy at zero momentum does not receive further quantum corrections apart from the potential one-loop contribution. This is of relevance to probe possible time parity odd dynamics in a planar sheet of graphene which has an effective description in terms of $(2+1)$-dimensional planar reduced QED.
