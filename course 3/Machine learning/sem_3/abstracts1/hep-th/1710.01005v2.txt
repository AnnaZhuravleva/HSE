Is the hydrodynamics of an interacting many-body system fundamentally limited by basic principles of quantum mechanics? Starting with the conjecture that viscosity is at least as large as entropy density (as measured in fundamental units), there has been a long search for a precise answer to this question. In this work, we identify a simple relationship between hydrodynamics and many-body quantum chaos in a broad class of experimentally realizable systems. Consistency with the quantum butterfly effect leads to upper bounds on the speed of sound and diffusion constants of hydrodynamics. These bounds link two very different theories of quantum many-body dynamics, clarify the relationship between classical hydrodynamics and quantum information loss, and provide a simple way to constrain theories of thermalization and quantum chaos in experiments.
