We have analyzed the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies of a class of static spherically symmetric spacetime having a smeared matter distribution. Here we mainly focused on the QNM spectrum for the odd parity perturbation of this background geometry. The results as found with diffused mass distribution, capture significant changes in the QNM spectrum, which could be relevant for future generation experiments, specifically to distinguish the signals of GW from a non-singular source in contrast to a singular geometry. We also provide explicit numerical estimate for the (Gaussian) spread of mass distribution of typical globular cluster like spherical galaxies where the correction to the GW signal due to smeared distribution is accessible to present day observational precision. On the other hand, the correction induced by quantum gravity motivated smearing, of the order of Planck length, is expected to be very small for astrophysical objects (which, however, can be significant for the hypothetical Planck mass black holes).
