Admissible curved space backgrounds for four-dimensional supersymmetric field theories are determined by solving Killing spinor equations of four-dimensional off-shell supergravities. These can be obtained by combining ten-dimensional type IIB supersymmetry with D-brane kappa-symmetry and identifying auxiliary fields of the four-dimensional supergravity fields in terms of type IIB fields. In this paper we show how to extend a number of solutions of four-dimensional Killing spinor equations with four or less supercharges to solutions of the ten-dimensional supersymmetry constraints.
