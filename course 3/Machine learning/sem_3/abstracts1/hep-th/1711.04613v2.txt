We investigate the phase structure of a charged AdS dilaton black hole in the extended phase space which takes the cosmological constant, i.e. the AdS-$\Lambda$ parameter as pressures. Through both thermal ensemble and quasinormal mode analysis, we find that stable phase of the black hole with non-trivial dilaton profiles always exists for both large and small couplings when the AdS-$\Lambda$ is considered dynamical degrees of freedom. This forms a somewhat contrast with previous works which does not do so. Our results provide new examples for the parallelism or equivalences between thermal ensemble methods and dynamic perturbation analysis for black hole phase structures.
