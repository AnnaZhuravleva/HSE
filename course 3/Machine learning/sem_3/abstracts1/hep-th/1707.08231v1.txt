We propose an analogue of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic entanglement entropy applicable to non-relativistic holographic dualities involving Horava gravity. This is a powerful tool for the duality to have, as topological order quantified by entanglement entropy is a robust notion in condensed matter systems. Our derivation makes use of examining on-shell gravitational actions on conical spacetimes.
