I describe the recently proposed quantization of bosonic string about the mean-field ground state, paying special attention to the differences from the usual quantization about the classical vacuum which turns out to be unstable for d>2. In particular, the string susceptibility index $\gamma_{\rm str}$ is 1 in the usual perturbation theory, but equals 1/2 in the mean-field approximation that applies for 2<d<26. I show that the total central charge equals zero in the mean-field approximation and argue that fluctuations about the mean field do not spoil conformal invariance.
