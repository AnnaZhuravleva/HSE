We find $\mathcal{N}=1$ Lagrangian gauge theories that flow to generalized Argyres-Douglas theories with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. We find that certain SU quiver gauge theories flow to generalized Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_{k-1}, A_{mk-1})$ and $(I_{m, k m}, S)$. We also find quiver gauge theories of SO/Sp gauge groups flowing to the $(A_{2m-1}, D_{2mk+1})$, $(A_{2m}, D_{2m(k-1)+k})$ and $D_{m(2k+2)}^{m(2k+2)}[m]$ theories.
