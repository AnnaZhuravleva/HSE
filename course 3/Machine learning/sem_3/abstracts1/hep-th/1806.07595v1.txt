In the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, we find some conformal field theory (CFT) states that have no bulk description by the Ba\~nados geometry. We elaborate the constraints for a CFT state to be geometric, i.e., having a dual Ba\~nados metric, by comparing the order of central charge of the entanglement/R\'enyi entropy obtained respectively from the holographic method and the replica trick in CFT. We find the geometric CFT states fulfill Bohr's correspondence principle by reducing the quantum KdV hierarchy to its classical counterpart. We call the CFT states that satisfy the geometric constraints geometric states, and otherwise non-geometric states. We give examples of both the geometric and non-geometric states, with the latter case including the superposition states and descendant states.
