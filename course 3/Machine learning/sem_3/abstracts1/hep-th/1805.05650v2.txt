We apply the mimetic $f(T)$ theory into the thick brane model. We take the Lagrange multiplier formulation of the action and get the corresponding field equations of motion. Considering the mimetic field as a single-kink or a double-kink, we find solutions for different kinds of $f(T)$. Besides, we investigate the stability of the mimetic $f(T)$ brane by considering the tensor perturbations of the vielbein. Localization problem is also studied and it is shown that the four-dimensional gravity can be recovered for all the solutions. The effects of the torsion show that for the polynomial form of $f(T)$, the zero mode has a split compared with that of $f(T)=T$, but situations for the exponential form of $f(T)$ is similar to that of $f(T)=T$.
