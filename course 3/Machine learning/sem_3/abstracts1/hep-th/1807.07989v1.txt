We obtain a manifestly background independent BRST quantization of the $\N=4$ supersymmetric spinning particle. We show that nilpotency of the BRST charge $Q$ implies the Einstein equations admitting a cosmological constant of indefinite sign. The physical graviton states are given by the vertex operator, obtained by an infinitesimal variation of $Q$, acting on diffeomorphism ghost states. In addition, the tree-point graviton scattering vertex is correctly reproduced by the worldline computation with these vertex operators.
