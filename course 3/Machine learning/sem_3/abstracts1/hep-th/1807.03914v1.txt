For gauge groups SO$(n{+}1)$, SU$(m{+}1)$ and Sp$(\ell{+}1)$, we construct equivariant Yang-Mills solutions on de Sitter space in $n{+}1$, $2(m{+}1)$ and $4(\ell{+}1)$ spacetime dimensions. The latter is conformally mapped to a finite cylinder over a coset space realizing an appropriate unit sphere. The equivariance condition reduces the Yang-Mills system to an analog Newtonian particle in one or two dimensions subject to a time-dependent friction and a particular potential. We analyze some properties of the solutions such as their action and energy and display all analytic ones. Beyond dS$_4$ all such configurations have finite energy but infinite action.
