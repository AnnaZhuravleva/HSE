Working within the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we construct a set of three operators suitable for identifying coordinate-like quantities on a spin-network configuration. In doing so, we rely on known properties of operators for angles, which are already well-known in the LQG literature. These operators are defined on the kinematical Hilbert space, in a background-independent fashion. Computing their action on coherent states, we are able to study some relevant properties such us the spectra, which are discrete. In particular, we focus on the algebra generated by quantum coordinates and, remarkably, it turns out that they do not commute. Interestingly, this may provide additional hints on how space-time noncommutativity could be realized in the context of LQG. The semiclassical regime, necessary to make contact with coordinates on manifolds, is also explored and, specifically, is given by the large-spin limit in which commutativity can be restored. Finally, building on well-established results, we discuss how it is possible to have regularization.
