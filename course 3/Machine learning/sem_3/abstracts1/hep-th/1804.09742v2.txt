We show that two-dimensional JT gravity, the holographic dual of SYK model, can be obtained from the consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction of a class of EMD theories in general $D$ dimensions. For $D=4$, $5$, the EMD theories can be themselves embedded in supergravities. These exact embeddings provide holographic duals of the SYK model in the framework of strings and M-theory. We find that a class of JT gravity solutions can be lifted to become time-dependent charged extremal black holes. They can be further lifted, for example, to describe the D1/D5-branes where the worldsheet is the Milne universe, rather than the typical Minkowski spacetime.
