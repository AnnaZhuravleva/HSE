The renormalization in a Lorentz-breaking scalar-spinor higher-derivative model involving $\phi^4$ self-interaction and the Yukawa-like coupling is studied. We explicitly de- monstrate that the convergence is improved in comparison with the usual scalar-spinor model, so, the theory is super-renormalizable, with no divergences beyond four loops. We compute the one-loop corrections to the propagators for the scalar and fermionic fields and show that in the presence of higher-order Lorentz invariance violation, the poles that dominate the physical theory, are driven away from the standard on-shell pole mass due to radiatively induced lower dimensional operators. The new operators change the standard gamma-matrix structure of the two-point functions, introduce large Lorentz-breaking corrections and lead to modifications in the renormalization conditions of the theory. We found the physical pole mass in each sector of our model.
