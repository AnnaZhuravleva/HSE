Einstein-frame supergravity is accompanied by quantum correction terms because of super-Weyl transformation. The correction term consists of the field strength terms that respectively originate from gauge, gravitational, and K\"ahler anomalies. In this paper, it is shown how the full-kind one-loop Jacobian correction term is calculated and represented in $\mathcal{N} = 1, D = 4$ superspace formalism.
