We investigate dynamics of probe particles moving in the near-horizon limit of (2N+1)-dimensional extremal Myers-Perry black hole with arbitrary rotation parameters. We observe that in the most general case with nonequal nonvanishing rotational parameters the system admits separation of variables in N-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinates. This allows us to find solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation and write down the explicit expressions of Liouville constants of motion.
