This work explores an alternative solution to the problem of renormalizability in Einstein gravity. In the proposed approach, Einstein gravity is transformed into the renormalizable theory of four-derivative gravity by applying a field redefinition containing an infinite number of higher derivatives. It is also shown that the current-current amplitude is invariant with the field redefinition, and thus the unitarity of Einstein gravity is preserved.
