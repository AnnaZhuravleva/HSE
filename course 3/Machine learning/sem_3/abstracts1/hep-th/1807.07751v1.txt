We introduce a novel way to perform high-order computations in multi-Regge-kinematics in planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and generalize the existing factorization into building blocks at two loops to all loop orders. Afterwards, we will explain how this framework can be used to easily obtain higher-loop amplitudes from existing amplitudes and how to relate them to amplitudes with higher number of legs.
