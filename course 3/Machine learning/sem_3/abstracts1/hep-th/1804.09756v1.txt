In this paper we present our new results on the correlation functions of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ model in the rational case. Our main point is making usage of general properties of the density matrix of the $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ model like the qKZ equation, reduction properties, asymptotic behaviors etc. We could get the concrete results up to the three-site density matrix for the infinite chain.
