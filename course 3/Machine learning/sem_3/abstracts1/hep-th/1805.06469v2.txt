We consider vacuum solutions of four dimensional general relativity with $\Lambda < 0$. We numerically construct stationary solutions that asymptotically approach a boundary metric with differential rotation. Smooth solutions only exist up to a critical rotation. We thus argue that increasing the differential rotation by a finite amount will cause the curvature to grow without bound. (In paper II of this series, we will study the time dependent problem and confirm this expectation.) This provides vacuum counterexamples to weak cosmic censorship in anti-de Sitter spacetime. These results hold for both zero and nonzero temperature, and both compact and noncompact boundaries.
