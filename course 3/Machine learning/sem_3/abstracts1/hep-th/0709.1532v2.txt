We calculate analytically the transmission and reflection amplitudes for waves incident on a rotating black hole in d=4, analytically continued to asymptotically large, nearly imaginary frequency. These amplitudes determine the asymptotic resonant frequencies of the black hole, including quasinormal modes, total-transmission modes and total-reflection modes. We identify these modes with semiclassical bound states of a one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, localized along contours in the complexified r-plane which connect turning points of corresponding null geodesics. Each family of modes has a characteristic temperature and chemical potential. The relations between them provide hints about the microscopic description of the black hole in this asymptotic regime.
