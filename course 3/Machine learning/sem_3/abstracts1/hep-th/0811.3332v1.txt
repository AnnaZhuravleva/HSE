We investigate the statistical nature of holographic gas, which may represent the quasi-particle excitations of a strongly correlated gravitational system. We find that the holographic entropy can be obtained by modifying degeneracy. We calculate thermodynamical quantities and investigate stability of the holographic gas. When applying to cosmology, we find that the holographic gas behaves as holographic dark energy, and the parameter $c$ in holographic dark energy can be calculated from our model. Our model of holographic gas generally predicts $c<1$, implying that the fate of our universe is phantom like.
