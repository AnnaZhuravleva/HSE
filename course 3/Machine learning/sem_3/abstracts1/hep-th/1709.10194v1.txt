Recent developments for BPHZ renormalization performed in configuration space are reviewed and applied to the model of a scalar quantum field with quartic self-interaction. An extension of the results regarding the short-distance expansion and the Zimmermann identity is shown for a normal product, which is quadratic in the field operator. The realization of the equation of motion is computed for the interacting field and the relation to parametric differential equations is indicated.
