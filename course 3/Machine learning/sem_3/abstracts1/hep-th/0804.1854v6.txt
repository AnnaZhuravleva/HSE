We here provide further details on the construction and properties of mass dimension one quantum fields based on Elko expansion coefficients. We show that by a judicious choice of phases, the locality structure can be dramatically improved. In the process we construct a fermionic dark matter candidate which carries not only an unsuppressed quartic self interaction but also a preferred axis. Both of these aspects are tentatively supported by the data on dark matter.
