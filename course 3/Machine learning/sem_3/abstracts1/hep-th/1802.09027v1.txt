We study the ferminoic spectrum with Weyl correction, which exhibits the non-Fermi liquid behavior. Also, we find that both the height of the peak of the fermionic spectrum and the dispersion relation exhibit a nonlinearity with the variety of the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$, which mean that such nonlinearity maybe ascribe to the one of the Maxwell field. Another important property of this system is that for the holographic fermionic system with $\gamma<0$, the degree of the deviation from Fermi liquid is heavier than that for the one with $\gamma>0$. It indicates that there is a transition of coupling strength in the dual boundary field theory.
