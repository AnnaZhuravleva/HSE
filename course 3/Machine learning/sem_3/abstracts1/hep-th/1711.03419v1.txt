We construct a new solution of type IIB supergravity with eight supercharges by applying non-Abelian T-duality to the $ AdS_5\times S^5$ solution, along the $ SU(2)$ isometries in both the internal and Lorentz symmetries. The study of quantised charges and D-brane embeddings suggests a configuration of D1 and D3'-branes that polarise into concentric, spherical, D3 and D5-branes due to the Myers dielectric effect. We find that our solution is dual to a IIB matrix model with fuzzy sphere vacua characterised by partitions of the number of D1 and D3'-branes. We also study the solution obtained via (Abelian) T-dualities along the $S^1$ fiber angles inside the $S^3$'s of the $ AdS_5\times S^5$ solution. In addition, we point out a precise relation between NATD and ATD solutions by considering a double scaling limit in the NATD solutions. In the particular case of the solutions obtained by a single (non-)Abelian T-duality inside the Lorentz symmetries of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ solution, we demonstrate that the double scaling limit provides a supergravity realisation of the relations between the vacua of the half-BPS theories studied by Lin and Maldacena.
