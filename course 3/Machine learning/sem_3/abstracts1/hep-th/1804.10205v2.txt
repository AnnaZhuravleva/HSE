The D1-D5 system has an orbifold point in its moduli space, at which it may be described by an ${\cal N} = (4,4)$ supersymmetric sigma model with target space $M^N/S(N)$ where $M$ is $\mathbb{T}^4$ or $K3$. In this paper we consider correlation functions involving chiral operators constructed from twist fields: we find explicit expressions for processes involving a twist $n$ operator joining $n$ twist operators of arbitrary twist. These expressions are universal, in that they are independent of the choice of $M$, and the final results can be expressed in a compact form. We explain how these results are relevant to the black hole microstate programme: one point functions of chiral operators can be used to reconstruct AdS$_3$ near horizon regions of D1-D5 microstates and to match microstates constructed in supergravity with the CFT.
