We study solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation with vector and scalar potentials of the Coulomb types under the influence of non-inertial effects in the space-time of topological defects. We also investigate a quantum particle described by the Klein-Gordon oscillator in the background space-time generated by a string. An important result obtained is that the non-inertial effects restrict the physical region of the space-time where the particle can be placed. In addition, we show that these potentials can form bound states for the relativistic wave equation equation in this kind of background.
