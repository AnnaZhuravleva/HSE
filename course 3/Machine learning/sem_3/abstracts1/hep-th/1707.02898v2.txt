In this paper, we study the finite-temperature matrix quantum mechanics with chemical potential term linear in the single trace of U(N) matrices, via Monte Carlo simulation. In the bosonic case, we exhibit the existence of the Gross-Witten-Wadia (GWW) type third-order phase transition. We also extend our studies to the model with the fermionic degrees of freedom employing the non-lattice simulation via Fourier expansion, and explore the possibilities that there is a phase transition between the gapped and ungapped phase both in the absence and presence of the chemical potential term. We make a comparison of the phase diagram between the bosonic and fermionic cases.
