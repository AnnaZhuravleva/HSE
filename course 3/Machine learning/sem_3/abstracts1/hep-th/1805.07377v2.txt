We analytically as well as numerically study the effects of Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics on the properties of $(1+1)$-dimensional s-wave holographic superconductors. We relax the probe limit and further assume the scalar and gauge fields affect on the background spacetime. We thus explore the effects of backreaction on the condensation of the scalar hair. For the analytical method, we employ the Sturm-Liouville eigen value problem and for the numerical method, we employ the shooting method. We show that these methods are powerful enough to analyze the critical temperature and phase transition of the one dimensional holographic superconductor. We find out that increasing the backreaction as well as nonlinearity makes the condensation harder to form. In addition, this one-dimensional holographic superconductor faces with second order phase transition and their critical exponent has the mean field value $\beta={1}/{2}$.
