We derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for a class of BPS black holes in the massive type IIA supergravity background AdS$_4 \times S^6$ from a microscopic counting of supersymmetric ground states in a holographically dual field theory. The counting is performed by evaluating the topologically twisted index of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ Chern-Simons-matter gauge theories in the large $N$ limit. The $\mathcal{I}$-extremization principle is shown to match the attractor mechanism for the near-horizon geometries constructed in the four-dimensional dyonic $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, that arises as a consistent truncation of massive type IIA supergravity on $S^6$. In particular, our results prove that the imaginary part of the three-dimensional partition functions plays a crucial r\^ole in holography.
