In this paper we present a complete and detailed analysis of the calculation of both the Wightman function and the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor that arise from quantum vacuum fluctuations of massive and massless scalar fields in the cosmic dispiration spacetime, which is formed by the combination of two topological defects: a cosmic string and a screw dislocation. This spacetime is obtained in the framework of the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity and is considered to be a chiral space-like cosmic string. For completeness we perform the calculation in a high-dimensional spacetime, with flat extra dimensions. We found closed expressions for the the energy-momentum tensor and, in particular, in (3+1)-dimensions, we compare our results with existing previous ones in the literature for the massless scalar field case.
