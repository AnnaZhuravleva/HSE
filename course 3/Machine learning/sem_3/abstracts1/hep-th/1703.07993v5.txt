We consider the most general action for gravity which is quadratic in curvature. In this case first order and second order formalisms are not equivalent. This framework is a good candidate for a unitary and renormalizable theory of the gravitational field; in particular, there are no propagators falling down faster than $\tfrac{1}{p^2}$. Calculations are somewhat involved when all monomials are considered, but we have intended to laid down the general case. The interaction between external sources is analyzed; this interaction is conveyed mainly by the three-index connection field. The theory as it stands, is in the conformal invariant phase; only when Weyl invariance is broken through the coupling to matter can an Einstein-Hilbert term (and its corresponding Planck mass scale) be generated by quantum corrections.
