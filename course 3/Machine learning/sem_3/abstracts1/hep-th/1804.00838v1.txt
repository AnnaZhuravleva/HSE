We consider the four dimensional topologically massive electrodynamics in which a gauge field is interacting with 2nd rank antisymmetric tensor field through a topological interaction. The photon becomes massive by eating the 2nd rank tensor field, which is dual to the Higgs mechanism. We explicitly demonstrate the nature of the mechanism by performing a canonical analysis of the theory and discuss various aspects of it.
