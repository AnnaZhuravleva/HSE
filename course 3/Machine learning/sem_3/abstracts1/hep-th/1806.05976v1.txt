In this paper we study the propagation of entanglement entropy after a global instantaneous quench on the CFT boundary of AdS bulk. We consider the Gauss-Bonnet model as a higher curvature gravity model for which we correct the RT(HRT) proposal to compute the holographic entanglement entropy(HEE). To obtain an analytical solution we perform an approximation approach which bounds our computations to the small subregions and we compare its thermalization regimes to the result of large subsystem case. We can see tsunami picture that describes the evolution of entanglement for the large systems breaks down here and the details just depends on the shape and size of entangled region and of course the details of our gravity model. We can see the phase transition in this regime is always continuous regardless the shape and size, in contrary with large subregions.
