We use Lie-algebraic arguments to classify all Lorentz-invariant theories of massless interacting particles that feature coordinate-dependent redundant symmetries of the Galileon type. We show that such theories are uniquely determined by specifying an affine representation of the Lie algebra of physical, non-redundant internal symmetries and an invariant metric on its target space. This creates an infinite catalog of theories relevant for both cosmology and high-energy physics thanks to their special properties such as enhanced scaling of scattering amplitudes in the soft limit.
