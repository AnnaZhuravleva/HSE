In this paper, we study the acoustic black hole emerged from the nonextremal black D3-brane, based on the holographic approaches in constructing the acoustic black hole in asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetime (AAdS) and the effective hydrodynamic description of the nonextremal black D3-brane. We show that the holographic dual description of the acoustic black hole appeared on the timelike cutoff surface in the nonextremal black D3-brane also exist. The duality includes the dynamical connection between the acoustic black hole and the bulk gravity, a universal equation relating the Hawking-like temperature and the Hawking temperature, and a phonon/scalar channel quasinormal mode correspondence.
