We show how the gauge and field structure of the tensor hierarchies in Double and $E_{7(7)}$ Exceptional Field Theory fits into $L_\infty$ algebras. Special attention is paid to redefinitions, the role of covariantly constrained fields and intertwiners. The results are connected to Gauged Supergravities through generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions. We find that trivial parameters are deformed by gaugings, giving rise to novel symmetries for symmetries that are absent in their ungauged counterparts.
