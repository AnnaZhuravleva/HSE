The matching method is employed to analytically investigate the properties of holographic superconductors in higher dimensions in the framework of power Maxwell electrodynamics taking into account the effects of spacetime noncommutativity. The relationship between the critical temperature and the charge density and the value of the condensation operator is obtained first. The Meissner like effect is then studied. The analysis indicate that larger values of the noncommutative parameter and the parameter $q$ appearing in the power Maxwell theory makes the condensate difficult to form. The critical magnetic field however increases with increase in the noncommutative parameter $\theta$.
