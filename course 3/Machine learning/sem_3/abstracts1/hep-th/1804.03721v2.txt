We propose the superintegrable generalization of Smorodinsky-Winternitz system on the N- dimensional complex Euclidian space which is specified by the presence of constant magnetic field. We find that in addition to 2N Liouville integrals the system has additional functionally independent constants of motion, and compute their symmetry algebra. We perform the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation of C^2-Smorodinsky-Winternitz system to the (three-dimensional) generalized MICZ- Kepler problem and find the symmetry algebra of the latter one. We observe that constant magnetic field appearing in the initial system has no qualitative impact on the resulting system.
