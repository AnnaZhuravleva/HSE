In finite entropy systems, real-time partition functions do not decay to zero at late time. Instead, assuming random matrix universality, suitable averages exhibit a growing "ramp" and "plateau" structure. Deriving this non-decaying behavior in a large $N$ collective field description is a challenge related to one version of the black hole information problem. We describe a candidate semiclassical explanation of the ramp for the SYK model and for black holes. In SYK, this is a two-replica nonperturbative saddle point for the large $N$ collective fields, with zero action and a compact zero mode that leads to a linearly growing ramp. In the black hole context, the solution is a two-sided black hole that is periodically identified under a Killing time translation. We discuss but do not resolve some puzzles that arise.
