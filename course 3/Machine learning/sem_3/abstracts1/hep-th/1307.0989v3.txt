We advocate and develop the use of the dreibein (and the metric) as prepotential for three-dimensional SO(3) Yang-Mills theory. Since the dreibein transforms homogeneously under gauge transformation, the metric is gauge invariant. For a generic gauge potential, there is a unique dreibein on fixing the boundary condition. Topologically non-trivial monopole configurations are given by conformally flat metrics, with scalar fields capturing the monopole centres. Our approach also provides an ansatz for the gauge potential covering the topological aspects.
