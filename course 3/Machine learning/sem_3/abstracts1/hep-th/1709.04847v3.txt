Performing Hamiltonian analysis of the massive gravity [9] in full phase space, we see that the theory is ghost free. We also see in a more clear way that this result is intrinsic of the interaction term and does not depend on the variables involved. Since no first class constraint emerges, the theory seems to lack gauge symmetry. We show that this is due to the presence of an auxiliary field, and the symmetry may be manifest in the Stuckelberg formulation. We give the generating functional of gauge transformation in this model.
