We study massless Dirac fermions in the background of a specific planar topologically nontrivial configuration in the three-dimensional spacetime. The results show the presence of massive bound states, phase shifts and the consequent differential cross section for the scattering of fermions in the weak coupling regime. Despite the nontrivial topology of the background field, no fermionic zero mode is found.
