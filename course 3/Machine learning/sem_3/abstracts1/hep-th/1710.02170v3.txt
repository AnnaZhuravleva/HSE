We present tree-level $n$-particle on-shell scattering amplitudes of various brane theories with $16$ conserved supercharges. These include the world-volume theory of a probe D3-brane or D5-brane in 10D Minkowski spacetime as well as a probe M5-brane in 11D Minkowski spacetime, which describes self interactions of an abelian tensor supermultiplet with 6D $(2,0)$ supersymmetry. Twistor-string-like formulas are proposed for tree-level scattering amplitudes of all multiplicities for each of these theories. The R symmetry of the D3-brane theory is shown to be $SU(4) \times U(1)$, and the $U(1)$ factor implies that its amplitudes are helicity conserving. Each of 6D theories (D5-brane and M5-brane) reduces to the D3-brane theory by dimensional reduction. As special cases of the general M5-brane amplitudes, we present compact formulas for examples involving only the self-dual $B$ field with $n=4,6,8$.
