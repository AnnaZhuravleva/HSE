In ${\cal N}=5, 6, 8$ supergravities there are hidden symmetries of equations of motion, described by duality groups $SU(1,5), \, SO^*(12), \, E_{7(7)}$ respectively. UV divergences and known candidate counterterms violate the deformed duality symmetry current conservation. Extra higher derivative terms in the action are required to restore duality. We study the effect of a two-vector part of the counterterm for ${\cal N}\geq 5$ supergravities using the universality of the symplectic structure of extended supergravities. We construct a compact form of a deformed action with infinite number of higher derivative terms and restored duality symmetry with deformation parameter $\lambda$. We find, in $\lambda^2$ approximation, that the $SU({\cal N})$ symmetry of the deformed theory is restored on shell.
