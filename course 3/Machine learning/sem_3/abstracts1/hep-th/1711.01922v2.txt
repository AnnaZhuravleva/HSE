The holographic principle and its realisation as the AdS/CFT correspondence leads to the existence of the so called precursor operators. These are boundary operators that carry non-local information regarding events occurring deep inside the bulk and which cannot be causally connected to the boundary. Such non-local operators can distinguish non-vacuum-like excitations within the bulk that cannot be observed by any local gauge invariant operators in the boundary. The boundary precursors are expected to become increasingly non-local the further the bulk process is from the boundary. Such phenomena are expected to be related to the extended nature of the strings. Standard gauge invariance in the boundary theory equates to quantum error correction which furthermore establishes localisation of bulk information. I show that when double field theory quantum error correction prescriptions are considered in the bulk, gauge invariance in the boundary manifests residual effects associated to stringy winding modes. Also, an effect of double field theory quantum error correction is the appearance of positive cosmological constant. The emergence of spacetime from the entanglement structure of a dual quantum field theory appears in this context to generalise for de-Sitter spacetimes as well.
