We consider a generic class of the so-called inflationary $-\alpha$ attractor models and compute the cosmological observables in the Einstein and Jordan frames, of the corresponding $F(R)-$gravity theory. We find that the two sets coincide (to within errors from the use of the slow-roll approximation) for moderate and large values of the number of e-foldings $N$, which is the novel result of this paper, generalizing previous results on the subject (see e.g. Ref. (\citen{oik1})). We briefly comment on the possible generalizations of these results.
