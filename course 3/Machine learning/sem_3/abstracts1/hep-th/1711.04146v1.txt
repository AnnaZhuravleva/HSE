In the present work we compute the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies of four-dimensional charged black holes in Einstein-power-Maxwell theory. In particular we study scalar perturbations adopting the 6th order WKB approximation. We analyze in detail the behaviour of the spectrum depending on the charge of the black hole, the quantum number of angular momentum and the overtone number. In addition, a comparison is made between the results obtained here and the results valid for charged black holes in other theories as well as for the Reissner-Nordstr${\"o}$m black hole. Finally, we have provided an analytical expression for the quasinormal spectrum in the eikonal limit.
