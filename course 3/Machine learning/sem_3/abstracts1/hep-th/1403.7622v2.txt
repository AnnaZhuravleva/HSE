We present heuristic arguments that hint to a possible connection of Lorentz violation with observed phenomenon in condensed matter physics. Various references from condensed matter literature are cited where operators in the Standard Model Extension appear to be enhanced. Furthermore, we consider the Levy-Leblond equation, which is the analogue of Dirac equation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We show that we can obtain the Levy-Leblond equation by adding enhanced Lorentz violating operators to the Dirac equation. Based on these observations, we propose that Lorentz violation exhibits itself in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
