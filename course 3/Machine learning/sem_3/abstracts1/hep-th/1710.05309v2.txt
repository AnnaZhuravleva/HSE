We study the ground state instability of mesons in the presence of the electric field on Schr\"odinger geometry which is a solution of type IIB string theory. The instability takes place as a result of Schwinger like effect. We calculate decay rate of instability and pair production probability by using $gauge/gravity$ duality.At zero temperature for massive mesons, the critical electric field would be the same as AdS result if we replace the mass of mesons with the effective mass. This effective mass depends on compactification parameter $\mu$, which it would be dual to the chemical potential, and also t'Hooft coupling.   We also find $ Euler-Heisenberg $ Lagrangian from holography in Schr\"odinger space-time which behaves similarly to the AdS one for the gapless system concerning the electric field. For the massive one the functionality of effective action to the external electric field would be the same as AdS geometry if we call $E \sqrt{1-\frac{\pi^2 m^2}{|\mu| \lambda}}$ instead of the electric field.
