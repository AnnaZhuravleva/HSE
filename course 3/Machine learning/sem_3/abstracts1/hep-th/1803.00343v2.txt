We study superpaticle models with fermionic gauge symmetry on the coset spaces of the $SU(1,1|N)$ supergroup. We first construct $SU(1,1|N)$ supersymmetric extension of a particle on $AdS_2$ possessing the $\kappa$-symmetry. Including angular degrees of freedom and extending this model to a superparticle on the $AdS_2\times \mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ background with two-form flux, one breaks the $\kappa$-symmetry down to a fermionic gauge symmetry with one parameter. A link of the background field configuration to the near horizon black hole geometries is discussed.
