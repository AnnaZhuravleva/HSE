We performed a functional renormalization group analysis for the quantum Einstein gravity including a quadratic term in the curvature. The ultraviolet non-gaussian fixed point and its critical exponent for the correlation length are identified for different forms of regulators in case of dimension 3. We searched for that optimized regulator where the physical quantities show the least regulator parameter dependence. It is shown that the Litim regulator satisfies this condition. The infrared fixed point has also been investigated, it is found that the exponent is insensitive to the third coupling introduced by the $R^2$ term.
