We describe holographic thermal quenches that are inhomogeneous in space. The main characteristic of the quench is to take the system far from its equilibrium configuration. Except special extreme cases, the problem has no analytic solution. Using the numerical holography methods, we study different observables that measure thermalization such as the time evolution of the apparent horizon, two-point Wightman function and entanglement entropy (EE). Having an extra nontrivial spacial direction, allows us to study this peculiar generalization since we categorize the problem based on whether we do the measurements along this special direction or perpendicular to it. Exciting new features appear that are absent in the common computations in the literature; the appearance of negative EE valleys surrounding the positive EE hills and abrupt quenches that occupy the whole space at their universal limit are some of the results of this paper. Physical explanation is given and connections to the Cardy's idea of thermalization are discussed.
