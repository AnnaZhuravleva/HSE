The dominant method of energy loss by a loop of cosmic D-strings in models of warped brane inflation is studied. It is shown that the energy loss via Ramond-Ramond field radiation can dominate by many orders of magnitude over the energy radiation via gravitational wave emission. The ratio of these two energy loss mechanisms depends on the energy scale of inflation, the mass scale of string theory and whether it is a single-throat or a multi-throat inflationary scenario. This can have important consequences for the detection of cosmic superstrings in the near future. It is argued that the bounds from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and big bang nucleosynthesis are the dominant cosmological sources to constrain the physical parameters of the network of cosmic superstrings, whereas the role of the gravitational wave-based experiments may be secondary.
