We construct two possible candidates for the non-relativistic $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra in 4 space-time dimensions by contracting the original relativistic $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra. The $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra is infinite-dimensional, and it contains the generators of the Poincar\'e algebra, together with the so-called super-translations. Similarly, the proposed $\mathfrak{nrbms}_4$ algebras can be regarded as two infinite-dimensional extensions of the Bargmann algebra. We also study a canonical realisation of one these algebras in terms of the Fourier modes of a free Schr\"odinger field, mimicking the canonical realisation of the relativistic $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra using a free Klein-Gordon field.
