We show that the anti-de Sitter(AdS) space naturally emerges from the conformal field theory(CFT). The behavior of the leading divergent term in the entanglement entropy implies the underlying AdS geometry. The coefficient of the leading divergent term is related to the radius of the AdS space. All these are confirmed fully for the two dimensional CFTs. We also give comments for the higher dimensional CFTs.
