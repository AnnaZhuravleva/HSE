The Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence has provided new and useful insights into the non-perturbative regime of strongly coupled gauge theories. We construct a class of models meant to mimic Yang-Mills theory using the superpotential method. This method allows us to efficiently address the problem of having one more equation of motion than there are independent fields. The conformal symmetry is broken in the infrared by a dilaton field. Using a 5-dimensional action we calculate the mass spectrum of scalar glueballs. This spectrum contains a tachyon, indicating an instability in the theory. We stabilize the theory by introducing a cosmological constant in the bulk and a pair of 3-branes, as in the Randall-Sundrum model. The scalar glueball masses computed by lattice gauge theory are then described very well by just a few parameters. Prospects for extending the model to other spins and parities and to finite temperature are considered.
