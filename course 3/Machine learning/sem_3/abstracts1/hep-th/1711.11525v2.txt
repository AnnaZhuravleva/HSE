Using a recently proposed duality for $U(N)$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) in three dimensions with monopole superpotential, in this paper we derive the mirror dual description of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with unitary gauge group, generalizing the known mirror dual description of abelian gauge theories. We match the chiral ring of the dual theories and their partition functions on the squashed sphere. We also conjecture a generalization for SQCD with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups.
