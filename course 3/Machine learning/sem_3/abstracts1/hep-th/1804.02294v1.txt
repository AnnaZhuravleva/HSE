We propose a new method to characterize the different phases observed in the non-perturbative numerical approach to quantum gravity known as Causal Dynamical Triangulation. The method is based on the analysis of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Laplace-Beltrami operator computed on the triangulations: it generalizes previous works based on the analysis of diffusive processes and proves capable of providing more detailed information on the geometric properties of the triangulations. In particular, we apply the method to the analysis of spatial slices, showing that the different phases can be characterized by a new order parameter related to the presence or absence of a gap in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and deriving an effective dimensionality of the slices at the different scales. We also propose quantities derived from the spectrum that could be used to monitor the running to the continuum limit around a suitable critical point in the phase diagram, if any is found.
