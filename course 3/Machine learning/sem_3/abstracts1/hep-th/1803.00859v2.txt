The Wilsonian renormalization group properties of the conformal factor of the metric are profoundly altered by the fact that it has a wrong-sign kinetic term. If couplings are chosen so that the quantum field theory exists on $\mathbb{R}^4$, it fails to exist on manifolds below a certain size, if a certain universal shape function turns negative. We demonstrate that this is triggered by inhomogeneity in the cases of $\mathbb{T}^4$ and $\mathbb{T}^3\times\mathbb{R}$, including twisted versions. Varying the moduli, we uncover a rich phenomenology.
