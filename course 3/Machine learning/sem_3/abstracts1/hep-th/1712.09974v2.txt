We discuss a supersymmetric extension of a non-relativistic Chern-Simons matter theory, known as the SUSY Jackiw-Pi model, in a harmonic trap. We show that the non-relativistic version of the superconformal symmetry, called the super-Schr\"odinger symmetry, is not spoiled by an external field including the harmonic potential. It survives as a modified symmetry whose generators have explicit time dependences determined by the strength of the trap, the rotation velocity of the system and the fermion number chemical potential. We construct 1/3 BPS states of trapped Jackiw-Pi vortices preserving a part of the modified superconformal symmetry and discuss fluctuations around static BPS configurations. In addition to the bosonic massive Nambu-Goldstone modes, we find that there exist massive Nambu-Goldstone fermions associated with broken modified super-Schr\"odinger symmetry generators. Furthermore, we find that eigenmodes form supermultiplets of a modified supersymmetry preserved by the static BPS backgrounds. As a consequence of the modified supersymmetry, infinite towers of explicit spectra can be found for eigenmodes correspond- ing to bosonic and fermionic lowest Landau levels.
