In this paper we extend our previous treatment of the one-loop corrections to inflation. Previously we calculated the one-loop corrections to the background and the two-point correlation function of inflaton fluctuations in a specific model of chaotic inflation. We showed that the loop corrections depend on the total number of e-foldings and estimated that the effect could be as large as a few percent in a lambda-phi-four model of chaotic inflation. In the present paper we generalize the calculations to general inflationary potentials. We find that effect can be as large as 70% in the simplest model of chaotic inflation with a quadratic inflationary potential. We discuss the physical interpretation of the effect in terms of the tensor-to-scalar consistency relation. Finally, we discuss the relation to the work of Weinberg on quantum contributions to cosmological correlators.
