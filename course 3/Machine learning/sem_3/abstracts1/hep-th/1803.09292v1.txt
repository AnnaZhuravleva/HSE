It is shown that by imposing the relativistic symmetries on the cutoff in field theories one rules out all known non-perturbative regulators except the point splitting. The relativistic cutoff dynamics is non-local in time and thereby unstable, bringing the very existence of relativistic field theory into question. It is argued within the context of a scalar field theory model that the combination of the point splitting with a sufficiently fast suppression in the field amplitude may lead to stable semiclassical dynamics and to a new kind of realistic vacuum structure.
