In \url{arXiv:1704.07208} it was shown that the spectrum and bilocal propagator of SYK model with four fermion interactions can be realized as a three dimensional model in $AdS_2 \times S^1/Z_2$ with nontrivial boundary conditions in the additional dimension. In this paper we show that a similar picture holds for generalizations of the SYK model with $q$-fermion interactions. The 3D realization is now given on a space whose metric is conformal to $AdS_2 \times S^1/Z_2$ and is subject to a non-trivial potential in addition to a delta function at the center of the interval. It is shown that a Horava-Witten compactification reproduces the exact SYK spectrum and a non-standard propagator between points which lie at the center of the interval exactly agrees with the bilocal propagator. As $q \rightarrow \infty$, the wave function of one of the modes at the center of the interval vanish as $1/q$, while the others vanish as $1/q^2$, in a way consistent with the fact that in the SYK model only one of the modes contributes to the bilocal propagator in this limit.
