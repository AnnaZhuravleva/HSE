The Ostrogradski ghost problem that appears in higher derivative theory containing constraints has been considered here. Specifically we considered the systems where only second class constraints appear. For these kind of systems, it is not possible to gauge away the linear momenta that cause the instability. To solve this issue, we have considered the PT symmetric aspects of the theory. As an example we have considered the Galilean invariant Chern Simons model in 2+1 D which is a purely second class system. By solving the constraints, in the reduced phase, we derived the PT similarity transformed Hamiltonian. Putting conditions on the $\mathcal{C}$ -operator we found that the final form of the Hamiltonian is free from any linear momenta and bounded from blow.
