In this paper, we study the corrections to tree level scattering that arise due to noncommutative deformations of cubic scalar field theory through implementation of the Groenewald-Moyal(GM) product. The additional noncommutative refinement as we shall see, supplies nontrivial corrections to scattering even at the tree level. The amplitudes for 2 -> 2 scattering are computed and elucidated. Finally, we also consider the possibility of a localized noncommutativity parameter and the possible consequences of introducing position dependence in spacetime noncommutativity
