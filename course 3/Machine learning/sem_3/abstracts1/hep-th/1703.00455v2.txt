We study BPS jumping loci, or the subloci in moduli spaces of supersymmetric string vacua where BPS states come into existence discontinuously. This phenomenon is distinct from wall-crossing. We argue that these loci should be thought of as special cycles in the sense of Noether-Lefschetz loci or special Shimura subvarieties, which are indeed examples of BPS jumping loci for certain string compactifications. We use the Hodge-elliptic genus as an informative tool, suggesting that our work can be extended to understand the jumping behavior of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants.
