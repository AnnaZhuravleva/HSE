In these notes we discuss various methods relevant to the numerical construction of stationary black hole solutions in General Relativity with negative cosmological constant. We focus on solutions which explicitly break translational invariance along the boundary directions. Within the framework of the gauge/gravity duality, these can be interpreted as lattices. They have finite conductivity and thus help us move one step forward towards more realistic scenarios in holography.
