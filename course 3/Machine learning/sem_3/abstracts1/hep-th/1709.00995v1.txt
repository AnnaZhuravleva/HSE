The proper-time regularization of bosonic string reproduces the results of canonical quantization in a special scaling limit where the length in target space has to be renormalized. We repeat the analysis for the Pauli-Villars regularization and demonstrate the universality of the results. In the mean-field approximation we compute the susceptibility anomalous dimension and show it equals 1/2. We discuss the relation with the previously known results on lattice strings.
