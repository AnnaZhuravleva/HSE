The Ruijsenaars-Schneider models are conventionally regarded as relativistic generalizations of the Calogero integrable systems. Surprisingly enough, their supersymmetric generalizations escaped attention. In this work, N=2 supersymmetric extensions of the rational and hyperbolic Ruijsenaars-Schneider three-body models are constructed within the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism. It is also known that the rational model can be described by the geodesic equations associated with a metric connection. We demonstrate that the hyperbolic systems are linked to non-metric connections.
