We show that a model of superfluid dark matter, modifying the Newtonian potential and explaining galactic rotational curves, can be unitarized by the formation of classical configuration in scattering amplitudes. The classicalization mechanism may also trigger the formation of the superfluid state from the early to the late Universe.
