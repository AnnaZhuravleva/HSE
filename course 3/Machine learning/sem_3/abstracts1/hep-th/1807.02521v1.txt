We utilise SUSY quiver gauge theories to compute properties of Slodowy slices; these are spaces transverse to the nilpotent orbits of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$. We analyse classes of quiver theories, with Classical gauge and flavour groups, whose Higgs branch Hilbert series are the intersections between Slodowy slices and the nilpotent cone $\mathcal S\cap \mathcal N$ of $\mathfrak{g}$. We calculate refined Hilbert series for Classical algebras up to rank $4$ (and $A_5$), and find descriptions of their representation matrix generators as algebraic varieties encoding the relations of the chiral ring. We also analyse a class of dual quiver theories, whose Coulomb branches are intersections $\mathcal S\cap \mathcal N$; such dual quiver theories exist for the Slodowy slices of $A$ algebras, but are limited to a subset of the Slodowy slices of $BCD$ algebras. The analysis opens new questions about the extent of $3d$ mirror symmetry within the class of SCFTs known as $T_\sigma^\rho(G)$ theories. We also give simple group theoretic formulae for the Hilbert series of Slodowy slices; these draw directly on the $SU(2)$ embedding into $G$ of the associated nilpotent orbit, and the Hilbert series of the nilpotent cone.
