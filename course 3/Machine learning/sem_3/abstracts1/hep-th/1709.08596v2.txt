Light-cone gauge formulation of relativistic dynamics of a continuous-spin field propagating in the flat space is developed. Cubic interaction vertices of continuous-spin massless fields and totally symmetric arbitrary spin massive fields are studied. We consider parity invariant cubic vertices that involve one continuous-spin massless field and two arbitrary spin massive fields and parity invariant cubic vertices that involve two continuous-spin massless fields and one arbitrary spin massive field. We construct the complete list of such vertices explicitly. Also we demonstrate that there are no cubic vertices describing consistent interaction of continuous-spin massless fields with arbitrary spin massless fields.
