It is explained why the curvature associated to the vacuum energy density arising from SUSY breaking cannot be completely transferred to the extra spatial dimensions of a bulk space-time manifold, and it is shown -- without using hierarchy arguments but only the results of current large-scale observations -- why the Tev scale should correspond to the maximal allowed SUSY-breaking scale.
