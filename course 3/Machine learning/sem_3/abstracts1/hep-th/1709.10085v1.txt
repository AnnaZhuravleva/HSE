There are many situations in which a strong electromagnetic field may be approximated as a fixed background. Going beyond this approximation, i.e. accounting for the back-reaction of quantum process on the field, is however challenging. Here we develop an approach to this problem which is a straightforward extension of background field methods. The approach follows from the observation that scattering in an on-shell background is equivalent to scattering between coherent states; we show that by deforming these states one can model back-reaction. Focussing on intense laser-matter interactions, we provide examples which model beam depletion and, furthermore, introduce an extremisation principle with which to determine the level of depletion in a given scattering process.
