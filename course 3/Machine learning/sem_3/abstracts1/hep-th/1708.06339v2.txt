In this paper we consider Witten diagrams at one loop in AdS space for scalar $\phi^3+\phi^4$ theory. After using Schwinger parametrization to trivialize the space-time loop integration, we extract the Mellin-Barnes representation for the one-loop corrections to the four-particle scattering up to an integration over the Schwinger parameters corresponding to the propagators of the internal particles running into the loop. We then discuss an approach to deal with those integrals.
