We describe a framework for constructing the Ricci-flat metrics on the total space of the canonical bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ (the del Pezzo surface of rank one). We construct explicitly the first-order deformation of the so-called `orthotoric metric' on this manifold. We also show that the deformation of the corresponding conformal Killing-Yano form does not exist.
