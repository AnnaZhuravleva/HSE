A black hole described in $SU(N)$ gauge theory consists of $N$ D-branes. By separating one of the D-branes from others and studying the interaction between them, the black hole geometry can be probed. In order to obtain quantitative results, we employ the lattice Monte Carlo simulation. As a proof of the concept, we perform an explicit calculation in the matrix model dual to the black zero-brane in type IIA string theory. We demonstrate this method actually works in the high temperature region, where the stringy correction is large. We argue possible dual gravity interpretations.
