Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) is an approach for the gravitation field that is described using the formulation and terminology similar to that of electromagnetism. The Lorentz violation is considered in the formulation of GEM that is covariant in its form. In practice such a small violation of the Lorentz symmetry may be expected in a unified theory at very high energy. In this paper a non-minimal coupling term, which exhibits Lorentz violation, is added as a new term in the covariant form. The differential cross section for Bhabha scattering in the GEM framework at finite temperature is calculated that includes Lorentz violation. The Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism is used to calculate the total differential cross section at finite temperature. The contribution due to Lorentz violation is isolated from the total cross section. It is found to be small in magnitude.
