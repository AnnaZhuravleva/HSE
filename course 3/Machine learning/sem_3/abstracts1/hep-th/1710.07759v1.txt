We hereby study the properties of a large class of weakly non-local gravitational theories around the (anti-) de Sitter spacetime background. In particular we explicitly prove that the kinetic operator for the graviton field has the same structure as the one in Einstein-Hilbert theory around any maximally symmetric spacetime. Therefore, the perturbative spectrum is the same of standard general relativity, while the propagator on any maximally symmetric spacetime is a mere generalization of the one from Einstein's gravity derived and extensively studied in several previous papers. At quantum level the range of theories here presented is super-renormalizable or finite when proper (non affecting the propagator) terms cubic or higher in curvatures are added. Finally, it is proven that for a large class of non-local theories, which in their actions do involve neither the Weyl nor the Riemann tensor, the theory is classically equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert one with cosmological constant by means of a metric field redefinition at any perturbative order.
