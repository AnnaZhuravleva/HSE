We derive new black hole solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-Axion-Dilaton theory with a hyperscaling violation exponent. We then examine the corresponding anomalous transport exhibited by cuprate strange metals in the normal phase of high-temperature superconductors via gauge/gravity duality. Linear temperature dependence resistivity and quadratic temperature dependence inverse Hall angle can be achieved. In the high temperature regime, the heat conductivity and Hall Lorenz ratio are proportional to the temperature. The Nernst signal first increases as temperature goes up but it then decreases with increasing temperature in the high temperature regime.
