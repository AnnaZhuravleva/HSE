We study a general flat space and boson star transition model on the asymptotically flat gravity background with St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg mechanism and box boundary conditions. Similar to holographic theories, we disclose properties of phase transitions mostly from the condensation of a parameter related to behaviors of scalar fields around the box boundary. We find new types of first order quasi-local thermodynamical transitions in this general model. We mainly study effects of the scalar mass and St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg mechanism on the critical phase transition points and the order of transitions. We also obtain solutions corresponding to higher energy states and examine stability of solutions with different energy states. Moreover, we mention that properties of transitions in this general asymptotically flat gravity system with box boundary conditions are strikingly similar to those in holographic insulator/superconductor transitions in the AdS gravity.
