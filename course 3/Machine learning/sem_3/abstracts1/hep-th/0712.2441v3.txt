There has been the suggestion that the cosmological constant as implied by the dark energy is related to the well-known hierarchy between the Planck scale, $M_{\rm Pl}$, and the Standard Model scale, $M_{\rm SM}$. Here we further propose that the same framework that addresses this hierarchy problem must also address the smallness problem of the cosmological constant. Specifically, we investigate the minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Randall-Sundrum model where SUSY-breaking is induced on the TeV brane and transmitted into the bulk. We show that the Casimir energy density of the system indeed conforms with the observed dark energy scale.
