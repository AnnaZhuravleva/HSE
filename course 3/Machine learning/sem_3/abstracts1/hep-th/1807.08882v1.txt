We study holographic dual descriptions of very special conformal field theories with the T(2) symmetry. After constructing solutions in effective five dimensional Einstein gravity coupled with massive two-form fields, we uplift them to the ten dimensional type IIB supergravity, via a consistent truncation ansatz, to derive new analytical solutions in string theory. From the Kaluza-Klein ansatz in terms of the internal Sasaki-Einstein space, we obtain their field theory interpretation with concrete realizations in a large class of holographic $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric conformal field theories. Null compactification of these theories yields holographic dual descriptions of non-relativistic critical systems with translational invariance but without rotational invariance such as the ones induced from a constant electromagnetic field.
