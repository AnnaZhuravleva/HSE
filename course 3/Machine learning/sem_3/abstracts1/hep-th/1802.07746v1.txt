In this paper, we obtain a bulk dual to SYK model, including SYK model with $U(1)$ charge, by Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction from three dimensions. We show that KK reduction of the 3D Einstein action plus its boundary term gives the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) model in 2D with the appropriate 1D boundary term. The dilaton of the JT model turns out to be proportional to the KK radius. Small non-zero value of the dilaton represents a small non-zero KK radius, which naturally corresponds to an effective near-\ads geometry from the 3D scenario. In presence of U(1) charge, the 3D model additionally includes a $U(1)$ Chern-Simons (CS) action. In order to describe a boundary theory with non-zero chemical potential, we have also introduced a coupling between CS gauge field and bulk gravity. The 3D CS action plus the new coupling term with appropriate boundary terms reduce in two dimensions to a BF-type action plus a source term. The bulk dual represents the soft sector of the charged SYK model. The pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone modes of combined Diff/\slr and $U(1)_{\rm local}/U(1)$ transformations are represented by combined large diffeomorphisms and large gauge transformations. The bulk action after such transformations reproduce the effective action of the pseudo NG modes of the charged SYK model. We compute chaotic correlators from the bulk and reproduce the result that the contribution from the "boundary photons" corresponds to zero Liapunov exponent.
