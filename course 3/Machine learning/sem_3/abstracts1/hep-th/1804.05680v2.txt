We discuss homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of integrable sigma models in terms of twist operators. We show that the twist operators behave as the classical analogue of a Drinfeld twist, for all abelian and almost abelian deformations. We also use twist operators to rederive the well-known interpretation of TsT transformations -- equivalent to abelian deformations -- in terms of twisted boundary conditions. We discuss complications in extending this boundary condition picture to non-abelian deformations.
