We propose new interactions of a (massive) vector multiplet with chiral multiplets and (D-type) spontaneously broken supersymmetry in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity, due to the generalized Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms. Our actions are invariant under linearly realized off-shell supersymmetry and Kaehler-Weyl transformations. We compute the scalar potentials and pinpoint some physical restrictions arising in this approach.
