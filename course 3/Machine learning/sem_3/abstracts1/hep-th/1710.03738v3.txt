In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the thermoelectric DC conductivities in the presence of Weyl corrections with momentum dissipation in the incoherent limit. Moreover, we compute the butterfly velocity and study the charge and energy diffusion with broken translational symmetry. Our results show that the Weyl coupling $\gamma$, violates the bound on the charge diffusivity and modifies the bound on the electric diffusivity. It is also shown that the Weyl corrections violate the bound on the DC electrical conductivity in the incoherent limit.
