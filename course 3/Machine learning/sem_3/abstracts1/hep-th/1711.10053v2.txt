In maximally supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge theories planar on-shell diagrams are closely related to the positive Grassmannian and the cell decomposition of it into the union of so called positroid cells \cite{A}. We establish that volume forms on positroids used to express scattering amplitudes can be $q$-deformed to Hochschild homology classes of corresponding quantum algebras. The planar amplitudes are represented in \cite {A} as sums of contributions of some set of positroid cells; we quantize these contributions. In classical limit our considerations allow us to obtain explicit formulas for contributions of positroid cells to scattering amplitudes.
