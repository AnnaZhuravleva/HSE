These are the notes for a series of Numerical Study group meetings, held in Lorentz institute in the fall of 2017. The aim of the notes is to provide a non-specialist with the minimal knowledge in numerical methods used in BVP for PDEs, necessary to solve the problems typically arising in applications of holography to condensed matter systems. A graduate level knowledge of Linear Algebra and theory of Differential Equations is assumed. Special attention is payed to the treatment of the boundary conditions of general form. The notes focus on the practical aspects of the implementation leaving aside the theory behind the methods in use. A few simple problems to test the acquired knowledge are included.
