We use holography to study $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=4$, SU($N_{\rm \tiny{c}}$) super Yang-Mills coupled to $N_{\rm \tiny{F}} \ll N_{\rm \tiny{c}}$ quark flavors. We place the theory at finite quark density by turning on an isospin chemical potential $\mu_{\rm \tiny{I}}=M_{\rm \tiny{q}}$, with $M_{\rm \tiny{q}}$ the quark mass. We also turn on two R-symmetry charge densities $n_1=n_2$. We show that the ground state is a supersymmetric, superfluid, color superconductor, namely a finite-quark density state that preserves a fraction of supersymmetry in which part of the global symmetries and part of the gauge symmetries are spontaneously broken. The holographic description consists of $N_{\rm \tiny{F}}$ D7-brane probes in $\mbox{AdS}_5 \times \mbox{S}^5$. The symmetry breaking is due to the dissolution of some D3-branes inside the D7-branes triggered by the electric field associated to the isospin charge. The massless spectrum contains Goldstone bosons and their fermionic superpartners. The massive spectrum contains long-lived, mesonic quasi-particles if $n_{\rm \tiny{I}} \ll \mu_{\rm \tiny{I}}^3$, with $n_{\rm \tiny{I}}$ the isospin charge density, and no quasi-particles otherwise. We discuss the possibility that, despite the presence of mass scales and charge densities in the theory, conformal and relativistic invariance arise as emergent symmetries in the infrared.
