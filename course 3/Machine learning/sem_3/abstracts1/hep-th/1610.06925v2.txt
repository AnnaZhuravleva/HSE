We discuss a discretization of the quantum Toda field theory associated with a semisimple finite-dimensional Lie algebra or a tamely-laced infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody algebra $G$, generalizing the previous construction of discrete quantum Liouville theory for the case $G=A_1$. The model is defined on a discrete two-dimensional lattice, whose spatial direction is of length $L$. In addition we also find a "discretized extra dimension" whose width is given by the rank $r$ of $G$, which decompactifies in the large $r$ limit. For the case of $G=A_N$ or $A_{N-1}^{(1)}$, we find a symmetry exchanging $L$ and $N$ under appropriate spatial boundary conditions. The dynamical time evolution rule of the model is a quantizations of the so-called Y-system, and the theory can be well-described by the quantum cluster algebra. We discuss possible implications for recent discussions of quantum chaos, and comment on the relation with the quantum higher Teichmuller theory of type $A_N$.
