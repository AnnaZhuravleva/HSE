We present new formulas for $n$-particle tree-level scattering amplitudes of six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) and $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supergravity (SUGRA). They are written as integrals over the moduli space of certain rational maps localized on the $(n-3)!$ solutions of the scattering equations. Due to the properties of spinor-helicity variables in six dimensions, the even-$n$ and odd-$n$ formulas are quite different and have to be treated separately. We first propose a manifestly supersymmetric expression for the even-$n$ amplitudes of $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ SYM theory and perform various consistency checks. By considering soft-gluon limits of the even-$n$ amplitudes, we deduce the form of the rational maps and the integrand for $n$ odd. The odd-$n$ formulas obtained in this way have a new redundancy that is intertwined with the usual $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ invariance on the Riemann sphere. We also propose an alternative form of the formulas, analogous to the Witten-RSV formulation, and explore its relationship with the symplectic (or Lagrangian) Grassmannian. Since the amplitudes are formulated in a way that manifests double-copy properties, formulas for the six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ SUGRA amplitudes follow. These six-dimensional results allow us to deduce new formulas for five-dimensional SYM and SUGRA amplitudes, as well as massive amplitudes of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on the Coulomb branch.
