We study the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the fundamental mass (the mass susceptibility) for the Berkooz-Douglas model as a function of temperature and at zero mass. The model is believed to be holographically dual to a D0/D4 intersection. We perform a lattice simulation of the system at finite temperature and find excellent agreement with predictions from the gravity dual.
