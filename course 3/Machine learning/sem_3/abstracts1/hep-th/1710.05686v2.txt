The general form of the action growth for a large class of static black hole solutions in modified gravity which includes $F(R)$-gravity models is computed. The cases of black hole solutions with non vanishing Ricci curvature are also considered, generalizing the results previously found and valid only for constant curvature black holes. An argument is put forward to provide a physical interpretation of the results.
