The expectation-value equations for the collapse of a macroscopic, spherically symmetric, and uncharged body are integrated up to the limit of validity of semiclassical theory. The collapse finishes with a true stable black hole of the mass microscopically exceeding the vacuum-induced charge. The apparent horizon is almost closed. The most important feature of the solution is the presence of an irremovable Cauchy horizon.
