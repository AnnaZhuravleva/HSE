We verify the existence of radially symmetric first-order solitons in a gauged $CP(2)$ scenario in which the dynamics of the Abelian gauge field is controlled by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons action. We implement the standard Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism, from which we obtain a well-defined lower bound for the corresponding energy (i.e. the Bogomol'nyi bound) and the first-order equations saturating it. We solve these first-order equations numerically by means of the finite-difference scheme, therefore obtaining regular solutions of the effective model, their energy being quantized according the winding number rotulating the final configurations, as expected. We depict the numerical solutions, whilst commenting on the main properties they engender.
