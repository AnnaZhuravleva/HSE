This review is based on the lectures given by the author at the Les Houches Summer School 2016. It describes the recently developed Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) for a non-perturbative planar spectrum of N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory in a pedagogical way starting from the harmonic oscillator and avoiding a long historical path. We give many examples and provide exercises. At the end we give a list of the recent and possible future applications of the QSC.
