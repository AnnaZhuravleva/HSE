Next step is reported in the program of Racah matrices extraction from the differential expansion of HOMFLY polynomials for twist knots: from the double-column rectangular representations R=[rr] to a triple-column and triple-hook R=[333]. The main new phenomenon is the deviation of the particular coefficient $f_{[332]}^{[21]}$ from the corresponding skew dimension, what opens a way to further generalizations.
