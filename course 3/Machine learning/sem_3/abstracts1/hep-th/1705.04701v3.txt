We continue the study of the nonrelativistic short-distance completions of a naturally light Higgs, focusing on the interplay between the gauge symmetries and the polynomial shift symmetries. We investigate the naturalness of nonrelativistic scalar quantum electrodynamics with a dynamical critical exponent $z=3$ by computing leading power law divergences to the scalar propagator in this theory. We find that power law divergences exhibit a more refined structure in theories that lack boost symmetries. Finally, in this toy model, we show that it is possible to preserve a fairly large hierarchy between the scalar mass and the high energy naturalness scale across 7 orders of magnitude, while accommodating a gauge coupling of order 0.1.
