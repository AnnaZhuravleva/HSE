Exceptional field theory (EFT) gives a geometric underpinning of the U-duality symmetries of M-theory. In this talk I give an overview of the surprisingly rich algebraic structures which naturally appear in the context of EFT. This includes Borcherds superalgebras, Cartan type superalgebras (tensor hierarchy algebras) and $L_\infty$ algebras. This is the written version of a talk based mainly on refs.
