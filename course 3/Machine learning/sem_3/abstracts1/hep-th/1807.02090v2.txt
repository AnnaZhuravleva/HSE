Different types of numerical approximations of cold dense nuclear matter suggested that baryons in such a regime should be in a solid crystalline phase. Here the first analytic solutions in the (3+1)- dimensional Skyrme model representing multi-layered configurations of Skyrmions with crystalline structure living in at space-times at finite density are presented. The number of the peaks in the energy density in each layer is related with the Baryonic charge of that layer. The positions of the peaks in each layer can be computed explicitly by maximizing the energy density and they manifest a clear crystalline order. The total Baryon charge is the product of the number of layers times the Baryon charge of the layers. This construction provides with the first exact description of the so-called popcorn transitions in the low energy limit of full-fledged QCD. The present construction reveals the intriguing possibility of fractional Baryonic charges as the bumps in these crystal-like structures carry a fraction of 1/q of unit Baryonic charge (q being an odd integer). The propagation of electrons (Fermions) in these crystalline structures confirms the presence of fractional Baryonic charges.
