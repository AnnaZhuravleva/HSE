We explore a web of connections between quantum entanglement and knot theory by examining how topological entanglement entropy probes the braiding data of quasi-particles in Chern-Simons theory, mainly using $SU(2)$ gauge group as our working example. The problem of determining the Renyi entropy is mapped to computing the expectation value of an auxiliary Wilson loop in $S^3$ for each braid. We study various properties of this auxiliary Wilson loop for some 2-strand and 3-strand braids, and demonstrate how they reflect some geometrical properties of the underlying braids.
