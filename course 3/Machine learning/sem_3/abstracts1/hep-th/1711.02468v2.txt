We find the Yangian symmetry underlying the integrability of type IIB superstrings on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz flux. The abstract commutation relations of the Yangian are formulated via RTT realisation, while its matrix realisation is in an evaluation representation depending on the quantised coefficient of the Wess-Zumino term. The construction naturally encodes a secret symmetry of the worldsheet scattering matrix whose generators map different Yangian levels to each other. We show that in the large effective string tension limit the Yangian becomes a deformation of a unitary loop algebra and we derive its universal classical r-matrix.
