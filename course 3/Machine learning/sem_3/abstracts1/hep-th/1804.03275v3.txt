This note aims to provide an entr\'ee to two developments in two-dimensional topological gravity -- that is, intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces -- that have not yet become well-known among physicists. A little over a decade ago, Mirzakhani discovered \cite{M1,M2} an elegant new proof of the formulas that result from the relationship between topological gravity and matrix models of two-dimensional gravity. Here we will give a very partial introduction to that work, which hopefully will also serve as a modest tribute to the memory of a brilliant mathematical pioneer. More recently, Pandharipande, Solomon, and Tessler \cite{PST} (with further developments in \cite{Tes,BT,STa}) generalized intersection theory on moduli space to the case of Riemann surfaces with boundary, leading to generalizations of the familiar KdV and Virasoro formulas. Though the existence of such a generalization appears natural from the matrix model viewpoint -- it corresponds to adding vector degrees of freedom to the matrix model -- constructing this generalization is not straightforward. We will give some idea of the unexpected way that the difficulties were resolved.
