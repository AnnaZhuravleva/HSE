How to construct the $d+1$ dimensional geometry explicitly from the dual CFT$_d$ is a widely concerned problem. Specifically, given entanglement entropies of a CFT$_2$, which is purely expressed by two dimensional parameters, can we build the dual three dimensional geometry unambiguously? To do this, one must assume nothing is known about the three dimensional geometry and starts with the most general setup. In this paper, by identifying the UV and IR entanglement entropies of a perturbed usual CFT$_2$ with the geodesic lengths, we show that, the dual geometry is uniquely determined to be asymptotic AdS$_3$. The hidden dimension is generated by the energy cut-off of the CFT$_2$, according to the holographic principle. The pure AdS$_3$ is obtained by taking the massless limit. Our derivations apply to both static and covariant scenarios. Moreover, what deserves special attention is that the ratio of the numberical factors of the UV/IR entanglement entropies are crucial to have a dual geometry. We are led to conjecture a necessary condition of holographic CFT$_2$.
