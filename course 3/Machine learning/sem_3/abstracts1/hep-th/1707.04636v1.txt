We construct globally-defined $SU(3)$ structures on smooth compact toric varieties (SCTV) in the class of $\mathbb{CP}^1$ bundles over $M$, where $M$ is an arbitrary SCTV of complex dimension two. The construction can be extended to the case where the base is K\"ahler-Einstein of positive curvature, but not necessarily toric, and admits a parameter space which includes $SU(3)$ structures of LT type.
