We construct explicit examples of fibre inflation models which are globally embedded in type IIB orientifolds with chiral matter on D7-branes and full closed string moduli stabilisation. The minimal setup involves a Calabi-Yau threefold with h^{1,1}=4 Kaehler moduli which features multiple K3 fibrations and a del Pezzo divisor supporting non-perturbative effects. We perform a consistent choice of orientifold involution, brane setup and gauge fluxes which leads to chiral matter and a moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term. After D-term stabilisation, the number of Kaehler moduli is effectively reduced to 3 and the internal volume reduces to the one of fibre inflation models. The inflationary potential is generated by suitable string loop corrections in combination with higher derivative effects. We analyse the inflationary dynamics both in the single-field approximation and by numerically deriving the full multi-field evolution in detail. Interestingly, we find that the Kaehler cone conditions set strong constraints on the allowed inflaton field range.
