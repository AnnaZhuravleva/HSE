We discuss the existence of the knot solitons (Hopfions) of the $SU(3)$ Skryme-Faddeev-Niemi model which can be viewed as an effective theory of the $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory or the $SU(3)$ anti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg model. We examine with two different types of ansatz; one is a trivially embedded $SU(2)$ configuration and another is a nonembedding configuration which can be generated by the \Backlund transformation. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equations for both ansatz share common structure with the equation of motion of the known $CP^1$ Skyrme-Faddeev-Niemi model. The quantum natures of the solutions are examined by the collective coordinate zero-mode quantization method.
