In ABJ(M) theory, we propose a matrix model for the exact evaluation of BPS Wilson loops on a latitude circular contour, so providing a new weak-strong interpolation tool. Intriguingly, the matrix model turns out to be a particular case of that computing torus knot invariants in $U(N_1|N_2)$ Chern-Simons theory. At weak coupling we check our proposal against a three-loop computation, performed for generic framing, winding number and representation. The matrix model is amenable of a Fermi gas formulation, which we use to systematically compute the strong coupling and genus expansions. For the fermionic Wilson loop the leading planar behavior agrees with a previous string theory prediction. For the bosonic operator our result provides a clue for finding the corresponding string dual configuration. Our matrix model is consistent with recent proposals for computing Bremsstrahlung functions exactly in terms of latitude Wilson loops. As a by-product, we extend the conjecture for the exact $B^{\theta}_{1/6}$ Bremsstrahlung function to generic representations and test it with a four-loop perturbative computation. Finally, we propose an exact prediction for $B_{1/2}$ at unequal gauge group ranks.
