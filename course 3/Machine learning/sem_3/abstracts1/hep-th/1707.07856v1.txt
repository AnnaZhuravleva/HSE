We consider the question of reducibility of the differential system to normalized Fuchsian form on the Riemann sphere. The differential equations for the multiloop integrals in $\epsilon$-form constitute a particular example of the normalized Fuchsian form. We formulate the algorithmic criterion of reducibility. We also consider the question of the proper choice of variable in the differential system suitable for its reduction to $\epsilon$-form.
