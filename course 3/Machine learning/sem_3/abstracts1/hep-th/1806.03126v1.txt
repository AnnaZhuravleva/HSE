We present an explicit analytical computation of the quantum corrections, at next-to-leading order, to the critical exponents. We employ for that the Unconventional minimal subtraction, recently proposed, and the Callan-Symanzik methods to probe the universality hypothesis by comparing the outcomes for the critical exponents evaluated in both methods and the ones calculated previously in massless theories renormalized at different renormalization schemes. Furthermore, the consistency of the former method is investigated for the first time in literature, to our knowledge. At the end, we compute the critical exponents at any loop level by an induction process and furnish the physical interpretation of the results.
