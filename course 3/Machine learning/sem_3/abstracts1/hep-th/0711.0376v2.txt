We consider gauge vortices in symmetry breaking models with a non-canonical kinetic term. This work extends our previous study on global topological k-defects (hep-th/0608071), including a gauge field. The model consists of a scalar field with a non-canonical kinetic term, while for the gauge field the standard form of its kinetic term is preserved. Topological defects arising in such models, k-vortices, may have quite different properties as compared to ``standard'' vortices. This happens because an additional dimensional parameter enters the Lagrangian for the considered model -- a ``kinetic'' mass. We briefly discuss possible consequences for cosmology, in particular, the formation of cosmic strings during phase transitions in the early universe and their properties.
