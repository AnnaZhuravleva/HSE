One of the main advantages of super-renormalizable higher derivative quantum gravity models is the possibility to derive exact beta functions, by making perturbative one-loop calculations. We perform such a calculation for the Newton constant by using the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky trace technology. The result is well-defined in a large class of models of gravity in the sense that the renormalization group beta functions do not depend on the gauge-fixing condition. Finally, we discuss the possibility to apply the results to a large class of nonlocal gravitational theories which are free of massive ghost-like states at the tree-level.
