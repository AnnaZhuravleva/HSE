Hawking's black hole evaporation process has led to several paradoxes, stimulating searches for new physics. Without introducing any exotic objects, we here show that in fact after the full black hole evaporation the outgoing Hawking particles are entangled with each other and are consequently in a pure state. At any stage of the evaporation process, we carefully track the entanglement of the state of matter and Hawking particles. However, in the case of full evaporation, we show that the entanglement is transferred from particles inside the black hole to the outside particles created at different times, in a way equivalent to 'entanglement swapping'. Therefore, the final state after the full black hole evaporation is pure, without violating unitarity, the monogamy theorem, or the equivalence principle.
