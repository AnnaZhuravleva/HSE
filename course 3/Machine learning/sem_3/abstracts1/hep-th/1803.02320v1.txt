We show in details that the all-orders genus expansion of the two-cut Hermitian cubic matrix model reproduces the perturbative expansion of the $H_1$ Argyres-Douglas theory coupled to the $\Omega$ background. In the self-dual limit we use the Painlev\'e/gauge correspondence and we show that, after summing over all instanton sectors, the two-cut cubic matrix model computes the tau function of Painlev\'e II without taking any double scaling limit or adding any external fields. We decode such solution within the context of trans-series. Finally in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit we connect the $H_1$ and the $H_0$ Argyres-Douglas theories to the quantum mechanical models with cubic and double well potentials.
