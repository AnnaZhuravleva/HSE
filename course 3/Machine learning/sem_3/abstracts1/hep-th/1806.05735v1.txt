In this work we investigate the effects of dark energy quintessence on the evolution of the computational complexity in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence. We use   $complexity-action$ conjecture to write the action for a charged black hole gravity and by considering the dark energy counterpart to the model, we try to find how the complexity change by time? Does it satisfy the Lloyd bound. We also investigate evolution of the complexity when boundary region is perturbed by a small amount of energy. Actually we want to find how dark energy could be effective in the shock wave geometry.
