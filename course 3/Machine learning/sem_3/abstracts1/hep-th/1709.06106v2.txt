We discuss USp(2n) supersymmetric models with eight fundamental fields and a field in the antisymmetric representation. Turning on the most generic superpotentials, coupling pairs of fundamental fields to powers of the antisymmetric field while preserving an R symmetry, we give evidence for the statement that the models are connected by a large network of dualities which can be organized into orbits of the Weyl group of E_8. We make also several curious observations about such models. In particular, we argue that a USp(2m) model with the addition of singlet fields and even rank m flows in the IR to a CFT with E_7 U(1) symmetry. We also discuss an infinite number of duals for the USp(2) theory with eight fundamentals and no superpotential.
