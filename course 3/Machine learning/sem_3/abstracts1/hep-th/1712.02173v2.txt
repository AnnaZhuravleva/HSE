The entropic force experienced by a moving quarkonia in a plasma, is computed in a hyperscaling violation background by holography approach. In that case, the axis of the moving quarkonia has an arbitrary angle with wind. We use the results for HSV parameters which obtained in our paper [1] as appropriate values satisfying condition $ImV_{Q\bar{Q}}< 0$. We will show that, in this background the entropic force of the meson shows a decreasing behaviour corresponds to increasing dissociation length. Results of this paper are in agreement with our mentioned work. In addition we will find diffusion constant in an exact case and by an exact approach [2] which satisfies the mentioned condition in there.
