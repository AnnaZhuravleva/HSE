We consider a local phenomenological model to explain a non-local gravity scenario which has been proposed to address dark energy issues. This non-local gravity action has been seen to fit the data as well as $\Lambda$-CDM and therefore demands a more fundamental local treatment. The induced gravity model coupled with higher-derivative gravity is exploited for this proposal, as this perturbatively renormalizable model has a well-defined ultraviolet (UV) description where ghosts are evaded. We consider a generalised version of this model where we consider two coupled scalar fields and their non-minimal coupling with gravity. In this simple model, one of the scalar field acquires a Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV), thereby inducing a mass for one of the scalar fields and generating Newton's constant. The induced mass however is seen to be always above the running energy scale thereby leading to its decoupling. The residual theory after decoupling becomes a platform for driving the accelerated expansion under certain conditions. Integrating out the residual scalar generates a non-local gravity action. The leading term of which is the non-local gravity action used to fit the data of dark energy.
