We explore the connection between the holographic Weyl anomaly and the superconformal index in six-dimensional $(1,0)$ theories. Using earlier results from holographic computations of the $\mathcal O(1)$ contributions $\delta a$ and $\delta(c-a)$ to the corresponding six-dimensional Weyl anomaly coefficients, we derive a pair of differential operators that extracts these values from the large-$N$ single-trace index. In doing so, we also highlight the structure of these corrections in terms of group theory invariants of the superconformal representations.
