The celebrated holographic entropy bound asserts that, within the framework of a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, the maximal entropy (information) content of a physical system is given by one quarter of its circumscribing area: $S\leq S_{\text{max}}={\cal A}/4{\ell^2_P}$ (here $\ell_P$ is the Planck length). An intriguing possible counter-example to this fundamental entropy bound, which involves {\it homogenous} weakly self-gravitating confined thermal fields in higher-dimensional spacetimes, has been proposed almost a decade ago. Interestingly, in the present paper we shall prove that this composed physical system, which at first sight seems to violate the holographic entropy bound, actually conforms to the entropy-area inequality $S\leq {\cal A}/4{\ell^2_P}$. In particular, we shall explicitly show that the homogeneity property of the confined thermal fields sets an upper bound on the entropy content of the system. The present analysis therefore resolves the apparent violation of the holographic entropy bound by confined thermal fields in higher-dimensional spacetimes.
