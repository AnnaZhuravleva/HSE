The classical double copy procedure relates classical asymptotically-flat gravitational field solutions to Yang-Mills and scalar field solutions living in Minkowski space. In this paper we extend this correspondence to maximally symmetric curved spacetimes. We consider asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes in Kerr-Schild form and construct the corresponding single and zeroth copies. In order to clarify the interpretation of these copies, we study several examples including (A)dS-Schwarzschild, (A)dS-Kerr, black strings, black branes, and waves, paying particular attention to the source terms. We find that the single and zeroth copies of stationary solutions satisfy different equations than those of wave solutions. We also consider how to obtain Einstein-Maxwell solutions using this procedure. Finally, we derive the classical single and zeroth copy of the BTZ black hole.
