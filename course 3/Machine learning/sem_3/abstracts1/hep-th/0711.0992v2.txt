Einstein-Maxwell theory implies the mixing of photons with gravitons in an external electromagnetic field. This process and its possible observable consequences have been studied at tree level for many years. We use the worldline formalism for obtaining an exact integral representation for the one-loop corrections to this amplitude due to scalars and fermions. We study the structure of this amplitude, and obtain exact expressions for various limiting cases.
