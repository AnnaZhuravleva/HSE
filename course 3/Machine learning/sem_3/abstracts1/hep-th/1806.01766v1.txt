This essay proves the cyclic invariance of anti-NMHV and N$^2$MHV tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM up to any number of external particles as an interesting exercise. In the proof the two-fold simplex-like structures introduced in 1609.08627 (and reviewed in 1712.10000) play a key role, as the cyclicity of amplitudes also induces similar simplex-like structures for the boundary generators of homological identities. For this purpose, we only need a part of all distinct boundary generators, and the relevant identities only involve BCFW-like cells.
