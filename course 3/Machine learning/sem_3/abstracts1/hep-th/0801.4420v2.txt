In cyclic cosmology based on phantom dark energy the requirement that our universe satisfy a CBE-condition ({\it Comes Back Empty}) imposes a lower bound on the number $N_{\rm cp}$ of causal patches which separate just prior to turnaround. This bound depends on the dark energy equation of state $w = p/\rho = -1 - \phi$ with $\phi > 0$. More accurate measurement of $\phi$ will constrain $N_{\rm cp}$. The critical density $\rho_c$ in the model has a lower bound $\rho_c \ge (10^9 {\rm GeV})^4$ or $\rho_c \ge (10^{18} {\rm GeV})^4$ when the smallest bound state has size $10^{-15}$m, or $10^{-35}$m, respectively.
