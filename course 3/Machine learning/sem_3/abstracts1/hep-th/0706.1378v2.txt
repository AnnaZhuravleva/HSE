We consider class of modified $f(R)$ gravities with the effective cosmological constant epoch at the early and late universe. Such models pass most of solar system tests as well they satisfy to cosmological bounds. Despite their very attractive properties, it is shown that one realistic class of such models may lead to significant Newton law corrections which become small at the future universe only. The model with acceptable Newton law regime shows the matter instability. This suggests that more complicated version of such theory (or extended parameters space) should be investigated.
