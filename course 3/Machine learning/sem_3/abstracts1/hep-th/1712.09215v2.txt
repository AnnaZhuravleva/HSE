We study shift relations between Feynman integrals via the Mellin transform through parametric annihilation operators. These contain the momentum space IBP relations, which are well-known in the physics literature. Applying a result of Loeser and Sabbah, we conclude that the number of master integrals is computed by the Euler characteristic of the Lee-Pomeransky polynomial. We illustrate techniques to compute this Euler characteristic in various examples and compare it with numbers of master integrals obtained in previous works.
