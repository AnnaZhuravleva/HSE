We bootstrap loop corrections to AdS${}_5$ supergravity amplitudes by enforcing the consistency of the known classical results with the operator product expansion of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. In particular this yields much new information on the spectrum of double-trace operators which can then be used, in combination with superconformal symmetry and crossing symmetry, to obtain a prediction for the one-loop amplitude for four graviton multiplets in AdS. This in turn yields further new results on subleading $O(1/N^4)$ corrections to certain double-trace anomalous dimensions.
