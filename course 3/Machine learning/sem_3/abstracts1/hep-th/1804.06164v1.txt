We study a class of SYK-type models in large N limit from the gravity dual side in terms of Schwarzian action analytically. The quantum correction to two point correlation function due to the Schwarzian action produces transfer of degree of freedom from the quasiparticle peak to Hubbard band in density of states (DOS), a signature strong correlation. In Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) formalism, we calculate higher point thermal out-of-time order correlation (OTOC) functions, which indicate quantum chaos by having Lyapunov exponent. Higher order local spin-spin correlations are also calculated, which can be related to the dynamical local susceptibility of quantum liquids such as spin glasses, disordered metals.
