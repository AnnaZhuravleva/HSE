We study near horizon geometry of extremal static and stationary Oliva Tempo Troncoso (OTT) black hole. We define the set od consistent asymptotic conditions in both cases and obtain that in the static case canonical generator is regular. For the rotating OTT black hole we get that the corresponding asymptotic symmetry consists of time reparameterization, chiral Virasoro and centrally extended $u(1)$ Kac-Moody algebra.
