We study different aspects of quantum entanglement and its measures, including entanglement entropy in the vacuum state of a certain Lifshitz scalar theory. We present simple intuitive arguments based on "non-local" effects of this theory that the scaling of entanglement entropy depends on the dynamical exponent as a characteristic parameter of the theory. The scaling is such that in the massless theory for small entangling regions it leads to area law in the Lorentzian limit and volume law in the $z\to\infty$ limit. We present strong numerical evidences in (1+1) and (2+1)-dimensions in support of this behavior. In (2+1)-dimensions we also study some shape dependent aspects of entanglement. We argue that in the massless limit corner contributions are no more additive for large enough dynamical exponents due to non-local effects of Lifshitz theories. We also comment on possible holographic duals of such theories based on the sign of tripartite information.
