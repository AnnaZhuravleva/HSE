We present numerical results for the nonplanar lightlike cusp and collinear anomalous dimension at four loops in ${\mathcal N} = 4$ SYM theory, which we infer from a calculation of the Sudakov form factor. The latter is expressed as a rational linear combination of uniformly transcendental integrals for arbitrary colour factor. Numerical integration in the nonplanar sector reveals explicitly the breakdown of quadratic Casimir scaling at the four-loop order. A thorough analysis of the reported numerical uncertainties is carried out.
