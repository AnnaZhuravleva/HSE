We note that large classes of contractions of algebras that arise in physics can be understood purely algebraically, via identifying appropriate $\mathbb{Z}_m$-gradings (and their generalizations) on the parent algebra. This includes various types of flat space/Carroll limits of finite and infinite dimensional (A)dS algebras, as well as Galilean and Galilean Conformal algebras. Our observations can be regarded as providing a natural context for the Grassmann approach of arXiv:1312.2941. We also introduce a related notion, which we call partial grading, that arises naturally in this context.
