We consider the open superstring action in the AdS$_4 \times \mathbf{CP}^3$ background and investigate the suitable boundary conditions for the open superstring describing the 1/2-BPS D-branes by imposing the $\kappa$-symmetry of the action. This results in the classification of 1/2-BPS D-branes from covariant open superstring. It is shown that the 1/2-BPS D-brane configurations are restricted considerably by the K\"{a}hler structure on $\mathbf{CP}^3$. We just consider D-branes without worldvolume fluxes.
