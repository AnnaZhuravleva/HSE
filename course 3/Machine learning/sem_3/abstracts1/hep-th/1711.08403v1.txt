A new proposal for the notion of spacetime in a relativistic generalization of special relativity based on a modification of the composition law of momenta is presented. Locality of interactions is the principle which defines the spacetime structure for a system of particles. The formulation based on $\kappa$-Poincar\'e Hopf algebra is shown to be contained in this framework as a particular example.
