In arXiv:1601.02203 and arXiv:1702.07063, we have proposed a topological model with a simple Lagrangian density and have tried to solve one of the cosmological constant problems. The Lagrangian density is the BRS exact and therefore the model can be regarded as a topological theory. In this model, the divergence of the vacuum energy coming from the quantum corrections from matters can be absorbed into the redefinition of the scalar field. In this paper, we consider the extension of the model in order to apply the mechanism to other kinds of divergences coming from the quantum correction and consider the cosmology in an extended model.
