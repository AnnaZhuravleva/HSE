We study out-of-time-ordered correlation functions in permutation orbifolds at large central charge. We show that they do not decay at late times for arbitrary choices of low-dimension operators, indicating that permutation orbifolds are non-chaotic theories. This is in agreement with the fact they are free discrete gauge theories and should be integrable rather than chaotic. We comment on the early-time behaviour of the correlators as well as the deformation to strong coupling.
