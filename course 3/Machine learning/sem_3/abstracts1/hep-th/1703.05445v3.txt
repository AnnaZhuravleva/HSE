We use the tensor network living on the Bruhat-Tits tree to give a concrete realization of the recently proposed $p$-adic AdS/CFT correspondence (a holographic duality based on the $p$-adic number field $\mathbb{Q}_p$). Instead of assuming the $p$-adic AdS/CFT correspondence, we show how important features of AdS/CFT such as the bulk operator reconstruction and the holographic computation of boundary correlators are automatically implemented in this tensor network.
