Representation theory provides a suitable framework to count and classify invariants in tensor models. We show that there are two natural ways of counting invariants, one for arbitrary rank of the gauge group and a second, which is only valid for large N. We construct bases of invariant operators based on the counting, and compute correlators of their elements. The basis associated with finite N diagonalizes the two-point function of the theory and it is analogous to the restricted Schur basis used in matrix models. We comment on future lines of investigation.
