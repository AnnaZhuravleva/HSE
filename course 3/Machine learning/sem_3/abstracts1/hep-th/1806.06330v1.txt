We study the nearly AdS(2) geometry of nearly extremal black holes in N = 2 supergravity in four dimensions. In the strictly extreme limit the attractor mechanism for asymptotically flat black holes states that the horizon geometries of these black holes are independent of scalar moduli. We determine the dependence of the near extreme geometry on asymptotic moduli and express the result in simple formulae that generalize the extremal attractor mechanism to nearly extreme black holes. This is a nAttractor mechanism. We discuss the dependence of the near horizon theory on the scales introduced by generic attractor flows.
