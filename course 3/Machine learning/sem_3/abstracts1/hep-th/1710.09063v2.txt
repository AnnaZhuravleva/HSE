We identify the operators in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that correspond to ${1\over 8}$-BPS giant gravitons in AdS$_5\times$S$^5$. Our evidence for the identification comes from (1) counting these operators and showing agreement with independent counts of the number of giant graviton states, and (2) by demonstrating a correspondence between correlation functions of the super Yang-Mills operators and overlaps of the giant graviton wave functions.
