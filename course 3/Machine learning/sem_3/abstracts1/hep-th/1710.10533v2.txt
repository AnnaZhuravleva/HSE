We analyze the structure of the family of quadratic superalgebras, introduced in J Phys A 44(23):235205 (2011), for the quadatic deformations of $N = 1$ space-time conformal supersymmetry. We characterize in particular the `zero-step' modules for this case. In such modules, the odd generators vanish identically, and the quadratic superalgebra is realized on a single irreducible representation of the even subalgebra (which is a Lie algebra). In the case under study, the quadratic deformations of $N = 1$ space-time conformal supersymmetry, it is shown that each massless positive energy unitary irreducible representation (in the standard classification of Mack), forms such a zero-step module, for an appropriate parameter choice amongst the quadratic family (with vanishing central charge). For these massless particle multiplets therefore, quadratic supersymmetry is unbroken, in that the supersymmetry generators annihilate \emph{all} physical states (including the vacuum state), while at the same time, superpartners do not exist.
