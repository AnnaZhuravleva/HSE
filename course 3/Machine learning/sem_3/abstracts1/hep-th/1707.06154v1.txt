We present a new BPS flow within minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity in seven dimensions describing a warped $\textrm{AdS}_{3}$ background supported by a "dyonic" profile of the three-form. Furthermore, we discuss the holographic interpretation of the above solution in terms of a defect $\textrm{SCFT}_{2}$ inside the 6d $(1,0)$ theory dual to the AdS in the asymptotic region. Finally we provide the brane picture of the aforementioned defect CFT as D2- and wrapped D4-branes ending on a D6 - NS5 - D8 funnel in massive type IIA string theory.
