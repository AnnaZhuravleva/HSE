We use the spinor helicity formalism to study KLT-like relations for the inflationary graviton four-point correlation function. New features are observed in this correlation function compared to the graviton scattering amplitude in flat spaceime. After obtaining the general momentum dependence, collinear, squeezed and collapsed limits are considered to further study the features of the correlation function, and the relation to the corresponding flat space scattering amplitude.
