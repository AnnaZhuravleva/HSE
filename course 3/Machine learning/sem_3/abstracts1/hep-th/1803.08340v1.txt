In this paper, we examine the validity of the first law of inner mechanics of black holes in Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity. We consider BTZ and spacelike warped black holes and show that the first law of inner mechanics is valid for given black holes in Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity. As we expect, due to the presence of the Lorentz Chern-Simons term in Lagrangian of considered model, the product of the entropies of the inner and outer horizons depends on the mass as it happens in Topologically Massive Gravity.
