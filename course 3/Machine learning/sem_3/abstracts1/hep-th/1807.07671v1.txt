In this work, we analyze an extended $\mathcal{N}=2$ supesymmetry with central charge and develop its superspace formulation under two distinct points of view. Initially, in the context of classical mechanics, we discuss the introduction of deformed supersymmetric derivatives and their consequence on the deformation of a particular one-dimensional nonlinear sigma-model. After that, considering a field-theoretical framework, we present an implementation of this superalgebra in two dimensions, such that one of the coordinates is related to the central charge. As an application, in this two-dimensional scenario, we investigate the topological configurations of a special self-coupled matter model.
