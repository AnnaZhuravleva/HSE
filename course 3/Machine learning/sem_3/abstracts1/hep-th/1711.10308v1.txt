A simple quantum superfield generating equation of the field-antifield formalism is proposed. The Schroedinger equation with the Hamiltonian having $\Delta$-exact form is derived. An $Sp(2)$ symmetric extension to the main construction, with specific features caused by the principal fact that all basic equations become $Sp(2)$ vector-valued ones, is presented. A principal role of quantum antibrackets in formulation of the Heisenberg equations of motion is shown.
