Several years ago, it was proposed that the usual solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated to Lie groups can be deduced in a systematic way from four-dimensional gauge theory. In the present paper, we extend this picture, fill in many details, and present the arguments in a concrete and down-to-earth way. Many interesting effects, including the leading nontrivial contributions to the $R$-matrix, the operator product expansion of line operators, the framing anomaly, and the quantum deformation that leads from $\mathfrak{g}[[z]]$ to the Yangian, are computed explicitly via Feynman diagrams. We explain how rational, trigonometric, and elliptic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation arise in this framework, along with a generalization that is known as the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation.
