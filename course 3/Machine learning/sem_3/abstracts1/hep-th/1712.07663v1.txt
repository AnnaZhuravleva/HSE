We perturbatively construct asymptotically $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times\mathbb{T}^2$ black branes with multiple inhomogeneous directions and show that some of them are thermodynamically preferred over uniform branes in both the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. This demonstrates that, unlike five-dimensional black strings, the instability of some unstable black branes has a plausible endpoint that does not require a violation of cosmic censorship.
