By imposing the weighted renormalization condition and the (super)symmetry requirements, we construct a Lifshitz-like extension of the three-dimensional Wess-Zumino model, with dynamical critical exponent z=2. In this context, the auxiliary field F plays a key role by introducing the appropriate Lifshitz operator in the bosonic sector of the theory, avoiding so undesirable time-space mixing derivatives and inconsistencies concerning the critical z exponent, as reported in the literature. The consistency of the proposed model is verified by building explicitly the susy algebra through the Noether method in the canonical formalism. This component-field Lifshitz-Wess-Zumino model is in addition rephrased in the Lifshitz superspace, a natural modification of the conventional one. Finally, the one-loop effective potential is computed to study the possibility of symmetry breaking. It is found that supersymmetry remains intact at one-loop order, while the U(1) phase symmetry suffers a spontaneous breakdown above the critical value of the renormalization point. By renormalizing the one-loop effective potential within the cutoff regularization scheme, it is observed an improvement of the UV behavior of the theory compared with the relativistic Wess-Zumino model.
