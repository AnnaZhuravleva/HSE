We consider supersymmetric deformations of gauge theories in various dimensions obtained from a String Theory realisation of branes embedded in flux backgrounds. In particular we obtain deformations which take the form of Wilson line defects, where the R-symmetry is twisted into the gauge symmetry. Furthermore we construct higher-order generalisations, also expressed a twisting of the R-symmetry, that have symmetries associated to co-dimension two and three defects.
