We map the quantum problem of a free bosonic field in a space-time dependent background into a classical problem. $N$ degrees of freedom of a real field in the quantum theory are mapped into $2N^2$ classical simple harmonic oscillators with specific initial conditions. We discuss how this classical-quantum correspondence (CQC) may be used to evaluate quantum radiation and also to analyze the backreaction of quantum fields on classical backgrounds.
