We study the mutual information between pairs of regions on the two asymptotic boundaries of maximally-extended anisotropic black-brane solutions. This quantity characterizes the local pattern of entanglement of thermofield double states which are dual to these geometries. We analyse the disruption of the mutual information in anisotropic shock wave geometries and show that the entanglement velocity plays an important role in this phenomenon. Besides that we compute several chaos-related properties of this system, like the entanglement velocity, the butterfly velocity and the scrambling time. We find that the butterfly velocity and the entanglement velocity violate the upper bounds proposed in 1311.1200 and 1612.00082, but remain bounded by their corresponding values in the infrared effective theory.
