We consider the problem of transferring overall rotation of quark-gluon plasma to polarization of hyperons along the rotation axis. As a toy theoretical model, we exploit that of pionic superfluidity induced by chemical potentials violating isotopic symmetry. Apparently, the model accounts only for the light degrees of freedom, that is pions. The rotation, however, results in vortices which are infinitely thin in the hydrodynamic approximation. Field theory resolves the singularity and predicts that the core of the vortices is build up on spins of baryons. We review consequences from the quark-hadron duality in this case. First, an anomalous triangle graph in effective field theory turns to be dual to the vorticity term in the standard hydrodynamic expansion. And, then, the overall coefficient determining the polarization of baryons is fixed by duality with the triangle graph in the fundamental field theory.
