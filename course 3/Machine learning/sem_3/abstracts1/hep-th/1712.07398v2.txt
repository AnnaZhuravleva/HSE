The gravitational part of the holographic dual to the SYK model has been conjectured to be Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. In this paper we construct an AdS2 background in N = (2,2) JT gravity and show that the gravitational dynamics are - as in the N = 0 and N = 1 cases - fully captured by the extrinsic curvature as an effective boundary action. This boundary term is given by the super-Schwarzian of the N = 2 SYK model, thereby providing further evidence of the JT/SYK duality. The chirality of this SYK model is reproduced by the inherent chirality of axial N = (2,2) supergravity.
