In the context of the gauge/gravity duality applications, we study and compute the entanglement entropy of gauge theories corresponding to string/M theories on D3-, M2- and M5-brane backgrounds. This is achieved using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We obtain the entanglement entropy for the general cases of the D3-, M2- and M5-brane backgrounds and also for the near horizon AdS limit, as well as the non-conformal flat space limit in each case.
