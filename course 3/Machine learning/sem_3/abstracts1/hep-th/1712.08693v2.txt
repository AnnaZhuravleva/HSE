In the present work, the set of stationary solutions of the Gross-Neveu model in't Hooft limit is extended. Such extension is obtained by striving a hidden supersymmetry associated to disconnected sets of stationary solutions. How the supersymmetry arises from the Darboux-Miura transformations between Lax pairs of stationary modified Korteweg-de Vries and the stationary Korteweg-de Vries hierarchies are shown, associating the correspondent superpotentials to self-consistent condensates for the Gross-Neveu model.
