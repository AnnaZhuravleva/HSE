In this work we discuss the dynamical generation of mass in a deformed ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in a two-dimensional ($D=1+1$) space-time. We introduce the deformation by imposing a constraint that explicitly breaks supersymmetry. Through the tadpole method, we compute the effective potential at leading order in $1/N$ expansion showing that the model exhibit a dynamical generation of mass to the matter fields. Supersymmetry is recovered in the limit of the deformation parameter going to zero.
