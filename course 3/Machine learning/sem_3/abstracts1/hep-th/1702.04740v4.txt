Compactifying N=(1,0) theories on a torus, with additional fluxes for global symmetries, we obtain N=1 supersymmetric theories in four dimensions. It is shown that for many choices of flux these models are toric quiver gauge theories with singlet fields. In particular we compare the anomalies deduced from the description of the six-dimensional theory and the anomalies of the quiver gauge theories. We also give predictions for anomalies of four-dimensional theories corresponding to general compactifications of M5-branes probing C_2/Z_k singularities.
