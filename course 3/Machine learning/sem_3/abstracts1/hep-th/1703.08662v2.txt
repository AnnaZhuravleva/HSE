We study spherically symmetric static solutions to the semi-classical Einstein equation sourced by the vacuum energy of quantum fields in the curved space-time of the same solution. We found solutions that are small deformations of the Schwarzschild metric for distant observers, but without horizon. Instead of being a robust feature of objects with high densities, the horizon is sensitive to the energy-momentum tensor in the near-horizon region.
