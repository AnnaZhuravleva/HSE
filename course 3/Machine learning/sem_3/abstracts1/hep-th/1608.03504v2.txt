The Yukawa Model is revisited in one space - one time dimensions in an approach completely different to those available in the literature. We show that at the classical level it is a constrained system. We apply the Dirac method of quantization of constrained systems. Then by means of the bosonization procedure we uniformize the Hamiltonian at the quantum level in terms of a pseudo-scalar field and the chiral components of a real scalar field.
