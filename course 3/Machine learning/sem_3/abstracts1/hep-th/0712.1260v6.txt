Continuing with the ideas of (section 4 of) [1], after inclusion of perturbative and non-perturbative alpha' corrections to the Kaehler potential and (D1- and D3-) instanton generated superpotential, we show the possibility of slow-roll axionic inflation in the large volume limit of Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications of type IIB string theory. We also include one- and two-loop corrections to the Kaehler potential but find the same to be subdominant to the (perturbative and non-perturbative) alpha' corrections. The NS-NS axions provide a flat direction for slow-roll inflation to proceed from a saddle point to the nearest dS minimum.
