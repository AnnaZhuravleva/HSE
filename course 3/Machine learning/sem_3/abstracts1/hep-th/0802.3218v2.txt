In our previous work the nonlinearity parameter f_NL, which characterizes nongaussianity in the cosmic microwave background, was estimated for a class of inflationary models based on nonlocal field theory. These models include p-adic inflation and generically have the remarkable property that slow roll inflation can proceed even with an extremely steep potential. Previous calculations found that large nongaussianity is possible; however, the technical complications associated with studying perturbations in theories with infinitely many derivatives forced us to provide only an order of magnitude estimate for f_NL. We reconsider the problem of computing f_NL in nonlocal inflation models, showing that a particular choice of field basis and recent progress in cosmological perturbation theory makes an exact computation possible. We provide the first quantitatively accurate computation of the bispectrum in nonlocal inflation, confirming our previous claim that it can be observably large. We show that the shape of the bispectrum in this class of models makes it observationally distinguishable from Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation models.
