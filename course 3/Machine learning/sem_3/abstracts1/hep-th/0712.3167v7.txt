The dynamical scenario is considered for N=1 SQCD, with N_c colors and N_c<N_F<3N_c flavors with small but nonzero current quark masses m_Q\neq 0, in which quarks form the diquark-condensate phase. This means that colorless chiral quark pairs condense coherently in the vacuum, <{\bar Q}Q>\neq 0, while quarks alone don't condense, <Q>=<\bar Q>=0, so that the color is confined. Such condensation of quarks results in formation of dynamical constituent masses \mu_C \gg m_Q of quarks and appearance of light "pions" (similarly to QCD). The mass spectrum of SQCD in this phase is described and comparison with the Seiberg dual description is performed. It is shown that the direct and dual theories are different (except, possibly, for the perturbative strictly superconformal regime).
