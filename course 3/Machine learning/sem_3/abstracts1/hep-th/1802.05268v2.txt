We find an N=1 gauge theory that flows to the rank-one N=2 superconformal field theory with $E_7$ flavor symmetry. We first obtain a Lagrangian description for the $R_{0, N}$ theory, which appears in the S-dual description of the SU(N) gauge theory with 2N fundamental hypermultiplets. This is a straightforward generalization of the proposed Lagrangian description for the $E_6$ theory. The $E_7$ theory is then obtained via partial Higgsing of the $R_{0, 4}$ theory. From this Lagrangian description, we compute the full superconformal index. We also consider twisted dimensional reduction on $S^2$ to obtain N=(0, 4) theory for the $E_7$ one instanton string and compute its elliptic genus.
