We propose a toy model of quantum gravity in two dimensions with Euclidean signature. The model is given by a kind of discretization which is different from the dynamical triangulation. We show that there exists a continuum limit and we can calculate some physical quantities such as the expectation value of the area, that is, the volume of the two dimensional euclidean space-time. We also consider the extensions of the model to higher dimensions.
