We find neutral and charged black branes solutions with axion fields in the context of a conformally coupled gravitational theory in four dimensions. These solutions describe AdS black branes supported by axion fields that break translational invariance at the boundary, providing for momentum dissipation. The conformally coupled scalar field is regular inside and outside the event horizon and there is no need of any self-interaction, obtaining in this way solutions without fine-tuned parameters. We analyze the thermodynamics of our solutions considering the effects of the axion charges and it is shown that axionic and electric charges must be related such that the conformal scalar field does not contribute to the mass. We compute the holographic DC conductivity and we show how it is affected by the inclusion of the conformal scalar field, which provides a temperature independent behavior. We include a non-linear axionic contribution given by a k-essence term that modifies the DC conductivity providing for more general behaviors. Finally, we endorse our solutions with rotation showing that angular momentum is sustained by the axion charges.
