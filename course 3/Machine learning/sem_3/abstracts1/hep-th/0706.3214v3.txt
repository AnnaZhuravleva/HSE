We propose a mechanism of reheating after inflation in multi-throat scenarios of warped extra dimensions. Validity of an effective field theory on the standard model (SM) brane requires that the position of the SM brane during inflation be different from the position after inflation. The latter is supposed to be near the tip of the SM throat but the former is not. After inflation, when the Hubble expansion rate becomes sufficiently low, the SM brane starts moving towards the tip and eventually oscillates. The SM fields are excited by the brane motion and the universe is reheated. Since interaction between the brane position modulus and the SM fields is suppressed only by the local string scale, the modulus effectively decays into the SM fields.
