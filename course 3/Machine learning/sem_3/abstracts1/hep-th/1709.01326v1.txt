The modified measure theories recommend themselves as a good possibility to go beyond the standard formulation to solve yet unsolved problems. The Galileon measure that is constructed in the way to be invariant under the Galileon shift symmetry is considered in the context of superstring theory. Supersymmetric action is presented with all terms, including tension, being derived from the equations of motion.
