We study the Landau gauge correlators of Yang-Mills fields for infrared Euclidean momenta in the context of a massive extension of the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian which, we argue, underlies a variety of continuum approaches. Standard (perturbative) renormalization group techniques with a specific, infrared-safe renormalization scheme produce so-called decoupling and scaling solutions for the ghost and gluon propagators, which correspond to nontrivial infrared fixed points. The decoupling fixed point is infrared stable and weakly coupled, while the scaling fixed point is unstable and generically strongly coupled except for low dimensions $d\to2$. Under the assumption that such a scaling fixed point exists beyond one-loop order, we find that the corresponding ghost and gluon scaling exponents are, respectively, $2\alpha_F=2-d$ and $2\alpha_G=d$ at all orders of perturbation theory in the present renormalization scheme. We discuss the relation between the ghost wave function renormalization, the gluon screening mass, the scale of spectral positivity violation, and the gluon mass parameter. We also show that this scaling solution does not realize the standard Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry of the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian. Finally, we discuss our findings in relation to the results of nonperturbative continuum methods.
