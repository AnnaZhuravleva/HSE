We calculate the critical exponents $\omega_\pm$ in the $d$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model in $1/N$ expansion with $1/N^2$ accuracy. These exponents are related to the slopes of the $\beta$-functions at the critical point in the Gross - Neveu - Yukawa model. They have been computed recently to four loops accuracy. We checked that our results are in complete agreement with the results of the perturbative calculations.
