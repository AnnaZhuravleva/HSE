The four-loop Sudakov form factor in maximal super Yang-Mills theory is analysed in detail. It is shown explicitly how to construct a basis of integrals that have a uniformly transcendental expansion in the dimensional regularisation parameter, further elucidating the number-theoretic properties of Feynman integrals. The physical form factor is expressed in this basis for arbitrary colour factor. In the nonplanar sector the required integrals are integrated numerically using a mix of sector-decomposition and Mellin-Barnes representation methods. Both the cusp as well as the collinear anomalous dimension are computed. The results show explicitly the violation of quadratic Casimir scaling at the four-loop order. A thorough analysis concerning the reliability of reported numerical uncertainties is carried out.
