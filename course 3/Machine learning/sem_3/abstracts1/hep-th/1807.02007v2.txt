We investigate the presence of vortex structures in generalized Maxwell-Higgs and Chern-Simons-Higgs models in the three-dimensional spacetime. Despite the important difference between the Maxwell and Chern-Simons dynamics, we have been able to introduce first order differential equations that solve the equations of motion for static and rotationally symmetric field configurations. In both cases, solutions of the first order equations engender minimum energy, and we have found vortex configurations whose internal structure unveils interesting and unusual ringlike profile.
