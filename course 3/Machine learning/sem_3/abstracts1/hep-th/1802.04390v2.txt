We compute the four-point function of scalar operators in CFTs with weakly broken higher spin symmetry at arbitrary 't Hooft coupling. We use the known three-point functions in these theories, the Lorentzian OPE inversion formula and crossing to fix the result up to the addition of three functions of the cross ratios. These are given by contact Witten diagrams in AdS and manifest non-analyticity of the OPE data in spin. We use Schwinger-Dyson equations to show that such terms are absent in the large $N$ Chern-Simons matter theories. The result is that the OPE data is analytic in spin up to $J=0$.
