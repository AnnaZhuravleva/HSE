By employing CFT techniques, we show how to compute in the context of \lambda-deformations of current algebras and coset CFTs the exact in the deformation parameters C-function for a wide class of integrable theories that interpolate between a UV and an IR point. We explicitly consider RG flows for integrable deformations of left-right asymmetric current algebras and coset CFTs. In all cases, the derived exact C-functions obey all the properties asserted by Zamolodchikov's c-theorem in two-dimensions.
