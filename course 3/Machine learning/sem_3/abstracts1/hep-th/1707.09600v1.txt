We bring the concept that quantum symmetries describe theories with nontrivial momentum space properties one step further, looking at quantum symmetries of spacetime in presence of a nonvanishing cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In particular, the momentum space associated to the $\kappa$-deformation of the de Sitter algebra in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions is explicitly constructed as a dual Poisson-Lie group manifold parametrized by $\Lambda$. Such momentum space includes both the momenta associated to spacetime translations and the `hyperbolic' momenta associated to boost transformations, and has the geometry of (half of) a de Sitter manifold. Known results for the momentum space of the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra are smoothly recovered in the limit $\Lambda\to 0$, where hyperbolic momenta decouple from translational momenta. The approach here presented is general and can be applied to other quantum deformations of kinematical symmetries, including (3+1)-dimensional ones.
