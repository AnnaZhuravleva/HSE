We investigate the nonperturbative degrees of freedom of a class of weakly nonlocal gravitational theories that have been proposed as an ultraviolet completion of general relativity. At the perturbative level, it is known that the degrees of freedom of nonlocal gravity are the same of the Einstein--Hilbert theory around any maximally symmetric spacetime. We prove that, at the nonperturbative level, the degrees of freedom are actually eight in four dimensions, contrary to what one might guess on the basis of the "infinite number of derivatives" present in the action. Six of these degrees of freedom may play a role at large scales and on curved backgrounds. We also propose a criterion to select the form factor almost uniquely.
