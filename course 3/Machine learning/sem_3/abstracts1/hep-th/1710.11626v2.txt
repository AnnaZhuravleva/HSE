We study various aspects of warped conformal field theories (WCFTs) in two dimensions. We find new Lagrangian WCFTs, and show that all known Lagrangian WCFTs are local only after an infinite tuning. We deduce the anomalies of WCFTs and relate them to central charges, as well as analyze WCFT hydrostatics, thereby re-deriving the warped analogue of the Cardy formula. Finally, we point out that holographic WCFTs are semi-local, that matter fields in spacelike WAdS$_3$ black hole geometries exhibit a Gregory-Laflamme-like instability, and that WAdS$_3$ throats do not admit a decoupling limit.
