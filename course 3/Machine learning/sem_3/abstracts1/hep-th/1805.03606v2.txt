We derive a holographic description of the simplest quantum mechanical system, a 1d free particle. The dual formulation uses a couple of two-dimensional topological abelian BF theories with appropriate boundary conditions, interactions and constraints. The aim of this construction is not to use holography as a tool for quantum mechanics but rather to find the simplest possible setup in order to explore holography.
