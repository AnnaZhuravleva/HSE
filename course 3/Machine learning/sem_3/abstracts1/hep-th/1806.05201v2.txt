We find the equations of motion of membranes dual to the black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity to leading order in 1/D in the large D regime. We also find the metric solutions to the EGB equations to first subleading order in 1/D in terms of membrane variables. We propose a world volume stress tensor for the membrane whose conservation equations are equivalent to the leading order membrane equations. We also work out the light quasi-normal mode spectrum of static black holes in EGB gravity from the linearised fluctuations of static, round membranes. All our results are worked out to linear order in the Gauss-Bonnet parameter.
