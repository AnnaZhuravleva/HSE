In this paper, a careful treatment of extraction of the Hilbert space and constraints from the formal functional integral with the Einstein-Hilbert action is given. The diffeomorphism inavariant measure is worked out using the metric of metrics. The procedure of quantizing the classical constraints is bypassed. Instead the relevant operator constraints are directly obtained from the functional integral, removing the ambiguities and uncertainties involved in guessing them from the classical theory. The novelties of the resulting formalism are briefly discussed.
