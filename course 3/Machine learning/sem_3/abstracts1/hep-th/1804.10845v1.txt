We show that $U(N)$ $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $S^{3}$ with $N_{f}$ massive fundamental hypermultiplets and with a Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term are solvable in terms of generalized Selberg integrals. Finite $N$ expressions for the partition function and Wilson loop in arbitrary representations are given. We obtain explicit analytical expressions for Wilson loops with symmetric, antisymmetric, rectangular and hook representations, in terms of Gamma functions of complex argument. The free energy for orthogonal and symplectic gauge group is also given. The study of asymptotic expansions of the free energy then leads to the emergence of exponentially small contributions for $N_{f}<2N-2$, which corresponds to bad theories. Duality checks are also explicitly performed and we show how the exponential asymptotics is understood from the point of view of the duality between good and bad theories.
