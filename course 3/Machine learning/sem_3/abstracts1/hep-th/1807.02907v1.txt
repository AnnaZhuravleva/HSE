We study the impact of Lorentz violating terms on a physical observable for both electrodynamics of chiral matter and an Abelian Higgs-like model in $3+1$ dimensions. Our calculation is done within the framework of the gauge-invariant, but path-dependent, variables formalism. Interestingly enough, for electrodynamics of chiral matter we obtain that the interaction energy is the sum of a Coulombic and a linear potential (Cornell-like potential profile), leading to the confinement of static charges. Whereas for a Abelian Higgs model with a Lorentz-breaking term, the static potential remains in a screening phase.
