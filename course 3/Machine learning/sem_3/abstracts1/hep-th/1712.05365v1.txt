We construct the dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N=2$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. Beginning from an on-shell vector multiplet coupled to the standard Weyl multiplet, the equations of motion can be used to eliminate the supergravity auxiliary fields, following a similar pattern as in five and six dimensions. The resulting 24+24 component multiplet includes two gauge vectors and a gauge two-form and provides a variant formulation of $N=2$ conformal supergravity. We also show how this dilaton Weyl multiplet is contained in the minimal 32+32 Poincare supergravity multiplet introduced by Muller in superspace.
