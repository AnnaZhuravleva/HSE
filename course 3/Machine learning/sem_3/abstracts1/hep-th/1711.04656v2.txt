We derive all possible symmetry breaking patterns for all possible Higgs fields that can occur in intersecting brane models: bi-fundamentals and rank-2 tensors. This is a field-theoretic problem that was already partially solved in 1973 by Ling-Fong Li. In that paper the solution was given for rank-2 tensors of orthogonal and unitary group, and U(N x U(M) and O(N) x O(M) bi-fundamentals. We extend this first of al to symplectic groups. When formulated correctly, this turns out to be straightforward generalization of the previous results from real and complex numbers to quaternions. The extension to mixed bi-fundamentals is more challenging and interesting. The scalar potential has up to six real parameters. Its minima or saddle points are described by block-diagonal matrices built out of K blocks of size p x q. Here p=q=1 for the solutions of Ling-Fong Li, and the number of possibilities for p x q is equal to the number of real parameters in the potential, minus 1. The maximum block size is p x q=2 x 4. Different blocks cannot be combined, and the true minimum occurs for one choice of basic block, and for either K=1 or K maximal, depending on the parameter values.
