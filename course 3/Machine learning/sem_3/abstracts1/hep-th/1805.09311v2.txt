We derive a perturbative expansion of target space entanglement entropy for string theory by comparison between the standard orbifold picture and a world sheet replica trick construction. Requiring the two approaches to match implies a set of constrains on the amplitudes involved and produces a non-trivial relation among target space and world sheet entanglement. We will be mainly interested in bosonic string on a flat background but also discuss the superstring generalization.
