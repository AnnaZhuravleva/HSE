Basis tensor gauge theory (BTGT) is a reformulation of ordinary gauge theory that is an analog of the vierbein formulation of gravity and is related to the Wilson line formulation. To match ordinary gauge theories coupled to matter, the BTGT formalism requires a continuous symmetry that we call the BTGT symmetry in addition to the ordinary gauge symmetry. After classically interpreting the BTGT symmetry, we construct using the BTGT formalism the Ward identities associated with the BTGT symmetry and the ordinary gauge symmetry. As a way of testing the quantum stability and the consistency of the Ward identities with a known regularization method, we explicitly renormalize the scalar QED at one-loop using dimensional regularization using the BTGT formalism.
