We continue the study of Lagrangian descriptions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories. We use our recent interpretation in terms of sequential confinement to guess the Lagrangians of all the Argyres-Douglas models with Abelian three dimensional mirror. We find classes of four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ quivers that flow in the infrared to generalized Argyres-Douglas theories, such as the $(A_k,A_{kN+N-1})$ models. We study in detail how the $\mathcal{N}=1$ chiral rings map to the Coulomb and Higgs Branches of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ CFT's. The three dimensional mirror RG flows are shown to land on the $\mathcal{N}=4$ complete graph quivers. We also compactify to three dimensions the gauge theory dual to $(A_1,D_4)$, and find the expected Abelianization duality with $\mathcal{N}=4$ SQED with $3$ flavors.
