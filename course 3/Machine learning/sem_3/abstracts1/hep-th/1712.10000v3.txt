We elaborate the two-fold simplex-like structures of tree amplitudes in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (N=4 SYM), through its connection to a mathematical structure known as the positive Grassmannian. Exploiting the reduced Grassmannian geometry and the matrix form of on-shell recursion relation in terms of super momentum twistors, we manifest that tree amplitudes can be remarkably refined via the essential building blocks named as fully-spanning cells. For a fixed number of negative helicities, an amplitude can be entirely captured by finite, compact information of the relevant fully-spanning cells up to an arbitrarily large number of external particles.
