The so-called configurational entropy (CE) framework has proved to be an efficient instrument to study nonlinear scalar field models featuring solutions with spatially-localized energy, since its proposal by Gleiser and Stamapoulos. Therefore, in this work, we apply this new physical quantity in order to investigate the properties of degenerate Bloch branes. We show that it is possible to construct a configurational entropy measure in functional space from the field configurations, where a complete set of exact solutions for the model studied displays both double and single-kink configurations. Our study shows a rich internal structure of the configurations, where we observe that the field configurations undergo a quick phase transition, which is endorsed by information entropy. Furthermore, the Bloch configurational entropy is employed to demonstrate a high organisational degree in the structure of the configurations of the system, stating that there is a best ordering for the solutions.
