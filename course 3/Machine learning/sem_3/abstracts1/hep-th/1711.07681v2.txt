We consider matrix theoretical description of transverse M5-branes in M-theory on the 11-dimensional maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background. We apply the localization to the plane wave matrix model (PWMM) and show that the transverse spherical fivebranes with zero light cone energy in M-theory are realized as the distribution of low energy moduli of the $SO(6)$ scalar fields in PWMM.
