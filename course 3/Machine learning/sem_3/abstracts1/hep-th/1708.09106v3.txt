We complete the four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ superfield description of six-dimensional supergravity. The missing ingredients in the previous works are the superfields that contain the sechsbein $e_4^{\;\;\underline{\nu}}$, $e_5^{\;\;\underline{\nu}}$, $e_\mu^{\;\;\underline{4}}$, $e_\mu^{\;\;\underline{5}}$ and the second gravitino. They are necessary to make the action invariant under the diffeomorphisms and the Lorentz transformations involving the extra dimensions. We find the corresponding superfield transformation laws, and show the invariance of the action under them. We also check that the resultant action reproduces the known superfield description of five-dimensional supergravity through the dimensional reduction.
