We construct the Einstein-axions AdS black hole from Born-Infeld electrodynamics. Various DC transport coefficients of the dual boundary theory are computed. The DC electric conductivity depends on the temperature, which is a novel property comparing to that in RN-AdS black hole. The DC electric conductivity are positive at zero temperature while the thermal conductivity vanishes, which implies that the dual system is an electrical metal but thermal insulator. The effects of Born-Infeld parameter on the transport coefficients are analyzed. Finally, we study the AC electric conductivity from Born-Infeld electrodynamics with momentum dissipation. For weak momentum dissipation, the low frequency behavior satisfies the standard Drude formula and the electric transport is coherent for various correction parameter. While for stronger momentum dissipation, the modified Drude formula is applied and we observe a crossover from coherent to incoherent phase. Moreover, the Born-Infeld correction amplifies the incoherent behavior. Finally, we study the non-linear conductivity in probe limit and compare our results with those observed in (i)DBI model.
