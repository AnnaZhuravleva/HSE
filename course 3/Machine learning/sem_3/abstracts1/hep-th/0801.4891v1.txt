Considerable and ongoing effort is made to identify promising scalar field candidates in string theory to drive a cosmological period of inflation. At stake is the possibility that fundamental string parameters could be encoded in observables such as the CMB perturbation spectrum. In this contribution, we hold a concrete model of string inflation (KKLMMT) up against WMAP3 and discuss the constraints obtained.
