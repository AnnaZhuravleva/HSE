We compute the nuclear spin-orbit coupling from the Skyrme model. Previous attempts to do this were based on the product ansatz, and as such were limited to a system of two well-separated nuclei. Our calculation utilises a new method, and is applicable to the phenomenologically important situation of a single nucleon orbiting a large nucleus. We find that, to second order in perturbation theory, the coefficient of the spin-orbit coupling induced by pion field interactions has the wrong sign, but as the strength of the pion-nucleon interactions increases the correct sign is recovered non-perturbatively.
