We present a unified and completely general formulation of extended geometry, characterised by a Kac-Moody algebra and a highest weight coordinate module. Generalised diffeomorphisms are constructed, as well as solutions to the section constraint. Generically, additional ("ancillary") gauge transformations are present, and we give a concrete criterion determining when they appear. A universal form of the (pseudo-)action determines the dynamics in all cases without ancillary transformations, and also for a restricted set of cases based on the adjoint representation of a finite-dimensional simple Lie group. Our construction reproduces (the internal sector of) all previously considered cases of double and exceptional field theories.
