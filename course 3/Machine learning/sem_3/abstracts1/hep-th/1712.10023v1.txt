It was recently proposed that N=1 supersymmetric gauged matrix models have a duality of order four - that is, a quadrality - reminiscent of infrared dualities of SQCD theories in higher dimensions. In this note, we show that the zero-dimensional quadrality proposal can be infered from the two-dimensional Gadde-Gukov-Putrov triality. We consider two-dimensional N=(0,2) SQCD compactified on a sphere with the half-topological twist. For a convenient choice of R-charge, the zero-mode sector on the sphere gives rise to a simple N=1 gauged matrix model. Triality on the sphere then implies a triality relation for the supersymmetric matrix model, which can be completed to the full quadrality.
