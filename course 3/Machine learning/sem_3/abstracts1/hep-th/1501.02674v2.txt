We propose a new description of the (4+N)-dimensional Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model in a (4+1)-dimensional warped geometry to solve the gauge hierarchy problem. It has the same KK spectrum as in the ADD model and recovers its phenomenons that do not involve the interaction among the graviton KK modes. There is no hierarchy between the fundamental length and the size of the extra dimension. An explicit realization is constructed in the nonlocal gravity theory to give a warped description of the six-dimensional ADD model. Remarkably, the equivalent number N of the extra dimensions in this description may be non-integral, which provides a new mechanism to escape the experimental constrains.
