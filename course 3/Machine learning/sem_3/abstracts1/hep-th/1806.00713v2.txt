Following on from arXiv:1805.03657, we consider open strings in the non-Abelian T-dual of the $SU(2)_k$ WZW model, with respect to the vector $SU(2)$ isometry. Since in this case the dual theory has an exact CFT description, we look at the chiral algebra-preserving D-branes. The general conclusion is that a large set of branes, while consistent boundary conditions on the worldsheet, are sent to infinity in the target space. This suggests inconsistency of the strict non-Abelian duality with open strings, in this case.
