We suggest that vacuum entanglement energy associated with the entanglement entropy of the universe is the origin of dark energy.   The observed properties of dark energy can be explained by using the nature of entanglement energy without modification of gravity or exotic matter. From the number of degrees of freedom in the standard model, we obtain the equation of state parameter $\omega^0_\Lambda\simeq -0.93$ and $d\simeq 0.95$ for the holographic dark energy, which are consistent with current observational data at the 95% confidence level.
