We note that, in extended phase space the cosmological constant is a thermodynamic variable. In this paper, this cosmological constant lead us to consider a black hole as a heat engine. So, here we take advantage from holographic heat engine and study two kind of different black holes. We first investigate a static black hole (Dyonic BH) and consider the necessary condition to have high efficiency. Also we continue our investigation for dynamic black hole (rotating charged black hole) and study the effect of rotating parameter on the thermodynamic efficiency of holographic heat engine. We show that the rotating parameter has a more effective role than electric charge in thermodynamic efficiency.
