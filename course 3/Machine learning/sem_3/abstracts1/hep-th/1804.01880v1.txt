We obtain analytic results for the four point amplitude of an interacting scalar field theory in four dimensional, Euclidean Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space at one loop. For the two point function we provide analytic expressions up to two loops. In addition we argue that the AdS/CFT correspondence provides the necessary data for the renormalization conditions in AdS thus substituting the on-shell condition in flat space.
