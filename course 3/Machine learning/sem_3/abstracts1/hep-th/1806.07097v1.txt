The geometry very near the horizon of a near-extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole is described by the direct product of a near-$AdS_2$ spacetime with a two-sphere. While near-$AdS_2$ is locally diffeomorphic to $AdS_2$ the two connect differently with the asymptotically flat part of the geometry of (near-)extreme Reissner-Nordstrom. In previous work, we solved analytically the coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbation equations of $AdS_2\times S^2$ and the associated connection problem with extreme Reissner-Nordstrom. In this paper, we give the solution for perturbations of near-$AdS_2\times S^2$ and make the connection with near-extreme Reissner-Nordstrom. Our results here may also be thought of as computing the classical scattering matrix for gravitational and electromagnetic waves which probe the region very near the horizon of a highly charged spherically symmetric black hole.
