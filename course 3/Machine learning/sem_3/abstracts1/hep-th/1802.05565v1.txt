In this paper, we will show that gravity can emerge from an effective field theory, obtained by tracing out the fermionic system from an interacting quantum field theory, when we impose the condition that the field equations must be Cauchy predictable. The source of the gravitational field can be identified with the quantum interactions that existed in the interacting QFT. This relation is very similar to the ER= EPR conjecture and strongly relies on the fact that emergence of a classical theory will be dependent on the underlying quantum processes and interactions. We consider two concrete example for reaching the result - one where initially there was no gravity and other where gravity was present. The latter case will result in first order corrections to Einstein's equations and immediately reproduces well-known results like effective event horizons and gravitational birefringence.
