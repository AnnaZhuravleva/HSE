The extension of nonlinear higher-spin equations in d=4 proposed in [arXiv:1504.07289] for the construction of invariant functional is shown to respect local Lorentz symmetry. The equations are rewritten in a manifestly Lorentz covariant form resulting from some Stueckelberg-like field transformation. We also show that the two field-independent central terms entering higher-spin equations which are not entirely fixed by the consistency alone get fixed unambiguously by the requirement of Lorentz symmetry. One of the important advantages of the proposed approach demonstrated in the paper is the remarkable simplification of the perturbative analysis.
