We consider deep inelastic scattering (DIS) on a nucleus described as an extremal RN-AdS black hole using the holographic principle. Using the R-current correlators we determine the structure functions as a function Bjorken-x for nuclei with different atomic number, in leading order in the holographic limit. The R-ratio of the structure functions exhibit strong shadowing at low-x.
