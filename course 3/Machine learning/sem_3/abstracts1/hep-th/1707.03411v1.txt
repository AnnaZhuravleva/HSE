We present an action for chiral $N=(1,0)$ supergravity in $2+2$ dimensions. The fields of the theory are organized into an $OSp(1|4)$ connection supermatrix, and are given by the usual vierbein $V^a$, spin connection $\omega^{ab}$, and Majorana gravitino $\psi$. In analogy with a construction used for $D=10+2$ gauge supergravity, the action is given by $\int STr ({\bf R}^2 {\bf \Gamma})$, where ${\bf R}$ is the $OSp(1|4)$ curvature supermatrix two-form, and ${\bf \Gamma}$ a constant supermatrix containing $\gamma_5$. It is similar, but not identical to the MacDowell-Mansouri action for $D=2+2$ supergravity. The constant supermatrix breaks $OSp(1|4)$ gauge invariance to a subalgebra $OSp(1|2) \oplus Sp(2)$, including a Majorana-Weyl supercharge. Thus half of the $OSp(1|4)$ gauge supersymmetry survives. The gauge fields are the selfdual part of $\omega^{ab}$ and the Weyl projection of $\psi$ for $OSp(1|2)$, and the antiselfdual part of $\omega^{ab}$ for $Sp(2)$. Supersymmetry transformations, being part of a gauge superalgebra, close off-shell. The selfduality condition on the spin connection can be consistently imposed, and the resulting "projected" action is $OSp(1|2)$ gauge invariant.
