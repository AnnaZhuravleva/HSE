In the present work we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy density in the Gauss-Bonnet framework. By formulating independently the two cosmological scenarios, and by enforcing their simultaneous validity, we show that there is a correspondence between the holographic dark energy scenario in flat universe and the phantom dark energy model in the framework of Gauss-Bonnet theory with a potential. This correspondence leads consistently to an accelerating universe. However, in general one has not full freedom of constructing independently the two cosmological scenarios. Specific constraints must be imposed on the coupling with gravity and on the potential.
