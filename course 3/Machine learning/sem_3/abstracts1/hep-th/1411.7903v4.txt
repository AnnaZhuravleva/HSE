We consider 5d Sp(1) gauge theory with $E_{N_f+1}$ global symmetries based on toric(-like) diagram constructed from (p,q)-web with 7-branes. We propose a systematic procedure to compute the Seiberg-Witten curve for generic toric-like diagram. For $N_f=6,7$ flavors, we explicitly compute the Seiberg-Witten curves for 5d Sp(1) gauge theory, and show that these Seiberg-Witten curves agree with already known $E_{7,8}$ results. We also discuss a generalization of the Seiberg-Witten curve to rank-N cases.
