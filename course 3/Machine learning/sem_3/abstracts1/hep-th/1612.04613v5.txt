We studied the finite-size giant magnons in $\text{AdS}_4\times\text{CP}^3_{\beta}$ background using the classical spectral curve constructed in this paper. We computed the finite-size corrections to the dispersion relations for the $RP^3$ giant magnons using our twisted algebraic curve based on the method proposed in arXiv:0810.1246, in which the authors computed the finite-size corrections of giant magnons in $\text{AdS}_4\times\text{CP}^3$ by introducing a finite-size resolvent $G_{\text{finite}}(x)$. We obtained exactly the same result as in arXiv:1106.3686, where a totally different approach was used.
