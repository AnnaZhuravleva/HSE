We study whether the approach of Deffayet et al. (DPSV) can be adopted for obtaining a derivative part of quadratic action for scalar perturbations in beyond Horndeski theories about homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds. We find that even though the method does remove the second and higher derivatives of metric perturbations from the linearized Galileon equation, in the same manner as in the general Horndeski theory, it gives incorrect result for the quadratic action. We analyse the reasons behind this property and suggest the way of modifying the approach, so that it gives valid results.
