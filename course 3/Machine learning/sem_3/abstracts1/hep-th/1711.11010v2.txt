We calculate the one-loop contributions to the polarization operator for scalar quantum electrodynamics in different external electromagnetic and gravitational fields. In the case of gravity, de-Sitter space and its different patches were considered. It is shown that the Debye mass appears only in the case of alpha-vacuum in the Expanding Poincare Patch. It can be shown either by direct computations or by using analytical and casual properties of the de-Sitter space. Also, the case of constant electric field is considered and the Debye mass is calculated.
