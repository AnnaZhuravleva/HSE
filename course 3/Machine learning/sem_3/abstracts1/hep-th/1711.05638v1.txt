In this article we investigate an interpolating gauge fixing procedure in $(4l+3)$-dimensional abelian Chern-Simons theory. We show that this interpolating gauge is related to the covariant gauge in a constant anisotropic metric. We compute the corresponding propagators involved in various expressions of the linking number in various gauges. We comment on the geometric interpretations of these expressions, clarifying how to pass from one interpretation to another.
