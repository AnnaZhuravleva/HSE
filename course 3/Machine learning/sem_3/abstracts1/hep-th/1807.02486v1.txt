The BRST transformations and equations of motion of a gravity/two-form/dilaton system are derived from the product of two Yang-Mills theories in a BRST covariant form, to linear approximation. The inclusion of ghost fields facilitates the separation of the graviton and dilaton. The gravitational gauge fixing term is uniquely determined by those of the Yang-Mills factors which can be freely chosen. Moreover, the resulting gravity/two-form/dilaton Lagrangian is anti-BRST invariant and the BRST/anti-BRST charges anti-commute as a direct consequence of the formalism.
