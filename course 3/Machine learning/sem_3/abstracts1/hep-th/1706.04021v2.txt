The entropic force and the imaginary part of potential experienced by a moving quarkonia in a plasma, are computed in a charged deformed AdS background by holography approaches. In that case, the axis of the moving quarkonia has an arbitrary angle with wind. We show that the charge in deformed AdS background deeply effect on the increasing entropic force and decreasing thermal width. So, the dissociation length of the meson becomes short when charge is increasing. In addition, the entropic force and thermal width are increased by the deformation of the space. Therefore the deformation parameter in such background leads us to find process with arbitrary dissociation length of quark- anti quark.
