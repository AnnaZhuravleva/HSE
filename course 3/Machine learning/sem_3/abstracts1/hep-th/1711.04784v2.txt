The study of non-supersymmetric black hole microstates offers the potential to resolve the black hole information paradox. A system of equations was recently obtained that enables the systematic construction of non-supersymmetric smooth horizonless supergravity solutions, that are candidates to describe microstates of non-extremal black holes. Within this system we construct a family of six-dimensional supergravity solutions that feature two topologically-nontrivial three-cycles known as bolts. The two bolts touch at a single point and are supported by fluxes. We find that the fluxes on the two three-cycles can be either aligned or anti-aligned, and exhibit examples of both. We present several examples of smooth solutions, including near-extremal solutions that have an approximate AdS$_3$ region, and far-from extremal solutions that have arbitrarily small charge compared to their mass.
