We construct the exceptional sigma model: a two-dimensional sigma model coupled to a supergravity background in a manifestly (formally) $E_{D(D)}$-covariant manner. This formulation of the background is provided by Exceptional Field Theory (EFT), which unites the metric and form fields of supergravity in $E_{D(D)}$ multiplets before compactification. The realisation of the local symmetries of EFT on the worldsheet uniquely fixes the Weyl-invariant Lagrangian and allows us to relate our action to the usual type IIA fundamental string action and a form of the type IIB $(m,n)$ action. This uniqueness "predicts" the correct form of the couplings to gauge fields in both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors, without invoking supersymmetry.
