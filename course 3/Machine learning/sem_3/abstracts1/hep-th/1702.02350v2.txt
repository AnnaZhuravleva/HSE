We present a complete analysis for double soft limit of graviton scattering amplitude using the formalism proposed by Cachazo, He and Yuan. Our results agree with that obtained via BCFW recursion relations in arXiv:1504.05558. In addition we find precise relations between degenerate and nondegenerate solutions of scattering equations with local and nonlocal terms in the soft factor.
