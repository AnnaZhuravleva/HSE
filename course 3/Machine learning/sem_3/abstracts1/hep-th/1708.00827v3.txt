In this paper, we first propose the bosonic (fermionic) modified Wigner equations for continuous spin particle (CSP). Secondly, starting from the (Fang-)Fronsdal-like equation, we will reach to the modified action of bosonic (fermionic) continuous spin gauge field in flat spacetime, presented recently by Metsaev in A(dS) spacetime. We shall also explain how to obtain the proposed modified Wigner equations from the gauge-fixed equations of motion. Finally, we will consider the massive bosonic (fermionic) higher-spin action and, by taking the infinite spin limit, we will arrive at the modified bosonic (fermionic) CSP action.
