We consider the four-point correlator of the stress-energy tensor multiplet in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. In the planar limit and at large 't Hooft coupling such correlator is given by the corresponding holographic correlation function in IIB supergravity on $AdS_5 \times S^5$. We consider subleading corrections in the number of colours, i.e. order $1/N^4$, at large 't Hooft coupling. This corresponds to loop corrections to the supergravity result. Consistency conditions, most notably crossing symmetry, constrain the form of such corrections and lead to a complete determination of the spectrum of leading twist intermediate operators.
