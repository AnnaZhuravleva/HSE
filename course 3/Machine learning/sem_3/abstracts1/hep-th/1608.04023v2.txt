We consider the supergravity back-reaction of M2 branes wrapping around the space-time cycles in 1/8-BPS microstate geometries. We show that such brane wrappings will generically break all the supersymmetries. In particular, all the supersymmetries will be broken if there are such wrapped branes but the net charge of the wrapped branes is zero. We show that if M2 branes wrap a single cycle, or if they wrap a several of co-linear cycles with the same orientation, then the solution will be 1/16-BPS, having two supersymmetries. We comment on how these results relate to using W-branes to understand the microstate structure of 1/8-BPS black holes.
