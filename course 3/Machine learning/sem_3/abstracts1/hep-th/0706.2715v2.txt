We find an exact coordinate transformation rule from the $AdS_5$ Schwarzschild black hole in the Poincare and the global patch to the Fefferman-Graham coordinate system. Using these results, we evaluate the corresponding holographic stress tensor and trace anomaly of the boundary theory as a function of the radial coordinate. Following the AdS/CFT correspondence, we reinterpret the radial coordinate dependence of the trace anomaly as the Wilsonian renormalization group(RG) flow of the boundary theory.
