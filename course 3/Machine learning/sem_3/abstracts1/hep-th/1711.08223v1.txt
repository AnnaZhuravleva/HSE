In this paper we elaborate on the gauge invariant frame-like Lagrangian description for the wide class of the so-called infinite (or continuous) spin representations of Poincar\'e group. We use our previous results on the gauge invariant formalism for the massive mixed symmetry fields corresponding to the Young tableau with two rows Y(k,l) (Y(k+1/2,l+1/2) for the fermionic case). We have shown that the corresponding infinite spin solutions can be constructed as a limit where k goes to infinity, while l remain to be fixed and label different representations. Moreover, our gauge invariant formalism provides a natural generalization to (Anti) de Sitter spaces as well. As in the completely symmetric case considered earlier by Metsaev we have found that there are no unitary solutions in de Sitter space, while there exists a rather wide spectrum of Anti de Sitter ones. In this, the question what representations of the Anti de Sitter group such solutions correspond to remains to be open.
