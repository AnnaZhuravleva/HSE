In the framework of light-cone formulation of relativistic dynamics, arbitrary spin massless fields propagating in the four-dimensional AdS space are studied. For such fields, the complete list of light-cone gauge cubic interaction vertices is obtained. Realization of relativistic symmetries on space of light-cone gauge massless AdS fields is also obtained. The light-cone gauge vertices for massless AdS fields take simple form similar to the one for massless fields in the flat space.
