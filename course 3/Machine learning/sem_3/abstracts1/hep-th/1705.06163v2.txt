We construct the Lagrangian formulation of massive higher spin on-shell (1,0) supermultiplets in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space. The construction is based on description of the massive three dimensional fields in terms of frame-like gauge invariant formalism and technique of gauge invariant curvatures. For the two possible massive supermultiplets (s,s+1/2) and (s,s-1/2) we derive explicit form of the supertransformations leaving the sum of bosonic and fermionic Lagrangians invariant.
