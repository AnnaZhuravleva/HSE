In this paper, we give a map from matrices to a commutative geometry from a bound state of a D2-brane and N D0-branes. For this, tachyons in auxiliary unstable D-brane system describing the bound state play crucial roles. We found the map obtained in this way coincides with the recent proposals. We also consider the map from the geometry to matrices in a large N limit and argue that the map is a matrix regularization of geometry.
