We propose a covariant holographic conjecture for the entanglement negativity of mixed states in bipartite systems described by $d$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to bulk non static $AdS_{d+1}$ configurations. Application of our conjecture to $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theories dual to bulk rotating BTZ black holes exactly reproduces the corresponding entanglement negativity in the large central charge limit and characterizes the distillable entanglement. We further demonstrate that our conjecture applied to the case of bulk extremal rotating BTZ black holes also characterizes the entanglement negativity for the chiral half of the corresponding zero temperature $(1+1)$-dimensional holographic conformal field theories.
