We show that for generic stationary spacetime and a series of Killing fields, Wald's approach for quasi-local energy could always be generalized to the first order formalism straightforwardly without introducing the Lorentz-Lie derivative. Via this approach, we derive the general formula for the black hole entropy in the three dimensional torsional Mielke-Baekler gravity, reproducing correctly the total energy, the angular momentum as well as the black hole entropy for the BTZ-like solutions.
