We analyze fuzzy configurations of D0-branes in BFSS matrix model as microstates of black hole. Fuzzy configurations of D0-branes consist of localized fuzzy objects in 3 spatial directions which are smeared into 6 internal directions. Since the solutions are time dependent, these are non-BPS configurations and have internal energy compared with static case. Especially we examine the smeared fuzzy sphere in the BFSS matrix model, which will correspond to the microstate of the charged black hole in 4 dimensions, and compare the effective potential in that background with the result obtained by the near horizon geometry of the black 0-brane. The qualitative features of two descriptions agree with each other, thus we expect the smeared fuzzy sphere corresponds to one of the microstates of the charged black hole. We also examine the smeared fuzzy cylinder which will correspond to the flat space time.
