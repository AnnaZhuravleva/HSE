We introduce a new Lie bialgebra structure for the anti de Sitter (AdS) Lie algebra in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. By gauging the resulting AdS Lie bialgebra, we write a Chern-Simons gauge theory of bi-gravity involving two dreibeins rather than two metrics, which describes two interacting massless spin-2 fields. Our ghost-free bi-gravity model which has no any local degrees of freedom, has also a suitable free field limit. By solving its equations of motion, we obtain a new black hole solution which has two curvature singularities and two horizons.
