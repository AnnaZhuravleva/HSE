We consider a five dimensional AdS warped spacetime in presence of a massive scalar field in the bulk. The scalar field potential fulfills the requirement of modulus stabilization even when the effect of backreaction of the stabilizing field is taken into account. In such a scenario, we investigate the possible role of modulus field on a compact stellar structure from the perspective of four dimensional effective theory. Our result reveals that in the presence of the modulus field, the upper bound of mass-radius ratio (generally known as Buchdahl's limit) of a star can go beyond the general relativity prediction. Interestingly this provides a natural testbed for the existence of such higher dimensional modulus field.
