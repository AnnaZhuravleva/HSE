The Hubeny-Rangamani causal holographic information (CHI) defined by a region $R$ of a holographic quantum field theory (QFT) is a modern version of the idea that the area of event horizons might be related to an entropy. Here the event horizon lives in a dual gravitational bulk theory with Newton's constant $G_{\rm bulk}$, and the relation involves a factor of $4G_{\rm bulk}$. The fact that CHI is bounded below by the von Neumann entropy $S$ suggests that CHI is coarse-grained. Its properties could thus differ markedly from those of $S$. In particular, recent results imply that when $d\le 4$ holographic QFTs are perturbatively coupled to $d$-dimensional gravity, the combined system satisfies the so-called quantum focusing condition (QFC) at leading order in the new gravitational coupling $G_d$ when the QFT entropy is taken to be that of von Neumann. However, by studying states dual to spherical bulk (anti--de Sitter) Schwarschild black holes in the conformal frame for which the boundary is a $(2+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space, we find the QFC defined by CHI is violated even when perturbing about a Killing horizon and using a single null congruence. Since it is known that a generalized second law (GSL) holds in this context, our work demonstrates that the QFC is not required in order for an entropy, or an entropy-like quantity, to satisfy such a GSL.
