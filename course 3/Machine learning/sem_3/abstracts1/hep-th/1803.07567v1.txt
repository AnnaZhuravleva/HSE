By studying 2d string compactifications with half-maximal supersymmetry in a variety of duality frames, we find a natural physical setting for understanding Umbral moonshine. Near points in moduli space with enhanced gauge symmetry, we find that the Umbral symmetry groups arise as symmetries of the theory. In one duality frame -- a flux compactification on $T^4/Z_2\times T^4$ -- the 24-dimensional permutation representations of the Umbral groups act on D1-branes strung between a set of NS5-branes. The presence of these NS5-branes is used to explain the Umbral moonshine decompositions of the K3 twining genera, and in particular of the K3 elliptic genus. The fundamental string in this frame is dual to the type IIA string on K3$\times T^4$ and to a compactified heterotic little string theory. The latter provides an interesting example of a little string theory, as the string-scale geometry transverse to the 5-brane plays an important role in its construction.
