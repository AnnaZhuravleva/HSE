The effective action for reggeized gluons is based on the gluodynamic Yang-Mills Lagrangian with external current for longitudinal gluons added, see [1]. On the base of classical solutions, obtained in [2], the one-loop corrections to this effective action in light-cone gauge are calculated. The RFT calculus for reggeized gluons similarly to the RFT introduced in [3] is proposed and discussed. The correctness of the results is verified by calculation of the propagator of $A_{+}$ and $A_{-}$ reggeized gluons fields and application of the obtained results is discussed as well.
