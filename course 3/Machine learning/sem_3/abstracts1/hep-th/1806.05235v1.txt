The asymptotic symmetry group of asymptotically flat four-dimensional black holes is the BMS group. The original version of the group acts on null infinity but there are variants that act on event horizons. The definition of the group depends on a choice of boundary conditions for the metric. For a certain choice of boundary conditions, it contains the group of smooth area-preserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-sphere, ${\rm SDiff}(S^2)$. This suggests that black hole entropy could be related to ${\rm SDiff}(S^2)$ representation theory. Motivated by this possibility, we compute characters of ${\rm SDiff}(S^2)$ coadjoint orbits using the Atiyah-Bott fixed point formula. Physically, the characters can be interpreted as partition functions. Our results suggest that 2-sphere diffeomorphisms cannot account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
