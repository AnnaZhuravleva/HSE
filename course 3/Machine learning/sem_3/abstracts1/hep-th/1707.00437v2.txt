The super 0-brane action on the coset space of $D(2,1;\alpha)$ supergroup is constructed which involves a set of parameters related by $\kappa$-symmetry. It describes a massive superparticle propagating near the horizon of the extreme Reissner-Nordstr$\"o$m-AdS-dS black hole which is linked to the recently constructed $D(2,1;\alpha)$-superparticle [JHEP 1703 (2017) 054] by a canonical transformation.
