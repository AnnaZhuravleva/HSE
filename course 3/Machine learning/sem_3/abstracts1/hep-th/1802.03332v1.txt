We construct supersymmetric solutions of theories of gauged $\mathcal{N}=1,d=5$ supergravity coupled to vector multiplets with a $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\rm R}$ Abelian (Fayet-Iliopoulos) gauging and an independent SU$(2)$ gauging associated to an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ isometry group of the Real Special scalar manifold. These theories provide minimal supersymmetrizations of 5-dimensional SU$(2)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theories with negative cosmological constant. We consider a minimal model with these gauge groups and the "magic model" based on the Jordan algebra $\bf{J}_{3}^\mathbb{C}$ with gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(3)\times\mathrm{U}(1)_{\rm R}$, which is a consistent truncation of maximal $\mathrm{SO}(6)$-gauged supergravity in $d=5$ and whose solutions can be embedded in Type IIB Superstring Theory. We find several solutions containing selfdual $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ instantons, some of which asymptote to AdS$_{5}$ and some of which are very small, supersymmetric, deformations of AdS$_{5}$. We also show how some of those solutions can be embedded in Romans' $\mathrm{SU}(2)\times\mathrm{U}(1)$-gauged half-maximal supergravity, which was obtained by Lu, Pope and Tran by compactification of the Type IIB Superstring effective action. This provides another way of uplifting those solutions to 10 dimensions.
