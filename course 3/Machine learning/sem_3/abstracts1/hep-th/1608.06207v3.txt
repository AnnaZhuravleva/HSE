We discuss a generalisation of the Snyder model that includes all the possible deformations of the Heisenberg algebra compatible with Lorentz invariance, in terms of realisations of the noncommutative geometry. The corresponding deformed addition of momenta, the twist and the $R$-matrix are calculated to first order in the deformation parameters for all models. In the particular case of the Snyder realisation, the exact formula for the twist is obtained.
