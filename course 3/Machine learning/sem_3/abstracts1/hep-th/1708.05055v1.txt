We study the quantum theory of the singular scalar field $\varphi $ minimally coupled to gravity. In our approach, the scalar field is treated as a true quantum variable, while the scale factor $a(t)$ is supposed to be classical. We evaluate the quantum average of the self-interaction potential $V(\varphi)$ and use it in the modified differential equation for the Hubble parameter.
