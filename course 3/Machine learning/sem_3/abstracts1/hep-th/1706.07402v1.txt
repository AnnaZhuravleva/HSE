It has been recently conjectured that the exact eigenfunctions of quantum mirror curves can be obtained by combining their WKB expansion with the open topological string wavefunction. In this paper we give further evidence for this conjecture. We present closed expressions for the wavefunctions in the so-called maximally supersymmetric case, in various geometries. In the higher genus case, our conjecture provides a solution to the quantum Baxter equation of the corresponding cluster integrable system, and we argue that the quantization conditions of the integrable system follow from imposing appropriate asymptotic conditions on the wavefunction. We also present checks of the conjecture for general values of the Planck constant.
