Using the volume of the space enclosed in the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface, we study the complexity of the disk-shape subregion (with radius R) in various (2+1)-dimensional gapped systems with gravity duality. These systems include a class of toy models with singular IR and the bottom-up models for quantum chromodynamics and fractional quantum Hall effects. Two main results are: i) in the large-R expansion of the complexity, the R-linear term is always absent, in a way similar to the absence of topological entanglement entropy; ii) when the entanglement entropy exhibits the classic `swallowtail' phase transition, the complexity is sensible but reacts differently.
