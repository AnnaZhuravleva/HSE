It has been found that the zero mode of a five-dimensional Elko spinor could be localized on branes by introducing a coupling between the Elko spinor and the background scalar field or the Ricci scalar. However, the expressions of both couplings are determined by the parameters in the models and they just work for some kinds of thick brane models. In this paper, we explore other localization mechanism for the Elko spinor by introducing the non-minimal coupling $f(\phi)\mathfrak{L}_{Elko}$ between the five-dimensional Elko spinor and the background scalar field. Though two thick brane models and three kinds of couplings, we find that the Elko zero mode can be localized on the branes with this new mechanism. This provides us more possibilities of localizing the Elko zero mode.
