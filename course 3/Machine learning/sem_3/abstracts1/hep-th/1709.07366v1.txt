We define a new large $N$ limit for general $\text{O}(N)^{R}$ or $\text{U}(N)^{R}$ invariant tensor models, based on an enhanced large $N$ scaling of the coupling constants. The resulting large $N$ expansion is organized in terms of a half-integer associated with Feynman graphs that we call the index. This index has a natural interpretation in terms of the many matrix models embedded in the tensor model. Our new scaling can be shown to be optimal for a wide class of non-melonic interactions, which includes all the maximally single-trace terms. Our construction allows to define a new large $D$ expansion of the sum over diagrams of fixed genus in matrix models with an additional $\text{O}(D)^{r}$ global symmetry. When the interaction is the complete vertex of order $R+1$, we identify in detail the leading order graphs for $R$ a prime number. This slightly surprising condition is equivalent to the complete interaction being maximally single-trace.
