The methods of the renormalization group and the $\varepsilon$-expansion are applied to quantum gravity revealing the existence of an asymptotically safe fixed point in spacetime dimensions higher than two. To facilitate this, physical renormalization schemes are exploited where the renormalization group flow equations take a form which is independent of the parameterisation of the physical degrees of freedom (i.e. the gauge fixing condition and the choice of field variables). Instead the flow equation depends on the anomalous dimensions of reference observables. In the presence of spacetime boundaries we find that the required balance between the Einstein-Hilbert action and Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term is preserved by the beta functions. Exploiting the $\varepsilon$-expansion near two dimensions we consider Einstein gravity coupled to matter. Scheme independence is generically obscured by the loop-expansion due to breaking of two-dimensional Weyl invariance. In schemes which preserve two-dimensional Weyl invariance we avoid the loop expansion and find a unique ultra-violet (UV) fixed point. At this fixed point the anomalous dimensions are large and one must resum all loop orders to obtain the critical exponents. Performing the resummation a set of universal scaling dimensions are found. These scaling dimensions show that only a finite number of matter interactions are relevant. This is a strong indication that quantum gravity is renormalizable.
