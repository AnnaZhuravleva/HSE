Recently a new maximally supersymmetric, dyonically gauged supergravity in four-dimenions has been constructed. This theory admits several supersymmetric AdS solutions, and a Chern- Simons-matter dual theory has been proposed for a solution with an unbroken SU(3) symmetry. The gravity side and the field theory side of the free energy computation show nice agreements at superconformal point. With a view to a study of non-conformal deformations, in this paper we study a consistent truncation of the full theory where SU(3) is broken to U(1)$^2$. We elucidate the geometry of the scalar sector, and also present the superpotentials in both $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supergravity formulation.
