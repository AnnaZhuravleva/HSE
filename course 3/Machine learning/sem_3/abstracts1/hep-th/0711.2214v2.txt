We present a thermodynamical description of the interaction between holographic dark energy and dark matter. If holographic dark energy and dark matter evolve separately, each of them remains in thermodynamic equilibrium. A small interaction between them may be viewed as a stable thermal fluctuation that brings a logarithmic correction to the equilibrium entropy. From this correction we obtain a physical expression for the interaction which is consistent with phenomenological descriptions and passes reasonably well the observational tests.
