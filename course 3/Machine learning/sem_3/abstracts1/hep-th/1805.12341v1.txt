We use the embedding formalism to study correlation functions of a d-dimensional Euclidean CFT in the presence of a $q$ co-dimensional defect. The defect breaks the global conformal group $SO(d+1;1)$ into $SO(d-q+1,1) \times SO(q)$. We calculate all possible invariant structures that can appear in one-point, two-point and three-point correlation functions of bulk and defect operators in mixed symmetry representation. Their generalization to n-point correlation functions are also worked out. Correlation functions in the presence of a defect, in arbitrary representation of $SO(q)$, are also calculated.
