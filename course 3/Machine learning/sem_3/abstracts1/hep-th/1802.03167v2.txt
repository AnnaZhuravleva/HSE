We revisit the proof of equivalence of one loop expressions for fermion self-energy and vertex correction in light-front QED and Covariant QED at the Feynman diagram level and generalize, to all components, the proof of equivalence for the one loop vertex correction diagram which was presented earlier by us only for the $+$ component of $\Lambda^\mu$. We demonstrate, in the general case also, that the equivalence cannot be established without the third term in the three-term photon propagator in light cone gauge.
