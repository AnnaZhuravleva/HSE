We study the greybody factors of the scalar fields in spherically symmetric Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter black holes in higher dimensions. We derive the greybody factors analytically for both minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields. Moreover, we discuss the dependence of the greybody factor on various parameters including the angular momentum number, the non-minimally coupling constant, the spacetime dimension, the cosmological constant and the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient in detail. We find that the non-minimal coupling may suppress the Hawking radiation, while the Gauss-Bonnet coupling could enhance the radiation.
