In relativistic quantum field theory particles of half-integer spin must obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Their quantum operators must anticommute at spacelike separation in contrast to commuting physical observables. We show that Fermi-Dirac spin $1/2$ operators can be emergent in a fully commuting field theory forming directed strings and loops between, reproducing massive Dirac dynamics with background fields. Such underlying description may violate relativistic invariance but there are no manifest interactions at a distance and rotation symmetry remains preserved. We show that under some constraints on the model there exists a well-defined ground state -- Fermi sea that it is stable -- fermions cannot convert to bosons.
