We give a new expression for the supercurrent and its conservation in curved ${\cal N}=1$, $D=4$ superspace using the superconformal approach. The first component of the superfield, whose lowest component is the vector auxiliary field gives the (super)Einstein equations. Its trace and couplings to conformal and non-conformal matter is presented. In a suitable dilatational gauge, the conformal gauge, we obtain an update of the Callan-Coleman-Jackiw improved currents for conformal matter, containing $R$-symmetry corrections for a new traceless covariantly conserved energy--momentum tensor. We observe that in the Poincar\'e gauge, where standard Poincar\'e supergravity is usually formulated, the currents are not improved and then the higher conformal symmetry of the matter sector is obscured. The curvature multiplets are used to find supersymmetric curved backgrounds and some examples are exhibited in agreement with existing results.
