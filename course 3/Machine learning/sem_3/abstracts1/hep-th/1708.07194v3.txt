We construct new black brane solutions in the context of Horndeski gravity, in particular in its K-essence sector. These models are supported by axion scalar fields that depend only on the horizon coordinates. The dynamics of these fields is determined by a K-essence term that includes the standard kinetic term $X$ and a correction of the form $X^{k}$. We find both neutral and charged exact and analytic solutions in $D$-dimensions, which are asymptotically anti de Sitter. Then, we describe in detail the thermodynamical properties of the four-dimensional solutions and we compute the dual holographic DC conductivity.
