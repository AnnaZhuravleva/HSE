We construct a new class of black brane solutions in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) theory, which is characterized by a single parameter $a$. We find that the linear-T resistivity can be realized in a wide region of temperature for the specific case of $a^2=1/3$, which is dual to a ground state with vanishing entropy density in the dual system. Moreover, for $a=1$ we analytically construct the black brane which is magnetically charged by virtue of the electric-magnetic (EM) duality. Various transport coefficients are calculated and their temperature dependence are obtained in high temperature region.
