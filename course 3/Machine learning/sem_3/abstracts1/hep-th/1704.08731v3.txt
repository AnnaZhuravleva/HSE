We compute holographic R\'enyi entropies for spherical entangling surfaces on the boundary while considering third order Lovelock gravity with negative cosmological constant in the bulk. Our study shows that third order Lovelock black holes with hyperbolic event horizon are unstable, and at low temperatures those with smaller mass are favoured, giving rise to first order phase transitions in the bulk. We determine regions in the Lovelock parameter space in arbitrary dimensions, where bulk phase transitions happen and where boundary causality constraints are met. We show that each of these points corresponds to a dual boundary conformal field theory whose R\'enyi entropy exhibits a kink at a certain critical index $n$.
