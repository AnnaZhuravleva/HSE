Large vorticities have been observed in the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in peripheral collisions studied by the STAR collaboration at the RHIC facility. The first observations suggested, and more recent results confirm, that the vorticity is most in evidence at moderate impact energies, and is strongly suppressed at the \emph{highest} RHIC energies. In earlier work, we used a gauge-gravity approach to describe this unusual situation in terms of a \emph{bound on vorticity}, a bound that \emph{decreases} with increasing impact energy. This led to a prediction of a total average polarization $\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{\Lambda'}\,+\,\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{\overline{\Lambda}'}$, for (primary) $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons produced in collisions of $20\%$ centrality and 200 GeV impact energy, of about $0.4 \%$. At that time, one thought that this was too small to be detected, but the most recent results from the STAR collaboration, based on a much larger data set, are $\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{\Lambda'}\,\approx \,\overline{\mathcal{P}}_{\overline{\Lambda}'}\,\approx \, 0.2\%$ in this case, in good agreement with the holographic prediction. The STAR collaboration also reports data for polarization as a function of centrality, and these too are in agreement with the holographic model.
