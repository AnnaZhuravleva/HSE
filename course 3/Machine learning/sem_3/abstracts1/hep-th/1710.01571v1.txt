Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics is investigated in the Heisenberg picture via the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau gauge theory. On this framework, a perturbative method is used to compute the vacuum polarization tensor and its corresponding induced current for the case of a charged scalar field in the presence of an external electromagnetic field. Charge renormalization is brought into discussion for the interpretation of the results for the vacuum polarization.
