We investigate the relation between the $S$-matrix unitarity ($SS^{\dagger}=1$) and the renormalizability, in theories with negative norm states. The relation has been confirmed in many theories, such as gauge theories, Einstein gravity and Lifshitz-type non-relativistic theories by analyzing the unitarity bound, which follows from the $S$-matrix unitarity and the norm positivity. On the other hand, renormalizable theories with a higher derivative kinetic term do not necessarily satisfy the unitarity bound essentially because the unitarity bound does not hold due to the negative norm states. In these theories, it is not clear if the $S$-matrix unitarity provides a nontrivial constraint related to the renormalizability. In this paper we introduce scalar field models with a higher derivative kinetic term and analyze the $S$-matrix unitarity. We have positive results of the relation.
