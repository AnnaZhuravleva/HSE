After reformulating F(Riemann) gravity theory as a second derivative theory by introducing two auxiliary fields to the bulk action, we derive the surface term as well as the corner term supplemented to the bulk action for a generic non-smooth boundary such that the variational principle is well posed. We also introduce the counter term to make the boundary term invariant under the reparametrization for the null segment. Then as an application, we apply our expression for the full action to evaluate the corresponding action growth rate of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch in the Schwarzchild-AdS black hole for both F(R) gravity and critical gravity. The corresponding late time behavior recovers the previous one derived by other approaches.
