In this article we show that the BPS equations of vortex with nonzero internal pressure derived in~\cite{Atmaja:2015lia} for the generalized Maxwell-Higgs model can also be obtained using the BPS Lagrangian method developed in~\cite{Atmaja:2015umo}. Two additional terms are added into the original BPS Lagrangian $L_{BPS}=\int dQ$, with $Q$ is the BPS energy function, which are propotional to quadratic of first-derivative of the effective scalar field and a function of the effective scalar field. These additional terms produce additional constraint equations coming from Euler-Lagrange equations of the BPS Lagrangian. We repeat the procedure for generalized Born-Infeld-Higgs model and show that the total energy is finite for the BPS equations if the scalar potential is bounded from above $V\leq 2b^2$, with $b$ is the Born-Infeld parameter. We also compute the energy-momentum tensor and show that the pressure densities in radial and angular directions are nonzero. We argue that the BPS Lagrangian method could be used to find BPS equations for other solitons with nonzero internal pressure.
