We study a general class of spinning pulsating strings in $(AdS_5 \times S^5)_{\varkappa}$ background. For these family of solitons, we examine the scaling relation between the energy, spin or angular momentum. We verify that in $\varkappa \rightarrow 0 $ limit these relations reduce to the undeformed $AdS_5 \times S^5$ case. We further study an example of a string which is spinning in the $\varkappa$-deformed AdS$_5$ and S$^5$ simultaneously and find out the scaling relation among various conserved charges.
