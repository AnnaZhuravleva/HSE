It is shown that the correction to the vertex for fermion pair annihilation and production in the low-energy region is equal to the value of the wave function for the two-body system at the origin. The procedure also shows directly that the emergence of the Sommerfeld effect in quantum mechanics is the product of the reduction of the vertex correction from four spacetime dimensions to three-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the reciprocal wave function is introduced into quantum mechanics.
