We provide ${\cal N}=1$ superfield description of BPS background in six-dimensional supergravity (6D SUGRA) with 3-branes, which is compactified on a two-dimensional space. The brane terms induce the localized fluxes. We find a useful gauge in which the background equations become significantly simple. This is not the Wess-Zumino gauge, and the relation to the usual component-field expression of 6D SUGRA is not straightforward. One of the equations reduces to the Liouville equation. By moving to the Wess-Zumino gauge, we check that our expressions reproduce the known results of the previous works, which are expressed in the component fields. Our results help us develop the systematic derivation of four-dimensional effective theories that keeps the ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY structure.
