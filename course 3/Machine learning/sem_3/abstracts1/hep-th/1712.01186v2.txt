We study the two-dimensional topological abelian BF theory in the Lorenz gauge and, surprisingly, we find that the gauged-fixed theory is a free type B twisted N=(2,2) superconformal theory with odd linear target space, with the ghost field c being the pullback of the linear holomorphic coordinate on the target. The BRST operator of the gauge-fixed theory equals the total Q of type B twisted theory. This unexpected identification of two different theories opens a way for nontrivial deformations of both of these theories.
