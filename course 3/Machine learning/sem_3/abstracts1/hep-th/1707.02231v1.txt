The paper at hand studies the heat engine provided by black holes in the presence of massive gravity. The main motivation is to investigate the effects of massive gravity on different properties of the heat engine. It will be shown that massive gravity parameters and graviton's mass modify the efficiency of engine on a significant level. Furthermore, it will be shown that it is possible to have the heat engine for non-spherical black holes in massive gravity and we study the effects of topological factor on properties of the heat engine. Surprisingly, it will be shown that the highest efficiency for the heat engine belongs to black holes with hyperbolic horizon, while the lowest one belongs to spherical black holes.
