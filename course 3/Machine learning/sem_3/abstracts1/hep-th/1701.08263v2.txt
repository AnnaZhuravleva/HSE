We use Lagrangian effective field theory techniques to construct the equations of motion for an ideal relativistic fluid whose constituent degrees of freedom have microscopic polarization. We discuss the meaning of such a system, and argue that it is the first term in the EFT appropriate for describing polarization observables in heavy ion collisions, such as final state particle polarization and chiral magnetic and vortaic effects. We show that this system will generally require non-dissipative dynamics at higher order in gradient than second order, leading to potential stability issues known with such systems. We comment on the significance of this in the light of conjectured lower limits on viscosity.
