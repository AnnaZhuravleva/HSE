In this talk we introduce the properties of scattering forms on the compactified moduli space of Riemann spheres with $n$ marked points. These differential forms are $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ invariant, their intersection numbers correspond to scattering amplitudes as recently proposed by Mizera. All singularities are at the boundary of the moduli space and each singularity is logarithmic. In addition, each residue factorizes into two differential forms of lower points.
