We examine the recently introduced idea of Spin-Field Correspondence focusing on the example of the spin system described by the XXZ Heisenberg model with external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian of the resulting nonlinear scalar field theory is derived for arbitrary value of the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$. We show that the linear scalar field theory is reconstructed in the large spin limit. For $\Delta=1$ a non-relativistic scalar field theory satisfying the Born reciprocity principle is recovered. As expected, for the vanishing anisotropy parameter $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ the standard relativistic Klein-Gordon field is obtained. Various aspects of the obtained class of the scalar fields are studied, including the fate of the relativistic symmetries and the properties of the emerging interaction terms. We show that, in a certain limit, the so-called polymer quantisation of the field variables is recovered. This and other discussed properties suggest a possible relevance of the considered framework in the context of quantum gravity.
