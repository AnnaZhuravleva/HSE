Based on the gauge/gravity correspondence we have calculated the thermoelectric kinetic and transport characteristics of the strongly interacting materials in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field. The 3+1 dimensional system with Dirac-like spectrum is considered as a strongly interacting one if it is close to the particle-hole symmetry point. Transport in such system has been modeled by the two interacting vector fields. In the holographic theory the momentum relaxation is caused by axion field and leads to finite values of the direct current transport coefficients. We have calculated conductivity tensor in the presence of mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields and temperature gradient. The geometry differs from that in which magnetic field lies in the same plane as an electric one and temperature gradient.
