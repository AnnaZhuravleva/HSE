In the present theoretical communication, we propose a useful approach to write the Elko spinors, looking towards phenomenological applications. Such task starts by defining the Weyl spinors and the helicity operator in terms of the momentum in Cartesian coordinate system. This prescription is very useful in the sense of phenomenology point of view, so, we propose a set of Elko spinors ready to be computationally implemented. Regardless of, we impose to this spinors to be restrict to an axis, coincidentally the axis of locality, and then, using the proposed approach, we search for physical observables and physical processes along this axis, intending to unveil a possible hidden relevant physics.
