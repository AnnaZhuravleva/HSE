We construct a manifestly diffeomorphic M5-brane action in dual formulation coupled to an eleven-dimensional supergravity target space. The covariantisation is carried out by using (generalised) PST technique with 5 auxiliary scalar fields, which are obtained by using a geometrical consideration as a reduction of an auxiliary 4-form of Maznytsia-Preitschopf-Sorokin. As is typical in PST-covariantised theory, our construction possesses as usual the two local PST symmetries. By using one of the local PST symmetries, the action can be reduced to the non-manifestly covariant M5-brane action in dual formulation constructed earlier by the authors. The discussion on double dimensional reduction to D4-brane, and on the comparison of on-shell action then easily follows.
