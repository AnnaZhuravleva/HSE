We explain how a single scalar degree of freedom can be obtained from projecting out all the other components of a chiral superfield using simple operators in the microscopic theory. We use the Fayet-Iliopoulos model as an example of the origin for the necessary supersymmetry breaking. We also comment on one peculiar aspect where non-linear realisation can be useful: the freeze-in scenario for gravitino dark matter.
