In this work, a clear connection is made between E. Verlinde's recent theory of emergent gravity in de Sitter space and the earlier work that described emergent gravity using holographic screens. A modified (non)holographic screen scenario is presented, wherein the screen fails to encode an emergent mass in the bulk "unemerged" part of space for sufficiently large length-scales, where the volume-law of the non-holographic bulk degrees of freedom overtakes the area-law scaling of the entropy of the screen. Within this framework, we can describe both an emergent dark gravitational force, which scales like $\frac{1}{r}$, and also a version of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. We therefore recast these results within an emergent gravity framework in which there is an explicit violation of holography for sufficiently large length-scales.
