We study the radion stability and radion mass in the framework of the Horava-Witten (HW) heterotic M-Theory on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$, and find that the radion is stable and its mass can be of the order of GeV. The gravity is localized on the visible brane, and the spectrum of the gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes is discrete and can have a mass gap of TeV. The corrections to the 4D Newtonian potential from the higher order gravitational KK modes are exponentially suppressed. Applying such a setup to cosmology, we find the generalized Friedmann-like equations on each of the two orbifold branes.
