We consider a conformal field theory in two dimensions in which an external perturbation is placed. We study the energy flux and entanglement entropy for one, two and multiple intervals and give a suggestion relating the two in some cases. We show that both the energy flux and the entanglement entropy exhibit a light-cone singularity which strongly depends on the regularization we choose.
