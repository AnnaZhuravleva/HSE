The three-dimensional non-relativistic isometry algebras, namely Galilei and Newton-Hooke algebras, are known to admit double central extensions, which allows for non-degenerate bilinear forms hence for action principles through Chern-Simons formulation. In three-dimensional colored gravity, the same central extension helps the theory evade the multi-graviton no-go theorems by enlarging the color-decorated isometry algebra. We investigate the non-relativistic limits of three-dimensional colored gravity in terms of generalized \.In\"on\"u-Wigner contractions.
