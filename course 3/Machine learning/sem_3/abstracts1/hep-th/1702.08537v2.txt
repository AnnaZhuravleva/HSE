We investigate M-theory and heterotic compactifications to 7 and 3 dimensions. In 7 dimensions we discuss a class of massive supergravities that arise from M-theory on K3 and point out obstructions to realizing these theories in a dual heterotic framework with a geometric description. Taking M-theory further down to 3 dimensions on K3xK3 with a choice of flux leads to a rich landscape of theories with various amounts of supersymmetry, including those preserving 6 supercharges. We explore possible heterotic realizations of these vacua and prove a no--go theorem: every heterotic geometry that preserves 6 supercharges preserves 8 supercharges.
