Previously, two of the present authors obtained the decoupling limit and the corresponding throat geometry of non-supersymmetric D3 brane solution of type IIB string theory. In analogy with the supersymmetric case, it describes the gravity dual of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory with QCD-like properties such as running coupling and confinement (or mass gap) in certain range of its parameters. In this paper, we consider a `black' version of the non-supersymmetric D3 brane solution in the decoupling limit and use this gravity background to holographically compute the expectation value of a time-like Wilson loop which, in turn, is related to the potential of a heavy quark-antiquark pair. By boosting the gravity solution along one of the brane directions and placing the pair at an arbitrary orientation with this direction, we numerically obtain the variation of the screening length as well as the potential with velocity, its orientation with respect to the direction of motion and other parameters of the theory. Remarkably enough, our results are in qualitative agreement with those obtained holographically in supersymmetric gauge theories indicating that these features are quite robust and universal as they are insensitive to the presence of any supersymmetry in the theory. The physical interpretations of the variations with respect to the other parameters of the theory, not observed in supersymmetric theory, have also been given.
