We show that the one-loop on-shell four-point scattering amplitude of massless $\phi^4$ scalar field theory in 4D Minkowski space time, when Mellin transformed to the Celestial sphere at infinity, transforms covariantly under the global conformal group ($SL(2,C)$) on the sphere. The unitarity of the four-point scalar amplitudes is recast into this Mellin basis. We show that the same conformal structure also appears for the two-loop Mellin amplitude. Finally we comment on some universal structure for all loop four-point Mellin amplitudes specific to this theory.
