The holographic complexity of a `black' non-susy $D3$-brane is computed. The difference in the holographic complexity between this geometry and that of the AdS_5 geometry is obtained. This is then related to the changes in the energy and the entanglement entropy of the system. We next take the high temperature limit of the change in complexity and observe that it scales with the temperature in the same way as the holographic entanglement entropy. The crossover of the holographic complexity to its corresponding thermal counterpart is similar to the corresponding crossover of the holographic entanglement entropy in the high temperature limit. We further repeat the analysis for $\mathcal{N} =4$ super Yang-Mills theory and observe a similar behaviour.
