We show that when an external magnetic field parallel to the boundary is applied, Weyl anomaly give rises to a new anomalous current transport in the vicinity of the boundary. Unlike other previous studied anomalous transport phenomena such as the chiral magnetic effect or the chiral vortical effect, this induced transport does not rely on the presence of a material system and can occur in vacuum. Similar to the Casimir effect, this transport phenomena has its origin in the effect of the boundary on the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. However this induced current is pure quantum mechanical and has no classical limit; and like the quantum Hall effect, it is measured by the quantum Hall conductance. We briefly discuss how this induced transport may be observed experimentally.
