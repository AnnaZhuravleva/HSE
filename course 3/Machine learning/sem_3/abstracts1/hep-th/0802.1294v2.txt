Inspired by the Landau two-fluid model of superfluidity, we consider a similar multifluid description for cosmology where two normal fluids occur for matter and radiation respectively. For cyclic cosmology, two dark energy superfluid components turn out to be insufficient but three superfluids can lead to a sensible five-fluid model which in a certain limit becomes indistinguishable from the brane-world cyclic model proposed earlier (Baum and Frampton). Distinguishing more general five-fluid models from brane-world models for cyclic cosmology could be feasible with more accurate observational data.
