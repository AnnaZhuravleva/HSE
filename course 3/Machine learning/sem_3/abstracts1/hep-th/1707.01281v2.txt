We show that there exist infinite number of recurrence relations valid for all energies among the open bosonic string scattering amplitudes (SSA) of three tachyons and one arbitrary string state, or the Lauricella SSA. Moreover, these infinite number of recurrence relations can be used to solve all the Lauricella SSA and express them in terms of one single four tachyon amplitude. These results extend the solvability of SSA at the high energy, fixed angle scattering limit and those at the Regge scattering limit discovered previously.
