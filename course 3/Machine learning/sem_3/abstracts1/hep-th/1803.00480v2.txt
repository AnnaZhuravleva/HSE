Bosonization techniques are important nonperturbative tools in quantum field theory. In three dimensions they possess interesting connections to topologically ordered systems and ultimately have driven the observation of an impressive web of dualities. In this work, we use the quantum wires formalism to show how the fermion-boson mapping relating the low-energy regime of the massive Thirring model in three spacetime dimensions with the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model can be obtained from the exact bosonization in two dimensions.
