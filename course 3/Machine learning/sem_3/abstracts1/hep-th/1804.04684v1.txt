In the present work we study the propagation of a probe minimally coupled scalar field in Einstein-power-Maxwell charged black hole background in (1+2) dimensions. We find analytical expressions for the reflection coefficient as well as for the absorption cross-section in the low energy regime, and we show graphically their behaviour as functions of the frequency for several values of the free parameters of the theory.
