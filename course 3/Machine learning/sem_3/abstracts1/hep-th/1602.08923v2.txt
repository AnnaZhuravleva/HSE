We examine a discrete version of the two-dimensional nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model derived from discrete complex analysis. We adopt two lattices, one rectangular, the other polar. We define a discrete energy $E({f})^{\rm disc.}$ and a discrete area ${\cal{A}}({f})^{\rm disc.}$, where the function $f$ is related to a stereographic projection governed by a unit vector of the model. The discrete energy and area satisfy the inequality $E({f})^{\rm disc.} \ge |{\cal{A}}({f})^{\rm disc.}|$, which is saturated if and only if the function $f$ is discrete (anti-)holomorphic. We show for the rectangular lattice that, except for a factor 2, the discrete energy and the area tend to the usual continuous energy $E({f})$ and the area ${\cal{A}}({f})=4 \pi N, \,\,N\in \pi_2(S^2)$ as the lattice spacings tend to zero. In the polar lattice, we section the plane by $2M$ lines passing through the origin into $2M$ equal sectors and place vertices radially in a geometric progression with a common ratio $q$. For this polar lattice, the Euler--Lagrange equation derived from the discrete energy $E({f})^{\rm disc.}$ yields rotationally symmetric (anti-)holomorphic solutions $f(z)=Cz^{\pm 1}\,\,(C\bar{z}^{\pm 1})$ in the zeroth order of $\kappa:=q^{-1}-q$. We find that the discrete area evaluated by these zeroth-order solutions is expressible as a $q$-integral (the Jackson integral). Moreover, the area tends to $\pm 2\cdot 4\pi$ in the continuum limit ($M \to \infty$ and $q \to 1\!-0$) with fixed discrete conformal structure $\rho_0 =2 \sin{(\pi/M)}/ \kappa$.
