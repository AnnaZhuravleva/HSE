We construct supersymmetric solutions of three dimensional N = (1,1) General Massive Supergravity (GMG). Solutions with a null Killing vector are in general pp-waves. We identify those that appear at critical points of the model some of which do not exist in N = (1,1) New Massive Supergravity (NMG). In the timelike case, we find that many solutions are common with NMG but there is a new class that is genuine to GMG, two members of which are stationary Lifshitz and timelike squashed AdS spacetimes. We also show that in addition to the fully supersymmetric AdS vacuum, there is a second AdS background with a non-zero vector field that preserves 1/4 supersymmetry.
