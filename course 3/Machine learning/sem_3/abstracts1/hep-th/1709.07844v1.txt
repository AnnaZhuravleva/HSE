We review recent theoretical progress and observational constraints on multifractional spacetimes, geometries that change with the probed scale. On the theoretical side, the basic structure of the Standard Model and of the gravitational action is discussed. On the experimental side, we recall the bounds on the scales of the geometry coming from particle physics, astrophysics, and the cosmic microwave background.
