The non-Abelian tensor gauge fields take value in extended Poincar\'e algebra. In order to define the invariant Lagrangian we introduce a vector variable in two alternative ways: through the transversal representation of the extended Poincar\'e algebra and through the path integral over the auxiliary vector field with the U(1) Abelian action. We demonstrate that path integral formulation allows to fix the unitary gauge, derive scattering amplitudes in spinor representation and to define the gauge invariant Lagrangian in a curved space-time.
