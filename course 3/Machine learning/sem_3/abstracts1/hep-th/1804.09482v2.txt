Starting from the formulation of pseudo-Riemannian generalisation of real spectral triples we develop the data of geometries over finite-dimensional algebras with indefinite metric and their Riemannian parts. We then discuss the Standard Model spectral triple in this formalism and interpret the physical symmetry preserving the lepton number as a shadow of a finite pseudo-Riemannian structure.
