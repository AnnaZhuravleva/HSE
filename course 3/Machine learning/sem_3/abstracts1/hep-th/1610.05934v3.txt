I propose a quantum gravity model in which geometric space emerges from random bits in a quantum phase transition driven by the combinatorial Ollivier-Ricci curvature and corresponding to the condensation of short cycles in random graphs. This quantum critical point defines quantum gravity non-perturbatively. In the ordered geometric phase at large distances the action reduces to the standard Einstein-Hilbert term.
