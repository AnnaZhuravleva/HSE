We describe in detail the emission of massive particles from Kerr black hole by using complex trajectories, which are solutions to the Hamilton's equations of motion with imaginary proper time. The trajectories are smooth and cover the inner and outer horizon regions. Following the worldline approach, we compute the imaginary part of the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude as a summation over these complex trajectories. We show that in the leading order, energy flux tunneling through the horizon is indeed proportional to $\sim (T^{+}_H)^4$, in accordance with the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
