The canonical tensor model (CTM) is a tensor model proposing a classically and quantum mechanically consistent model of gravity, formulated as a first-class constraint system with structural similarities to the ADM formalism of general relativity. A recent study on the formal continuum limit of the classical CTM has shown that it produces a general relativistic system. This formal continuum limit assumes the emergence of a continuous space, but ultimately continuous spaces should be obtained as preferred configurations of the quantum CTM. In this paper we study the symmetry properties of a wave function which exactly solves the quantum constraints of the CTM for general $N$. We have found that it has strong peaks at configurations invariant under some Lie-groups, as predicted by a mechanism described in our previous paper. A surprising result was the preference of configurations invariant not only under Lie-groups with positive signatures, but also with spacetime-like signatures, i.e., $SO(1,n)$. Such symmetries could characterize the global structures of spacetimes, and our results are encouraging towards showing spacetime emergence in the CTM. To verify the asymptotic convergence of the wave function we have also analyzed the asymptotic behaviour, which for the most part seems to be well under control.
