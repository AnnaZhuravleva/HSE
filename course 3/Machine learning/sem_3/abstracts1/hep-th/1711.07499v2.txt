We study elliptic vortices on $\mathbb{C}\times T^2$ by considering the 2d quiver gauge theory describing their moduli spaces. The elliptic genus of these moduli spaces is the elliptic version of vortex partition function of the 4d theory. We focus on two examples: the first is a $\mathcal{N}=1$, $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory with fundamental and anti-fundamental matter; the second is a $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory with matter in the fundamental representation. The results are instances of 4d "holomorphic blocks" into which partition functions on more complicated surfaces factorize. They can also be interpreted as free-field representations of elliptic Virasoro algebrae.
