We consider higher derivative supergravities that are dual to ghost-free $N=1$ supergravity theories in the Einstein frame. The duality is implemented by deforming the K\"ahler function, and/or the superpotential, to include nonlinear dependences on chiral fields that in other approaches play the role of the Lagrange multipliers employed to establish this duality. These models are of the no-scale type, and in the minimal case, require the presence of four chiral multiplets, with a K\"ahler potential having the structure of the $ SU(4,1)/SU(4) \times U(1) $ coset manifold. In the standard $N=1$ supergravity formulation, these models are described by a multifield scalar potential, featuring Starobinsky-like behavior in particular directions.
