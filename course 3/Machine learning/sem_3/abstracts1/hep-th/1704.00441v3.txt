We study the holographic dual of a massive gravity with Gauss-Bonnet and cubic quasi-topological higher curvature terms. Firstly, we find the energy-momentum two point function and central charges of the 4-dimensional boundary theory, albeit the massive term acts as a relevant perturbation to the conformal field theory. Then we focus on a black hole solution in this background and derive the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density for the dual theory. Results smoothly cover the massless limit.
