A pedagogical introduction to aspects of string cosmology, including the landscape (BPBT) solution to the cosmological constant problem, brane-antibrane inflation, warped compactification, the KKLMMT model, the eta problem of SUGRA models, DBI inflation, Kahler modulus and racetrack inflation, the D3-D7 model, cosmic superstrings, and the problem of reheating. Also includes basic methods for phenomenology of multifield models with nonstandard kinetic terms.
