We combine notions of a maximal curvature scale in nature with that of a minimal curvature scale to construct a non-singular Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole. We present an exact solution within the context of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. For a range of parameters the solution approaches Schwarzschild-de Sitter at large values of the radial coordinate, asymptotically approaching a de Sitter metric with constant minimal curvature, while approaching a maximal constant curvature smooth spacetime as the radial coordinate approaches zero. The spacetime is geodesically complete and generically has both a black hole horizon and a cosmological horizon.
