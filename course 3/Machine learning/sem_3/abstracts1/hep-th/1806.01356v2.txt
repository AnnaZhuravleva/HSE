Aspects of three dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with monopole superpotentials and their dualities are investigated. The moduli spaces of a number of such theories are studied using Hilbert series. Moreover, we propose new dualities involving quadratic powers for the monopole superpotentials, for unitary, symplectic and orthogonal gauge groups. These dualities are then tested using the three sphere partition function and matching of the Hilbert series. We also provide an argument for the obstruction to the duality for theories with quartic monopole superpotentials.
