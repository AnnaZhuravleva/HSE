We consider the Bremsstrahlung function associated to a 1/6-BPS Wilson loop in ABJM theory, with a cusp in the couplings to scalar fields. We non-trivially extend its recent four-loop computation at weak coupling to include non-planar corrections. We have recently proposed a conjecture relating this object to supersymmetric circular Wilson loops with multiple windings, which can be computed via localization. We find agreement between this proposal and the perturbative computation of the Bremsstrahlung function, including color sub-leading corrections. This supports the conjecture and hints at its validity beyond the planar approximation.
