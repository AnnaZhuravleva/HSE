We develop a systematic approach to evaluating AdS loop amplitudes based on the spectral (or "split") representation of bulk-to-bulk propagators, which re-expresses loop diagrams in terms of spectral integrals and higher-point tree diagrams. In this work we focus on 2pt one-loop Witten diagrams involving totally symmetric fields of arbitrary mass and integer spin. As an application of this framework, we study the contribution to the anomalous dimension of higher-spin currents generated by bubble diagrams in higher-spin gauge theories on AdS.
