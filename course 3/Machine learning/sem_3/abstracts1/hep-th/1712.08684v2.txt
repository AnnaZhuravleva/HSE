Recently, a double-copy formalism was used to calculate gravitational radiation from classical Yang-Mills radiation solutions. This work shows that Yang-Mills theory coupled to a biadjoint scalar field admits a radiative double copy that agrees with solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory at the lowest finite order. Within this context, the trace-reversed metric $\bar{h}^{\mu\nu}$ is a natural double copy of the gauge boson $A^{\mu a}$. This work provides additional evidence that solutions in gauge and gravity theories are related, even though their respective Lagrangians and nonlinear equations of motion appear to be different.
