We consider the non-supersymmetric "magic" theories based on the split quaternion and the split complex division algebras. We show that these theories arise as "Ehlers" $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ truncations of the maximal supergravity theory, exploiting techniques related to very-extended Kac-Moody algebras. We also generalise the procedure to other $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$ truncations, resulting in additional classes of non-supersymmetric theories, as well as to truncations of non-maximal theories. Finally, we discuss duality orbits of extremal black-hole solutions in some of these non-supersymmetric theories.
