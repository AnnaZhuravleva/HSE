We investigate effects of strong correlation on the surface state of topological insulator (TI). We argue that electrons in the regime of crossover from weak anti-localization to weak localization, are strongly correlated and calculate magneto-transport coefficients of TI using gauge gravity principle. Then, we examine, magneto-conductivity (MC) formula and find excellent agreement with the data of chrome doped Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in the crossover regime. We also find that cusp-like peak in MC at low doping is absent, which is natural since quasi-particles disappear due to the strong correlation.
