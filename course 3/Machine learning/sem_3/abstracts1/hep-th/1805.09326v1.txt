We describe a family of finite, four-dimensional, $L$-loop Feynman integrals that involve weight-$(L+1)$ hyperlogarithms integrated over $(L-1)$-dimensional elliptically fibered varieties we conjecture to be Calabi-Yau. At three loops, we identify the relevant K3 explicitly; and we provide strong evidence that the four-loop integral involves a Calabi-Yau threefold. These integrals are necessary for the representation of amplitudes in many theories---from massless $\varphi^4$ theory to integrable theories including maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit---a fact we demonstrate.
