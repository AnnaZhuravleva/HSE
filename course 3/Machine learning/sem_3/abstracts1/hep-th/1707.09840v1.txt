In this paper we continue our program of computing Casimir self-entropies of idealized electrical bodies. Here we consider an electromagnetic $\delta$-function sphere ("semitransparent sphere") whose electric susceptibility has a transverse polarization with arbitrary strength. Dispersion is incorporated by a plasma-like model. In the strong coupling limit, a perfectly conducting spherical shell is realized. We compute the entropy for both low and high temperatures. The TE self-entropy is negative as expected, but the TM self-entropy requires ultraviolet and infrared subtractions, and, surprisingly, is only positive for sufficiently strong coupling. Results are robust under different regularization schemes.
