We study M5-branes wrapped on a multi-centred Taub-NUT space. Reducing to String Theory on the circle fibration leads to D4-branes intersecting with D6-branes. D-braneology shows that there are additional charged chiral fermions from the open strings which stretch between the D4-branes and D6-branes. From the M-theory point of view the appearance of these charged states is mysterious as the M5-branes are wrapped on a smooth manifold. In this paper we show how these states arise in the M5-brane worldvolume theory and argue that are governed by a WZWN-like model where the topological term is five-dimensional.
