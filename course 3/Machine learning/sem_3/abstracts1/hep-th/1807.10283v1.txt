We develop the large $D$ limit of general relativity for spherically symmetric scalar fields in both asymptotically flat and asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces. The leading order equations in the $1/D$ expansion can be solved analytically, providing a large $D$ description of oscillating soliton stars. When the amplitude reaches a critical threshold, certain divergences occur which we interpret as signal of horizon formation. We estimate the size of the resulting black hole and obtain, with respect to that definition, a Choptuik scaling exponent for our family of solutions.
