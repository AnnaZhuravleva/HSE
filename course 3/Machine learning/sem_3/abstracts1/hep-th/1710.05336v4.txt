We derive the off-shell nilpotent (fermionic) (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations by exploiting the (anti-)chiral superfield approach (ACSA) to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism for the interacting Abelian 1-form gauge theories where there is a coupling between the U(1) Abelian 1-form gauge field and Dirac as well as complex scalar fields. We exploit the (anti-)BRST invariant restrictions on the (anti-)chiral superfields to derive the fermionic symmetries of our present D-dimensional Abelian 1-form gauge theories. The novel observation of our present investigation is the derivation of the absolute anticommutativity of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges despite the fact that our ordinary D-dimensional theories are generalized onto the (D, 1)-dimensional (anti-)chiral super submanifolds (of the general (D, 2)-dimensional supermanifold) where only the (anti-)chiral expansions of the (anti-)chiral superfields have been taken into account. We also discuss the nilpotency of the (anti-)BRST charges and (anti-)BRST invariance of the Lagrangian densities of our present theories within the framework of ACSA to BRST formalism.
