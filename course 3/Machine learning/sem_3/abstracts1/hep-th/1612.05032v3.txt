We apply analytic conformal bootstrap ideas in Mellin space to conformal field theories with $O(N)$ symmetry and cubic anisotropy. We write down the conditions arising from the consistency between the operator product expansion and crossing symmetry in Mellin space. We solve the constraint equations to compute the anomalous dimension and the OPE coefficients of all operators quadratic in the fields in the epsilon expansion. We reproduce known results and derive new results up to $O(\epsilon^3)$. For the $O(N)$ case, we also study the large $N$ limit in general dimensions and reproduce known results at the leading order in $1/N$.
