We discuss the four dimensional models obtained by compactifying a single M5 brane probing $D_{N}$ singularity (minimal D-type $(1,0)$ conformal matter in six dimensions) on a torus with flux for abelian subgroups of the $SO(4N)$ flavor symmetry. We derive the resulting quiver field theories in four dimensions by first compactifying on a circle and relating the flux to duality domain walls in five dimensions. This leads to novel ${\cal N}=1$ dualities in 4 dimensions which arise from distinct five dimensional realizations of the circle compactifications of the D-type conformal matter.
