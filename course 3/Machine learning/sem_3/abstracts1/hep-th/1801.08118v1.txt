Nonperturbative formulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is discussed. The partition function of the model can be represented as a functional integral over the Grassmann variables in Euclidean time which is well defined but it diverges after the transformation to the fermion bilocal fields. We point out that the generating functional of the SYK model in real time is well defined even after the transformation to the bilocal fields and it can be used for nonperturbative investigations of its properties. The SYK model in zero dimensions is studied, its large N expansion is evaluated and phase transitions are investigated.
