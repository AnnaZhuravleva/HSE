We study candidates of the multiple-brane solutions of bosonic open string field theory. They are constructed by performing a singular gauge transformation $n$ times for the Erler-Maccaferri solution. We check the EOM in the strong sense, and find that it is satisfied only when we perform the gauge transformation once. We calculate the energy for that case and obtain a support that the solution is a multiple-brane solution. We also check the tachyon profile for a specific solution which we interpret as describing a D24-brane placed on a D25-brane.
