The geometry of the dual amplituhedron is generally described in reference to a particular triangulation. A given triangulation manifests only certain aspects of the underlying space while obscuring others, therefore understanding this geometry without reference to a particular triangulation is desirable. In this note we introduce a new formalism for computing the volumes of general polytopes in any dimension. We define new "vertex objects" and introduce a calculus for expressing volumes of polytopes in terms of them. These expressions are unique, independent of any triangulation, manifestly depend only on the vertices of the underlying polytope, and can be used to easily derive identities amongst different triangulations. As one application of this formalism, we obtain new expressions for the volume of the tree-level, $n$-point NMHV dual amplituhedron.
