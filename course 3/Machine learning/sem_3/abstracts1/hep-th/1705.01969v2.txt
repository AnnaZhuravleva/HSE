We numerically study the behaviour of entanglement entropy for a free scalar field on the noncommutative ("fuzzy") sphere after a mass quench. It is known that the entanglement entropy before a quench violates the usual area law due to the non-local nature of the theory. By comparing our results to the ordinary sphere, we find results that, despite this non-locality, are compatible with entanglement being spread by ballistic propagation of entangled quasi-particles at a speed no greater than the speed of light. However, we also find that, when the pre-quench mass is much larger than the inverse of the short-distance cutoff of the fuzzy sphere (a regime with no commutative analogue), the entanglement entropy spreads faster than allowed by a local model.
