We study partially massless gravity theory(PM gravity theory) and suggest an alternative way to add higher order interaction vertices to the theory. Rather than introducing self interaction vertices of the gravitational fields to the partially massless gravity action, we consider interactions with matter fields, since it is well known that addition of the self interaction terms necessarily breaks the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry that PM gravity theory enjoys. To retain the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, the matter fields also transform properly and it turns out that the transformation must be non local. We also study the actions and the equations of motion of the partially massless gravity fields. As expected, it shows 4 unitary degrees of freedom. 2 of them are traceless tensor modes and they are light like fields. The other 2 are transverse vector modes and their dispersion relation changes as background space time(de sitter) evolutes. In the very early time, they are light like but in the very late time, their velocity become a half of speed of light. The vector mode dispersion relation shows momentum dependent behavior. In fact, the higher(lower) frequency modes show the faster(slower) velocity. We call this effect "conformal(or de sitter) prism". We suggest their quantization, compute Hamiltonians to present their exited quanta and construct their free propagators.
