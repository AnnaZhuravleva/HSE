We present a simple effective field theory formulation of a general family of single field flux monodromy models for which strong coupling effects at large field values can flatten the potential and activate operators with higher powers of derivatives. These models are radiatively and non-perturbatively stable and can easily sustain $\ga 60$ efolds of inflation. The dynamics combines features of both large field chaotic inflation and $k$-inflation, both of which can suppress the tensor amplitude. Reducing the tensor-scalar ratio below the observational bound $r \lesssim 0.1$ while keeping the scalar spectral index $n_s$ within experimental bounds either yields equilateral nongaussianity $f_{NL}^{eq} \simeq {\cal O}(1)$, close to the current observational bounds, or ultimately gives very small $r$.
