We show that the minimal D = 5, N = 2 gauged supergravity set-up may encode naturally the recently proposed clockwork mechanism. The minimal embedding requires one vector multiplet in addition to the supergravity multiplet and the clockwork scalar is identified with the scalar in the vector multiplet. The scalar has a two-parameter potential and it can accommodate the clockwork, the Randall-Sundrum and a no-scale model with a flat potential, depending on the values of the parameters. The continuous clockwork background breaks half of the original supersymmetries, leaving a D = 4, N = 1 theory on the boundaries. We also show that the generated hierarchy by the clockwork is not exponential but rather power law. The reason is that four-dimensional Planck scale has a power-law dependence on the compactification radius, whereas the corresponding KK spectrum depends on the logarithm of the latter.
