The BPS D3 brane has a non-supersymmetric cousin, called the non-susy D3 brane, which is also a solution of type IIB string theory. The corresponding counterpart of black D3 brane is the `black' non-susy D3 brane and like the BPS D3 brane, it also has a decoupling limit, where the decoupled geometry (in the case we are interested, this is asymptotically AdS$_5$ $\times$ S$^5$) is the holographic dual of a non-conformal, non-supersymmetric QFT in $(3+1)$-dimensions. In this QFT we compute the entanglement entropy (EE), the complexity and the Fisher information metric holographically using the above mentioned geometry for both the strip type and spherical subsystems. We compare our results with the standard AdS$_5$ black hole (the decoupled geometry of black D3 brane) obtained before (only the EE is known and not the complexity which we calculate in this paper) and find that although the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the metric reproduces the result for the entanglement entropy correctly, it fails to do so for the complexity. The fidelity and the Fisher information metric have been calculated from the regularized extremal volume of the codimension one time slice of the bulk geometry using some earlier prescription in the literature.
