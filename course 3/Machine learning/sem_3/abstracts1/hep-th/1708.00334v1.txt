Nonlinear realizations of the SO(4,2) group are discussed from the point of view of symmetries. Dynamical symmetry breaking is introduced. One linear and one quadratic model in curvature are constructed. Coherent states of the Klauder-Perelomov type are defined for both cases taking into account the coset geometry. A new spontaneous compactification mechanism is defined in the subspace invariant under the stability subgroup. The physical implications of the symmetry rupture in the context of non-linear realizations and direct gauging are analyzed and briefly discussed.
