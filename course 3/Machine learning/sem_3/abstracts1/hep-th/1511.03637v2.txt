Motivated by the search for new gravity duals to M2 branes with $N>4$ supersymmetry --- equivalently, M-theory backgrounds with Killing superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(N|4)$ for $N>4$ --- we classify homogeneous M-theory backgrounds with symmetry Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(n) \oplus \mathfrak{so}(3,2)$ for $n=5,6,7$. We find that there are no new backgrounds with $n=6,7$ but we do find a number of new (to us) backgrounds with $n=5$. All backgrounds are metrically products of the form $\operatorname{AdS}_4 \times P^7$, with $P$ riemannian and homogeneous under the action of $\operatorname{SO}(5)$, or $S^4 \times Q^7$ with $Q$ lorentzian and homogeneous under the action of $\operatorname{SO}(3,2)$. At least one of the new backgrounds is supersymmetric (albeit with only $N=2$) and we show that it can be constructed from a supersymmetric Freund--Rubin background via a Wick rotation. Two of the new backgrounds have only been approximated numerically. (The second version of this paper includes an appendix by Alexander~S.~Haupt, closing a gap in our original analysis.)
