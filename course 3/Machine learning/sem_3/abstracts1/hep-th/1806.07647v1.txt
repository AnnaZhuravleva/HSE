We apply differential geometry methods to the computation of the anomaly-induced hydrodynamic equilibrium partition function. Implementing the imaginary-time prescription on the Chern-Simons effective action on a stationary background, we obtain general closed expressions for both the invariant and anomalous part of the partition function. This is applied to the Wess-Zumino-Witten action for Goldstone modes, giving the equilibrium partition function of superfluids. In all cases, we also study the anomaly-induced gauge currents and energy-momentum tensor, providing explicit expressions for them.
