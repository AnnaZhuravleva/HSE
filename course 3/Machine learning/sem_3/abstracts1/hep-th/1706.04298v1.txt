Using the momentum space representation, we study the (2 +1)-dimensional Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau oscillator for spin 0 particle under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length in the noncommutative space. The explicit form of energy eigenvalues are found, the wave functions and the corresponding probability density are reported in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. Additionally, we also discuss the special cases and depict the corresponding numerical results.
