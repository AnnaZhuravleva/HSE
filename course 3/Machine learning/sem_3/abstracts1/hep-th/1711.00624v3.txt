The R\'enyi entanglement entropy (REE) of the states excited by local operators in two dimensional irrational conformal field theories (CFTs), especially in Liouville field theory (LFT) and $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Liouville field theory (SLFT), has been studied. In particular, we consider the excited states obtained by acting on the vacuum with primary operators. The 2nd REE of such local excited states becomes divergent in early and late time limits. In terms of different divergent behavior of REE, these states can be divided into two classes in LFT and SLFT with respect to value of Liouville momentum. Choosing a target state and reference state in the same class, the variation of REE between target and reference states can be well defined. The difference of such variation of REE between in early and late time limit always coincides with the log of the ratio of fusion matrix elements between target states and reference states. Furthermore, the locally excited states by acting generic descendent operators on the vacuum have been also investigated and the difference of variation of REE will be summation of the log of the ratio of the fusion matrix elements associated with target states and reference states, and additional normalization factors. Since the identity operator (or vacuum state) does not live in Hilbert space of LFT and SLFT and no discrete terms contribute REE, the variation of REE between target and reference states is quite different from one of excited states in 1+1 dimensional rational CFTs.
