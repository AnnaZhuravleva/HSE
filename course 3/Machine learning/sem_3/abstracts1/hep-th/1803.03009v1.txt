The quantum ${\mathbb C}P^{N-1}$ model is in the confining (or unbroken) phase with a full mass gap in an infinite space, while it is in the Higgs (broken or deconfinement) phase accompanied with Nambu-Goldstone modes in a finite space such as a ring or finite interval smaller than a certain critical size. We find a new self-consistent exact solution describing a soliton in the Higgs phase of the ${\mathbb C}P^{N-1}$ model in the large-$N$ limit on a ring. We call it a confining soliton. We show that all eigenmodes have real and positive energy and thus it is stable.
