In this presentation, I review recent work with Mike Appels and David Kubiznak on thermodynamics of accelerating black holes. I start by reviewing the geometry of accelerating black holes, focussing on the conical deficit responsible for the 'force' causing the black hole to accelerate. Then I discuss black hole thermodynamics with conical deficits, showing how to include the tension of the deficit as a thermodynamic variable, and introducing a canonically conjugate {\it thermodynamic length}. Finally, I describe the thermodynamics of the slowly accelerating black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime.
