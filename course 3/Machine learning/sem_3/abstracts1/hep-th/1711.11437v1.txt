The symplectic analysis for the four dimensional Pontryagin and Euler invariants is performed within the Faddeev-Jackiw context. The Faddeev-Jackiw constraints and the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets are reported; we show that in spite of the Pontryagin and Euler classes give rise the same equations of motion, its respective symplectic structures are different to each other. In addition, a quantum state that solves the Faddeev-Jackiw constraints is found, and we show that the quantum states for these invariants are different to each other. Finally, we present some remarks and conclusions.
