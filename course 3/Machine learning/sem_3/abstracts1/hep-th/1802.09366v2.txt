We present an action of ultra-relativistic electrodynamics on a flat Carroll manifold. The model exhibits a couple of physical degrees of freedom per space-point. We observe that the action of the conformal Carroll algebra on the phase space is Hamiltonian in 4 space-time dimensions. Moreover the elements of the algebra give rise to an infinite number of conserved charges and the charge algebra is an exact realization of the kinematical algebra.
