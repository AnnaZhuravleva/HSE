We investigate whether the eternal chaotic inflation can be achieved when the weak gravity conjecture is taken into account. We show that even the assisted chaotic inflation with potential $\lambda\phi^4$ or $m^2\phi^2$ can not be eternal. The effective field theory description for the inflaton field breaks down before inflation reaches the eternal regime. We also find that the total number of e-folds is still bounded by the inflationary entropy for the assisted inflation.
