We study the fully nonlinear time evolution of a holographic system possessing a first order phase transition. The initial state is chosen in the spinodal region of the phase diagram, and includes an inhomogeneous perturbation in one of the field theory directions. The final state of the time evolution shows a clear phase separation in the form of domain formation. The results indicate the existence of a very rich class of inhomogeneous black hole solutions.
