In this article we establish the notion of classical Yangian symmetry for planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and for related planar gauge theories. After revisiting Yangian invariance for the equations of motion, we describe how the bi-local generators act on the action of the model such that the latter becomes exactly invariant. In particular, we elaborate on the relevance of the planar limit and how to act non-linearly with bi-local generators on the cyclic action.
