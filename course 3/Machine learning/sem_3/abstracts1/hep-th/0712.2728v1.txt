We discuss the limit T->0 of the relativistic ideal Fermi gas of luxons (particles moving with the speed of light) and tachyons (hypothetical particles faster than light) based on observations of our recent paper: K. Kowalski, J. Rembielinski and K.A. Smolinski, Phys. Rev. D, 76, 045018 (2007). For bradyons this limit is in fact the nonrelativistic one and therefore it is not studied herein.
