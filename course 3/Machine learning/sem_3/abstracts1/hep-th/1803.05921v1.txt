We analyze the Thermodynamics of massless bosonic systems in D-dimensional anti-de Sitter (adS) spacetime, considering scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The dynamics of the several fields of interest are described by P\"{o}schl-Teller effective potentials. The bosonic systems are quantized, with the determination of the associated energy spectra. From the microscopic description developed, a macroscopic thermodynamic treatment is proposed, where an effective volume in anti-de Sitter geometry is defined and a suitable thermodynamic limit is considered. Partition functions are constructed for the bosonic gases, allowing the determination of several thermodynamic quantities of interest. With the obtained results, general aspects of the Thermodynamics associated to the considered systems are described, including the observation of phase transitions in thermal adS spacetime.
