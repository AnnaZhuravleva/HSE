We analyse the signatures of brane inflation models with moduli stabilisation. These are hybrid inflation models with a non-trivial field-space metric which can induce complex trajectories for the fields during inflation. This in turn could lead to observable features on the power spectrum of the CMB fluctuations through departures from near scale invariance or the presence of isocurvature modes. We look specifically at multi-brane models in which the volume modulus also evolves. We find that the signatures are highly sensitive to the actual trajectories in field space, but their amplitudes are too small to be observable even for future high precision CMB experiments.
