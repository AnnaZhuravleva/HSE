The configurational entropy setup is employed to study dynamical tachyonic holographic AdS/QCD models. The phenomenology of light-flavour mesonic states is then corroborated by the Shannon's information. Tachyonic bulk corrections to the dynamical AdS/QCD show more dominant and abundant dual mesonic states in the 4D boundary QCD, when compared to the dual mesons in the standard dynamical AdS/QCD. Entropic Regge-like trajectories are also emulated.
