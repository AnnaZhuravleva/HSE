Families of vector-like deformed relativistic quantum phase spaces and corresponding realizations are analyzed. Method for general construction of star product is presented. Corresponding twist, expressed in terms of phase space coordinates, in Hopf algebroid sense is presented. General linear realizations are considered and corresponding twists, in terms of momenta and Poincar\'e-Weyl generators or $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ generators, are constructed and R-matrix is discussed. Classification of linear realizations leading to vector-like deformed phase spaces is given. There are 3 types of spaces: $i)$ commutative spaces, $ii)$ $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces and $iii)$ $\kappa$-Snyder spaces. Corresponding star products are $i)$ associative and commutative (but non-local), $ii)$ associative and non-commutative and $iii)$ non-associative and non-commutative, respectively. Twisted symmetry algebras are considered. Transposed twists and left-right dual algebras are presented. Finally, some physical applications are discussed.
