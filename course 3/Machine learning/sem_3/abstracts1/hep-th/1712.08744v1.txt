A single-sided boundary is introduced in the three-dimensional Chern-Simons model. It is shown that only one boundary condition for the gauge fields is possible, which plays the twofold role of chirality condition and bosonization rule for the two-dimensional Weyl fermion describing the degrees of freedom of the edge states of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect. It is derived the symmetry on the boundary which determines the effective two dimensional action, whose equation of motion coincides with the continuity equation of the Tomonaga-Luttinger theory. The role of Lorentz symmetry and of discrete symmetries on the boundary is also discussed.
