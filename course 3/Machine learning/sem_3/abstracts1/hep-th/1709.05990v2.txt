We calculate the quantum correlator in Schwarzschild black hole space-time. We perform the calculation for a scalar field in three different quantum states: Boulware, Unruh and Hartle-Hawking, and for points along a timelike circular geodesic. The results show that the correlator presents a global fourfold singularity structure, which is state-independent. Our results also show the different correlations in the three different quantum states arising in-between the singularities.
