We propose a connection between the butterfly velocity and the complexity growth rate in the context of thermodynamics of black holes where the cosmological constant is interpreted as thermodynamic pressure. Moreover, we study the bound on the diffusion coefficient by comparing with the bound on shear viscosity to entropy density ratio in order to obtain a relationship between the diffusion coefficient times pressure with the shear viscosity. Our result shows that there is the upper bound on complexity growth rate with respect to the shear viscosity and thermodynamical variables.
