The renormalization of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super Yang-Mills theory with the presence of the local composite operators $AA$, $A_\mu \gamma_\mu \lambda$ and $\bar{\lambda}\lambda$ is analyzed in the Wess-Zumino gauge, employing the Landau condition. An all-orders proof of the renormalizability of the theory is given by means of the Algebraic Renormalization procedure. Only three renormalization constants are needed, which can be identified with the coupling constant, gauge field, and gluino renormalization. The non-renormalization theorem of the gluon--ghost--anti-ghost vertex in the Landau gauge is shown to remain valid in $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super Yang-Mills with the presence of the local composite operators. Moreover, due to the non-linear realization of the supersymmetry in the Wess-Zumino gauge, the renormalization factor of the gauge field turns out to be different from that of the gluino.
