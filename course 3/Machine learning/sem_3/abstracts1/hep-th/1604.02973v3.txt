In this paper, we take cosmological constant as a thermodynamical pressure and it's conjugate quantity as a thermodynamical volume. This expression help us to investigate the phase transition and holographic heat engine. So, in order to have Van der Waals fluid behaviour in Horava -Lifshitz (HL) black hole, we modified the solution of such black hole with some cosmology ansatz. Also from holographic heat engine, we obtain Carnot efficiency for the HL black hole. The phase transition of the system lead us to investigate the stability condition for the corresponding black hole. In that case, we show that the stability exist only in special region of black hole.
