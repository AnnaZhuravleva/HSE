We construct a relation between the Aretakis charge of any extreme black hole and the Newman-Penrose charge. This is achieved by constructing a conformal correspondence between extreme black holes and what we call weakly asymptotically flat space-times. Under this correspondence the Newman-Penrose charge of the weakly asymptotically flat space-time maps on to the Aretakis charge of the extreme black hole. Furthermore, we generalise the conformal isometry displayed by the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution to a novel conformal symmetry that acts within a class of static STU supergravity black holes.
