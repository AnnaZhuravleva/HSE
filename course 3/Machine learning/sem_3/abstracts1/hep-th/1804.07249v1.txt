This paper is a study of a spacelike-timelike conformal correspondence in QCD. When the times at vertices are fixed in an A_+ = 0 gauge calculation the distribution of gluons in a highly virtual decay have an exact correspondence with the gluons in the lightcone wavefunction of a high energy dipole with the identification of angles in the timelike case and transverse coordinates in the lightcone wavefunction. Divergences show up when the time integrals are done. A procedure for dropping these divergences, analogous to the Gell-Mann Low procedure in QED, allows one to define a conformal QCD, at least through NLO. Possible uses of such a conformal QCD are discussed.
