In this paper we study non-commutative massive unquenched Chern-Simons matter theory using its gravity dual. We construct this novel background by applying a TsT-transformation on the known parent commutative solution. We discuss several aspects of this solution to the Type IIA supergravity equations of motion and, amongst others, check that it preserves ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. We then turn our attention to applications and investigate how dynamical flavor degrees of freedom affect numerous observables of interest. Our framework can be regarded as a key step towards the construction of holographic quantum Hall states on a non-commutative plane.
