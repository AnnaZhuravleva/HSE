We revisit the problem of constraining the weak field limit of the gravitational lagrangian from S-matrix properties. From unitarity and Lorentz invariance of the S-matrix of massless gravitons, we derive on-shell gauge invariance to consist on the transverse part of the linearised diffeomorphisms group. Moreover, by looking to the interaction between sources, we conclude that there exist only two possible lagrangians that lead to a well-defined covariant interaction, corresponding to the weak field limits of General Relativity and Unimodular Gravity. Additionally, this result confirms the equivalence of the S-matrix of both theories around flat space-time.
