We consider the general $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4,$ $d{=}\,3$ Galilean superalgebra with arbitrary central charges and study its dynamical realizations. Using the nonlinear realization techniques, we introduce a class of actions for $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ three-dimensional non-relativistic superparticle, such that they are linear in the central charge Maurer-Cartan one-forms. As a prerequisite to the quantization, we analyze the phase space constraints structure of our model for various choices of the central charges. The first class constraints generate gauge transformations, involving fermionic $\kappa$-gauge transformations. The quantization of the model gives rise to the collection of free $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$, $d{=}\,3$ Galilean superfields, which can be further employed, e.g., for description of three-dimensional non-relativistic $\mathcal{N}{=}\,4$ supersymmetric theories.
