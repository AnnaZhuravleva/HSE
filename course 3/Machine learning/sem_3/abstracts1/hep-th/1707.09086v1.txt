We present a BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism for the two-form gauge fields. A set of vector gaugeon fields is introduced as a quantum gauge freedom. One of the gaugeon fields satisfies a higher derivative field equation; this property is necessary to change the gauge-fixing parameter of the two-form gauge field. A naive Lagrangian for the vector gaugeon fields is itself invariant under a gauge transformation for the vector gaugeon field. The Lagrangian of our theory includes the gauge-fixing terms for the gaugeon fields and corresponding Faddeev--Popov ghosts terms.
