There are two sets of orbits of the Virasoro group which admit a Kahler structure. We consider the construction of coherent states on these orbits which furnish unitary representations of the group. The procedure is equivalent to geometric quantization using a holomorphic polarization. We explore some of the properties of these states, including the definition of symbols corresponding to operators and their star products. The possibility of applying this to gravity in 2+1 dimensions is also briefly discussed.
