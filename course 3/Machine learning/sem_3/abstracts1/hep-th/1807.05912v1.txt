A modified quantum kinetic equation which takes account of the noninertial features of rotating frame is proposed. The vector and axial-vector field components of the Wigner function for chiral fluids are worked out in a semiclassical scheme. It is demonstrated that the chiral currents and energy-momentum tensor computed by means of them are consistent with the hydrodynamical results. A new semiclassical covariant chiral transport equation is established by inspecting the equations satisfied by the chiral vector fields. It uniquely provides a new three-dimensional semiclassical chiral kinetic theory possessing a Coriolis force term. The particle number and current densities deduced from this transport equation satisfy the anomalous continuity equation and generate the magnetic and vortical effects correctly.
