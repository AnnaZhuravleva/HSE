We study the $\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal Chern-Simons matter field theory (the ABJM theory) conformally coupled to a Lorentzian, curved background spacetime. To support rigid supersymmetry, such backgrounds have to admit twistor spinors. At the classical level, the symmetry of the theory can be described by a conformal symmetry superalgebra. We show that the full $\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal algebra persists at the quantum level using the BV-BRST method.
