We study magnetically-charged supersymmetric flow equations in a consistent truncation of gauged $\mathcal{N}\,=\,8$ supergravity in five dimensions. This truncation gives gauged $\mathcal{N}\,=\,2$ supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets and two hypermultiplets. We derive magnetically-charged flow equations of scalar fields from vector and hypermultiplets. It turns out that there could be only up to two nontrivial scalar fields out of eight from the hypermultiplets. Along the way, we recover some known $AdS_3$ solutions of the flow equations.
