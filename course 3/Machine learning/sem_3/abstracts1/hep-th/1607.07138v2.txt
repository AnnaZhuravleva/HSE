The Parikh-Kraus-Wilczeck tunneling radiation of black hole involving a $f(R)$ global monopole is considered based on the generalized uncertainty principle. The influences from global monopole, $f(R)$ gravity and the corrections to the uncertainty appear in the expression of black hole entropy difference. It is found that the global monopole and the revision of general relativity both hinder the black hole from emitting the photons. The two parts as corrections to the uncertainty make the entropy difference of this kind of black hole larger or smaller respectively.
