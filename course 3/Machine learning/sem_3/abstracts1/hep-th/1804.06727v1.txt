We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy in the Rindler-AdS space-time to obtain an exact solution for the corresponding minimal surface.   Moreover, the holographic entanglement entropy of the charged single accelerated AdS Black holes in four dimensions is investigated. We obtain the volume of the codimension one-time slice in the bulk geometry enclosed by the minimal surface for both the Rindler-AdS space-time and the charged accelerated AdS Black holes in the bulk. It is shown that the holographic entanglement entropy and the volume enclosed by the minimal hyper-surface in both the Rindler space-time and the charged single accelerated AdS Black holes (C-metric) in the bulk decrease with increasing acceleration parameter.
