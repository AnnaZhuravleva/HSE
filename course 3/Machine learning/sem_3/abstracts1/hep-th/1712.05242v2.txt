We exploit the theoretical strength of (anti-)chiral superfield approach (ACSA) to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism to derive the proper nilpotent (anti-) BRST symmetry transformations for any arbitrary $D$-dimensional interacting non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory where there is an $SU(N)$ gauge invariant coupling between the gauge field and the Dirac fields. We derive the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and establish their nilpotency and absolute anticommutativity properties within the framework of ACSA to BRST formalism. The clinching proof of absolute anticommutativity property of the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges is a novel result in view of the fact that we consider, in our present endeavor, only the (anti-)chiral super expansions of the superfields that are defined on the $(D, 1)$-dimensional super-submanifolds of the general $(D, 2)$-dimensional supermanifold on which our $D$-dimensional ordinary interacting non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory is generalized. The latter supermanifold is parameterized by the superspace coordinates $Z^M = (x^\mu, \theta, \bar\theta)$ where $x^\mu \;(\mu = 0, 1,...D-1)$ are the bosonic $D$-dimensional coordinates and a pair of Grassmannian variables $(\theta, \bar\theta)$ of the superspace coordinates ($Z^{M}$) satisfy the standard (fermionic) relationships: $\theta^2 = \bar\theta^2 = 0, \theta\bar\theta + \bar\theta\theta = 0$.
