We propose a regular classical field theory realisation of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati mechanism by considering our universe to be the four-dimensional core of a seven dimensional 't Hooft-Polyakov hypermonopole. We show the existence of metastable gravitons trapped in the core. Their mass spectrum is discrete, positive definite, and computed for various values of the field coupling constants: the resulting Newton gravity law is seven-dimensional at small and large distances but can be made four-dimensional on intermediate length scales. There is no need of a cosmological constant in the bulk, the spacetime is asymptotically flat and of infinite volume in the extra-dimensions. Confinement is achieved through the local positive curvature of the extra-dimensions induced by the monopole-forming fields and for natural values of the coupling constants of order unity.
