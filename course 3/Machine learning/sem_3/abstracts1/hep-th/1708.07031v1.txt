With proposing a unified description of the fields variation at the level of generating functional, we obtain a new identity for the quark-gluon interaction vertex based on gauge symmetry, which is similar to the Slavnov-Taylor Identities(STIs) based on the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin transformation. With these identities, we find that in Landau gauge, the dressing function of the ghost propagator approaches to a constant as its momentum goes to zero, which provides a strong constraint on the infrared behaviour of ghost propagator.
