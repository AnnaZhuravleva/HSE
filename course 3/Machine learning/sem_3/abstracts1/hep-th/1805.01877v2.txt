We discuss a new interaction for chiral models in four-dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supergavity. It contains a new arbitrary function in addition to the K\"ahler potential and superpotential. Its features include linearly realized off-shell supersymmetry, K\"ahler-Weyl invariance and broken supersymmetry. The corresponding scalar potential is augmented by the arbitrary function which allows freedom in constructing low-energy phenomenological models and inflationary models rooted in supergravity.
