We review some aspects of the cutting and gluing law in local quantum field theory. In particular, we emphasize the description of gluing by a path integral over a space of polarized boundary conditions, which are given by leaves of some Lagrangian foliation in the phase space. We think of this path integral as a non-local $(d-1)$-dimensional gluing theory associated to the parent local $d$-dimensional theory. We describe various properties of this procedure and spell out conditions under which symmetries of the parent theory lead to symmetries of the gluing theory. The purpose of this paper is to set up a playground for the companion paper where these techniques are applied to obtain new results in supersymmetric theories.
