Rotating black holes are algebraically special solutions to the vacuum Einstein equation. Using properties of the algebraically special solutions we construct the dual fluid, which flows on black hole horizon. An explicit form of the Kerr solution allows us to write an explicit dual fluid solution and investigate its stability using energy balance equation. We show that the dual fluid is stable because of high algebraic speciality of the Kerr solution.
