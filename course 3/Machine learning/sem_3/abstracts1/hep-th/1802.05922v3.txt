We have recently undergone an analysis of gravitational theories as defined in first order formalism, where the metric and the connection are treated as independent fields. The physical meaning of the connection field has historically been somewhat elusive. In this paper, a complete spin analysis of the torsionless connection field is performed, and its consequences are explored. The main properties of a hypothetical consistent truncation of the theory are discussed as well.
