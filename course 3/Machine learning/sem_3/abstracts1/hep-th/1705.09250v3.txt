The AdS/CFT duality maps supersymmetric heavy operators with conformal dimension of the order of the central charge to asymptotically AdS supergravity solutions. We show that by studying the quadratic fluctuations around such backgrounds it is possible to derive the 4-point correlators of two light and two heavy states in the supergravity approximation. We provide an explicit example in the AdS$_3$ setup relevant for the duality with the D1-D5 CFT. Contrary to previously studied examples, the supergravity correlator derived in this work differs from the result obtained at the CFT orbifold point. Our method bypasses the difficulties of applying the standard Witten's diagrams approach to correlators with operators of large conformal dimension and also avoids some technical steps that have made the computation of dynamical 4-point correlators in the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ context unfeasible until now.
