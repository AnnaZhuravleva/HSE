We consider static spherically symmetric solutions of a general scalar field theory with non-standard kinetic energy coupled to gravity with a view to explain dark matter halos as a coherent state of the scalar field. Consistent solutions are found with a smooth scalar profile which can describe observed rotation curves. Some of the solutions have negative scalar energy density near the origin though the total energy is positive definite. The solutions with positive energy density everywhere have a steeper rotation curve near the origin than those that don't. We also reconsider the no scalar hair theorems for black holes with emphasis on asymptotic boundary conditions and super-luminal propagation. Some modifications and extensions of previous analyses are discussed.
