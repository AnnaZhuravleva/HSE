We investigate whether the Standard Model, within the accuracy of current experimental measurements, satisfies the Hodge duality condition introduced and studied in Dabrowski, D'Andrea, Sitarz, Lett Math Phys (2018) 108:1323. We show that the neutrino and quark mass-mixing and the difference of fermion masses is necessary for this property. We demonstrate that the current data supports the new geometric feature of the Standard Model, Hodge duality, provided that all neutrinos are massive.
