The interiors of Schwarzschild black-holes border on space-like singularities which are considered to serve as geodesic information sinks. It is shown that these sinks are completely decoupled from local quantum physics by a dynamically generated Dirichlet boundary. Towards this boundary, local information carriers become free and receive vanishing probabilistic support. Hence information cannot leak and information processing in black-hole interiors is free from paradoxes.
