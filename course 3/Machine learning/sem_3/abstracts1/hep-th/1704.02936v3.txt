We present the first exact calculations of the time dependence of causal correlations in driven nonequilibrium states in (2+1)-dimensional systems using holography. Comparing exact results with those obtained from simple prototype geometries that are parametrized only by a time dependent temperature, we find that the universal slowly varying features are controlled just by the pump duration and the initial and final temperatures only. We provide numerical evidence that the locations of the event and apparent horizons in the dual geometries can be deduced from the nonequilibrium causal correlations without any prior knowledge of the dual gravity theory.
