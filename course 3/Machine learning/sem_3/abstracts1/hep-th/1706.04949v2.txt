We consider the lagrangian description of Argyres-Douglas theories of type $A_{2N-1}$, which is a $SU(N)$ gauge theory with an adjoint and one fundamental flavor. An appropriate reformulation allows us to map the moduli space of vacua across the duality, and to dimensionally reduce. Going down to three dimensions, we find that the adjoint SQCD "abelianizes": in the infrared it is equivalent to a $\mathcal{N}=4$ linear quiver theory. Moreover, we study the mirror dual: using a monopole duality to "sequentially confine" quivers tails with balanced nodes, we show that the mirror RG flow lands on $\mathcal{N}=4$ SQED with $N$ flavors. These results provide a physical derivation of previous proposals for the three dimensional mirror of AD theories.
