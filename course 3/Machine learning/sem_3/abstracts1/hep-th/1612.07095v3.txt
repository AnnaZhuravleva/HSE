The gauged model of Siegel type chiral boson is considered. It has been shown that the action of gauged model of Floreanini-Jackiw (FJ) type chiral boson is contained in it in an interesting manner. A BRST invariant action corresponding to the action of gauged FJ type chiral boson has been formulated using Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky based improved Fujiwara, Igarishi and Kubo (FIK) formalism. An alternative quantization of the gauge symmetric action has been made with a Lorentz gauge and an attempt has been made to establish the equivalence between the gauge symmetric version of the extended phase space and original gauge non-invariant version of the usual phase space.
