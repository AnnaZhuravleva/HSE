The dynamics of the Goldstino mode of spontaneously broken supersymmetry is universal, being fully determined by the non-linearly realized symmetry. We investigate the small-field limit of this theory. This model non-linearly realizes an alternative supersymmetry algebra with vanishing anti-commutators between the fermionic generators, much like an internal supersymmetry. This Goldstino theory is akin to the Galilean scalar field theory that arises as the small-field limit of Dirac-Born-Infeld theory and non-linearly realizes the Galilean symmetry. Indeed, the small-field Goldstino is the partner of a complex Galilean scalar field under conventional supersymmetry. We close with the generalization to extended internal supersymmetry and a discussion of its higher-dimensional origin.
