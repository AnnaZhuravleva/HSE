We obtain an exact solution of the supergravity equations of motion in which the four-dimensional observed universe is one of a number of colliding D3-branes in a Calabi-Yau background. The collision results in the ten-dimensional spacetime splitting into disconnected regions, bounded by curvature singularities. However, near the D3-branes the metric remains static during and after the collision. We also obtain a general class of solutions representing $p$-brane collisions in arbitrary dimensions, including one in which the universe ends with the mutual annihilation of a positive-tension and negative-tension 3-brane.
