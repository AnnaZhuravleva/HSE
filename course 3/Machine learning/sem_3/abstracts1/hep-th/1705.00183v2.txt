We further the investigation on the Parikh-Kraus-Wilczeck tunneling radiation of Kehagias-Sfetsos black hole under the generalized uncertainty principle. We obtain the entropy difference involving the influence from the inequality. The two terms as generalizations of the Heisenberg's uncertainty promote or retard the emission of this kind of black holes respectively.
