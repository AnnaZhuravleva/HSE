We establish the action of the three-dimensional non-Abelian bosonization dualities in the presence of a boundary, which supports a non-anomalous two-dimensional theory. In particular, we generalize a prescriptive method for assigning duality consistent boundary conditions used originally for Abelian dualities to dual non-Abelian Chern-Simons-matter theories with $SU$ and $U$ gauge groups and fundamental matter sectors. The cases of single species matter sectors and those with both scalars and fermions in the dual theories are considered. Generalization of our methods to $SO$ and $USp$ Chern-Simons theories is also discussed.
