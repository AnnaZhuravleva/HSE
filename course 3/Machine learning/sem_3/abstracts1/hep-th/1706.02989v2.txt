We study structure constants of local operators inserted on the Wilson loop in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. We compute the structure constants in the SU(2) sector at tree level using the correspondence between operators on the Wilson loop and the open spin chain. The results are interpreted as the summation over all possible ways of changing the signs of magnon momenta in the hexagon form factors. This is consistent with a holographic description of the correlator as the cubic open string vertex, which consists of one hexagonal patch and three boundaries. We then conjecture that a similar expression should hold also at finite coupling.
