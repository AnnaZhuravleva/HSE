We present a first attempt to derive the full (type-A and type-B) Weyl anomaly of four dimensional conformal higher spin (CHS) fields in a holographic way. We obtain the type-A and type-B Weyl anomaly coefficients for the whole family of 4D CHS fields from the one-loop effective action for massless higher spin (MHS) Fronsdal fields evaluated on a 5D bulk Poincar\'e-Einstein metric with an Einstein metric on its conformal boundary. To gain access to the type-B anomaly coefficient we assume, for practical reasons, a Lichnerowicz-type coupling of the bulk Fronsdal fields with the bulk background Weyl tensor. Remarkably enough, our holographic findings under this simplifying assumption are certainly not unknown: they match the results previously found on the boundary counterpart under the assumption of factorization of the CHS higher-derivative kinetic operator into Laplacians of "partially massless" higher spins on Einstein backgrounds.
