This paper defines a complexity between states in quantum field theory by introducing a Finsler structure based on ladder operators (the generalization of creation and annihilation operators). Two simple models are shown as examples to clarify the differences between complexity and other conceptions such as complexity of formation and entanglement entropy. When it is applied into thermofield double (TFD) states in $d$-dimensional conformal field theory, results show that the complexity density between them and corresponding vacuum states are finite and proportional to $T^{d-1}$, where $T$ is the temperature of TFD state. Especially, a proof is given to show that fidelity susceptibility of a TFD state is equivalent to the complexity between it and corresponding vacuum state, which gives an explanation why they may share the same object in holographic duality. Some enlightenments to holographic conjectures of complexity are also discussed.
