We analyze the consistency of a recently proposed real tachyon vacuum solution without square roots in open bosonic string field theory. We show that the equation of motion contracted with the solution itself is satisfied. Additionally, by expanding the solution in the basis of the curly $\mathcal{L}_0$ and the traditional $L_0$ eigenstates, we evaluate numerically the vacuum energy and obtain a result in agreement with Sen's conjecture.
