In this review, we give a brief introduction on the aspects of some extra dimension models and the five-dimensional thick brane models in extended theories of gravity. First, we briefly introduce the Kaluza-Klein theory, the domain wall model, the large extra dimension model, and the warped extra dimension models. Then some thick brane solutions in extended theories of gravity are reviewed. Finally, localization of bulk matter fields on thick branes is discussed.
