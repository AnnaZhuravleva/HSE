We discuss the different forms of the functional RG equation and their relation to each other. In particular we suggest a generalized background field version that is close in spirit to the Polchinski equation as an alternative to the Wetterich equation to study Weinberg's asymptotic safety program for defining quantum gravity, and argue that the former is better suited for this purpose. Using the heat kernel expansion and proper time regularization we find evidence in support of this program in agreement with previous work.
