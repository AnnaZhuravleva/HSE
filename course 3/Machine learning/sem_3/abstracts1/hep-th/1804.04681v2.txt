We derive a general local form for supersymmetric solutions of six-dimensional (1,0) supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of tensor multiplets. We consider some special cases in which the resulting equations can be solved explicitly. In particular we derive black string solutions and calculate their entropy. Upon reducing to five dimensions they yield spinning black hole solutions. We also discuss BPS pp-waves and black string solutions with traveling waves. Lastly, as an application, we study the attractor mechanism in this theory.
