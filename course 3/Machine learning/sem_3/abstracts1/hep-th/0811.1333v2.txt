We investigate the restrictions on the equation-of-state parameter of phantom cosmology, due to the minimum quantum gravitational requirements. We find that for all the examined $w_\Lambda(z)$-parametrizations and for arbitrary phantom potentials and spatial curvature, the phantom equation-of-state parameter is not restricted at all. This is in radical contrast with the quintessence paradigm, and makes phantom cosmology more robust and capable of constituting the underlying mechanism for dark energy.
