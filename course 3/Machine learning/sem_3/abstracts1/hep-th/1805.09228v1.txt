We discuss local supercurrents as sources of the super-Einstein equations in the superconformal approach in the old and new minimal (auxiliary fields) formulation. Modifications of the Ward identity giving the covariant divergence of the Einstein multiplet are considered in presence of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term. Curvature multiplets can be used as alternative to the gravitino variation in the search for rigid supersymmetric curved backgrounds.
