We have extended the results of arXiv:1704.06076 upto second subleading order in an expansion around large dimension D. Unlike the previous case, there are non-trivial metric corrections at this order. Due to our `background-covariant' formalism, the dependence on Ricci and the Riemann curvature tensor of the background is manifest here. The gravity system is dual to a dynamical membrane coupled with a velocity field. The dual membrane is embedded in some smooth background geometry that also satisfies the Einstein equation in presence of cosmological constant. We explicitly computed the corrections to the equation governing the membrane-dynamics. Our results match with earlier derivations in appropriate limits. We calculated the spectrum of QNM from our membrane equations and matched them against similar results derived from gravity.
