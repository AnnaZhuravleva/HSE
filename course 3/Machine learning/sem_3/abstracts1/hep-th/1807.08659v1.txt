We discuss observables of an equivariant extension of the A-model in the framework of the AKSZ construction. We introduce the A-model observables, a class of observables that are homotopically equivalent to the canonical AKSZ observables but are better behaved in the gauge fixing. We discuss them for two different choices of gauge fixing: the first one is conjectured to compute the correlators of the A-model with target the Marsden-Weinstein reduced space; in the second one we recover the topological Yang-Mills action coupled with A-model so that the A-model observables are closed under supersymmetry.
