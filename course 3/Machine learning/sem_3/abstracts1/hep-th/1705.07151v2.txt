We revisit the perturbative S-matrix of c=1 string theory from the worldsheet perspective. We clarify the origin of the leg pole factors, the non-analyticity of the string amplitudes, and the validity as well as limitations of earlier computations based on resonance momenta. We compute the tree level 4-point amplitude and the genus one 2-point reflection amplitude by numerically integrating Virasoro conformal blocks with DOZZ structure constants on the sphere and on the torus, with sufficiently generic complex Liouville momenta, and find agreement with known answers from the c=1 matrix model.
