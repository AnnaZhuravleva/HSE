In this paper we find and explore the correspondence between quivers, torus knots, and combinatorics of counting paths. Our first result pertains to quiver representation theory -- we find explicit formulae for classical generating functions and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of an arbitrary symmetric quiver. We then focus on quivers corresponding to $(r,s)$ torus knots and show that their classical generating functions, in the extremal limit and framing $rs$, are generating functions of lattice paths under the line of the slope $r/s$. Generating functions of such paths satisfy extremal A-polynomial equations, which immediately follows after representing them in terms of the Duchon grammar. Moreover, these extremal A-polynomial equations encode Donaldson-Thomas invariants, which provides an interesting example of algebraicity of generating functions of these invariants. We also find a quantum generalization of these statements, i.e. a relation between motivic quiver generating functions, quantum extremal knot invariants, and $q$-weighted path counting. Finally, in the case of the unknot, we generalize this correspondence to the full HOMFLY-PT invariants and counting of Schr{\"o}der paths.
