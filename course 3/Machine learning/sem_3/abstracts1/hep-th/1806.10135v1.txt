Topological excitations of gauge fields exhibit a discrete behavior, which arises from the global structure. We calculate the Chern numbers of higher dimensional Taub-NUT and Taub-Bolt instantons and find the winding numbers, which classify the U(1)$-$bundles that harbor Maxwell dyons. Our results can be written in general for any even dimension and apply for many different theories of gravity. We illustrate this point by focusing on Lovelock gravity. The magnetic flux is found to be a pure topological excitation whereas the electric flux is indirectly indexed by the magnetic counterpart. We argue that this last result is a consequence of the path integral approach to quantum gravity.
