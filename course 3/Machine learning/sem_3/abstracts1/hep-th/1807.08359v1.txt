We propose a bicosmology model which is the classical analog of noncommutative quantum mechanics. From this point of view the sources of the modified FRW equations are dark energy ones governed by a Chapligyn's equation state. The parameters of noncommutativity $\theta$ and $B$ are interpreted in terms of the Planck area and a like-magnetic field, presumably the magnetic seed of magnetogenesis.
