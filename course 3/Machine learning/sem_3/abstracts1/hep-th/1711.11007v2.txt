Free mixed-symmetry continuous-spin fields propagating in AdS(5) space and flat R(4,1) space are studied. In the framework of a light-cone gauge formulation of relativistic dynamics, we build simple actions for such fields. Realization of relativistic symmetries on space of light-cone gauge mixed-symmetry continuous-spin fields is also found. Interrelations between constant parameters entering the light-cone gauge actions and eigenvalues of the Casimir operators of space-time symmetry algebras are obtained. Using these interrelations and requiring that the field dynamics in AdS(5) be irreducible and classically unitary, we derive restrictions on the constant parameters and eigenvalues of the 2nd-order Casimir operator of the so(4,2) algebra.
