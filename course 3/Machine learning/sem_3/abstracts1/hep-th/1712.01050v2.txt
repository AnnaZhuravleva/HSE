Partially massless in three dimensions is revisited and its relationship with the self-dual massive gravity is considered. The only mode of the partially massless is shown explicitly through of an action for a scalar field on (A)dS background. This fact can be generalized to higher dimensions. This degree of freedom is altered when a triadic Chern-Simons is introduced, giving rise to the self dual massive gravity on (A)dS background. We present another physical system with partially massless symmetry and its connection with topologically massive gravity is discussed.
