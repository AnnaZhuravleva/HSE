Localized states in relativistic quantum field theories are usually considered as problematic, because of their seemingly strange (non covariant) behavior under Lorentz transformations, and because they can spread faster than light. We point out that a careful quantum field theoretic analysis in which we distinguish between basis position states and wave packet states clarifies the issue of Lorentz covariance. The issue of causality is resolved by observing that superluminal transmission of information cannot be achieved by such wave packets. Within this context it follows that the Reef-Schlieder theorem, which proves that localized states can exhibit influence on each other over space like distances, does not imply that such states cannot exist in quantum field theory.
