Making use of the T-duality symmetry of superstring theory, and of the double geometry from Double Field Theory, we argue that cosmological singularities of a homogeneous and isotropic universe disappear. In fact, an apparent big bang singularity in Einstein gravity corresponds to a universe expanding to infinite size in the dual dimensions.
