We propose a nilpotent ${\cal N}=1$ tensor multiplet describing two fields, which are the Goldstino and the axion, the latter being realised in terms of the field strength of a gauge two-form. This supersymmetric multiplet is formulated in terms of a deformed real linear superfield, subject to a cubic nilpotency condition. Its couplings to a super Yang-Mills multiplet and supergravity are presented. To define a nilpotent tensor multiplet in the locally supersymmetric case, one has to make use of either real or complex three-form supergravity theories, which are variant realisations of the old minimal formulation for ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity.
