We propose a procedure for the renormalization of Casimir energy, that is based on the implicit versions of standard steps of renormalization procedure --- regularization, subtraction and removing the regularization. The proposed procedure is based on the calculation of a set of convergent sums, which are related to the original divergent sum for the non-renormalized Casimir energy. Then one constructs a linear equations system, that connects this set of convergent sums with the renormalized Casimir energy, which is a solution to this equations system. This procedure slightly reduces the indeterminancy that arises in standard procedure when we choose the particular regularization and the explicit form of counterterm. The proposed procedure is more efficient from the computational point of view than the standard one. It can be applied not only for systems with the explicit transcendental equation for the spectrum, but also for systems with the spectrum that can be obtained only numerically.
