The singularity structure of the Coulomb and Higgs branches of good $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ circular quiver gauge theories (CQGTs) with unitary gauge groups is studied. The central method employed is the Kraft--Procesi transition. CQGTs are described as a generalisation of a class of linear quivers. This class degenerates into the familiar class $T_{\rho}^{\sigma}(SU(N))$ in the linear case, however the circular case does not have the degeneracy and so the class of CQGTs contains many more theories and much more structure. We describe a collection of good, unitary, CQGTs from which the entire class can be found using Kraft--Procesi transitions. The singularity structure of a general member of this collection is fully determined, encompassing the singularity structure of a generic CQGT. Higher-level Hasse diagrams are introduced in order to write the results compactly. In higher-level Hasse diagrams, single nodes represent lattices of nilpotent orbit Hasse diagrams and edges represent traversing structure between lattices. The results generalise the case of linear quiver moduli spaces which are known to be nilpotent varieties of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$.
