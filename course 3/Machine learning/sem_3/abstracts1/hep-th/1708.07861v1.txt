We propose a new duality between two 3d $\mathcal{N}=8$ superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theories: the $U(3)_1 \times U(3)_{-1}$ ABJM theory and a theory consisting of the product between the $\left(SU(2)_3\times SU(2)_{-3}\right)/\mathbb{Z}_2$ BLG theory and a free ${\cal N} = 8$ theory of eight real scalars and eight Majorana fermions. As evidence supporting this duality, we show that the moduli spaces, superconformal indices, $S^3$ partition functions, and certain OPE coefficients of BPS operators in the two theories agree.
