A scenario of space-time emergence from individual interactions at the quantum level requires correlations encoding a scalar product, for large-scale emergence of space orientation. In D=4 the candidate is spin 1/2 correlations, indicating complementarity to be crucial in models of correlations, entangling processes and thermalization giving rise to space-time. We argue for the relevance of identifying fundamental interactions and of analysing how they might give rise to space-time emergence. We discuss how to model complementarity, contrasting with how it is absent in the wave function due to a restriction to classically simultaneous variables. In modelling theory after measurements, we suggest an extended model to contain `orthogonal' information existing in parallel, in a vector analogy. We also give a rough conjecture of what would be required of entangling processes for equilibration of correlations between vacuum fluctuations, only briefly mentioning effects of acceleration.
