We systematically present a new approach for studying the coupled linear transport of holographic systems. In this approach, the set of equations for the linear perturbations can be reduced to a first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation expressed as the radial (renormalization group) flow equation of the transport matrices. As an important application, we use this approach to compute the DC and AC conductivities of a holographic model with momentum dissipation, which can be easily read off from the nonlinear flow equations. This method also works for transport in the presence of an external magnetic field.
