In this paper, we will compute the holographic complexity (dual to a volume in AdS), holographic fidelity susceptibility and the holographic entanglement entropy (dual to an area in AdS) in a two-dimensional version of $AdS$ which is dual to open strings. We will explicitly demonstrate that these quantities are well defined, and then argue that a relation for fidelity susceptibility and time should hold in general due to the $AdS_2$ version of the classical Kepler's principle. We will demonstrate that it holds for $AdS_2$ solution as well as conformal copies metrics in bulk theory of a prescribed dual conformal invariant quantum mechanics which have been obtained in open string theory. We will also show that hierarchical UV/IR mixing exists in boundary string theory through the holographic bulk picture.
