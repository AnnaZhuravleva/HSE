We discuss about the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST), anti-BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations and derive their corresponding conserved charges in the case of a two (1+1)-dimensional (2D) self-interacting non-Abelian gauge theory (without any interaction with matter fields). We point out a set of novel features that emerge out in the BRST and co-BRST analysis of the above 2D gauge theory. The algebraic structures of the symmetry operators (and corresponding conserved charges) and their relationship with the cohomological operators of differential geometry are established, too. To be more precise, we demonstrate the existence of a single Lagrangian density that respects the continuous symmetries which obey proper algebraic structure of the cohomological operators of differential geometry. We lay emphasis on the existence and properties of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions in the context of (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations and pinpoint their differences and similarities. All the observations, connected with the (anti-)co-BRST symmetries, are completely novel.
