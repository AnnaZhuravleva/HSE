In this work we discuss the properties of the solutions of the Dirac equation in presence of an uniform background magnetic field. In particular we focus on the nature of the solutions, their ortho-normality properties and how these solutions depend on the choice of the vector potential giving rise to the magnetic field. We explicitly calculate the spin-sum of the solutions and using it we calculate the propagator of the electron in presence of an uniform background magnetic field.
