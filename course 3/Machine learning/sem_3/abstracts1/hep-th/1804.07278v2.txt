The central discovery of $2d$ conformal theory was holomorphic factorization, which expressed correlation functions through bilinear combinations of conformal blocks, which are easily cut and joined without a need to sum over the entire huge Hilbert space of states. Somewhat similar, when a link diagram is glued from tangles, the link polynomial is a multilinear combination of {\it tangle blocks} summed over just a few representations of intermediate states. This turns to be a powerful approach because the same tangles appear as constituents of very different knots so that they can be extracted from simpler cases and used in more complicated ones. So far this method has been technically developed only in the case of arborescent knots, but, in fact, it is much more general. We begin a systematic study of tangle blocks by detailed consideration of some archetypical examples, which actually lead to non-trivial results, far beyond the reach of other techniques. At the next level, the tangle calculus is about gluing of tangles, i.e. functorial mappings from ${\rm Hom}({\rm tangles})$, and its main advantage is an explicit realization of multiplicative composition structure, which is partly obscured in traditional knot theory.
