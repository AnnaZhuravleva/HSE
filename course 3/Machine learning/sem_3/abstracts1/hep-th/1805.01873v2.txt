We present the powerful module-intersection integration-by-parts (IBP) method, suitable for multi-loop and multi-scale Feynman integral reduction. Utilizing modern computational algebraic geometry techniques, this new method successfully trims traditional IBP systems dramatically to much simpler integral-relation systems on unitarity cuts. We demonstrate the power of this method by explicitly carrying out the complete analytic reduction of two-loop five-point non-planar hexagon-box integrals, with degree-four numerators, to a basis of $73$ master integrals.
