We consider the Sen limit of several global F-theory compactifications, some of which exhibit an MSSM-like spectrum. We show that these indeed have a consistent limit where they can be viewed as resulting from an intersecting D-brane configuration in type IIB. We discuss the match of the fluxes and the chiral spectrum in detail. We find that some D5-tadpole canceling gauge fluxes do not lift to harmonic vertical four-form fluxes in F-theory. We discuss the connection between splitting of curves at weak coupling and remnant discrete symmetries.
