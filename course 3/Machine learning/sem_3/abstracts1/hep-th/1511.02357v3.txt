We present a comprehensive method for the evaluation of a vast class of integrals representing 3-point functions of conformal field theories in momentum space. The method leads to analytic, closed-form expressions for all scalar and tensorial 3-point functions of operators with integer dimensions in any spacetime dimension. In particular, this encompasses all 3-point functions of the stress tensor, conserved currents and marginal scalar operators.
