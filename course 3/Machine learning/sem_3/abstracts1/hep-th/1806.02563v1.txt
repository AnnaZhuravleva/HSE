In this note we derive Dayson-Schwinger hierarchy of the equations for the correlators of reggeized gluon fields in the framework of Lipatov's high energy QCD effective action formalism, \cite{LipatovEff,Our1,Our2,Our3,Our4}. The explicit perturbative expressions for the correlators till correlator of four-fields inclusively are obtained and different perturbative schemes for the solutions of the equation for the two-field correlator are discussed. A correspondence between the correlators of reggeized gluon fields and Wilson line operators of longitudinal gluon field is established with the help of \cite{Our4} paper results and the connection between the JIMWLK-Balitsky formalism and Lipatov's effective action approach is clarified. The discussion of the obtained results is also present.
