Motivated by the recent observations for the cosmic acceleration and the suitable evolution of the Universe provided an interaction (decay of dark energy to matter) is incorporated in a cosmological model, we study the cosmological evolution of the Interacting Holographic Dark Energy scenario. Critical points are derived and their corresponding cosmological models are presented. The dynamical character of these models is revealed.
