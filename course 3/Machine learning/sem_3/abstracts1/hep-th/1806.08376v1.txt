Using the volume proposal, we compute the change of complexity of holographic states caused by a small conformal transformation in AdS$_{3}$/CFT$_{2}$. This computation is done perturbatively to second order. We give a general result and discuss some of its properties. As operators generating such conformal transformations can be explicitly constructed in CFT terms, these results might allow for a comparison between holographic methods of defining and computing computational complexity and purely field-theoretic proposals in the future.
