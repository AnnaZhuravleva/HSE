We relate the recent derivation of the linearised Einstein equation on an AdS background from holographic entanglement entropy arguments to the Sparling construction: we derive the differential form whose exterior derivative gives the Einstein equation from the Sparling formalism. We develop the study of perturbations within the context of the Sparling formalism and find that the Sparling form vanishes for linearised perturbations on flat space.
