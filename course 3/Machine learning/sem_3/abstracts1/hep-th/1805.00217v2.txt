We develop the embedding formalism for odd dimensional Dirac spinors in AdS and apply it to the (geodesic) Witten diagrams including fermionic degrees of freedom. We first show that the geodesic Witten diagram (GWD) with fermion exchange is equivalent to the conformal partial waves associated with the spin one-half primary field. Then, we explicitly demonstrate the GWD decomposition of the Witten diagram including the fermion exchange with the aid of the split representation. The geodesic representation of CPW indeed gives the useful basis for computing the Witten diagrams.
