We study the asymptotically flat quasi-local black hole/hairy black hole model with nonzero mass of the scalar filed. We disclose effects of the scalar mass on transitions in a grand canonical ensemble with condensation behaviors of a parameter $\psi_{2}$, which is similar to approaches in holographic theories. We find that more negative scalar mass makes the phase transition easier to happen. We also obtain an analytical relation $\psi_{2}\varpropto(T_{c}-T)^{1/2}$ around the critical phase transition points implying a second order phase transition. Besides the parameter $\psi_{2}$, we show that metric solutions can be used to disclose properties of transitions. In this work, we observe that phase transitions in a box are strikingly similar to holographic transitions in the AdS gravity and the similarity provides insights into holographic theories.
