We study quasi-single field inflation with a warm inflation background. The thermal effects at small scales can sufficiently enhance the magnitude of the primordial standard clock signal. This scenario offers us the possibility of probing the UV physics of the very early universe without the exponentially small Boltzmann factor when the mass of the isocurvaton is much heavier than Hubble. The thermal effects at small scales can be studied using the flat space thermal field theory, connected to an effective description using non-Bunch-Davies vacuum at large scales, with large clock signal.
