This paper tests a conjecture on discrete non-Abelian gauging of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Given a parent quiver with a bouquet of $n$ nodes of rank $1$, invariant under a discrete $S_n$ global symmetry, one can construct a daughter quiver where the bouquet is substituted by a single adjoint $n$ node. Based on the main conjecture in this paper, the daughter quiver corresponds to a theory where the $S_n$ discrete global symmetry is gauged and the new Coulomb branch is a non-Abelian orbifold of the parent Coulomb branch. We demonstrate and test the conjecture for three simply laced families of bouquet quivers and a non-simply laced bouquet quiver with $C_2$ factor in the global symmetry.
