We consider the propagation of totally symmetric bosonic fields on generic background spacetimes. The mutual compatibility of the dynamical equations and constraints severely constrains the set of geometries where consistent propagation is possible. To enlarge this set in this article we allow several background fields to be turned on. We were able to show that massive fields of spin s greater than or equal to three may consistently propagate in a large set of non-trivial spacetimes, such as asymptotically de-Sitter, flat and anti-de-Sitter black holes geometries, as long as certain conditions between the various background fields are met. For the special case of massive spin-2 fields the set of allowed spacetimes is larger and includes domain-wall-type geometries, such as the Freedman-Robertson-Walker metric. We comment on the assumptions underlying our study and on possible applications of our results.
