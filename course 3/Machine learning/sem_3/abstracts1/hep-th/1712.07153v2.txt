In this work we consider a two-dimensional quantum black hole sourced by the trace anomaly of a conformal field theory. By using holography, we are able to prove that the black hole size is always proportional to the number of states inside the black hole, a result that might be interpreted as a two dimensional version of the Bekenstein entropy law. Finally, we also show that such a black hole has a minimal size (a remnant). Extrapolating this result for higher dimensions, we show that this would imply that the remnant has a size way larger than the Planck length and is, therefore, always weakly coupled.
