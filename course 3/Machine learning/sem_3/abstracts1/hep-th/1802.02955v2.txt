We study the one-loop corrections to the four-point function in the Anti de Sitter space-time for a $\phi^4$ field theory. Our calculation shows the existence of non-local counterterms which however respect the AdS isometry. Our arguments are quite general and applicable to other (non-conformal) AdS field theories. We also explain why calculations in Euclidean and Lorentzian signatures should differ even at the leading order in non globaly hyperbolic manifolds.
