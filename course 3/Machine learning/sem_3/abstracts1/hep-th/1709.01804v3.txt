Using Rindler method we derive the logarithmic correction to the entanglement entropy of a two dimensional BMS-invariant field theory (BMSFT). In particular, we present a general formula for extraction of the logarithmic corrections to both the thermal and the entanglement entropies. We also present a CFT formula related to the logarithmic correction of the BTZ inner horizon entropy which results in our formula after taking appropriate limit.
