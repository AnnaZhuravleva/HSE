Exact solutions describing rotating black holes can offer important tests for alternative theories of gravity, motivated by the dark energy and dark matter problems. We present an analytic rotating black hole solution for a class of vector-tensor theories of modified gravity, valid for arbitrary values of the rotation parameter. The new configuration is characterised by parametrically large deviations from the Kerr-Newman geometry, controlled by non-minimal couplings between vectors and gravity. It has an oblate horizon in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, and it can rotate more rapidly and have a larger ergosphere than black holes in General Relativity (GR) with the same asymptotic properties. We analytically investigate the features of the innermost stable circular orbits for massive objects on the equatorial plane, and show that stable orbits lie further away from the black hole horizon with respect to rotating black holes in GR. We also comment on possible applications of our findings for the extraction of rotational energy from the black hole.
