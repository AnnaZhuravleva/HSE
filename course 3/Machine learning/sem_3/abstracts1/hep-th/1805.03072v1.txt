We study s-wave scattering of fermion off dilaton black-hole. With one loop correction it was found to suffer from nonpreservation of information and that of course, went against Hawking's revised suggestion on this issue. A nonstandard approach, e.g. the probable existence of unparticle in $(1+1)$ dimension has been adopted here that shows a remedy to get rid of the danger of information loss to bring it in agrees with the Hawking's revised suggestion.
