By means of magnetohydrodynamic equations in a non relativistic multi fluid framework, we study the behavior of small amplitude perturbations in cold Quark Gluon Plasmas (QGP). Magnetohydrodynamic equations, along with the QGP equation of state are expanded using the reductive perturbation method. It is shown that such a medium should be considered as multi fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system. The result is a nonlinear wave equation which complies with a modified form of the "derivative nonlinear Schrodinger" equation instead of the KdV equation. We show that the complete set of equations, by considering the magnetic field which is supported by the Maxwell's equations, create stable solitary waves. An interesting result is the existence of an electric field component along the direction of magnetic field which causes charge separability in the medium. Properties of this solitonic solution is studied by considering different values for the QGP characters such as background mass density and strength of the magnetic field (at the scale of compact stars).
