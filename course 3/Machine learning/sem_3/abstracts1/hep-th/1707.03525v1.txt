A path integral on a link complement of a three-sphere fixes a vector (the "link state") in Chern-Simons theory. The link state can be written in a certain basis with the colored link invariants as its coefficients. We use symmetric webs to systematically compute the colored link invariants, by which we can write down the multi-partite entangled state of any given link. It is still unknown if a product state necessarily implies that the corresponding components are unlinked, and we leave it as a conjecture.
