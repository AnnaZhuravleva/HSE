Imposing T-duality in the renormalisation process of entanglement entropy leads to new relations between entanglement entropy counter-terms. T-duality is made explicit by means of the generalised metric of double field theory in the context of bulk-boundary duality. Double field theory in the bulk naturally provides the new relations between higher order quantum corrections to entanglement entropy as well as a systematic approach to understanding entanglement entropy renormalisation counter-terms. An analogue for Slavnov-Taylor identities for T-dual counter-terms of entanglement entropy is envisaged.
