We generalize the Cosmological Slingshot Scenario for a Slingshot brane moving in a Klebanov-Strassler throat. We show that the horizon and isotropy problems of standard cosmology are avoided, while the flatness problem is acceptably alleviated. Regarding the primordial perturbations, we identify their vacuum state and elucidate the evolution from the quantum to the classical regimes. Also, we calculate their exact power spectrum showing its compatibility with current data. We discuss the bouncing solution from a four dimensional point of view. In this framework the radial and angular motion of the Slingshot brane are described by two scalar fields. We show that the bouncing solution for the scale factor in String frame is mapped into a monotonically increasing (in conformal time) solution in the Einstein frame. We finally discuss about the regularity of the geometry in Einstein frame.
