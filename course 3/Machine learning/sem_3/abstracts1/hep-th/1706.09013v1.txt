In this paper we consider the effect of temperature on the net potential of the electric field \textit{confinement}. We study the behavior of the electric field coupled with dielectric function in the presence of temperature ($T$). The aim, is to obtain an electric field confinement at low temperatures $T<T_{c}$, ($T_{c}$, is the critical temperature), similar to what we observe with the field of gluons that bind quarks in hadrons at low energies, and also to determine its associated string tension as a function of temperature. We also study the screening phenomenon at high temperatures, $T\geqslant T_{c}$. To achieve this, we use the phenomenon of color dielectric function coupled with the dynamics of the gauge field in a tachyon matter. This method is efficient for obtaining the net potential associated with the confinement of quarks and gluons as a function of temperature. We show that the tachyon matter behaves the same way the associated dielectric function, modifies the Maxwell equations and influences the fields in a manner which results in confinement regime at $T<T_{c}$ and Coulombian-like regime at $T=T_{c}$ in three spatial dimensions.
