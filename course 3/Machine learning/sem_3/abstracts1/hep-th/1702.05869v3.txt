We extend our work on entanglement propagation following a local quench in 2+1 dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We find that entanglement propagates along an emergent lightcone, whose speed of propagation $v_E$ seems distinct from other measures of quantum information spreading. We compare the relations we find to information and hydrodynamic velocities in strongly coupled 2+1 dimensional theories. While early-time entanglement velocities corresponding to small entangling regions are numerically close to the butterfly velocity, late-time entanglement velocities for large regions show less regularity. We also generalize and extend our previous results regarding the late-time decay of the entanglement entropy back to its equilibrium value.
