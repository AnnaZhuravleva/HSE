We report a holographic study of a two dimensional dilaton gravity theory with the Dirichlet boundary condition for the cases of non-vanishing and vanishing cosmological constants. Our result shows that a boundary theory of the two dimensional dilaton gravity theory with the Dirichlet boundary condition for the case of a non-vanishing cosmological constant is a Schwarzian term coupled to a dilaton field, while for the case of a vanishing cosmological constant, it is a trivial theory that does not have a kinetic term. We also include the higher derivative term $R^2$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature that is coupled to a dilaton field. We find that the form of the boundary theory is not modified perturbatively. Finally, we show that a lattice holographic picture is realized up to the second order perturbation of the boundary cut-off $\epsilon^2$ under a constant boundary dilaton field and the non-vanishing cosmological constant by identifying the lattice spacing $a$ of a lattice Schwarzian theory with the boundary cut-off $\epsilon$ of the two dimensional dilaton gravity theory.
