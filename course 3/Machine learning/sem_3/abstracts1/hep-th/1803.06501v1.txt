In particle physics and cosmology, the dilaton is an hypothetical scalar field which can explain many physical phenomena. In this framework, we investigate an extended lagrangian of QCD which involves dilatonic degrees of freedom. Our approach is based on the relationship between the massive dilaton and the nonperturbative effects of QCD. We derive a general axion potential involving the dilaton properties and vacuum condensates.
