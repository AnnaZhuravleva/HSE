Inspired by the low wave-length limit of topological M-theory, which re-constructs the theory of $3+1$D gravity in the self-dual variables' formulation, and by the realization that in Loop Quantum Gravity the holonomy of a flat connection can be non-trivial if and only if a non-trivial (space-like) line defect is localized inside the loop, we argue that non-trivial gravitational holonomies can be put in correspondence with space-like M-branes. This suggests the existence of a new duality, which we call $H$ duality, interconnecting topological M-theory with Loop Quantum Gravity. We spell some arguments to show that fundamental S-strings are serious candidates to be considered in order to instantiate this correspondence to classes of LQG states. In particular, we consider the case of the holonomy flowers in LQG, and show that for this type of states the action of the Hamiltonian constraint, from the M-theory side, corresponds to a linear combination of appearance and disappearance of a SNS1- strings. Consequently, these processes can be reinterpreted, respectively, as enucleations or decays into open or closed strings.
