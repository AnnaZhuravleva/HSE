In this paper, we study large $c$ Virasoro blocks by using the Zamolodchikov monodromy method beyond its known limits. We give an analytic proof of our recent conjectur, which implied that the asymptotics of the large $c$ conformal blocks can be expressed in very simple forms, even if outside its known limits, namely the semiclassical limit or the heavy-light limit. In particular, we analytically discuss the fact that the asymptotic behavior of large $c$ conformal blocks drastically changes when the dimensions of external primary states reach the value $\frac{c}{32}$, which is conjectured by our numerical studies. The results presented in this work imply that the general solutions to the Zamolodchikov recursion relation are given by Cardy-like formula, which is an important conclusion that can be numerically drawn from our recent works. Mathematical derivations and analytical results imply that, in the bulk, the collision behavior between two heavy particles may undergo a remarkable transition associated with their masses.
