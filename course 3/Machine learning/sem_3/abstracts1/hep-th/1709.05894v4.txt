We study the complexity growth by using complexity = action (CA) proposal in Minimal Massive 3D Gravity(MMG) model which is proposed for resolving the bulk-boundary clash problem of Topologically Massive Gravity(TMG). We observe that the rate of the complexity growth for BTZ black hole saturates the proposed bound by physical mass of the BTZ black hole in the MMG model, when the angular momentum parameter and the inner horizon of black hole goes to zero.
