We reformulate the Lagrange deformed field-antifield BV -formalism suggested, in terms of the general Euler vector field $N$ generated by the antisymplectic potential. That $N$ generalizes, in a natural anticanonically-invariant manner, the usual power-counting operator. We provide for the "usual" gauge-fixing mechanism as applied to the deformed BV -formalism.
