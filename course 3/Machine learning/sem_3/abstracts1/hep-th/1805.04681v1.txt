An effective approach is presented to produce Schrodinger-like equation for the spinor components from Dirac equation. Considering electrostatic potential as a constant value yields a second-order differential equation that is comparable with the well-known solvable models in the non-relativistic quantum mechanics for the certain bound state energy spectrum and the well-known potentials. By this comparison, the gage field potential and the relativistic energy can be written by the non-relativistic models and the spinors will be related to the orthogonal polynomials. It has also shown that the upper spinors wave functions based on the orthogonal polynomials can be given in terms of the Rodrigues representations. Association with the Rodrigues representations of orthogonal polynomials have also been investigated in the lower spinor components, since they are related to the upper spinor components according to first-order differential equation that is attained from Dirac equation.
