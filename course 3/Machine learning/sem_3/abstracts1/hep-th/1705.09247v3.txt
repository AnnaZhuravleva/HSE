Effective supergravity inflationary models induced by anti-D3 brane interaction with the moduli fields in the bulk geometry have a geometric description. The K\"ahler function carries the complete geometric information on the theory. The non-vanishing bisectional curvature plays an important role in the construction. The new geometric formalism, with the nilpotent superfield representing the anti-D3 brane, allows a powerful generalization of the existing inflationary models based on supergravity. They can easily incorporate arbitrary values of the Hubble parameter, cosmological constant and gravitino mass. We illustrate it by providing generalized versions of polynomial chaotic inflation, T- and E-models of $\alpha$-attractor type, disk merger. We also describe a multi-stage cosmological attractor regime, which we call cascade inflation.
