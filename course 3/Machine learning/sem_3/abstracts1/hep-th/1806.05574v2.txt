This note is devoted to the investigation of Susskind's proposal concerning the correspondence between the operator growth in chaotic theories and the radial momenta of the particle falling in the AdS black hole. We study this proposal and consider the simple example of an operator with the global charge described by the charged particle falling to the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole. Different charges of the particle lead to qualitatively different behavior of the particle momenta and consequently change of the operator size behavior. This holographic result is supported by different examples of melonic models with a finite chemical potential where the suppression of chaos has been observed.
