We study perturbative unitarity in the scalar sector of the Myers and Pospelov model. The model introduces a preferred four vector $n$ which breaks Lorentz symmetry and couples to a five-dimension operator. When the preferred four vector is chosen in the pure timelike direction the model becomes a higher time derivative theory leading to a cubic dispersion relation. Two of the poles are shown to be perturbative connected to the standard ones, while a third pole, which we call Lee-Wick-like pole, can be associated to a negative metric, threatening the preservation of unitarity. We analyze perturbative unitarity using the optical theorem and considering a quartic self-interaction term. By computing discontinuities in the loop diagram, we arrive to a pinching condition which also determines the propagation of the Lee-Wick-like particle through the cut. We find that the contribution vanishes for real external momenta, thus preserving one-loop unitarity.
