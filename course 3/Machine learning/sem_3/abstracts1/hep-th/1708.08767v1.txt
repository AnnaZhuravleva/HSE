This paper deals with the problem of defining off-shell conserved charges in a set of theories known as Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity (CSLTG). The method is derived in a general way, which may find applications in a wide set of theories, and then specified to the case of Generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG), where known results of the central charge and black hole entropy are reproduced. The results for the charges are useful to the community and can be applied to all three-dimensional gravity theories within the class of CSLTG which includes almost all of them. The given specific examples show a consistency check of the more general method.
