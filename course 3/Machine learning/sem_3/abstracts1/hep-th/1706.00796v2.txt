We study a five dimensional Horava-Lifshitz like scalar QED with dynamical exponent z=2. Consistency of the renormalization procedure requires the presence of four quartic and one six-fold scalar couplings besides the terms bilinear in the scalar fields. We compute one-loop radiative corrections to the parameters in the original Lagrangian employing dimensional regularization in the spacial part of the Feynman integrals and prove the relevant Ward identities. By using renormalization group methods, we determine the behavior of the coupling constants with changes in the energy and discuss the emergence of Lorentz symmetry at low energies.
