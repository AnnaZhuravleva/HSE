The Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic formalism for constrained systems is applied to analyze the dynamical content of a model describing two massive relativistic particles with interaction, which can also be interpreted as a bigravity model in one dimension. We systematically investigate the nature of the physical constraints, for which we also determine the zero-modes structure of the corresponding symplectic matrix. After identifying the whole set of constraints, we find out the transformation laws for all the set of dynamical variables corresponding to gauge symmetries, encoded in the remaining zero-modes. In addition, we use an appropriate gauge-fixing procedure, the conformal gauge, to compute the quantization brackets (Faddeev-Jackiw brackets) and also obtain the number of physical degree of freedom. Finally, we argue that this symplectic approach can be helpful for assessing physical constraints and understanding the gauge structure of theories of interacting spin-2 fields.
