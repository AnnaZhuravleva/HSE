Completely from the thermodynamic point of view, we explore the microscopic character of a hairy black hole of Einstein's theory conformally coupled to a scalar field in five dimensions by means of the Ruppeiner thermodynamic geometry. We demonstrate that the scalar hairy black hole has rich microscopic structures in different parameter spaces. Moreover, we analyze the thermal stability of this black hole in detail.
