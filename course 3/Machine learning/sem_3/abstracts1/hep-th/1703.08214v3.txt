We present a new approach to formulating open superstring field theory based on the covering of the supermoduli space of super-Riemann surfaces and explicitly construct a gauge-invariant action in the Neveu-Schwarz sector up to quartic interactions. The cubic interaction takes a form of an integral over an odd modulus of disks with three punctures and the associated ghost is inserted. The quartic interaction takes a form of an integral over one even modulus and two odd moduli, and it can be interpreted as the integral over the region of the supermoduli space of disks with four punctures which is not covered by Feynman diagrams with two cubic vertices and one propagator. As our approach is based on the covering of the supermoduli space, the resulting theory naturally realizes an $A_\infty$ structure, and the two-string product and the three-string product used in defining the cubic and quartic interactions are constructed to satisfy the $A_\infty$ relations to this order.
