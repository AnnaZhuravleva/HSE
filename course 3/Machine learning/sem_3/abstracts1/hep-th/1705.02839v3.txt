In this work we investigate several models described by a single real scalar field with non-polynomial interactions, constructed to support topological solutions. We do this using the deformation procedure to introduce a function which allows to construct two distinct families of hyperbolic potentials, controlled by three distinct parameters, in the standard formalism. In this way, the procedure allows us to get analytical solutions, and then investigate the energy density, linear stability and zero mode. We move on and introduce a non-standard formalism to obtain compact solutions, analytically. We also investigate these hyperbolic models in the braneworld context, considering both the standard and non-standard possibilities. The results show how to construct distinct braneworld models which are implemented via the first order formalism and are stable against fluctuation of the metric tensor.
