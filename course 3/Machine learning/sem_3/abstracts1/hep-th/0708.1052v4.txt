In the present letter we find that Starobinsky's inflationary solution is also valid in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model where a 3-brane is embedded in 5-dimensional Minkowski bulk. We show that such a solution is typically not supported by the Self-Accelerated branch of the model, giving therefore a natural selection of the conventional branch of solutions. In the absence of brane induced Einstein-Hilbert term the SA branch is always selected out. We then study the linearized modes around all such de Sitter brane solutions finding perturbative stability for a range of parameters of the brane QFT.
