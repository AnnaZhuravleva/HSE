In this note, we go over the recent soft photon model and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of the massless quantum electrodynamics in the eikonal limit to some extent. Throughout our readdressing, we observe that the gauge potentials in both approaches become pure gauges and the associated eikonal Faddeev-Jackiw quantum bracket matches with the soft quantum bracket. These observations and the fact that the gauge fields in two cases localize in two-dimensional plane (even if it is spatial in soft photon case and $1+1$-dimensional Minkowski in the eikonal case) imply that there might be an interesting relation between these two distinct perspectives.
