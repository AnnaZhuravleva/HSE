We review the fast developing subject of tensor models for the NAdS$_2$/NCFT$_1$ holographic correspondence. We include a brief review of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and then focus on the associated quantum mechanical tensor models (GW and CTKT). We examine their main features and how they compare with SYK. To end, we discuss different extensions: the large $D$ limit of matrix-tensor models, the large $N$ expansion of symmetric/antisymmetric tensors, the use of probes, the construction of a bilocal action for tensors, some attempts to extend the above models to higher dimensions and a proposal to break the tensor symmetry.
