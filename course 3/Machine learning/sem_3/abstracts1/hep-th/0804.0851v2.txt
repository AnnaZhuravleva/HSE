Modifications of a free quantum field calculation using translation-related concepts and general translation representations yield quantum fields for massive particles that as a consequence follow the classical trajectories of electrodynamics and geometrodynamics. The work allows an explanation for the unexpectedly high energy of cosmic rays. The explanation can be tested at the Large Hadron Collider once high energy proton beams are operational.
