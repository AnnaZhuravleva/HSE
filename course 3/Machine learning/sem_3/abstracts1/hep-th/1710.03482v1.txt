We construct a novel tensionless limit of Superstring theory that realises the Inhomogeneous Super Galilean Conformal Algebra (SGCA$_I$) as the residual symmetries in the analogue of the conformal gauge, as opposed to previous constructions of the tensionless superstring, where a smaller symmetry algebra called the Homogeneous SGCA emerged as the residual gauge symmetry on the worldsheet. We obtain various features of the new tensionless theory intrinsically as well as from a systematic limit of the corresponding features of the tensile theory. We discuss why it is desirable and also natural to work with this new tensionless limit and the larger algebra.
