Statefinder diagnostic is a useful method which can differ one dark energy model from each others. In this letter, we apply this method to a holographic dark energy model from Ricci scalar curvature, called the Ricci dark energy model(RDE). We plot the evolutionary trajectories of this model in the statefinder parameter-planes, and it is found that the parameter of this model plays a significant role from the statefinder viewpoint. In a very special case, the statefinder diagnostic fails to discriminate LCDM and RDE models, thus we apply a new diagnostic called the Om diagnostic proposed recently to this model in this case in Appendix A and it works well.
