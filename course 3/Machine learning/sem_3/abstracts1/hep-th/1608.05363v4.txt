The half-BPS boundary conditions preserving $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetry in 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theories are examined. The BPS equations admit decomposition of the bulk supermultiplets into specific boundary supermultiplets of preserved supersymmetry. Nahm-like equations arise in the vector multiplet BPS boundary condition preserving $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetry and Robin-type boundary conditions appear for the hypermultiplet coupled to vector multiplet when $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry is preserved. The half-BPS boundary conditions are realized in the brane configurations of Type IIB string theory.
