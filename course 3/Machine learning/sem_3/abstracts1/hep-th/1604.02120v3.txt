We consider BTZ black holes and flat space cosmologies in generic higher derivative gravity theories in 2+1 dimensions. Our goal is to prove the match between the bulk Iyer-Wald entropy and the field theory entropy for various symmetry algebras (CFT$_2$, Warped CFT$_2$, BMS$_3$). We also discuss phase transitions in higher curvature theories, and argue that, in the flat case, there is strictly speaking no phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble.
