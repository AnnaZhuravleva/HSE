We formulate large $N$ duality of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ refined Chern-Simons theory with a torus knot/link in $S^3$. By studying refined BPS states in M-theory, we provide the explicit form of low-energy effective actions of Type IIA string theory with D4-branes on the $\Omega$-background. This form enables us to relate refined Chern-Simons invariants of a torus knot/link in $S^3$ to refined BPS invariants in the resolved conifold. Assuming that the extra $\mathrm{U}(1)$ global symmetry acts on BPS states trivially, the duality predicts graded dimensions of cohomology groups of moduli spaces of M2-M5 bound states associated to a torus knot/link in the resolved conifold. Thus, this formulation can be also interpreted as a positivity conjecture of refined Chern-Simons invariants of torus knots/links. We also discuss about an extension to non-torus knots.
