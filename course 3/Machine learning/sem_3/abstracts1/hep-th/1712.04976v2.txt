We introduce a class of (0,2) superconformal field theories based on hybrid geometries, generalizing various known constructions. We develop techniques for the computation of the complete massless spectrum when the theory can be interpreted as determining a perturbative heterotic string compactification. We provide evidence for surprising properties regarding RG flows and IR accidental symmetries in (0,2) hybrid CFTs. We also study the conditions for embedding a hybrid theory in a particular class of gauged linear sigma models. This perspective suggests that our construction generates models which cannot be realized or analyzed by previously known methods.
