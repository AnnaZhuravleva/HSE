We show that the minimally gauged BPS baby Skyrme model remains a BPS theory after coupling with gravity that is the topologically nontrivial configurations called baby Skyrmions carrying magnetic flux are solutions to a zero pressure equation. Following that the proper mass, magnetic flux and the proper geometric volume are linear function of the topological charge, while the total ADM mass and geometric radius get a contribution due to the gravitational interaction which is quadratic in the topological charge. All these quantities are found exactly as target space integrals (averages) of the so-called superpotential. A complete classification of possible mass-radius curves is provided.As an example we consider the model with the pion like mass potential, for which, an approximated but analytical form of the superpotential is provided.
