We use the superspace formulation of (massive) IIA supergravity to obtain the explicit form of the dilatino terms, and we find that the quartic-dilatino term is positive. The theory admits a ten-dimensional de Sitter solution, obtained by assuming a nonvanishing quartic-dilatino condensate which generates a positive cosmological constant. Moreover, in the presence of dilatino condensates, the theory admits formal four-dimensional de Sitter solutions of the form $dS_4\times M_6$, where $M_6$ is a six-dimensional K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifold of positive scalar curvature.
