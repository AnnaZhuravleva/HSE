In this paper study the quantum deformation of the superflag Fl(2|0, 2|1,4|1), and its big cell, describing the complex conformal and Minkowski superspaces respectively. In particular, we realize their projective embedding via a generalization to the super world of the Segre map and we use it to construct a quantum deformation of the super line bundle realizing this embedding. This strategy allows us to obtain a description of the quantum coordinate superring of the superflag that is then naturally equipped with a coaction of the quantum complex conformal supergroup SL_q(4|1).
