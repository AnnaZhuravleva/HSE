We derive the complete set of off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting (anti-)BRST as well as (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the gauge-invariant Christ-Lee model by exploiting the celebrated (dual-)horizontality conditions together with the gauge-invariant and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions within the framework of geometrical "augmented" supervariable approach to BRST formalism. We show the (anti-) BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariances of the Lagrangian in the context of supervariable approach. We, further, also provide the geometrical origin and capture the key properties associated with the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations (and corresponding conserved charges) in terms of the supervariables and Grassmannian translational generators.
