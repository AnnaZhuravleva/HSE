We compute the running of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations in String Gas Cosmology, making use of a smooth parametrization of the transition between the early Hagedorn phase and the later radiation phase. We find that the running has the same sign as in simple models of single scalar field inflation. Its magnitude is proportional to $(1 - n_s)$ ($n_s$ being the slope index of the spectrum), and it is thus parametrically larger than for inflationary cosmology, where it is proportional to $(1 - n_s)^2$.
