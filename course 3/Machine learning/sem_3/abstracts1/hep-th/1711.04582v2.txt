In this paper we review and discuss several aspects of supertranslations and their associated algebras at the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. We will compare two different approaches on horizon supertranslations, which were recently considered in separate publications. Furthermore we describe a possible holographic description of a Schwarzschild black hole in terms of a large N boundary theory, which accommodates the Goldstone bosons of the horizon supertranslations.
