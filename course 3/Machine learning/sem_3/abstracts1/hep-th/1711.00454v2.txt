We present the phase diagram of stability of 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime against horizon formation in the gravitational collapse of a scalar field, treating the scalar field mass and width of initial data as free parameters. We find that the stable phase becomes larger and shifts to smaller widths as the field mass increases. In addition to classifying initial data as stable or unstable, we identify two other phases based on nonperturbative behavior. The metastable phase forms a horizon over longer time scales than suggested by the lowest order perturbation theory, and the irregular phase can exhibit non-monotonic and chaotic behavior in the horizon formation times. Our results include evidence for chaotic behavior even in the collapse of a massless scalar field.
