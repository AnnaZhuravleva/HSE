It gives me great pleasure to review some of the joint work by Tullio Regge and myself. We worked intensely on 2+1-dimensional gravity from 1989 for about five years, and published 16 articles. I will present and review two of our early articles, highlighting what I believe are the most important results, some of them really surprising, and discuss later developments.
