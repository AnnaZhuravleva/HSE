In this work, we study the key role of generic Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework to quantify the correlation functions in a quasi de Sitter background for an arbitrary initial choice of the quantum vacuum state. We perform the computation in unitary gauge in which we apply St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg trick in lowest dimensional EFT operators which are broken under time diffeomorphism. Particularly using this non-linear realization of broken time diffeomorphism and truncating the action by considering the contribution from two derivative terms in the metric we compute the two point and three point correlations from scalar perturbations and two point correlation from tensor perturbations to quantify the quantum fluctuations observed in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. We also use equilateral limit and squeezed limit configurations for the scalar three point correlations in Fourier space. To give future predictions from EFT setup and to check the consistency of our derived results for correlations, we use the results obtained from all class of canonical single field and general single field $P(X,\phi)$ model. This analysis helps us to fix the coefficients of the relevant operators in EFT in terms of the slow roll parameters and effective sound speed. Finally, using CMB observation from Planck we constrain all of these coefficients of EFT operators for single field slow roll inflationary paradigm.
