The aim of this paper is to study the thermodynamics variables of non-rotating BTZ black hole in 2+1 dimensional using two models; one of them is the quantum hydrogen atom model, and the other is the Collapsed Shell Model. We calculate the thermodynamics variables (temperature, entropy, thermodynamics volume and heat capacity) in presence of the minimal length f. Also calculate the efficiency of holographic heat engine in absence of the minimal length for the four cases; uncharged and non-rotating, charged and non-rotating, uncharged and rotating, charged and rotating BTZ black hole respectively.
