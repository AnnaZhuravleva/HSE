We derive a new exact evolution equation for the scale dependence of an effective action. The corresponding equation for the effective potential permits a useful truncation. This allows one to deal with the infrared problems of theories with massless modes in less than four dimensions which are relevant for the high temperature phase transition in particle physics or the computation of critical exponents in statistical mechanics.
