We investigate the critical properties of the Lee-Yang model in less than six spacetime dimensions using truncations of the functional renormalization group flow. We give estimates for the critical exponents, study the dependence on the regularization scheme, and show the convergence of our results for increasing size of the truncations in four and five dimensions. While with our truncations it is numerically challenging to approach the three-dimensional case, we provide a simple approximation which allows us to qualitatively study the Lee-Yang model in two and three dimensions, and use it to argue the existence of further nonunitary multicritical theories including one which is relevant for the universality class of the Blume-Capel model.
