For strongly correlated systems, holography is an ideal framework for computing plasmon properties. These can be compared to experimental results obtained from momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), able to e.g. measure the dynamical charge response of strange metals.   We show that all self-sourced modes in holographic Maxwell theories are described by a specific choice of boundary conditions. As an application we compute the 2D-plasmon dispersion and obtain results that agree with those obtained by conventional methods, when applicable, indicating the method's potential to improve holographic models of effectively two dimensional systems, e.g. graphene.
