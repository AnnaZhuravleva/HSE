Recently, large gauge transformation (LGT), the residual gauge symmetry after gauge fixing that survives at null infinity, has drawn much attention concerning soft theorems and the memory effect. We point out that LGT charges in quantum electrodynamics are in fact one of non-compact generators of the two dimensional Euclidean group. Moreover, by comparing two equivalent descriptions of gauge transformation, we suggest that LGT is simply another way of describing the gauged little group for massless soft photons.
