We consider $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory formulated in ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ harmonic superspace and analyze the structure of the two-loop divergences in the hypermultiplet sector. Using the ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ superfield background field method we study the two-point supergraphs with the hypermultiplet legs and prove that their total contribution to the divergent part of effective action vanishes off shell.
