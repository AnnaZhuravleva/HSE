We consider nontopological first-order solitons arising from a gauged $CP(2)$ model in the presence of the Maxwell term multiplied by a nontrivial dielectric function. We implement the corresponding first-order scenario by proceeding the minimization of the total energy, this way introducing the corresponding energy lower-bound, such a construction being only possible due to a differential constraint including the dielectric function itself and the self-interacting potential defining the model. We saturate the aforementioned bound by focusing our attention on those solutions fulfilling a particular set of two coupled first-order differential equations. In the sequel, in order to solve these equations, we choose the dielectric function explicitly, also calculating the corresponding self-interacting potential. We impose appropriate boundary conditions supporting nontopological solitons, from which we verify that the energy of final structures is proportional to the magnetic flux they engender, both quantities being not quantized, as expected. We depict the new numerical solutions, whilst commenting on the main properties they present.
