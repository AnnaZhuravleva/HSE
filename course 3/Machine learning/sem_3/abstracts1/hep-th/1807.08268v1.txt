We derive all the second order dynamical transport coefficients for Dp-brane with p from 1 to 6 using the boundary derivative expansion formalism of the fluid/gravity correspondence in this paper. D5 and D6-brane do not have dual relativistic fluids; D3-brane corresponds to 4 dimensional conformal relativistic fluid; D1, D2 and D4-brane separately correspond to nonconformal relativistic fluids of dimensions 2, 3 and 5. The Haack-Yarom relation only exists for Dp-branes with $p$ larger than 2 and is also satisfied by them. We also find that the Romatschke and Kleinert-Probst relations need to be generalized in order to be valid for relativistic fluids of dimensions other than 4.
