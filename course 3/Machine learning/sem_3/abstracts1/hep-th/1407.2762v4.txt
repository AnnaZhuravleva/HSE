We construct a consistent reduction ansatz of eleven-dimensional supergravity to $N=2$ $SO(4)$ seven-dimensional gauged supergravity with topological mass term for the three-form field. The ansatz is obtained from a truncation of the $S^4$ reduction giving rise to the maximal $N=4$ $SO(5)$ gauged supergravity. Therefore, the consistency is guaranteed by the consistency of the $S^4$ reduction. Unlike the gauged supergravity without topological mass having a half-supersymmetric domain wall vacuum, the resulting 7D gauged supergravity theory admits a maximally supersymmetric $AdS_7$ critical point. This corresponds to $N=(1,0)$ superconformal field theory in six dimensions. We also study RG flows from this $N=(1,0)$ SCFT to non-conformal $N=(1,0)$ Super Yang-Mills theories in the seven-dimensional framework and use the reduction ansatz to uplift this RG flow to eleven dimensions.
