We list 4d interacting $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with minimal flavor central charge from the theory space constructed using 6d $(2,0)$ theory. For $ADE$ and $C_N$ flavor groups, our theory saturates the bound found using bootstrap method, but other cases have higher values. We find interesting rank one SCFTs with $B_3, G_2, F_4, C_4\times U(1), C_1\times U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Many physical properties of these theories are also studied.
