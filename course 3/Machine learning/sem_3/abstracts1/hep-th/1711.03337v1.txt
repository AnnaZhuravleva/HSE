We compute off-critical local height probabilities in regime-III restricted solid-on-solid models in a $4 N$-quadrant spiral geometry, with periodic boundary conditions in the angular direction, and fixed boundary conditions in the radial direction, as a function of $N$, the winding number of the spiral, and $\tau$, the departure from criticality of the model, and observe that the result depends only on the product $N \, \tau$. In the limit $N \rightarrow 1$, $\tau \rightarrow \tau_0$, such that $\tau_0$ is finite, we recover the off-critical local height probability on a plane, $\tau_0$-away from criticality. In the limit $N \rightarrow \infty$, $\tau \rightarrow 0$, such that $N \, \tau = \tau_0$ is finite, and following a conformal transformation, we obtain a critical partition function on a cylinder of aspect-ratio $\tau_0$. We conclude that the off-critical local height probability on a plane, $\tau_0$-away from criticality, is equal to a critical partition function on a cylinder of aspect-ratio $\tau_0$, in agreement with a result of Saleur and Bauer.
