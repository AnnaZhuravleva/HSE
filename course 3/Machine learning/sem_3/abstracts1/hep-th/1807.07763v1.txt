Following a novel approach, all known basic mass generation mechanisms consistent with an exact abelian U(1) gauge symmetry are shown to be related through an intricate network of dualities whatever the spacetime dimension. This equivalence which applies in the absence of any supersymmetry, is however restricted by the presence of topological terms generating possible topological effects. In particular in 3+1 dimensions the duality relations between the Maxwell-Higgs model, the Stueckelberg and the topological mass generation mechanisms are then established following a careful treatment of the gauge symmetry content. This result offers a new framework for an effective description of superconductivity or topological defects built from fields beyond the SM.
