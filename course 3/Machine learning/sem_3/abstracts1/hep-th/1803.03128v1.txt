We make a few general comments on the Renormalization Group flows in certain Yang-Mills theories in the vicinity of phase transitions. We then present a model in d=5 with non-periodic boundary conditions where a possible RG flow starts from the trivial point and ends on a quantum phase transition. Near the endpoint of the flow interesting comments can be made about the Higgs hierarchy problem.
