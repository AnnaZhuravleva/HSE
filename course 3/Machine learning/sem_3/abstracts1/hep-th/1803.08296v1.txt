The uniqueness of static spherically symmetric traversable wormholes with two asymptotically flat ends, subject to the higher-dimensional solutions of Einstein-Maxwell-phantom dilaton field equations was proved. We considered the case of an arbitrary dilaton coupling constant. Conformal positive energy theorem plays the key role in the considerations.
