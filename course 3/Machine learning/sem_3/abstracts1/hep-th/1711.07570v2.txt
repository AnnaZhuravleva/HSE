Omega-deformation of the Seiberg-Witten curve is known to be written in terms of the qq-character, namely the trace of a specific operator acting in a Hilbert space spanned by certain Young diagrams. We define a differential form acting on this space and establish two discretised versions of the Seiberg-Witten expressions for the periods and related relations for the prepotential.
