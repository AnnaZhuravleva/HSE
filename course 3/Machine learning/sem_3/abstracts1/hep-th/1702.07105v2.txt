We have analytically investigated the effects of non-linearity on the free energy and thermodynamic geometry of holographic superconductors in $2+1 -$dimensions. The non-linear effect is introduced by considering the coupling of the massive charged scalar field with Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We then calculate the relation between critical temperature and charge density from two different methods, namely, the matching method and the divergence of the scalar curvature which is obtained by investigating the thermodynamic geometry of the model. The two results are slightly different from numerical values but the effects of non-linearity gets captured in our analysis.
