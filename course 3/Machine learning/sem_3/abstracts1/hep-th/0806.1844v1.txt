We consider two different toy cosmological models based on two fields (one normal scalar and one phantom) realizing the same evolution of the Bang-to-Rip type. One of the fields (pseudoscalar) interacts with the magnetic field breaking the conformal invariance of the latter. The effects of the amplification of cosmic magnetic fields are studied and it is shown that the presence of such effects can discriminate between different cosmological models realizing the same global evolution of the universe.
