Cohomological invariants of twisted wild character varieties as constructed by Boalch and Yamakawa are derived from enumerative Calabi-Yau geometry and refined Chern-Simons invariants of torus knots. Generalizing the untwisted case, the present approach is based on a spectral correspondence for meromorphic Higgs bundles with fixed conjugacy classes at the marked points. This construction is carried out for twisted wild character varieties associated to (l, kl-1) torus knots, providing a colored generalization of existing results of Hausel, Mereb and Wong as well as Shende, Treumann and Zaslow.
