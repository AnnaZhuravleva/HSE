In this paper, we study the dynamics of the light quark jet moving through the static, strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$, anisotropic plasma with and without charge. The light quark is presented by a point-like initial condition falling string in the context of the AdS/CFT. We calculate the stopping distance of the light quark in the anisotropic medium and compare it with its isotropic value. By studying the falling string in the beam direction and transverse direction, we find that the jet quenching increases in both directions. Although, the enhancement of quenching is larger in the beam direction. Also, the suppression of stopping distance is more prominent when the anisotropic plasma have the same temperature as the isotropic plasma.
