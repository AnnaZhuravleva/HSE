In this paper, we introduce an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric SYK model with $SO(q)$ global symmetry. We study the large $N$ expansion of the bi-local collective action of our model. At strong coupling limit, this model exhibits a super-reparametrization symmetry, and the $SO(q)$ global symmetry is enhanced to a $\widehat{SO}(q)$ local symmetry. The corresponding symmetry algebra is the semi-direct product of the super-Virasoro and the super-Kac-Moody algebras. These emergent symmetries are spontaneously and explicitly broken, which leads to a low energy effective action: super-Schwarzian action plus an action of a super-particle on the $SO(q)$ group manifold. We analyze the zero mode contributions to the chaotic behavior of four point functions in various $SO(q)$ channels. In singlet channel, we show that the out-of-time-ordered correlators related to bosonic bi-locals exhibit the saturation of the chaos bound as in the non-SUSY SYK model. On the other hand, we find that the ones with fermionic bi-locals in the singlet channel have ${\pi\over\beta}$ Lyapunov exponent. In the anti-symmetric channel, we demonstrate that the out-of-time-ordered correlator related to a $SO(q)$ generator grows linearly in time. We also compute the non-zero mode contributions which give consistent corrections to the leading Lyapunov exponents from the zero modes.
