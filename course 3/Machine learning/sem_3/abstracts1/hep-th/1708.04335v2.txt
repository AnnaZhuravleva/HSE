In the present work we study charged black hole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell action that have Thurston geometries on its near horizon region. In particular we find solutions with charged Solv and Nil geometry horizons. We also find Nil black holes with hyperscaling violation. For all our solutions we compute the thermoelectric DC transport coefficients of the corresponding dual field theory. We find that the Solv and Nil black holes without hyperscaling violation are dual to metals while those with hyperscaling violation are dual to insulators.
