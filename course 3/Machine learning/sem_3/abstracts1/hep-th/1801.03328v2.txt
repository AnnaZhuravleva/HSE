Using the explicit solution of Compere and Long for the Schwarzschild metric containing the supertranslation field, we study the near-horizon symmetries of the metric. In distinction to the previously studied cases in which the metric was assumed to be smooth at the horizon, in the case of the Schwarzschild metric with finite supertranslation field the metric is not smooth at the horizon. The algebra of vector fields generating transformations preserving the functional form of the metric at the horizon is constructed.
