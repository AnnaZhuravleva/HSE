We couple twisted non-compact N=(2,2) supersymmetric models to topological gravity in two dimensions. We propose expressions for the genus zero correlation functions based on a Kadomtsev-Petviashvili integrable hierarchy. Moreover, we prove recursion relations satisfied by the topological gravity amplitudes at all genera and compute characteristic critical exponents. We discuss the extent to which moving beyond the N=2 central charge barrier opens a window on two-dimensional gravity with central charge larger than one.
