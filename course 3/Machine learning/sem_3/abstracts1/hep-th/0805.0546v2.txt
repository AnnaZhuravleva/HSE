In this paper we implement the new agegraphic dark energy model with quintessence field. We demonstrate that the new agegraphic evolution of the universe can be described completely by a single quintessence field. Its potential as a function of the quintessence field is reconstructed numerically. In particular, the analytical solution of the new agegraphic quintessence dark energy model (NAQDE) is approximately obtained in the matter-dominated epoch. Furthermore, we investigate the evolution of the NAQDE model in the $\omega-\omega'$ phase plane. It turns out that by quantum corrections, the trajectory of this model lies outside the thawing and freezing regions at early times. But at late times, it enters the freezing regions and gradually approaches to a static cosmological constant state in the future. Therefore the NAQDE should belong to the freezing model at late times. For comparison, we further extend this model by including the interaction between the NADE and DM and discuss its evolution in the $\omega-\omega'$ phase plane.
