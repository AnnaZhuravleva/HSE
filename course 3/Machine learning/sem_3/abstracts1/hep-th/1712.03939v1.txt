We consider the possibility to solve the issues of the phantom field cosmology by means of the PT-symmetric quantum theory. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is applied to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to study the inhomogeneous fluctuations over the homogeneous minisuperspace. The evolution of the longitudinal inhomogeneous modes in WKB-time is described using a time-dependent pseudo-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian.
