Recently it has been understood that certain soft factorization theorems for scattering amplitudes can be written as Ward identities of new asymptotic symmetries. This relationship has been established for soft particles with spins $s > 0$, most notably for soft gravitons and photons. Here we study the remaining case of soft scalars. We show that a class of Yukawa-type theories, where a massless scalar couples to massive particles, have an infinite number of conserved charges. This raises the question as to whether one can associate asymptotic symmetries to scalars.
