In the present paper, we dwelve into the relationship between tensor hierarchy structures in supergravity theories, and Leibniz algebras. The tensor hierarchies naturally emerge from gauging procedures in supergravity models. Given a set of 1-form fields taking values in a representation $V$ of the symmetry Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of the model, these techniques provide a tower of $p$-form fields that induce covariance of the $p$-form field strengths. The goal of this paper is two-fold: we first show that the choice of an embedding tensor $\Theta:V\to\mathfrak{g}$ induces a Leibniz algebra structure on $V$. Leibniz algebras are non-skew-symmetric generalizations of Lie algebras. In a Leibniz algebra, the product may admit a non-vanishing symmetric part, so that the usual Jacobi identity may not be satisfied anymore, to the benefits of the Leibniz identity. Then we show how a given Leibniz algebra $V$ gives rise to a family of embedding tensors taking values into sub-Lie algebras of $V$, showing that the two notions are responding to one another. Finally we propose a systematic construction of the tensor hierarchy algebra that is dependent on the fewest data possible: a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a representation $V$, an embedding tensor $\Theta$ and a choice of a lift of the symmetric bracket on $V$. The construction provides a classification of tensor hierarchies in terms of the lifts of the symmetric bracket.
