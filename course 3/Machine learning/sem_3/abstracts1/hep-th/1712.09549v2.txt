Supersymmetric $\,\textrm{AdS}_{4}\,$, $\,\textrm{AdS}_{2} \times \Sigma_{2}\,$ and asymptotically AdS$_{4}$ black hole solutions are studied in the context of non-minimal $\,\mathcal{N}=2\,$ supergravity models involving three vector multiplets (STU-model) and Abelian gaugings of the universal hypermultiplet moduli space. Such models correspond to consistent subsectors of the $\,\textrm{SO}(p,q)\,$ and $\,\textrm{ISO}(p,q)\,$ gauged maximal supergravities that arise from the reduction of 11D and massive IIA supergravity on $\,\textrm{H}^{(p,q)}\,$ spaces down to four dimensions. A unified description of all the models is provided in terms of a square-root prepotential and the gauging of a duality-hidden symmetry pair of the universal hypermultiplet. Some aspects of M-theory and massive IIA holography are mentioned in passing.
