We study the thermodynamic phase diagram of three-dimensional $sl(N;\mathbb{R})$ higher spin black holes. By analyzing the semi-classical partition function we uncover a rich structure that includes Hawking-Page transitions to the AdS$_3$ vacuum, first order phase transitions among black hole states, and a second order critical point. Our analysis is explicit for $N=4$ but we extrapolate some of our conclusions to arbitrary $N$. In particular, we argue that even $N$ is stable in the ensemble under consideration but odd $N$ is not.
