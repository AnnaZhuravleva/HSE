We study the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet term on the holographic complexity growth rate of asymptotically AdS black holes using the "Complexity --- Volume" (CV) and CV2.0 conjectures. We investigate the late time value and full time evolution of the complexity growth rate of Gauss-Bonnet black holes with horizons with zero curvature ($k=0$), positive curvature ($k=1$) and negative curvature ($k=-1$) respectively. For the $k=0$ and $k=1$ cases we find that the Gauss-Bonnet term suppresses the growth rate as expected, while in the $k=-1$ case the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet term may be opposite to what is expected. The reason for it is briefly discussed, and the comparison of our results to the result obtained by using the "Complexity --- Action" (CA) conjecture is also presented.
