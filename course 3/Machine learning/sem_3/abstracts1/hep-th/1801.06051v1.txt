In this paper, we analytically investigate the noncommutative effects of a charged black hole on holographic superconductors. The effects of charge of the black hole is investigated in our study. Employing the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue method, the relation between the critical temperature and charge density is analytically investigated. The condensation operator is then computed. It is observed that condensate gets harder to form for large values of charge of the black hole.
