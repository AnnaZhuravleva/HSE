We suggest two realistic f(R) and one F(G) modified gravities which are consistent with local tests and cosmological bounds. The typical property of such theories is the presence of the effective cosmological constant epochs in such a way that early-time inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration are naturally unified within single model. It is shown that classical instability does not appear here and Newton law is respected. Some discussion of possible anti-gravity regime appearence and related modification of the theory is done.
