We investigate the entanglement entropy of a two-dimensional disordered system holographically. The disorder deforms a two-dimensional conformal field theory defined at a UV fixed point to a Lifshitz field theory in an IR region. After decomposing the entanglement entropy into short and long range correlations, we investigate how the entanglement entropy of the disordered system evolves from UV to IR along the renormalization group flow. The long range correlation interestingly leads to a universal critical exponent in the IR regime, which is only very weakly dependent on the strength of the disorder. We also investigate a possible phase transition and long range correlation between two subsystems by studying the mutual information.
