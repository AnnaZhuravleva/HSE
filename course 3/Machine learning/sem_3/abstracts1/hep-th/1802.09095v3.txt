This paper presents a case study of the effects of increasing the order of a Ginzburg-Landau type expansion, by using the well known Gross-Neveu model in 1+1 dimensions as a test case. It is found that as the order of expansion increases, the predicted phase diagram increasingly resembles the known exact phase diagram. Finally, some properties of arbitrary large order phase diagrams are examined.
