We consider a class of conformal defects in Virasoro minimal models that have been defined as fixed points of the renormalisation group and calculate the leading contribution to the reflection coefficient for these defects. This requires several structure constants of the operator algebra of the defect fields, for which we present a derivation in detail. We compare our results with our recent work on conformal defects in the tricritical Ising model.
