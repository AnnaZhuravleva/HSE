For a quiver with weighted arrows we define gauge-theory K-theoretic W-algebra generalizing the definition of Shiraishi et al., and Frenkel and Reshetikhin. In particular, we show that the qq-character construction of gauge theory presented by Nekrasov is isomorphic to the definition of the W-algebra in the operator formalism as a commutant of screening charges in the free field representation. Besides, we allow arbitrary quiver and expect interesting applications to representation theory of generalized Borcherds-Kac-Moody Lie algebras, their quantum affinizations and associated W-algebras.
