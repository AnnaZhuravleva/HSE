I discuss the possibility of using a massive vector field to generate the density perturbation in the Universe. I find that a scale-invariant superhorizon spectrum of vector field perturbations is possible to generate during inflation. The associated curvature perturbation is imprinted onto the Universe following the curvaton scenario. The mechanism does not generate a long-range anisotropy because an oscillating massive vector field behaves as a pressureless isotropic fluid.
