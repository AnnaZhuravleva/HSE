The nonlinear transport features of inhomogeneous chiral plasma in the presence of electromagnetic fields, in rotating coordinates are studied within the relaxation time approach. The chiral distribution functions up to second order in the electric field in rotating coordinates and the derivatives of chemical potentials are established by solving the Boltzmann transport equation. First, the vector and axial current densities in the weakly ionized chiral plasma for vanishing magnetic field are calculated. They involve the rotational analogues of the Hall effect as well as several new terms arising from the Coriolis and fictitious centrifugal forces. Then in the short relaxation time regime the angular velocity and electromagnetic fields are treated as perturbations. The current densities are obtained by retaining the terms up to second order in perturbations. The time evolution equations of the inhomogeneous chemical potentials are derived by demanding that collisions conserve the particle number densities.
