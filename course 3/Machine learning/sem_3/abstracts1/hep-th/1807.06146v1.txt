In earlier work we introduced an abelianized gauge field model in which a Rarita-Schwinger field is directly coupled to a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ field, and showed that this model admits a perturbative expansion in the gauge field coupling. As a preliminary to further study of the coupled model, in this paper we present a detailed analysis of the free field structure that obtains when the dimensionless gauge coupling is set to zero, but the dimension one coupling of the spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fields remains nonzero.
