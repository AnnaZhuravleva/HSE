We present the construction of a new family of coherent states for quantum theories of connections obtained following the polymer quantization. The realization of these coherent states is based on the notion of graph change, in particular the one induced by the quantum dynamics in Yang-Mills and gravity quantum theories. Using a Fock-like canonical structure that we introduce, we derive the new coherent states that we call the graph coherent states. These states take the form of an infinite superposition of basis network states with different graphs. We further discuss the properties of such states and certain extensions of the proposed construction.
