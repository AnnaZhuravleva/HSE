We propose a new approach in Lagrangian formalism for studying the fluid dynamics on noncommutative space. Starting with the Poisson bracket for single particle, a map from canonical Lagrangian variables to Eulerian variables is constructed for taking into account of the noncommutative effects. The advantage of this approach is that the kinematic and potential energies in the Lagrangian formalism continuously change in the infinite limit to the ones in Eulerian formalism, and hence make sure that both the kinematical and potential energies are taken into account correctly. Furthermore, in our approach, the equations of motion of the mass density and current density are naturally expressed into conservative form. Based on this approach, the noncommutative Poisson bracket is introduced, and the noncommutative algebra among Eulerian variables, as well as the noncommutative corrections on the equations of motion are obtained. We find that the noncommutative corrections generally depend on the derivatives of potential under consideration. Furthermore, we find that the noncommutative algebra does modify the usual Friedmann equation, and the noncommutative corrections measure the symmetry properties of the density function $\rho(\vec{z})$ under rotation around the direction $\vec{\theta}$. This characterization results in vanishing corrections for spherically symmetric mass density distribution and potential.
