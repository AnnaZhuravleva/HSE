We present a formula for the information metric on $\mathbb{R} \times {S}^{d-1}$ for a scalar primary operator of integral dimension $\Delta \, (\,\, > \frac{d+1}{2})$. This formula is checked for various space-time dimensions $d$ and $\Delta$ in the field theory side. We check the formula in the gravity side using the holographic setup. We clarify the regularization and renormalization involved in these computations. We also show that the quantum information metric of an exactly marginal operator agrees with the leading order of the interface free energy of the conformal Janus on Euclidean ${S}^d$, which is checked for $d=2, 3$.
