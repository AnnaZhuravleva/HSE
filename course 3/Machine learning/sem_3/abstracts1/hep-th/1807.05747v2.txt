Energy and momentum conservation in the context of a type II, purely transmitting, defect, within a single scalar relativistic two-dimensional field theory, places a severe constraint not only on the nature of the defect but also on the potentials for the scalar fields to either side of it. The constraint is of an unfamiliar type since it requires the Poisson Bracket of the defect contributions to energy and momentum with respect to the defect discontinuity and its conjugate to be balanced by the potential difference across the defect. It is shown that the only solutions to the constraint correspond to the known integrable field theories.
