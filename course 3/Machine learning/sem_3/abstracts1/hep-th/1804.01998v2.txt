We consider the worldsheet S matrix of superstrings on an AdS3xS3xT4 NS-NS background in uniform light-cone gauge. We argue that scattering is given by a CDD factor that is non-trivial only between opposite-chirality particles, yielding a spin-chain-like Bethe Ansatz. Our proposal reproduces the spectrum of non-protected states computed from the Wess-Zumino-Witten description and the perturbative tree-level S matrix. This suggests that the model is an integrable deformation of a free theory similar to those arising from the T-Tbar composite operator.
