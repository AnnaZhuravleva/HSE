We obtain a charged black lens solution in the five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a positive cosmological constant. It is shown that the solution obtained here describes the formation of a black hole with the spatial cross section of a sphere from that of the lens space of L(n,1) in five-dimensional de Sitter space.
