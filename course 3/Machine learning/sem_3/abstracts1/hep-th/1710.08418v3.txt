We combine supersymmetric localization and the conformal bootstrap to study five-dimensional superconformal field theories. To begin, we classify the admissible counter-terms and derive a general relation between the five-sphere partition function and the conformal and flavor central charges. Along the way, we discover a new superconformal anomaly in five dimensions. We then propose a precise triple factorization formula for the five-sphere partition function, that incorporates instantons and is consistent with flavor symmetry enhancement. We numerically evaluate the central charges for the rank-one Seiberg and Morrison-Seiberg theories, and find strong evidence for their saturation of bootstrap bounds, thereby determining the spectra of long multiplets in these theories. Lastly, our results provide new evidence for the $F$-theorem and possibly a $C$-theorem in five-dimensional superconformal theories.
