We argue that the currently accepted method of constructing effective theories resulting from spontaneous breaking of spacetime symmetries in the coset space framework is misleading. Namely, we provide an example of a theory that requires the usage of the Inverse Higgs Constraints in obtaining its low energy description, but the imposition of which makes it impossible to reproduce the full effective Lagrangian. Based on the method of induced representations, we revisit the application of the coset space technique to spontaneous breakdown of spacetime symmetries. This allows us to establish a classical analog of the Goldstone theorem and to show that some of the Nambu-Goldstone fields are necessarily gapped. Our results disprove the role of IHC as a universal tool of eliminating unphysical degrees of freedom from the low energy content of a theory, and suggest a new method of building the effective description within the coset space formalism.
