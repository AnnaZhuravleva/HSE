I consider a theory of a real scalar and a fermion field, with a Yukawa interaction and a potential term that admits two degenerate minima at the tree level. The quantum vacuum energy difference between these two vacua can be calculated using the renormalization group improved effective potential, and gives a finite, non-zero result, dependent on the relative strength of the scalar and the Yukawa interactions.
