We study the holographic entanglement entropy of spatial regions with corners in the AdS4/BCFT3 correspondence by considering three dimensional boundary conformal field theories whose boundary is a timelike plane. We compute analytically the corner function corresponding to an infinite wedge having one edge on the boundary. A relation between this corner function and the holographic one point function of the stress tensor is observed. An analytic expression for the corner function of an infinite wedge having only its tip on the boundary is also provided. This formula requires to find the global minimum among two extrema of the area functional. The corresponding critical configurations of corners are studied. The results have been checked against a numerical analysis performed by computing the area of the minimal surfaces anchored to some finite domains containing corners.
