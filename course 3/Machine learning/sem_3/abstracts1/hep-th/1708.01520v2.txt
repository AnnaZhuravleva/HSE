In this paper, by taking de Sitter space-time as a thermodynamic system, we study the equivalent thermodynamic quantities of de Sitter black hole in massive gravity, and furthermore obtain the equivalent thermodynamic quantities of the space-time. Our results show that the entropy of this type of space-time takes the same form as that in Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter space-time, which lays a solid foundation for deeply understanding the universal thermodynamic characteristics of de Sitter space-time in the future. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the equivalent thermodynamic quantities and relevant parameters play a very important role, especially in the investigation of the stability and evolution of de Sitter space-time.
