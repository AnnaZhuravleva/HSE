We study meson decays using instanton methods in two string models. The first model is the old string model in flat space which combines strings and massive particles and the second is the holographic, Sakai-Sugimoto model. Using the the old string model, we reproduce the QCD formula for the probability of splitting of the QCD flux tube derived by Casher-Neuberger-Nussinov (CNN). In the holographic model we construct a string worldsheet instanton which interpolates between a single and double string configuration, which determines the decay from one to two dual mesonic particles. The resulting probability for meson decay incorporates both the effects of finite meson size as well as back-reaction of the produced quarks on the QCD flux tube. In the limit of very large strings the probability for a split reduces to the CNN formula. A byproduct of our analysis is the analysis of the moduli space of a generic double concentric Wilson loop with circles which are separated in the holographic direction of the confining background.
