Pseudo-supersymmetric solutions of minimal $N=2$, $D=4$ de Sitter supergravity are classified using spinorial geometry techniques. We find three classes of solutions. The first class of solution consists of geometries which are fibrations over a 3-dimensional manifold equipped with a Gauduchon-Tod structure. The second class of solution is the cosmological Majumdar-Papapetrou solution of Kastor and Traschen, and the third corresponds to gravitational waves propagating in the Nariai cosmology.
