We study worldsheet theory of confining strings in two-dimensional massive adjoint QCD. Similarly to confining strings in higher dimensions this theory exhibits a non-trivial $S$-matrix surviving even in the strict planar limit. In the process of two-particle scattering a zigzag is formed on the worldsheet. It leads to an interesting non-locality and exhibits some properties of a quantum black hole. Ordinarily, identical quantum particles do not carry identity. On the worldsheet they acquire off-shell identity due to strings attached. Identity implies complementarity. We discuss similarities and differences of the worldsheet scattering with the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We also propose a promising candidate for a supersymmetric model with integrable confining strings.
