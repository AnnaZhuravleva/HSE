We study possible applications of artificial neural networks to examine the string landscape. Since the field of application is rather versatile, we propose to dynamically evolve these networks via genetic algorithms. This means that we start from basic building blocks and combine them such that the neural network performs best for the application we are interested in. We study three areas in which neural networks can be applied: to classify models according to a fixed set of (physically) appealing features, to find a concrete realization for a computation for which the precise algorithm is known in principle but very tedious to actually implement, and to predict or approximate the outcome of some involved mathematical computation which performs too inefficient to apply it, e.g. in model scans within the string landscape. We present simple examples that arise in string phenomenology for all three types of problems and discuss how they can be addressed by evolving neural networks from genetic algorithms.
