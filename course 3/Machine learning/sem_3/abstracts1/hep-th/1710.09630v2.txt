In this paper, we have analytically computed the conductivity of holographic superconductors in the framework of Born-Infeld electrodynamics taking into account the backreaction of the matter fields on the bulk spacetime metric. The effect of the Born-Infeld electrodynamics is incorporated in the metric. The band gap energy is found to be corrected by the backreaction and Born-Infeld parameters. The conductivity expression is then compared with that obtained from a self consistent approach.
