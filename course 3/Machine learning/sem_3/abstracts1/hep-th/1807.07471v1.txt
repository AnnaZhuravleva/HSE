The Symmetries of Feynman Integrals method (SFI) associates a natural Lie group with any diagram, depending only on its topology. The group acts on parameter space and the method determines the integral's dependence within group orbits. This paper analyzes the two-loop vacuum diagram. It is shown how the solution of the SFI equations practically reproduces the most general value of the integral. On the way certain novel derivations are found, a geometrical interpretation is described, and divergences in general dimension are analyzed. These would hopefully be useful for engaging with more involved diagrams.
