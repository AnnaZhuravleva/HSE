In this paper, we consider deformed STU model in four dimensions including both electric and magnetic charges. Using AdS/CFT correspondence, we study holographic superconductor and obtain transport properties like electrical and thermal conductivities. We obtain transport properties in terms of the black hole magnetic charge and interpret it as magnetic monopole of dual field theory. We find that presence of magnetic charge is necessary to have maximum conductivities, and existence of magnetic monopole with a critical charge (137 e) to reach the maximum superconductivity is important. Also, we show that thermal conductivity increases with increasing of magnetic charge. It may be concluded that the origin of superconductivity is magnetic monopole.
