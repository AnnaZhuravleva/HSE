In this paper, we develop a rather general way to reduce integrands with polarization involved in the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulae, such as the reduced Pfaffian, its compactiffcation and its squeezing, as well as the new object for F^3 amplitude. We prove that the reduced Pfaffian vanishes unless evaluated on a certain set of solutions. It leads us to build up the 4d CHY formulae using spinors, which strains off many useless solutions. The supersymmetrization is straightforward and may provide a hint to understand ambitwistor string in 4d.
