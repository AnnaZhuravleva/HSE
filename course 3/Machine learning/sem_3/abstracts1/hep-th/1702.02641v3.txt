A two-dimensional Sp($2N$) vector model with small $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry is formulated, and its chiral algebra is shown to be generated by superprimary fields of even conformal weight. This vector model is the large level limit of a coset theory with large $\mathcal{N}=4$, whose proposed AdS$_3$ dual is a minimal Vasiliev higher spin theory with gauge algebra generated by fields of even spin. The relation of this vector model to the symmetric product orbifold, dual to tensionless strings in AdS$_3$ $\times$ S$^3$ $\times$ $\mathbb{T}^4$, is also worked out.
