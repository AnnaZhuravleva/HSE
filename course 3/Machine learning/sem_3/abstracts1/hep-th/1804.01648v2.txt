Recently, it is found that when an external magnetic field parallel to the boundary is applied, Weyl anomaly gives rises to a new anomalous current transport in the vicinity of the boundary. At the leading order of closeness from the boundary, the current is determined universally by the central charge of the theory. In this paper, we give a holographic proof for the existence and universality for this transport phenomena. We show that the current is independent of boundary conditions in four dimensions while it depends on boundary conditions in other dimensions. We also study the backreaction of the bulk Maxwell fields on the AdS spacetime and obtain the holographic Weyl anomaly for 5d BCFTs in presence of the background field strength.
