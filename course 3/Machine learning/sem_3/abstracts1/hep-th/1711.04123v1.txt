We explain a new method for finding the correlation functions for the XXX model which is based on the concepts of Operator Product Expansion of Quantum Field Theory on one hand and of fermionic bases for the XXX spin chain on the other. With this method we are able to perform computations for up to 11 lattice sites. We show that these "experimental" data allow to guess exact formulae for the OPE coefficients.
