The dynamics of bouncing universes is characterized by violating certain coordinate invariant restrictions on the total energy-momentum tensor, customarily referred to as energy conditions. Although there could be epochs where the null energy condition is locally violated, it may perhaps be enforced in an averaged sense. Explicit examples of this possibility are investigated in different frameworks.
