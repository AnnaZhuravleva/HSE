Collisions and subsequent decays of higher dimensional branes leave behind three-dimensional branes and anti-branes, one of which could play the role of our universe. This process also leads to the production of one-dimensional branes and anti-branes, however their number is expected to be suppressed. Brane collisions may also lead to the formation of bound states of branes. Their existence does not alter this result, it just allows for the existence of one-dimensional branes captured within the three-dimensional ones.
