We define melonic field theories over the $p$-adic numbers with the help of a sign character. Our construction works over the reals as well as the $p$-adics, and it includes the fermionic and bosonic Klebanov-Tarnopolsky models as special cases; depending on the sign character, the symmetry group of the field theory can be either orthogonal or symplectic. Analysis of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function in the leading melonic limit shows that power law scaling behavior in the infrared arises for fermionic theories when the sign character is non-trivial, and for bosonic theories when the sign character is trivial. In certain cases, the Schwinger-Dyson equation can be solved exactly using a quartic polynomial equation, and the solution interpolates between the ultraviolet scaling controlled by the spectral parameter and the universal infrared scaling. As a by-product of our analysis, we see that melonic field theories defined over the real numbers can be modified by replacing the time derivative by a bilocal kinetic term with a continuously variable spectral parameter. The infrared scaling of the resulting two-point function is universal, independent of the spectral parameter of the ultraviolet theory.
