We propose a cosmological model which exhibits the phenomenon of self-acceleration: the Universe is attracted to the phase of accelerated expansion at late times even in the absence of the cosmological constant. The self-acceleration is inevitable in the sense that it cannot be neutralized by any negative explicit cosmological constant. The model is formulated in the framework of brane-world theories with a warped extra dimension. The key ingredient of the model is the brane-bulk energy transfer which is carried by bulk vector fields with a sigma-model-like boundary condition on the brane. We explicitly find the 5-dimensional metric corresponding to the late-time de Sitter expansion on the brane; this metric describes an AdS_5 black hole with growing mass. The present value of the Hubble parameter implies the scale of new physics of order 1 TeV, where the proposed model has to be replaced by putative UV-completion. The mechanism leading to the self-acceleration has AdS/CFT interpretation as occurring due to specific dynamics of conformal matter interacting with external "electric" fields. The Universe expansion history predicted by the model is distinguishable from the standard LambdaCDM cosmology.
