By replacing the field of complex numbers with the commutative ring of bicomplex numbers, we attempt to construct interacting scalar quantum field theories that feature both positive- and negative-energy states. This work places the tentative ideas proposed in [R. Dickinson, J. Forshaw and P. Millington, J. Phys. Conf. Ser. 631 (2015) 012059] on more solid and general mathematical foundations and incorporates the "energy-parity" symmetry introduced in [A. D. Linde, Phys. Lett. B 200 (1988) 272; D. E. Kaplan and R. Sundrum, JHEP 0607 (2006) 042]. The interplay of the positive- and negative-energy states allows for cancellations of the vacuum energy. Both the positive- and negative-energy states have positive norms, and their direct mixing is prevented by virtue of the zero divisors of the bicomplex numbers, thereby eliminating the possibility of negative-energy cascades. We suggest that the same interplay of positive- and negative-energy states may allow Haag's theorem to be circumvented, removing the associated criticism of the Fock representation. We consider scalar theories with cubic and quartic interactions and describe how this construction may yield transition probabilities consistent with the standard scattering theory. Whilst these results are intriguing, we draw attention to potentially serious limitations in relation to perturbative unitarity.
