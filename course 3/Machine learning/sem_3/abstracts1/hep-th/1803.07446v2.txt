In this paper, we investigate the thermal effect on the Casimir energy associated with a massive scalar quantum field confined between two large parallel plates in a CPT-even, aether-like Lorentz-breaking scalar field theory. In order to do that we consider a nonzero chemical potential for the scalar field assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at some finite temperature. The calculations of the energies are developed by using the Abel-Plana summation formula, and the corresponding results are analyzed in several asymptotic regimes of the parameters of the system, like mass, separations between the plates and temperature.
