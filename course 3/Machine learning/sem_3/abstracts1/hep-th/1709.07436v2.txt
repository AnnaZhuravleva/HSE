We investigate the short distance fate of distinct classes of not asymptotically free supersymmetric gauge theories. Examples include super QCD with two adjoint fields and generalised superpotentials, gauge theories without superpotentials and with two types of matter representation and semi-simple gauge theories such as quivers. We show that for the aforementioned theories asymptotic safety is nonperturbatively compatible with all known constraints.
