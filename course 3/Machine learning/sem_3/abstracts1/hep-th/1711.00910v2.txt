Using the heat kernel method, we compute nonrelativistic trace anomalies for Schr\"odinger theories in flat spacetime, with a generic background gauge field for the particle number symmetry, both for a free scalar and a free fermion. The result is genuinely nonrelativistic, and it has no counterpart in the relativistic case. Contrary to the naive expectations, the anomaly is not gauge-invariant; this is similar to the non-gauge covariance of the non-abelian relativistic anomaly. We also show that, in the same background, the gravitational anomaly for a nonrelativistic scalar vanishes.
