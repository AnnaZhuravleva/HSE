We explore the physics of two-body decay of BPS states using semiclassical analysis to construct explicit solutions that illustrate the main features of wall crossing, for both ordinary and framed BPS states. In particular we recover the primitive wall-crossing formula from an asymptotic analysis of certain Dirac-type operators on monopole moduli spaces. Along the way we give an asymptotic metric for the moduli space of singular monopoles, analogous to the Gibbons-Manton and Lee-Weinberg-Yi metrics for the moduli space of smooth monopoles, and we find evidence for the existence of stable non-BPS boundstates. Our discussion applies to four-dimensional N = 2 super-Yang-Mills theories with general gauge group and general 't Hooft defects.
