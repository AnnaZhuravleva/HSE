The holographic relation between quantum correlations and connectivity of spacetime is explored for single R-charged AdS$_5$ black holes and their half-BPS limits (superstars). In a two boundary set-up, the wormhole between both universes reduces to a designable and computable quantum mechanical correlation between the dual microscopic degrees of freedom in the BPS limit. This quantum connectivity is seen as a naked singularity by a single sided observer. In a single boundary set-up, as a small step towards the description of entangled black holes, we describe quantum teleportation between two labs in different locations of the transverse 5-sphere using entangled gravitons in a reference state that provides a classical channel between both labs.
