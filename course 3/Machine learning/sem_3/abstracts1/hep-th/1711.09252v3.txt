In this paper we have found a classical giant magnon-like solution with both infinite and finite angular momentum moving in Sch_5 x S^5 with B-field, which is believed to be dual to dipole-deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. This string state propagates as a point particle in non-trivial subspace of the Sch_5 space but shows a giant magnon-like property in the S^2 subspace. We derive the energy-momentum dispersion relations and their finite-size correction for the case of finite but large angular momentum.
