We obtain general results on the dynamics of exactly conical geometries, where we use the notion of boundaries at infinity to characterize asymptotic behavior. As we demonstrate in examples, these notions also apply to smooth geometries that are merely asymptotically conical, such as the Eguchi-Hanson or resolved conifold geometries. In these cases we obtain a rather complete qualitative understanding of the varieties of asymptotic behavior, and we probe the connectivity of the phase space by finding infinitely large families of multiple geodesics connecting a point on the infinite past boundary with a point in the infinite future boundary.
