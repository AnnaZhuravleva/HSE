We consider a neutral and static black brane background with a probe power-law Maxwell field. Via the membrane paradigm, an expression for the holographic DC conductivity of the dual conserved current is obtained. We also discuss the dependence of the DC conductivity on the temperature, charge density and spatial components of the external field strength in the boundary theory. Our results show that there might be more than one phase in the boundary theory. Phase transitions could occur where the DC conductivity or its derivatives are not continuous. Specifically, we find that one phase possesses a charge-conjugation symmetric contribution, negative magneto-resistance and Mott-like behavior.
