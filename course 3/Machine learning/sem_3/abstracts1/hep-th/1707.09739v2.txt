In this paper, we discuss the noncommutative QED$_2$ in the S-matrix framework. We are interested in perturbatively proving that the exact Schwinger mass $\mu^2=\frac{e^2}{\pi}$ does not receive noncommutative corrections to any order in loop expansion. In this sense, the S-matrix approach is useful since it allows us to work with the effective action $\Gamma[A]$ (interaction term) to compute the corresponding gauge field 1PI two-point function at higher orders. Furthermore, by means of $\alpha^*$-cohomology, we generalize the QED$_2$ S-matrix analysis in the Moyal star product to all translation-invariant star products.
