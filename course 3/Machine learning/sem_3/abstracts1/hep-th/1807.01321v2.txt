We use 3d bosonization dualities to derive new non-supersymmetric dualities between bosonic quiver theories in $2+1$ dimensions. It is shown that such dualities are a natural non-Abelian generalization of the bosonic particle-vortex duality. A special case of such dualities is applicable to Chern-Simons theories living on interfaces in $3+1$ dimensional $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory across which the theta angle jumps. We also analyze such interfaces in a holographic construction which provides further evidence for novel dualities between quiver gauge theories and gauge theories with adjoint scalars. These conjectured dualities pass some stringent consistency tests.
