We show that F-theory compactifications with abelian gauge factors generally exhibit a non-trivial global gauge group structure. The geometric origin of this structure lies with the Shioda map of the Mordell--Weil generators. This results in constraints on the U(1) charges of non-abelian matter consistent with observations made throughout the literature. In particular, we find that F-theory models featuring the Standard Model algebra actually realise the precise gauge group [SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)]/Z6. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the gauge group structure and geometric (un-)higgsing. In an explicit class of models, we show that, depending on the global group structure, an SU(2)xU(1) gauge theory can either unhiggs into an SU(2)xSU(2) or an SU(3)xSU(2) theory. We also study implications of the charge constraints as a criterion for the F-theory 'swampland'.
