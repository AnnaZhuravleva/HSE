We generalize the concept of Borel resummability and renormalons to a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of fields and couplings, starting from the known notion based on the running coupling constants. An approach to identify the renormalons is provided by exploiting an analytic solution of the generic one-loop renormalization group equations in multi-field theories. Methods to evaluate the regions in coupling space where the theory is resummable are described. The generalization is then illustrated in a toy model with two coupled scalar fields, representing the simplest extension of the one-field analysis presented in the seminal works of the subject. Furthermore, possible links to realistic theories are briefly discussed.
