We consider a probe stable meson in the holographic quark-gluon plasma at zero temperature and chemical potential. Due to the energy injection into the plasma, the temperature and chemical potential are increased to arbitrary finite values and the meson is also excited. Excitation time tex is the time at which the meson falls into the final excited state. We study the effect of various parameters of theory on the excitation time and observe that for larger values of final temperature and chemical potential the excitation time increases. Furthermore, our outcomes show that the more stable mesons are excited sooner.
