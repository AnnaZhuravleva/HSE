We use the techniques of integral forms to analyse the easiest example of two dimensional sigma models on a supermanifold. We write the action as an integral of a top integral form over a D=2 supermanifold and we show how to interpolate between different superspace actions. Then, we consider curved supermanifolds and we show that the definitions used for flat supermanifold can also be used for curved supermanifolds. We prove it by first considering the case of a curved rigid supermanifold and then the case of a generic curved supermanifold described by a single superfield $E$.
