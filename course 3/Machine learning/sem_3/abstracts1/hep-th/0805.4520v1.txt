We investigate how eternal inflation is affected by quantum gravity effects. We consider general features of quantum gravity, such as renormalizability, complementarity, minimal length, definition of observables, and weak gravity conjecture. We also consider phenomenological models such as ghost inflation, non-commutative inflation, brane inflation, k-inflation and resonant tunneling. We find that all these features and models do not support eternal inflation. These evidences show hints that eternal inflation is prohibited by quantum gravity.
