In this Letter, based on the notion of Gauge/Gravity duality we explore the low frequency behaviour associated with the retarded two point correlators in the ground state of the strongly correlated quantum liquid that is dual to $ \eta $- deformed background in ($ 2+1 $)D. The massless charge carriers in the dual gauge theory are sourced due to some \textit{probe} $ N_f $ flavour $ Dp $ brane configurations in the bulk. In our analysis we stick to the NS sector and compute the two point correlators by turning on fluctuations associated with the worldvolume gauge fields in the bulk spacetime. Our analysis reveals the existence of holographic zero sound modes for ($ 1+1 $)D QFTs those are dual to bosonic $ \eta $ deformed $ AdS_3 \times S^{3} $ with vanishing RR fields.
