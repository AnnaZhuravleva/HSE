Wigner rotations are transformations that affect spinning particles and cause the observable phenomenon of Thomas precession. Here we study these rotations for arbitrary symmetry groups with a semi-direct product structure. In particular we establish a general link between Wigner rotations and Thomas precession by relating the latter to the holonomies of a certain Berry connection on a momentum orbit. Along the way we derive a formula for infinitesimal, Lie-algebraic transformations of one-particle states.
