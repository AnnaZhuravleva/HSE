We perform the canonical formulation of the conformal Horava theory at the classical level. The conformal symmetry is anisotropic in the sense that the lapse function transform with a weight different to the spatial metric. The conformal theory shares some similarities with the the kinetic-conformal theory that has been studied previously. The difference is that the latter does not have a conformal potential hence the theory is not conformal. In contrasting these two theories, we point out the change from second-class to first-class of the generator of the conformal transformations. We obtain the interesting result that the conformal theory propagates the same number of degrees of freedom that the kinetic-conformal theory, which in turn are the same of General Relativity. This is due to the fact that the kinetic-conformal case has two additional second-class constraints whereas the conformal case has one first-class constraint and an extra gauge symmetry. We also study and find anisotropic conformally flat solutions in the kinetic-conformal theory explicitly.
