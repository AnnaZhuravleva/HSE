In this work we consider kink-antikink and antikink-kink collisions in a hybrid model. The potential has two topological sectors connecting adjacent minima, so it simulates the $\phi^6$ model. However, in each topological sector, the potential is symmetric around the local maximum and the perturbed static kink solutions have translational and one vibrational mode, so it simulates the $\phi^4$ model. The two-bounce windows for antikink-kink collisions can be explained by the mechanism of Campbell-Schonfeld-Wingate (CSW) resonant transfer of energy between translational to vibrational mode. The high degree of symmetry of the potential leads, for kink-antikink collisions, to a new structure of bounce windows. In particular, depending on the initial velocity, one can have oscillations of the scalar field at the center of mass even for one bounce, or a change of topological sector. We show how a modified CSW mechanism can be used to explain some of the results.
