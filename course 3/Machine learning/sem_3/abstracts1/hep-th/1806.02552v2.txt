In the paper, within the background-field method, the structure of renormalizations is studied as for Yang-Mills fields interacting with a multiplet of spinor fields. By extending the Faddeev-Popov action with extra fields and parameters, one is allowed to establish the multiplicative character of the renormalizability. The renormalization of the physical parameters is shown to be gauge-independent.
