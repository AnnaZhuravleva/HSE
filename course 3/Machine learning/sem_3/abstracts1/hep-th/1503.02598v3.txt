The first and second order form of gauge theories are classically equivalent; we consider the consequence of quantizing the first order form using the Faddeev-Popov approach. Both the Yang-Mills and the Einstein-Hilbert actions are considered. An advantage of this approach is that the interaction vertices are quite simple, being independent of momenta. It is necessary however to consider the propagator for two fields (including a mixed propagator). We derive the Feynman rules for both models and consider the one loop correction for the thermal energy momentum tensor.
