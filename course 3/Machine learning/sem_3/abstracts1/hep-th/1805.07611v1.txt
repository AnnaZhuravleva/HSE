We present a prescription for using the a central charge to determine the flow of a strongly coupled supersymmetric theory from its weakly coupled dual. The approach is based on the equivalence of the scale-dependent a-parameter derived from the four-dilaton amplitude with the a-parameter determined from the Lagrange multiplier method with scale-dependent R-charges. We explicitly demonstrate this equivalence for massive free N=1 superfields and for weakly coupled SQCD.
