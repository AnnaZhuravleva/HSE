Imposing the conservation equation of the vector current for a fermion of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ at the quantum level, a gauge anomaly for the fermion coupling with non-Abelian vector and axial--vector fields in six--dimensional curved space is expressed in tensorial form. The anomaly consists of terms that resemble the chiral U(1) anomaly and the commutator terms that disappear if the axial--vector field is Abelian.
