The entropic force has been recently argued to be responsible for dissociation of heavy quarkonia. In this paper, we analyze $R^2$ corrections and $R^4$ corrections to the entropic force, respectively. It is shown that for $R^2$ corrections, increasing $\lambda_{GB}$ (Gauss-Bonnet factor) leads to increasing the entropic force. While for $R^4$ corrections, increasing $\lambda$ ('t Hooft coupling) leads to decreasing the entropic force. Also, we discuss how the entropic force changes with the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, at strong coupling.
