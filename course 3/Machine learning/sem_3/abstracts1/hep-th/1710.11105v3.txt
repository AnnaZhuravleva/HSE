Can the holographic principle be extended beyond the well known AdS/CFT correspondence? During the last couple of years there has been a substantial amount of research trying to find answers for this question. In this work we provide a review of recent developments of three-dimensional theories of gravity with higher-spin symmetries. We focus in particular on a proposed holographic duality involving asymptotically flat spacetimes and higher spin extended $\mathfrak{bms}_3$ symmetries. In addition we also discuss developments concerning relativistic and nonrelativistic higher spin algebras. As a special case Carroll gravity will be discussed in detail.
