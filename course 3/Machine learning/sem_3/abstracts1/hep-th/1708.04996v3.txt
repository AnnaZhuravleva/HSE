The chiral algebra of the symmetric product orbifold of a single-boson CFT corresponds to a "higher spin square" algebra in the large $N$ limit. In this note, we show that a symmetrized collection of $N$ bosons defines a similar structure that we refer to as the higher spin rectangle algebra. We explore the relation of this algebra to the higher spin square algebra. The existence of such a truncated algebra hints at bulk theories interpolating between Vasiliev higher spin theory and string theory.
