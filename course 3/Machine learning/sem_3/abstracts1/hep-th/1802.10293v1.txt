Starting from Utiyama and de Witt, attempts are being made to renormalize Einstein-Hilbert action. The renormalization of general relativity at one-loop demands introduction of higher-order curvature terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The current cosmological and astrophysical observations suggest modification to gravity in the large and small length scales. $f(R)$ theories of gravity have been popular owing to its simplicity and avoiding Ostr\"ogradsky instability. In this work, we investigate the perturbative nature of $f(R)$ gravity theories in the light-cone gauge. The advantage of working in light-cone coordinates is that it yields action containing only the physical fields. Owing to the new dynamics and to remove the extra scalar propagating mode, we make a new gauge choice. With this new gauge choice, we obtain higher derivative quartic interaction of these models both in the real and helicity basis. We show explicitly that the expressions involve only the two polarization modes. We discuss the implications of the results for KLT relation and computing MHV amplitudes.
