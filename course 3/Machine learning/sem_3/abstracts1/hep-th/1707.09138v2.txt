We discuss a general method of constructing the products of composite operators using the exact renormalization group formalism. Considering mainly the Wilson action at a generic fixed point of the renormalization group, we give an argument for the validity of short distance expansions of operator products. We show how to compute the expansion coefficients by solving differential equations, and test our method with some simple examples.
