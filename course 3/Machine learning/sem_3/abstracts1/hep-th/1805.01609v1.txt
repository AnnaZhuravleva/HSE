In previous works, we have demonstrated that the path integral for {\it real, Lorentzian} four-geometries in Einstein gravity yields sensible results in well-understood physical situations, but leads to unstable fluctuations when the "no boundary" condition proposed by Hartle and Hawking is imposed. In order to circumvent our result, new definitions for the gravitational path integral have been sought, involving specific choices for a class of {\it complex} four-geometries to be included. In their latest proposal, Diaz Dorronsoro et al. (arXiv:1804.01102) advocate integrating the lapse over a complex circular contour enclosing the origin. In this note we show that, like their earlier proposal, this leads to mathematical and physical inconsistencies and thus cannot be regarded as a basis for quantum cosmology.
