We construct a nearly-$AdS_2$ solution describing an eternal traversable wormhole. The solution contains negative null energy generated by quantum fields under the influence of an external coupling between the two boundaries. In parallel, we discuss two SYK systems coupled by a relevant interaction. The physics of the two cases is very similar. They both share a "gravitational" subsector which is identical. The solution within this subsector sets the stage for dynamics which is almost conformal invariant. We study this system in detail, both in gravity and in the SYK model. The coupled SYK models have an interesting phase diagram at finite temperature, displaying the usual Hawking-Page transition between the thermal AdS phase at low temperature and the black hole phase at high temperature. Interestingly, these two phases are continuously connected in the microcannonical ensemble.
