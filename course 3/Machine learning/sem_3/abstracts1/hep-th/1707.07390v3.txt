We propose new off-shell models for spontaneously broken local ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry, in which the supergravity multiplet couples to nilpotent Goldstino superfields that contain either a gauge one-form or a gauge two-form in addition to spin-1/2 Goldstone fermions and auxiliary fields. In the case of ${\cal N}=2$ Poincar\'e supersymmetry, we elaborate on the concept of twisted chiral superfields and present a nilpotent ${\cal N}=2$ superfield that underlies the cubic nilpotency conditions given in arXiv:1707.03414 in terms of constrained ${\cal N}=1$ superfields.
