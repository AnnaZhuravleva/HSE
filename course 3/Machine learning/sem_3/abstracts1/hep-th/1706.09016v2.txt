The 2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)^*$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be obtained from the 2D $\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ theory with a twisted mass deformation. In this paper we construct the gravity dual theory of the 2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)^*$ supersymmetric $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory at the large $N$ and large 't Hooft coupling limit using the 5D gauged supergravity. In the UV regime, this construction also provides the gravity dual of the 2D $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)^*$ $U(N)$ topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. We propose a triality in the UV regime among integrable model, gauge theory and gravity, and we make some checks of this relation at classical level.
