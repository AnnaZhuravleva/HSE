It has been shown that in larger than four space-time dimensions, soft factors that relate the amplitudes with a soft photon or graviton to amplitudes without the soft particle also determine the low frequency radiative part of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields during classical scattering. In four dimensions the S-matrix becomes infrared divergent making the usual definition of the soft factor ambiguous beyond the leading order. However the radiative parts of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields provide an unambiguous definition of soft factor in the classical limit up to the usual gauge ambiguity. We show that the soft factor defined this way develops terms involving logarithm of the energy of the soft particle at the subleading order in the soft expansion.
