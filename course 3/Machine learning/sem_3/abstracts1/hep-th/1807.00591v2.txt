We study top-down embeddings of massive Anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity in type-IIB string theory. The supergravity solutions have a AdS$_4$ fiber warped over a manifold M$_6$ whose shape resembles that of scottish bagpipes: The `bag' is a conventional AdS$_4$-compactification manifold, while the `pipes' are highly-curved semi-infinite Janus throats. Besides streamlining previous discussions of the problem, our main new result is a formula for the graviton mass which only depends on the effective gravitational coupling of the bag, and on the D3-brane charges and dilaton jumps of the Janus throats. We compare these embeddings to the Karch-Randall model and other bottom-up proposals for massive-AdS-gravity, and we comment on their holographic interpretation. This is a companion paper to [1], where some closely-related bimetric models with pure AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ throats were analyzed.
