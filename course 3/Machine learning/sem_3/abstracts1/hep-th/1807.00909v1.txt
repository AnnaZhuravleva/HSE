Background field method, a method preserves gauge invariance explicitly, in this paper is used to calculate the beta function of scalar quantum electrodynamics in the larger-$N_f$ approximation. Our calculation carried out with an arbitrary gauge-fixing parameter $\alpha$ has been done up to order $1/N_f$, and the result of our calculation is independent of the gauge-fixing parameter $\alpha$. We also investigate the renormalon property of the beta function and that of the two point Green's functions which are closely related to the beta function, finding that the beta function is fully determined by a simple function and can be expressed as an analytic expression with a finite radius of convergence, and the scheme dependent renormalized Borel transform of the two point Green's function suffers from renormalons.
