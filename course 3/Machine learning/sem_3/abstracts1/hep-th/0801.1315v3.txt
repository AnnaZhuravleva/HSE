One of the challenges of constructing a successful cyclic universe scenario is to be able to incorporate the second law of thermodynamics which typically leads to Tolman's problem of ever shrinking cycles. In this paper we construct a non-singular toy model where as the cycles shrink in the past they also spend more and more time in the entropy conserving Hagedorn phase. Thus in such a scenario the entropy asymptotes to a finite non-zero constant in the infinite past. The universe ``emerges'' from a small (string size) geodesically complete quasi-periodic space-time. This paradigm also naturally addresses some of the classic puzzles of Big Bang cosmology, such as the largeness, horizon and flatness problems.
