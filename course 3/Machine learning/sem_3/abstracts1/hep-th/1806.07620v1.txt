In this paper we study compactifications of ADE type conformal matter, N M5 branes probing ADE singularity, on torus with flux for global symmetry. We systematically construct the four dimensional theories by first going to five dimensions and studying interfaces. We claim that certain interfaces can be associated with turning on flux in six dimensions. The interface models when compactified on a circle comprise building blocks for constructing four dimensional models associated to flux compactifications of six dimensional theories on a torus. The theories in four dimensions turn out to be quiver gauge theories and the construction implies many interesting cases of IR symmetry enhancements and dualities of such theories.
