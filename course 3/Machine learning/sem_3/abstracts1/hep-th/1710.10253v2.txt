We define and study various tensorial generalizations of the Gross-Neveu model in two dimensions, that is, models with four-fermion interactions and $G^3$ symmetry, where we take either $G=U(N)$ or $G=O(N)$. Such models can also be viewed as two-dimensional generalizations of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, or more precisely of its tensorial counterpart introduced by Klebanov and Tarnopolsky, which is in part our motivation for studying them. Using the Schwinger-Dyson equations at large-$N$, we discuss the phenomenon of dynamical mass generation and possible combinations of couplings to avoid it. For the case $G=U(N)$, we introduce an intermediate field representation and perform a stability analysis of the vacua. It turns out that the only apparently viable combination of couplings that avoids mass generation corresponds to an unstable vacuum. The stable vacuum breaks $U(N)^3$ invariance, in contradiction with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, but this is an artifact of the large-$N$ expansion, similar to the breaking of continuous chiral symmetry in the chiral Gross-Neveu model.
