Acting with non-Abelian T-duality on the $S^3$ inside the $AdS_5$ subspace of $AdS_5\times S^5$ with $N$ units of flux, we generate a new half-BPS solution with $SU(2|4)$ symmetry that belongs to the Lin-Lunin-Maldacena class of geometries. The analysis of the asymptotics, quantised charges and probe branes in this geometry suggests an interpretation as the gravity dual to the Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase Plane Wave Matrix Model, in a particular vacuum associated to a partition of $N$, in which the multiplicity of each $SU(2)$ irreducible representation is equal to its dimension. This vacuum is interpreted in M-theory in terms of giant gravitons backreacting in the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave geometry. Consistently with this, we show that the non-Abelian T-dual solution exactly agrees with the Penrose limit of the superstar solution in $AdS_7\times S^4$. This suggests an interesting global completion of the non-Abelian T-dual solution in terms of an M5-brane geometry.
