The field which binds a thermal fermionic cloud is defined as a Hartree integral upon its density. In turn, the density results from the field via a Thomas-Fermi occupation of the local phase space. This defines a complete theory of all properties and observables for the cloud. As an application to dark matter halos, comparisons with astronomic data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies are provided and discussed. Estimates of the elementary fermion mass are obtained, serving as a phase-space bound on fermionic dark matter.
