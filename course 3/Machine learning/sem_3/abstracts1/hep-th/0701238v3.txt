Cadabra is a new computer algebra system designed specifically for the solution of problems encountered in field theory. It has extensive functionality for tensor polynomial simplification taking care of Bianchi and Schouten identities, for fermions and anti-commuting variables, Clifford algebras and Fierz transformations, implicit coordinate dependence, multiple index types and many other field theory related concepts. The input format is a subset of TeX and thus easy to learn. Both a command-line and a graphical interface are available. The present paper is an introduction to the program using several concrete problems from gravity, supergravity and quantum field theory.
