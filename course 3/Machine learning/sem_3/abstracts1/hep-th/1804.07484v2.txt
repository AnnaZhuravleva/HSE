In this paper, we study the quantum behavior of the noncommutative Jackiw-Pi model. After establishing the Becchi-Rouet-Store-Tyutin (BRST) invariant action, the perturbative renormalizability is discussed, allowing us to introduce the renormalized mass and gauge coupling. We then proceed to compute the one-loop correction to the basic 1PI functions, necessary to determine the renormalized parameters (mass and charge), next we discuss the physical behaviour of these parameters.
