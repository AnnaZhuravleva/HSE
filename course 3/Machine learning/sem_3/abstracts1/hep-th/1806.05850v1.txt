We test a proposed mirror map at the level of correlators for linear models describing the (0,2) moduli space of superconformal field theories with a (2,2) locus associated to Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. We verify in non-trivial examples that the correlators are exchanged by the mirror map and we derive a correspondence between the observables of the A/2- and B/2-twisted theories. We also comment on the global structure of the (0,2) moduli space and present a simple non-renormalization argument for a large class of B/2 model subfamilies.
