We show how cosmological correlation functions of massless fields can be rewritten in terms of Minkowski correlation functions, by extracting symmetry-breaking operators from the cosmological correlators. This technique simplifies some cosmological calculations. Also, known properties of Minkowski correlation functions can be translated to non-trivial properties of cosmological correlations. To illustrate this idea, inflation to Minkowski and matter bounce to Minkowski relations are presented for the interactions of general single field inflation. And a Minkowski recursion relation is translated to a novel relation for inflation.
