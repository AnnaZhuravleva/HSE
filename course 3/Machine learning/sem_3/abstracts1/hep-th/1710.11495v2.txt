We present simple solutions of IKKT-type matrix models describing a quantized homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with $k=-1$, finite density of microstates and a resolved Big Bang. At late times, a linear coasting cosmology $a(t) \propto t$ is obtained, which is remarkably close to observation. The solution consists of two sheets with opposite intrinsic chiralities, which are connected in a Euclidean pre-big bang era.
