We consider reheating after inflation in theories with a non-standard kinetic term. We show that the equation that exhibits parametric resonance is the Hill-Whittaker equation, which is a particular case of the more general Hill equation. This equation is in general more unstable than the Mathieu equation, such that narrow resonance preheating may be efficient in theories with a non-canonical kinetic term.
