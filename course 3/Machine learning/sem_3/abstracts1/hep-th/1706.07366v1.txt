The main geometric ingredient of closed string field theory are the string vertices, the collections of string diagrams describing the elementary closed string interactions, satisfying the quantum Batalian-Vilkovisky master equation. They can be characterized using the Riemann surfaces endowed with metric solving the generalized minimal area problem. However, an adequately developed theory of such Riemann surfaces is not available yet, and consequently description of the string vertices via Riemann surfaces with the minimal area metric fails to provide practical tools for performing calculations. We describe an alternate construction of the string vertices satisfying the Batalian-Vilkovisky master equation using Riemann surfaces endowed with the metric having constant curvature $-1$ all over the surface. This is the first of a series of papers in which the authors attempt to provide a computable framework for the covariant quantum closed bosoinc string field theory based on hyperbolic geometry.
