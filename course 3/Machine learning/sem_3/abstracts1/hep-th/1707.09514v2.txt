In this paper, we explicitly construct a higher spin asymptotic $\mathcal{W}_5$ symmetry algebra of the three-dimensional anti-de Sitter$(AdS_3)$ gravity. We use a $\mathfrak{sl}(5,R) \oplus \mathfrak{sl}(5,R)$ Lie algebra valued Chern-Simons gauge theory coupled to three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant and its asymptotic symmetry algebra is explicitly calculated as two copies of the classical $\mathcal{W}_5$ algebra with central charge c. Our results can be interpreted as a spin $5$ extension of the $BTZ$ solution and a proof of how the higher spin Ward identities and as well as the asymptotic $\mathcal{W}_5$ symmetry algebra are derived from the higher spin bulk field equations of motion. This higher spin asymptotic $\mathcal{W}_5$ symmetry algebra contains a finite number of conformal primary spins: $s\,=\,2,\,3,\,4,\,5.$
