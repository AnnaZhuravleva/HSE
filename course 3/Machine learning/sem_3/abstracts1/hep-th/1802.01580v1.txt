A shift symmetry is a ubiquitous ingredient in inflationary models, both in effective constructions and in UV-finite embeddings such as string theory. It has also been proposed to play a key role in certain Dark Energy and Dark Matter models. Despite the crucial role it plays in cosmology, the observable, model independent consequences of a shift symmetry are yet unknown. Here, assuming an exact shift symmetry, we derive these consequences for single-clock cosmologies within the framework of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation. We find an infinite set of relations among the otherwise arbitrary effective coefficients, which relate non-Gaussianity to their time dependence. For example, to leading order in derivatives, these relations reduce the infinitely many free functions in the theory to just a single one. Our Effective Theory of shift-symmetric cosmologies describes, among other systems, perfect and imperfect superfluids coupled to gravity and driven superfluids in the decoupling limit. Our results are the first step to determine observationally whether a shift symmetry is at play in the laws of nature and whether it is broken by quantum gravity effects.
