We consider backreacted $AdS_5 \times S^5$ coupled with $N_f$ massless flavors introduced by D7-branes at non-zero temperature. The backreacted geometry is in the Veneziano limit. The temperature of this system is related to the event horizon at $r_h$. Dividing one of the spatial directions into a line segment with length $l$, we will calculate the entanglement entropy between the two subspaces. We study the behavior near the event horizon, and finally find that there exists phase transition phenomenon near the event horizon since the difference between the entanglement entropy of the connected minimal surface and the disconnected one changes sign.
