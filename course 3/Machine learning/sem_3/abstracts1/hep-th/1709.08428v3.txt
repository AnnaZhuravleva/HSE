We investigate an Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion holographic model and obtain two branches of a charged black hole solution with a dynamic exponent and a hyperscaling violation factor when a magnetic field presents. The magnetothermoelectric DC conductivities are then calculated in terms of horizon data by means of holographic principle. We find that linear temperature dependence resistivity and quadratic temperature dependence inverse Hall angle can be achieved in our model. The well-known anomalous temperature scaling of the Nernst signal and the Seebeck coefficient of cuprate strange metals are also discussed.
