The transition from formulations with extra dimensions to Kaluza-Klein theories, aimed at extending the Standard Model, bears the ingredients of hidden symmetries and the Kaluza-Klein mechanism for mass generation. We explore these essential aspects in detail, and find that much can be said about them with no reference to the specific geometry of compact extra dimensions: the low-energy theory is determined, included dynamic variables and symmetries; mass terms arise; eigenfunctions that define Kaluza-Klein fields are fixed by the appropriate choice a Casimir invariant; there is a set of Kaluza-Klein pseudo-Goldstone bosons. Throughout our presentation, similarities and differences among spontaneous symmetry breaking, commonly present in conventional Standard Model extensions, and what happens in Kaluza-Klein theories are signaled and discussed.
