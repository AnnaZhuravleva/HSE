We study the scattering of the $\varphi^8$ kinks off each other, namely, we consider those $\varphi^8$ kinks that have power-law asymptotics. The slow power-law fall-off leads to a long-range interaction between the kink and the antikink. We investigate how the scattering scenarios depend on the initial velocities of the colliding kinks. In particular, we observe the `escape windows' -- the escape of the kinks after two or more collisions, explained by the resonant energy exchange between the translational and vibrational modes. In order to elucidate this phenomenon, we also analyse the excitation spectra of a solitary kink and of a composite kink+antikink configuration.
