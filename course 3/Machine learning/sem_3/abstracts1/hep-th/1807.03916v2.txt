We introduce a family of partially entangled thermal states in the SYK model that interpolates between the thermo-field double state and a pure (product) state. The states are prepared by a euclidean path integral describing the evolution over two euclidean time segments separated by a local scaling operator $\mathcal{O}$. We argue that the holographic dual of this class of states consists of two black holes with their interior regions connected via a domain wall, described by the worldline of a massive particle. We compute the size of the interior region and the entanglement entropy as a function of the scale dimension of $\mathcal{O}$ and the temperature of each black hole. We argue that the one-sided bulk reconstruction can access the interior region of the black hole.
