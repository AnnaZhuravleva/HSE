We discuss the possibility to consider quark matter as the topological material. We consider hadronic phase (HP), the quark - gluon plasma phase (QGP), and the hypothetical color - flavor locking (CFL) phase. In those phases we identify the relevant topological invariants in momentum space. The formalism is developed, which relates those invariants and massless fermions that reside on vortices and at the interphases. This formalism is illustrated by the example of vortices in the CFL phase.
