We study F-theory duals of heterotic line bundle models on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds. These models necessarily contain NS5-branes which are geometrised in the dual F-theory compactifications. We initiate a systematic study of the correspondence between various configurations of NS5-branes and the dual geometries in F-theory and perform several checks of the duality. Furthermore, we discuss the singular transitions between different configurations of NS5-branes.
