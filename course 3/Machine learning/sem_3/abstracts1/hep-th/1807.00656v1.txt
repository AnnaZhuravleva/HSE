The question of the asymptotic form of the perturbation expansion in scalar field theories is reconsidered. Renewed interest in the computation of terms in the epsilon-expansion, used to calculate critical exponents, has been frustrated by the differing and incompatible results for the high-order behaviour of the perturbation expansion reported in the literature. We identify the sources of the errors made in earlier papers, correct them, and obtain a consistent set of results. We focus on phi^4 theory, since this has been the most studied and is the most widely used, but we also briefly discuss analogous results for phi^N theory, with N>4. This reexamination of the structure of perturbation expansions raises issues concerning the renormalisation of non-perturbative effects and the nature of the Feynman diagrams at large order, which we discuss.
