We consider the general gauge theory with a closed irreducible gauge algebra possessing the non-anomalous global (super)symmetry in the case when the gauge fixing procedure violates the global invariance of classical action. The theory is quantized in the framework of BRST-BV approach in the form of functional integral over all fields of the configuration space. It is shown that the global symmetry transformations are deformed in the process of quantization and the full quantum action is invariant under such deformed global transformations in the configuration space. The deformed global transformations are calculated in an explicit form in the one-loop approximation.
