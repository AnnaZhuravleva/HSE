We show that scattering amplitudes in magical, symmetric or homogeneous N=2 Maxwell-Einstein supergravities can be obtained as double copies of two gauge theories, using the framework of color/kinematics duality. The left-hand-copy is N=2 super-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a hypermultiplet, whereas the right-hand-copy is a non-supersymmetric theory that can be identified as the dimensional reduction of a D-dimensional Yang-Mills theory coupled to P fermions. For generic D and P, the double copy gives homogeneous supergravities. For P=1 and D=7,8,10,14, it gives the magical supergravities. We compute explicit amplitudes, discuss their soft limit and study the UV-behavior at one loop.
