In this paper, we propose a string theory description of generic 't Hooft defects in $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theories. We show that the space of supersymmetric ground states is given by the moduli space of singular monopoles and that in this setting, Kronheimer's correspondence is realized as T-duality. We conjecture that this brane configuration can be used to study the full dynamics of monopole bubbling.
