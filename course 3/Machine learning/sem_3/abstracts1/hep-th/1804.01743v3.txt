The microscopic structure of black holes remains a challenging subject. In this paper, based on the well-accepted fact that black holes can be mapped to thermodynamic systems, we make a preliminary exploration of the microscopic structure of the thermodynamically stable Schwarzschild anti-de-Sitter (SAdS) black hole. In accordance with the number density and thermodynamic scalar curvature, we give the interaction potential among the molecules of thermodynamically stable SAdS black holes and analyze its effectiveness. Moreover, we derive the thermo-correction to the equation of state for such black holes that arises from interactions among black-hole molecules using virial coefficients.
