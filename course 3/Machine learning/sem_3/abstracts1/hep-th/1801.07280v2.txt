Recently, Kabat and Lifschytz \cite{Kabat:2017mun} have prescribed a method to reconstruct local bulk operators from the modular Hamiltonian data of boundary subregions, \emph{without} a priori knowledge of the bulk metric or bulk equations of motion of the fields. In this work, we use their construction to formulate a recipe to extract the bulk metric itself. As a proof of principle, we consider three dimensional bulk and selected CFT states such as the vacuum and the thermofield double states. We show that they indeed reproduce the pure AdS and the regions outside the Rindler wedge and the BTZ black hole \emph{up to a constant conformal factor}. This is expected from a purely CFT construction. Our approach provides a CFT perspective of the bulk field redefinition ambuiguity, that even with the knowledge of the full field theory data (including modular Hamiltonians of subregions), it is possible to reproduce the metric only up to a conformal factor. We discuss several future applications, in particular a potential construction for operators and metric beyond the causal wedge of a boundary region.
