In $3d$ Chern-Simons theory, there is a discrete one-form symmetry, whose symmetry group is isomorphic to the center of the gauge group. We study the 't Hooft anomaly associated to this discrete one-form symmetry in theories with generic gauge groups, $A,B,C,D$-types. We propose to detect the discrete anomaly by computing the Hopf state entanglement in the subspace spanned by the symmetry generators and develop a systematical way based on the truncated modular S matrix. We check our proposal for many examples.
