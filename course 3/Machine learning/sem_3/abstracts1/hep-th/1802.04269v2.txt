In this work we study various aspects of six-dimensional ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ SCFTs. We consider the construction of their string duals in Massive IIA and discuss some observables in given examples. We study the dynamics of string solitons wrapping and rotating on the Massive IIA background and show that the associated Hamiltonian system is both non-integrable and chaotic, implying the non-integrability of the dual CFT. Our procedure is analytic, using well developed mathematical techniques, and numerical, by the explicit calculation of power spectra, Lyapunov coefficients and Poincar\'e sections.
