We compute the dynamical relaxation times for chiral transport phenomena in strongly coupled regime using the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relaxation times can be a useful proxy for the dynamical time scale for achieving equilibrium spin-polarization of quasi-particles in the presence of magnetic field and fluid vorticity. We identify the Kubo relations for these relaxation times and clarify some previous issues regarding time-dependence of the Chiral Vortical Effect. We study the consequences of imposing time-reversal invariance on parity-odd thermal noise fluctuations that are related to chiral transport coefficients by the fluctuation-dissipation relation. We find that time-reversal invariance dictates the equality between some of the chiral transport coefficients as well as their relaxation times.
