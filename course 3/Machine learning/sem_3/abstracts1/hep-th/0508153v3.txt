We describe correlations functions of topological quantum mechanics (TQM) in terms of Morse theory. We review the basics of topological field theories and discuss geometric and algebraic interpretations of TQM. We prove that correlators in TQM can be expressed via intersection numbers of certain submanifolds of the target space with paths of steepest descent between critical points of a Morse function. In the end we conjecture another correspondence between quantum mechanics correlators and integrals of Massey products of certain cohomology classes.
