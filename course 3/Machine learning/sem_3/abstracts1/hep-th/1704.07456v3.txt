We consider pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on four-dimensional de Sitter space dS$_4$ and construct a smooth and spatially homogeneous magnetic solution to the Yang-Mills equations. Slicing dS$_4$ as ${\mathbb R}\times S^3$, via an SU(2)-equivariant ansatz we reduce the Yang-Mills equations to ordinary matrix differential equations and further to Newtonian dynamics in a double-well potential. Its local maximum yields a Yang-Mills solution whose color-magnetic field at time $\tau\in{\mathbb R}$ is given by $\tilde{B}_a=-\frac12 I_a/(R^2\cosh^2\!\tau)$, where $I_a$ for $a=1,2,3$ are the SU(2) generators and $R$ is the de Sitter radius. At any moment, this spatially homogeneous configuration has finite energy, but its action is also finite and of the value $-\frac12j(j{+}1)(2j{+}1)\pi^3$ in a spin-$j$ representation. Similarly, the double-well bounce produces a family of homogeneous finite-action electric-magnetic solutions with the same energy. There is a continuum of other solutions whose energy and action extend down to zero.
