We develop a method to obtain $\epsilon$-expansions of massless two-point integrals in position space, based on the constraints implied by symmetries of the asymptotic expansion of conformal four-point integrals. Together with parametric integration, we are able to fix the expansions of 170 genuine five-loop master integrals. In particular, we computed the expansions of all planar master integrals up to transcendental weight 9.
