We study Matrix Quantum Mechanics on the Euclidean time orbifold $S_1/\mathbb{Z}_2$. Upon Wick rotation to Lorentzian time and taking the double-scaling limit this theory provides a toy model for a big-bang/big crunch universe in two dimensional non-critical string theory where the orbifold fixed points become cosmological singularities. We derive the MQM partition function both in the canonical and grand canonical ensemble in two different formulations and demonstrate agreement between them. We pinpoint the contribution of twisted states in both of these formulations either in terms of bi-local operators acting at the end-points of time or branch-cuts on the complex plane. We calculate, in the matrix model, the contribution of the twisted states to the torus level partition function explicitly and show that it precisely matches the world-sheet result, providing a non-trivial test of the proposed duality. Finally we discuss some interesting features of the partition function and the possibility of realising it as a $\tau$-function of an integrable hierarchy.
