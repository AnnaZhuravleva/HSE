We discuss some physical prospective of the non-BPS effective actions of type IIA and IIB superstring theories. By dealing with the complete all three and four point functions, including a closed string Ramond-Ramond (in terms of both its field strength and its potential), gauge (scalar) fields as well as a real tachyon and under symmetry structures, we find various restricted world volume and bulk Bianchi identities. The complete forms of the non-BPS scattering amplitudes including their Chan-Paton factors are elaborated. All the singularity structures of the non-BPS amplitudes, their all orders $\alpha'$ higher derivative corrections, their contact terms and various modified Bianchi identities are derived. Finally we show that scattering amplitudes computed in different super-ghost pictures are compatible when suitable Bianchi identities are imposed on the Ramond-Ramond fields. Moreover, we argue that the higher derivative expansion in powers of the momenta of the tachyon is universal.
