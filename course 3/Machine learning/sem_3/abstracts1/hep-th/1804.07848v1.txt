The theory of reheating in the Sneutrino-Higgs cosmology of the $B-L$ MSSM is presented. It is shown that following an epoch of inflation consistent with all Planck2015 data, the inflaton begins to oscillate around its minimum at zero and to reheat to various species of standard model and supersymmetric matter. The decay rates to this matter are computed, both analytically and numerically. Using these results, the Hubble parameter and the relative energy densities for each matter species, including that of the inflaton, are calculated numerically. The inflaton energy density is demonstrated to vanish at an energy scale of ${\cal{O}}(10^{13})~{\rm GeV}$, signaling the end of the period of reheating. The newly created matter background is shown to be in thermal equilibrium, with a reheating temperature of $\simeq 1.13 \times 10^{13}~{\rm GeV}$. To allow for a $B-L$ breaking scale sufficiently smaller than the reheating scale, we extend the statistical method of determining the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters developed in previous work. The result is that one can determine a large number of phenomenologically realistic initial conditions for which the $B-L$ breaking scale is an order of magnitude or more smaller than the reheating scale.
