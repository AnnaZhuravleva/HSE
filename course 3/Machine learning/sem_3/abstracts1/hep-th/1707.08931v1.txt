Tensor models generalize the matrix-model approach to 2-dimensional quantum gravity to higher dimensions. Some models allowing a $1/N$ expansion have been explored, most of them generating branched-polymer geometries. Recently, enhancements yielding an additional 2d quantum-gravity (planar) phase and an intermediate regime of proliferating baby-universes have been found. It remains an open issue to find models escaping these lower dimensionality universality classes.   Here we analyze the dominant regime and critical behaviour of a range of new models which are candidates for such effective geometries, in particular interactions based on the utility graph $K_{3,3}$. We find that, upon proper enhancement, the two-phase structure of a branched-polymer and a 2d gravity regime is the common case in $U(N)$-invariant rank $D=4$ tensor models of small orders. Not only the well known so-called necklace interactions but also $K_{3,3}$-type interactions turn out as the source for the planar regime. We give a systematic account of the enhancement scaling, the counting of leading-order diagrams and the multi-critical behaviour of a wide range of interactions, in particular for all order-6 interactions of rank 3 and 4. These findings support the claim of universality of such mixtures of branched-polymer and planar diagrams at criticality. In particular, this hints at the necessity to consider new ingredients, or interactions of higher order and rank, in order to obtain higher dimensional continuum geometry from tensor models.
