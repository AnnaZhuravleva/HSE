We propose a new world-line Lagrangian model of the D=4 massless relativistic particle with continuous spin and develop its twistorial formulation. The description uses two Penrose twistors subjected to four first class constraints. After the first quantization of the world-line twistorial model, the wave function is defined by an unconstrained function on the two-dimensional complex affine plane. We find the twistor transform that determines the space-time field of the continuous spin particle through the corresponding twistor one, which plays the role of a prepotential. It is shown that this space-time field is an exact solution of the space-time constraints defining the irreducible massless representation of the Poincare group with continuous spin.
