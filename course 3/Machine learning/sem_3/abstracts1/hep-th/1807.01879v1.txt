The multicenter solutions of 4d ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity contain a subset of scaling solutions with vanishing total angular momentum. In a near limit those solutions are asymptotically locally AdS$_2\times$ S$^2$, but we show that a higher moment of angular momentum contributes a subtle twist, rotating the S$^2$ with time. This provides some potential hair distinguishing the asymptotics of these scaling solutions from the near horizon geometry of an extremal BPS black hole.
