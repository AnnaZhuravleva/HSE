We use flat-space holography to calculate the mutual information and the 3-partite information of a two-dimensional BMS-invariant field theory (BMSFT$_2$). This theory is the putative holographic dual of the three-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes. We find a bound in which entangling transition occurs for zero and finite temperature BMSFTs. We also show that the holographic 3-partite information is always non-positive which indicates that the holographic mutual information is monogamous.
