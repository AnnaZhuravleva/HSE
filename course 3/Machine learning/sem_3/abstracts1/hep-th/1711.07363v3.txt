We classify kinematical Lie algebras in dimension $D \geq 4$. This is approached via the classification of deformations of the relevant static kinematical Lie algebra. We also classify the deformations of the universal central extension of the static kinematical Lie algebra in dimension $D\geq 4$. In addition we determine which of these Lie algebras admit an invariant inner product.
