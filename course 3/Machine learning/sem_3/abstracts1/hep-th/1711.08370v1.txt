We study the evolution of cosmological perturbations in a non-singular bouncing cosmology with a bounce phase which has superimposed oscillations of the scale factor. We identify length scales for which the final spectrum of fluctuations obtains imprints of the non-trivial bounce dynamics. These imprints in the spectrum are manifested in the form of damped oscillation features at scales smaller than a characteristic value and an increased reddening of the spectrum at all the scales as the number of small bounces increases.
