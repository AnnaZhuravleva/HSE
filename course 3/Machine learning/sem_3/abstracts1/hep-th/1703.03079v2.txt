We extend the effective theory approach to the ideal fluid limit where the polarization of the fluid is non-zero. After describing and motivating the equations of motion, we expand them around the hydrostatic limit, obtaining the sound wave and vortex degrees of freedom. We discuss how the presence of polarization affects the stability and causality of the ideal fluid limit.
