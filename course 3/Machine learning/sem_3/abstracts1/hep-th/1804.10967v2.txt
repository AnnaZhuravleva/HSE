We consider the problem of exact integration of the $T\bar{T}$-deformation of two dimensional quantum field theories, as well as some higher dimensional extensions in the form of $\det T$-deformations. When the action can be shown to only depend algebraically on the background metric the solution of the deformation equation on the Lagrangian can be given in closed form in terms of solutions of the (extended) Burgers' equation. We present such examples in two and higher dimensions.
