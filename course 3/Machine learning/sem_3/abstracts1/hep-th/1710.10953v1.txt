We conjecture a new set of analytic relations for scattering amplitudes in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. They generalise the Steinmann relations and are expressed in terms of the cluster algebras associated to Gr(4,n). In terms of the symbol, they dictate which letters can appear consecutively. We study heptagon amplitudes and integrals in detail and present symbols for previously unknown integrals at two and three loops which support our conjecture.
