The 2d principal models without boundaries have symmetry group $G\times G$. The possible classical symmetries with integrable boundaries found so far are $H \times H$ or $G_D$ where $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ for which $G/H$ is symmetric space and $G_D$ is the diagonal subgroup of $G\times G$. A common property of these known boundary conditions is that they do not contain any free parameters. We have found new integrable boundary conditions for which the remaining symmetry groups are either $G\times H$ or $H\times G$ and they contain one free parameter. The related boundary monodromy matrices are also described.
