In this paper, we show that tree level $2\to 2$ scattering amplitudes in 3d ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a fundamental chiral multiplet are dual superconformal invariant.We further show that the large $N$ all loop exact amplitude computed in arXiv:1505.06571, also has dual superconformal symmetry, which implies dual superconformal symmetry is all loop exact which is in contrast to other known highly supersymmetric examples such as ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and ABJM where the dual superconformal symmetry is in general anomalous. We then reverse the argument and ask, is it possible to fix the amplitude completely based on general principles. We show, dual superconformal invariance fixes the momentum dependent piece leaving the coupling constant dependence unfixed. We use a combination of parity invariance, unitarity and self-duality of the amplitude to constrain the coupling constant dependence of scattering amplitude. We also show, in the dual space CFT, the four point scattering amplitude can be interpreted as correlation of function of some operators. Interestingly, the full four point correlation function in the `u-channel' comes from identity exchange.
