We analyze general N = 2 supersymmetric AdS4 solutions of type IIB supergravity. Utilizing a set of pure spinor equations directly adapted to N = 2, the necessary and sufficient conditions for supersymmetry are reduced to a concise system of partial differential equations for two functions which determine the solutions. We show that using this system analytic solutions can be generated, thus potentially expanding the rather limited set of known AdS4 solutions in type IIB supergravity.
