We extend the construction of Calabi-Yau manifolds to hypersurfaces in non-Fano toric varieties, requiring the use of certain Laurent defining polynomials, and explore the phases of the corresponding gauged linear sigma models. The associated non-reflexive and non-convex polytopes provide a generalization of Batyrev's original work, allowing us to construct novel pairs of mirror models. We showcase our proposal for this generalization by examining Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in Hirzebruch n-folds, focusing on n=3,4 sequences, and outline the more general class of so-defined geometries.
