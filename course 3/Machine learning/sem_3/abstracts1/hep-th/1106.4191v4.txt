We study n-string scattering amplitudes in three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space (AdS3). We focus our attention on the processes in which the winding number conservation is violated maximally; that is, those processes in which it is violated in n-2 units. A worldsheet conformal field theory calculation leads us to confirm a previous conjecture about the functional form of these observables.
