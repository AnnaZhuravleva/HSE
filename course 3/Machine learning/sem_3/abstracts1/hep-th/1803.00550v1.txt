We study stringy modifications of $T^3$-fibered manifolds, where the fiber undergoes a monodromy in the T-duality group. We determine the fibration data defining such T-folds from a geometric model, by using a map between the duality group and the group of large diffeomorphisms of a four-torus. We describe the monodromies induced around duality defects where such fibrations degenerate and we argue that local solutions receive corrections from the winding sector, dual to the symmetry-breaking modes that correct semi-flat metrics.
