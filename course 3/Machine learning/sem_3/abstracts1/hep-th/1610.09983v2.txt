The problem of classifying off-shell representations of the $N$ -extended one-dimensional super Poincar\'e algebra is closely related to the study of a class of decorated $N$-regular, $N$-edge colored bipartite graphs known as Adinkras. In previous work we canonically embedded these graphs into explicitly uniformized Riemann surfaces via the "dessins d'enfant" construction of Grothendieck. The Adinkra graphs carry two additional structures: a selection of dashed edges and an assignment of integral helghts to the vertices. In this paper, we complete the passage from algebra, through discrete structures, to geometry. We show that the dashings correspond to special spin structures on the Riemann surface, defining thereby super Riemann surfaces. Height assignments determine discrete Morse functions, from which we produce a set of Morse divisors which capture the topological properties of the height assignments.
