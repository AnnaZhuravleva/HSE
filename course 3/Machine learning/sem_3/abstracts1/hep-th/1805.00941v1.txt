We study a supersymmetry breaking deformation of the 2d N=(2,2) cigar=Liouville mirror pair, first introduced by Hori and Kapustin. We show that mirror symmetry flows in the infra-red to 2d bosonization, with the theories reducing to massive Thirring and Sine-Gordon respectively. The exact bosonization map emerges at one-loop. We further compactify non-supersymmetric 3d bosonization dualities on a circle and argue that these too flow to 2d bosonization at long distances.
