All symmetric space $AdS_n$ solutions of type II supergravity have recently been found for $n>2$. For the supersymmetric solutions (and their T-duals) it is known that the Green-Schwarz string is classically integrable. We complete the classification by ruling out integrability for the remaining non-supersymmetric solutions. This is achieved by showing that tree-level scattering on the worldsheet of a GKP or BMN string fails to factorize for these cases.
