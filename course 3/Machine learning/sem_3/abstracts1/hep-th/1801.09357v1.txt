We build a holographic model of a strongly coupled topological nodal line semimetal and show that the nodal line semimetal phase could go through a quantum phase transition to a topologically trivial state. The dual fermion spectral function confirms that the Fermi surface is a closed nodal loop in the nodal line semimetal phase. We expect that our model provides a general framework for generating strongly coupled topological semimetals in holography, which indicates that at strong coupling topologically nontrivial semimetal states generally exist. In this general framework the topological structure in the bulk is induced by the IR interplay between the dual mass operator and the operator that deforms the topology of the Fermi surface.
