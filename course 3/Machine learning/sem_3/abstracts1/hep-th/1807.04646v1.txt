In this paper, we compute the exact form of the bulk geometry emerging from a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory using the holographic principle. We first consider the $(2+1)$-dimensional asymptotic $AdS$ metric in Poincare coordinates and compute the area functional corresponding to the static minimal surface $\gamma_A$ and obtain the entanglement entropy making use of the holographic entanglement entropy proposal. We then use the results of the entanglement entropy for $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory on an infinite line, on an infinite line at a finite temperature and on a circle. Comparing these results with the holographic entanglement entropy, we are able to extract the proper structure of the bulk metric. The analysis reveals the behaviour of the bulk metric in both the near boundary region and deep inside the bulk. The results also show the influence of the boundary UV cut-off $a$ on the bulk metric. It is observed that the reconstructed metrics match exactly with the known results in the literature when one moves deep inside the bulk.
