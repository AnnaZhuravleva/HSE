In an earlier paper we have constructed a basis of massless single particle quantum states which transform in the unitary principal series representation of the four dimensional Lorentz group. The S-matrix written in this basis gives rise to the Mellin transformed amplitude of Pasterski-Shao-Strominger and its generalization. In this basis the particle can be thought of as living on the null-infinity in the Minkowski space. In this paper we take some preliminary steps to see how the connection between soft theorems and symmetries work out in this picture. For simplicity we consider only the leading soft photon and soft graviton theorems which are related to U(1) Kac-Moody and supertranslations.
