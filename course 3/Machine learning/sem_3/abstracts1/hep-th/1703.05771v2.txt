We study the effect of brane polarization on the supersymmetry transformations of probe anti-D3-branes at the tip of a Klebanov-Strassler throat geometry. As is well known, the probe branes can polarize into NS5-branes and decay to a supersymmetric state by brane-flux annihilation. The effective potential has a metastable minimum as long as the number of anti-D3-branes is small compared to the number of flux quanta. We study the reduced four-dimensional effective NS5-brane theory and show that in the metastable minimum supersymmetry is non-linearly realized to leading order, as expected for spontaneously broken supersymmetry. However, a strict decoupling limit of the higher order corrections in terms of a standard nilpotent superfield does not seem to exist. We comment on the possible implications of these results for more general low-energy effective descriptions of inflation or de Sitter vacua.
