The aim of this note is to present some new explicit examples of $O(d,d)$-generalised Leibniz parallelisable spaces arising as the normal bundles of adjoint orbits $\mathcal{O}$ of some semi-simple Lie group $G$. Using this construction, an explicit expression for a generalised frame is given in the case when the orbits are regular, but subtleties arise when they become degenerate. In the case of regular orbits, the resulting space is a globally flat fiber bundle over $\mathcal{O}$ which can be made compact, allowing for a generalised Scherk-Schwartz reduction. This means these spaces should admit consistent supergravity truncations. For degenerate orbits, the procedure hinges on the existence of a suitable metric, allowing for a consistent normalisation of the generalised frame.
