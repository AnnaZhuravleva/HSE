We obtain a supersymmetric Kaluza-Klein black lens solution in Taub-NUT space in the five-dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity. It is shown that the spacetime has a degenerate horizon with the spatial cross section of the lens space topology L(n,1) and looks like the four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in the neighborhood of spatial infinity. In contrast to the horizon topology, from a five-dimensional point of view, the spatial infinity has the topology of S^3 rather than the lens space. For this reason, this solution has an asymptotically flat limit. We discuss several properties of such a black lens, in particular, the effect by the compactification of an extra-dimension and some physical differences from the asymptotically flat supersymmetric black lens which has recently been found.
