This paper extends the formalism for quantizing field theories via a microcanonical quantum field theory and Hamilton's principle to evolution equations on de Sitter spacetime. These are based on the well-known correspondence under a Wick rotation between quantum field theories and 4-D statistical mechanical theories. By placing quantum field theories on a 4+1-D or de Sitter manifold, under Wick rotation to 5-D, expectations of observables are calculated for a microcanonical field theory averaging Hamiltonian flow over a fifth spacelike dimension, a technique common in lattice gauge simulations but not in perturbation theory. In a novel demonstration, averaging pairs of external lines in the classical Feynman diagrams over the fifth dimension generates diagrams with loops and vacuum fluctuations identical to Standard Model diagrams. Virtual fermions are also demonstrated to have momentum in the 5th dimension while on-mass shell fermions do not, a novel observation. Because it is microcanonical, this approach, while equivalent for standard quantum fields theories in the Standard Model, is able to quantize theories that have no canonical quantization. It is also unique in representing expectations as averages over solutions to an ordinary, classical PDE rather than a path integral or operator based approaches. Hence, this approach draws a clear connection between quantum field theory and classical field theory in higher dimensions which has implications towards how quantum effects are interpreted.
