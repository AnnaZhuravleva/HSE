We construct the 4D N=2 SCFTs of class-S, which stem from the $E_8$ (2,0) theory. There are 49,836 isolated SCFTs which arise as 3-punctured spheres. Of these, 149 are "mixed" (contain free hypermultiplets accompanying the interacting SCFT) and 775 have enhanced global symmetries (beyond the manifest global symmetry associated to the punctures). Among the 49,836 3-punctured spheres we find (after removing any free hypermultiplets which may be present) 29 that are product SCFTs. Turning to 4-punctured spheres, we find 1,025,438 4D SCFTs arising as a gauging (with a simple gauge group) of a pair of 3-punctured spheres. We discuss a number of applications, including recovering several known 4D SCFTs. Our full set of results can be accessed on the Web at https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/class-S/E8/ .
