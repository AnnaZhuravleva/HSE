We investigate an alternative CPT-odd Lorentz-breaking QED which includes the CFJ term of the Standard Model Extension (SME), writing the gauge sector in the action in a Palatini-like form, in which the vectorial field and the field-strength tensor are treated as independent entities. Interestingly, this naturally relaxes the condition of gauge invariance in the classical action. We study physical consistency aspects of the model both at classical and quantum levels.
