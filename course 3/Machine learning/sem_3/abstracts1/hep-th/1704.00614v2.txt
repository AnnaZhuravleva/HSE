Making use of the symmetries of anti-de Sitter space-time, we derive an analytic expression for the bispinor of parallel transport, from which we construct in closed form the vacuum Feynman Green's function of the Dirac field on this background. Using the imaginary time anti-periodicity property of the thermal Feynman Green's function, we calculate the thermal expectation values of the fermion condensate and stress-energy tensor and highlight the effect of quantum corrections as compared to relativistic kinetic theory results.
