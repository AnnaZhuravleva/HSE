We consider a "Scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet" theory in four dimension, where the scalar field couples non minimally with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term. This coupling with the scalar field ensures the non topological character of the GB term. In this scenario, we examine the possibility for collapsing of the scalar field. Our result reveals that such a collapse is possible in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity for suitable choices of parametric regions. The singularity formed as a result of the collapse is found to be a curvature singularity which is hidden from exterior by an apparent horizon.
