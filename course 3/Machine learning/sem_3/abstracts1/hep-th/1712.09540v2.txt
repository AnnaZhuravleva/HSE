We analyze the Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz superparticle model on a 2-dimensional curved spacetime as a super Finsler metric defined on a (2,2)-dimensional supermanifold. We propose a nonlinear Finsler connection which preserves this Finsler metric and calculates it explicitly. The equations of motion of the superparticle are reconstructed in the form of auto-parallel equations expressed by the super nonlinear connection.
