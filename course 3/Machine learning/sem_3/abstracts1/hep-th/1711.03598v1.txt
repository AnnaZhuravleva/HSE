The construction of a consistent measure for Yang-Mills is a precondition for an accurate formulation of non-perturbative approaches to QCD, both analytical and numerical. Using projective limits as subsets of Cartesian products of homomorphisms from a lattice to the structure group, a consistent interaction measure and an infinite-dimensional calculus has been constructed for a theory of non-abelian generalized connections on a hypercubic lattice. Here, after reviewing and clarifying past work, new results are obtained for the mass gap when the structure group is compact.
