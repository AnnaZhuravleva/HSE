We study the four-dimensional (4D) scalar potential arising from a generalized type IIA flux superpotential including the (non-)geometric fluxes. First, we show that using a set of peculiar flux combinations, the 4D scalar potential can be formulated into a very compact form. This is what we call as the `symplectic formulation' from which one could easily anticipate the ten-dimensional origin of the effective scalar potential. We support our formulation through an alternate derivation of the scalar potential via considering the Double Field Theory (DFT) reduction on a generic Calabi Yau orientifold. In addition, we also exemplify the insights of our formulation with explicit computations for two concrete toroidal examples using orientifolds of the complex threefolds ${\mathbb T}^6/{({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)}$ and ${\mathbb T}^6/{\mathbb Z}_4$.
