In this work we use the deformation procedure and explore the route to obtain distinct field theory models that present similar stability potentials. Starting from systems that interact polynomially or hyperbolically, we use a deformation function which allows to construct other theories having the feature of giving rise to the same stability potentials. Such deformation function leads to smooth potentials according to a specific choice of a single parameter. Among the results, one shows that for models with asymmetric topological sectors, the appearance of a new stability potential is also possible.
