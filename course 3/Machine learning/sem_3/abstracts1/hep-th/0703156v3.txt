We argue that TeVeS-like vector fields appear naturally in certain string theory backgrounds involving D0-branes, as a result of the recoil velocity field, expressing the interaction of neutrino string matter with point-like branes. However, the similarity with TeVeS models is restricted only to the bi-metric properties of space time, namely the difference of the background metric from the one felt by (some) matter fields interacting, in a topologically non-trivial manner, with the D0-brane defects. In our approach, neutrinos appear as dark matter candidates that could be ``captured'' by the D0 branes, as a result of stringy properties, and thus couple with the recoil-vector fields. Moreover, we argue in support of a possibly preferential role of neutrinos in inducing novel non-perturbative contributions to ``vacuum'' (dark) energy, in addition to their ordinary dark matter contribution. In fact, the role of neutrinos as providing substantial contributions to dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe, suggested by our approach, appears also to be necessitated by the need to reproduce the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum, as claimed recently in the literature. Thus, our framework may be viewed as providing a microscopic explanation of such phenomenological conclusions concerning TeVeS-like, Lorentz-violating models.
