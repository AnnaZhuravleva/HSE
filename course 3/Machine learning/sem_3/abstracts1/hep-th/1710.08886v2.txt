Motivated by the connection of string theory to cosmology or particle physics, we study solutions of type II supergravities having a four-dimensional de Sitter or Minkowski space-time, with intersecting Dp-branes and orientifold Op-planes. Only few such solutions are known, and we aim at a better characterisation. Modulo a few restrictions, we prove that there exists no classical de Sitter solution for any combination of D3/O3 and D7/O7, while we derive interesting constraints for intersecting D5/O5 or D6/O6, or combinations of D4/O4 and D8/O8. Concerning classical Minkowski solutions, we understand some typical features, and propose a solution ansatz. Overall, a central information appears to be the way intersecting Dp/Op overlap each other, a point we focus on.
