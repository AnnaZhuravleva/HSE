The geometric Fierz identities are here employed to generate new emergent fermionic fields on the parallelizable (curvatureless, torsionfull) 7-sphere ($S^7$). Employing recently found new classes of spinor fields on the $S^7$ spin bundle, new classes of fermionic fields are obtained from their bilinear covariants by a generalized reconstruction theorem, on the parallelizable $S^7$. Using a generalized non-associative product on the octonionic bundle on the parallelizable $S^7$, these new classes of algebraic spinor fields, lifted onto the parallelizable $S^7$, are shown to correctly transform under the Moufang loop generators on $S^7$.
