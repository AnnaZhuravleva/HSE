In this paper we consider charged and neutral blackfold and extract the Brown-York stress energy tensor. Also, we show that the neutral blackfold spacetime is Ricci- flat and the other spacetime is not. This Ricci-flat condition gives us opportunity to calculate the AAdS spacetime. In order to have dual theory one can consider the AAdS in Fefferman- Graham coordinates. This frame gives correct form of stress tensor in the boundary. The corresponding tensor with using this frame will be traceless and conserved. Such stress tensor is same as perfect fluid and it proves the dual renormalized theory exists for the neutral blackfold .
