We propose a class of ${\rm AdS}_3/{\rm CFT}_2$ dualities with $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry. These dualities relate string theory on ${\rm AdS}_3 \times ({\rm S}^3\times \mathbb{T}^4)/{\rm G}$ to marginal deformations of the symmetric product orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4/{\rm G}$, where ${\rm G}$ is a dihedral group. We demonstrate that the BPS spectrum calculated from supergravity and string theory agrees with that of the dual CFT. Moreover, the supergravity elliptic genus is shown to reproduce the CFT answer, thus providing further non-trivial evidence in favour of the proposal.
