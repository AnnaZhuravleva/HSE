We show how the Weyl anomaly generated by gauge fields, can be computed from manifestly gauge invariant and diffeomorphism invariant exact renormalization group equations, without having to fix the gauge at any stage. Regularisation is provided by covariant higher derivatives and by embedding the Maxwell field into a spontaneously broken $U(1|1)$ supergauge theory. We first provide a realisation that leaves behind two versions of the original $U(1)$ gauge field, and then construct a manifestly $U(1|1)$ supergauge invariant flow equation which leaves behind only the original Maxwell field in the spontaneously broken regime.
