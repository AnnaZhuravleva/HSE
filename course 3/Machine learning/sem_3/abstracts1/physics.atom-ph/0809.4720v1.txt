Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock electric quadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) transition probabilities are reported for transitions between levels of 3d^5 in [Fe IV]. The accuracy of the ab initio energy levels and the agreement in the length and velocity forms of the line strength for the E2 transitions are used as indicators of accuracy. The present E2 and M1 transition probabilities are compared with earlier Breit-Pauli results and other theories. An extensive set of transition probabilites with indicators of accuracy are reported in Appendices A and B. Recommended values of A(E2) + A(M1) are listed in Appendix C.
