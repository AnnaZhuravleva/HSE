We investigate the properties of two interacting ultracold polar molecules described as distinguishable quantum rigid rotors, trapped in a one-dimensional harmonic potential. The molecules interact via a multichannel two-body contact potential, incorporating the short-range anisotropy of intermolecular interactions including dipole-dipole interaction. The impact of external electric and magnetic fields resulting in Stark and Zeeman shifts of molecular rovibrational states is also investigated. Energy spectra and eigenstates are calculated by means of the exact diagonalization. The importance and interplay of the molecular rotational structure, anisotropic interactions, spin-rotation coupling, electric and magnetic fields, and harmonic trapping potential are examined in detail, and compared to the system of two harmonically trapped distinguishable atoms. Presented model and results may provide microscopic parameters for molecular many-body Hamiltonians, and may be useful for the development of bottom-up molecule-by-molecule assembled molecular quantum simulators.
