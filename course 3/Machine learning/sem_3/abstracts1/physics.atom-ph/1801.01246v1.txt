We propose a superconducting circuit-atom hybrid, where the Rabi oscillation of single excess Cooper pair in the island is stabilized via the common atomic-clock technique. The noise in the superconducting circuit is mapped onto the voltage source which biases the Cooper-pair box via an inductor and a gate capacitor. The fast fluctuations of the gate charge are significantly suppressed by an inductor-capacitor resonator, leading to a long-relaxation-time Rabi oscillation. More importantly, the residual low-frequency fluctuations are further reduced by using the general feedback-control method, in which the voltage bias is stabilized via continuously measuring the dc-Stark-shift-induced atomic Ramsey signal. The stability and coherence time of the resulting charge-qubit Rabi oscillation are both enhanced. The principal structure of this Cooper-pair-box oscillator is studied in detail.
