We show that strong parametric driving of a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a thermal bath allows one to distinguish between different microscopic models for the oscillator-bath coupling. We consider a bath with an Ohmic spectral density and a model where the system-bath interaction can be tuned continuously between position and momentum coupling via the coupling angle $\alpha$. We derive a master equation for the reduced density operator of the oscillator in Born-Markov approximation and investigate its quasi-steady state as a function of the driving parameters, the temperature of the bath and the coupling angle $\alpha$. We find that the time-averaged variance of position and momentum exhibits a strong dependence on these parameters. In particular, we identify parameter regimes that maximise the $\alpha$-dependence and provide an intuitive explanation of our results.
