We report a detailed investigation on near-ground state cooling of one and two trapped atomic ions. We introduce a simple sideband cooling method for confined atoms and ions, using RF radiation applied to bare ionic states in a static magnetic field gradient, and demonstrate its application to ions confined at secular trap frequencies, $\omega_z \approx 2\pi\times 117 $kHz. For a single \ybplus ion, the sideband cooling cycle reduces the average phonon number, $\left\langle\,n\,\right\rangle$ from the Doppler limit to $\left\langle\,n\,\right\rangle =$ 0.30(12). This is in agreement with the theoretically estimated lowest achievable phonon number in this experiment. We extend this method of RF sideband cooling to a system of two \ybplus ions, resulting in a phonon number of $\left\langle\,n\,\right\rangle =$ 1.1(7) in the center-of-mass mode. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first realisation of sympathetic RF sideband cooling of an ion crystal consisting of two individually addressable identical isotopes of the same species.
