Trapped-ion optical clocks are capable of achieving systematic fractional frequency uncertainties of $10^{-18}$ and possibly below. However, the stability of current ion clocks is fundamentally limited by the weak signal of single-ion interrogation. We present an operational, scalable platform for extending clock spectroscopy to arrays of Coulomb crystals consisting of several tens of ions, while allowing systematic shifts as low as $10^{-19}$. We observe 3D excess micromotion amplitudes inside a Coulomb crystal with atomic resolution and prove that the related frequency shifts of individual ions can be controlled simultaneously at the $10^{-19}$ level. Using this method, we demonstrate regions of $400 \mu$m and $2$ mm length where Coulomb crystals can be trapped with time dilation shifts due to micromotion close to $1\times10^{-19}$ and below $10^{-18}$, respectively. By further characterizing the trapping environment and calculating cooling dynamics for mixed In${}^+$/Yb${}^+$ crystals, we show that achievable clock uncertainties due to multi-ion operation in our setup are below $1\times10^{-19}$. This work opens up the path to precision spectroscopy in many-body ion systems, enabling entanglement-enhanced ion clocks and providing a well-controlled, strongly coupled quantum system.
