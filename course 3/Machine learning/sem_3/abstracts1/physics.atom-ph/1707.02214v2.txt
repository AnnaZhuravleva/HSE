The Anti-Matter Factory at CERN is gearing up, commissioning of the Extra Low ENergy Antiprotons (ELENA) ring is ongoing and the first anti-protons are foreseen to circulate in the decelerator very soon. The unprecedented flux of low energy antiprotons delivered by ELENA will open a new era for precision tests with antimatter including laser and microwave spectroscopy and tests of its gravitational behaviour. Here we propose a scheme to load the ultra cold anti-hydrogen atoms that will be produced by the GBAR experiment in an optical lattice tuned at the magic wavelength of the 1S-2S transition in order to measure this interval at a level comparable or even better than its matter counter part. This will provide the most sensitive test of CPT symmetry parametrised in the framework of the Standard Model Extension.
