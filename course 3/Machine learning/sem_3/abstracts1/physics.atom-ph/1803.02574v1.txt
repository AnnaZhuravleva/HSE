The generation of electron vortex states in ionization by intense and short laser pulses is analyzed under the scope of the lowest-order Born approximation. For near infrared laser fields and nonrelativistic intensities of the order of $10^{16}$~W/cm$^2$, we show that one has to modify the nonrelativistic treatment of ionization by accounting for recoil and mass relativistic corrections. By using the corrected quasi-relativistic theory, the requirements for the observation of electron vortex states with non-negligible probability and large topological charge are determined.
