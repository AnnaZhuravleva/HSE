Trapped ions are ideally suited for precision spectroscopy, as is evident from the remarkably low systematic uncertainties of single-ion clocks. The major weakness of these clocks is the long averaging time, necessitated by the low signal of a single atom. An increased number of ions can overcome this limitation and allow for the implementation of novel clock schemes. However, this presents the challenge to maintain the excellent control over systematic shifts of a single particle in spatially extended and strongly coupled many-body systems. We discuss systematic frequency uncertainties related to spectroscopy with ion chains and present experimental results from a newly developed rf trap array designed for precision spectroscopy on simultaneously trapped ion ensembles. For the example of an In${}^+$ clock, sympathetically cooled with Yb${}^+$ ions, we show in our system that the expected systematic frequency uncertainties related to multi-ion operation are below $1\times10^{-19}$. Our concept is applicable to all clock transitions with low differential electric quadrupole moment and supports on the order of 100 clock ions at this level of accuracy.
