We consider photoionization of a system bound by the central potential $V(r)$. We demonstrate that the high energy nonrelativistic asymptotics of the photoionization cross section can be obtained without solving the wave equation. The asymptotics can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform of the potential by employing the Lippmann--Schwinger equation. We find the asymptotics for the screened Coulomb field. We demonstrate that the leading corrections to this asymptotics are described by the universal factor. The high energy nonrelativistic asymptotics is found to be determined by the analytic properties of the potential $V(r)$. We show that the energy dependence of the asymptotics of photoionization cross sections of fullerenes is to large extent model dependent. We demonstrate that if the fullerene field $V(r)$ is approximated by the function with singularities in the complex plane, the power drop of the asymptotics is reached at the energies which as so high that the cross section becomes unobservably small. The preasymptotic behavior with a faster drop of the cross sections becomes important in these cases.
