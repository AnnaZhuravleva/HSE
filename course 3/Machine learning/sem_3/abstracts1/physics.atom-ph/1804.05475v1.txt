Electron interactions with the nuclear-spin-dependent (NSD) parity non-conserving (PNC) anapole moment are strongly enhanced within heteronuclear diatomic molecules. A novel, low-energy optical rotation experiment is being proposed with the aim of observing NSD PNC interactions in HgH. Based on the relativistic coupled cluster method we present a complete calculation of the circular polarization parameter $P = 2\,\textrm{Im}(E1_{PNC})/M1 \approx 3 \times 10^{-6}\; \kappa$ for the $^2\Sigma_{1/2} \to ^2\Pi_{1/2}$ optical transition of HgH, where $\kappa$ is a dimensionless constant determined by the nuclear anapole moment. This provides an improvement in sensitivity to NSD PNC by 2 -- 3 orders of magnitude over the leading atomic Xe, Hg, Tl, Pb and Bi optical rotation experiments, and shows that the proposed measurement will be sensitive enough to extract the $^{199}$Hg anapole moment and shed light on the underlying theory of hadronic parity violation.
