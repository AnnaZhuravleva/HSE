We report on the observation of the spin dynamics of single Yb$^+$ ions immersed in a cold cloud of spin-polarized $^6$Li atoms. This combination of species has recently been proposed to be the most suitable system to reach the quantum limit in atom-ion experiments. For a spin encoded in the Zeeman ground states of $^{174}$Yb$^+$, we find that the atomic environment polarizes the spin of the ion by $93(4)\,\%$ after a few Langevin collisions, pointing to strong spin-exchange rates. For the hyperfine ground states of $^{171}$Yb$^+$, we also find strong rates towards spin polarization. However, relaxation towards the $F=0$ ground state occurs after 7.7(1.5) Langevin collisions. We investigate spin impurity atoms as possible source of apparent spin-relaxation leading us to interpret the observed spin-relaxation rates as an upper limit. Using ab initio electronic structure and quantum scattering calculations, we explain the observed rates and analyze their implications for the possible observation of magnetic Feshbach resonances between atoms and ions.
