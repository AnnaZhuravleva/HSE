We present a method for the velocimetry of cold atoms by matterwave interferometry, which we have used to measure the velocity distributions within freely-expanding clouds of $^{85}$Rb atoms at temperatures of 17 and 33 $\mu$K. Quadrature measurement using an asymmetric three-pulse technique allows determination of the full analytic interferometer signal which yields the 1-D velocity distribution with excellent fidelity. The technique is particularly suited to ultracold samples, and avoids some of the artefacts of conventional Doppler and time-of-flight methods.
