High-fidelity entangled Bell states are of great interest in quantum physics. Entanglement of ultracold neutral atoms in two spatially separated optical dipole traps is promising for implementation of quantum computing and quantum simulation and for investigation of Bell states of material objects. We propose a new method to entangle two atoms via long-range Rydberg-Rydberg interaction. Alternatively to previous approaches, based on Rydberg blockade, we consider radiofrequency-assisted Stark-tuned F\"{o}rster resonances in Rb Rydberg atoms. To reduce the sensitivity of the fidelity of Bell states to the fluctuations of interatomic distance, we propose to use the double adiabatic passage across the radiofrequency-assisted Stark-tuned F\"{o}rster resonances, which results in a deterministic phase shift of the two-atom state.
