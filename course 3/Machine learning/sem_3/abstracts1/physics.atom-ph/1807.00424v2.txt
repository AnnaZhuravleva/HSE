We examine a range of effects arising from ac magnetic fields in high precision metrology. These results are directly relevant to high precision measurements, and accuracy assessments for state-of-the-art optical clocks. Strategies to characterize these effects are discussed and a simple technique to accurately determine trap-induced ac magnetic fields in a linear Paul trap is demonstrated using $^{171}\mathrm{Yb}^+$
