Atomic spectra and other properties of superheavy element dubnium (Db, Z=105) are calculated using recently developed method combining configuration interaction with perturbation theory (the CIPT method, Dzuba et al, Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 95}, 012503 (2017)). These include energy levels for low-lying states of Db and Db~II, electric dipole transition amplitudes from the ground state of Db, isotope shift for these transitions and ionisation potential of Db. Similar calculations for Ta, which is lighter analog of Db, are performed to control the accuracy of the calculations.
