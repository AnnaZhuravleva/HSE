The Dirac-Hartree-Fock plus many-body perturbation theory (DHF+MBPT) method has been used to calculate hyperfine structure constants for Fr. Calculated hyperfine structure anomaly for hydrogen-like ion has been shown to be in good agreement with analytical expressions. It has been shown that the ratio of the anomalies for $s$ and $p_{1/2}$ states is weakly dependent on the principal quantum number. Finally, we estimate Bohr--Weisskopf corrections for several Fr isotopes. Our results may be used to improve experimental accuracy for the nuclear $g$ factors of short-lived isotopes.
