We characterize the properties of a new form of magneto-optical trap (MOT) that relies on non-equilibrium population dynamics associated with narrow-linewidth optical transitions. We demonstrate this mechanism using the 7.5 kHz linewidth transition in both bosonic and fermionic strontium isotopes. In contrast to standard narrow-line MOTs based on imbalances in equilibrium scattering rates, our system benefits from a less complex laser system, a larger capture fraction from higher temperature samples, robustness against experimental perturbations and the ability to operate in the presence of large inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic transition frequency.
