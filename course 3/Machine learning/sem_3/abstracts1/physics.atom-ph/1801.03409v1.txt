Modern x-ray sources enable the production of coherent x-ray pulses with a pulse duration in the same order as the characteristic lifetimes of core-hole states of atoms and molecules. These pulses enable the manipulation of the core-hole population during Auger decay processes, modifying the lineshape of the electron spectra. In this work, we present a theoretical model to study those effects in Neon. We identify effects in the Auger-photoelectron coincidence spectrum due to the duration and intensity of the pulses. The normal Auger line-shape is recovered in Auger electron spectrum integrated over all photoelectron energies.
