Atomic properties such as field shift constants, magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, Land\'e $g_J$ factors, and electric quadrupole moments that are described by electronic operators with different ranks and radial behaviors are studied and the role of electron correlation effects in their determination are investigated. We have adopted the Dirac-Hartree-Fock method, the second- and third-order relativistic many-body perturbation theories, and an all-order relativistic many-body method in the coupled-cluster theory framework considering only the linearized terms and also all the non-linearized terms in the singles and doubles with partial triples excitations approximation to carry out these analyses. Variations in the propagation of electron correlation effects with operators having same angular factors but different radial behaviors and with different ranks are highlighted. Corrections from the higher-order relativistic corrections due to the Breit and quantum electrodynamics interactions to all these properties are also estimated. Understanding of trends of electron correlation effects in these properties can be useful to establish accuracies in the theoretical results of different atomic properties and to substantiate validity of an approximated many-body method.
