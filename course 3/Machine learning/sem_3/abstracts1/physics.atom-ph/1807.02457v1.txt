It is shown that the non-relativistic ground state energy of helium-like and lithium-like ions with static nuclei can be easily interpolated in full physics range of nuclear charge $Z$ with accuracy of not less than 6 decimal digits (d.d.) (or 7-8 significant digits (s.d.) for $Z \in [2,50]$) using a meromorphic function in appropriate variable with a few free parameters. It is demonstrated that finite nuclear mass effects do not change 4-5 s.d. for $Z \in [1,50]$ and the leading relativistic and QED effects leave unchanged 3-4 s.d. for $Z \in [1,12]$ in energy, thus, the interpolation reproduces the domain of applicability of non-relativistic QED. A meaning of interpolation is in a construction of unified Pade approximant for both small and large $Z$ expansions but with fitting some parameters at intermediate $Z$. It is noted that $\sim 99.9\%$ of the ground state energy (2 d.d.) is given by the variational energy for properly optimized trial function of the form of (anti)-symmetrized product of three (six) Coulomb orbitals for two-(three) electron system, respectively. This relative accuracy is also reached by the simplest meromorphic function with the single free parameter.
