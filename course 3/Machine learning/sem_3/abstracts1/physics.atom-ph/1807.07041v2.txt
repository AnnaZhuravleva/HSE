We demonstrate how the combination of oscillating magnetic forces and radio-frequency (RF) pulses endows RF photons with tunable momentum. We observe velocity-selective spinflip transitions and the associated Doppler shift. This realizes the key component of purely magnetic spin-orbit coupling schemes for ultracold atoms, which does not involve optical transitions and therefore avoids the problem of heating due to spontaneous emission.
