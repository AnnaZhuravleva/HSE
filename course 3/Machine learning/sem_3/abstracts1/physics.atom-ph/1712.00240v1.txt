We measure the dynamic differential scalar polarizabilities at 10.6 $\mu$m for two candidate clock transitions in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$. We evaluate the fractional black body radiation (BBR) shifts at 300 K to be $-1.28\,(9) \times 10^{-18}$ and $2.70 \,(21) \times10^{-17}$ for the $^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {^3D_1}$ and $^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {^3D_2}$ transitions, respectively. The former is the lowest among all optical clock candidates under active consideration.
