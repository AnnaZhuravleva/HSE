In this paper, we have carried out the calculations of the weighted oscillator strengths and the transition probabilities for a few low-lying transitions of boron-like ions: Mg VIII, Si X and S XII which are astrophysically important, particularly, in the atmospheres of the solar corona. We have employed an all-order relativistic many-body theory called the relativistic coupled-cluster theory to calculate very precisely these atomic quantities of astrophysical interest. We have reported for the first time the transition probabilities for some forbidden transitions which are unavailable in the literature; either theoretically or experimentally. We also discuss the physical effects associated with these transitions. Our data can be used for the identification of spectral lines arising from the coronal atmospheres of Sun and Sun-like stars having an extended corona.
