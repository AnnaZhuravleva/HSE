In the present manuscript, we present a high-speed method to control, manipulate and retrieve an intense vector soliton stored in the ground state coherences of a four-level atomic system. Additionally, we show the importance of the pulse area in determining the evolution of the system and present a constant in the evolution defined as the three-pulse area, a surprising extension to previously defined pulse areas.
