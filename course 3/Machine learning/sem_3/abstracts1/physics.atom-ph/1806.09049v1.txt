Photoelectron circular dichroism results from one-photon ionization of chiral molecules by circularly polarized light and manifests itself in forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane. What is the physical mechanism underlying asymmetric electron ejection? How ``which way'' information builds up in a chiral molecule and maps into forward-backward asymmetry?   We introduce instances of bound chiral wave functions resulting from stationary superpositions of states in a hydrogen atom and use them to show that the chiral response in one-photon ionization of aligned molecular ensembles originates from two propensity rules: (i) Sensitivity of ionization to the sense of electron rotation in the polarization plane. (ii) Sensitivity of ionization to the direction of charge displacement or stationary current orthogonal to the polarization plane. In the companion paper we show how the ideas presented here are part of a broader picture valid for all chiral molecules and arbitrary degrees of molecular alignment.
