We analyze the spatial dynamics of polarized atom vapor and present a mathematical method to eliminate the diffusion effect partially. It is found that the diffusion effect of polarized atoms can be regarded as a low pass filter in spatial frequency domain and fits well with a Butterworth filter. The fitted spatial filter can be used to restore the original magnetic image before being blurred by the diffusion, thus improving the magnetic spatial resolution. The results of spatial dynamics simulation and magnetic image restoration show the potential usage of this method in magnetic gradiometer and atomic magnetic microscopy.
