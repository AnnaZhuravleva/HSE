We present a detailed analysis of the effects of photon statistics on multi-photon ionization. Through a detailed study of the role of intermediate states, we evaluate the conditions under which the premise of non-resonant processes is valid. The limitations of its validity are manifested in the dependence of the process on the stochastic properties of the radiation and found to be quite sensitive to the intensity. The results are quantified through detailed calculations for coherent, chaotic and squeezed vacuum radiation. Their significance in the context of recent developments in radiation sources such as the short wavelength Free Electron Laser and squeezed vacuum radiation are also discussed.
