We report on spectroscopic results on the $^2S_{1/2} \rightarrow\,^2P_{3/2}$ transition in single trapped Yb$^+$ ions. We measure the isotope shifts for all stable Yb$^+$ isotopes except $^{173}$Yb$^+$, as well as the hyperfine splitting of the $^2P_{3/2}$ state in $^{171}$Yb$^+$. Our results are in agreement with previous measurements but are a factor of 5-9 more precise. For the hyperfine constant $A\left(^2P_{3/2}\right) = 875.4(10)$ MHz our results also agree with previous measurements but deviate significantly from theoretical predictions. We present experimental results on the branching ratios for the decay of the $^2P_{3/2}$ state. We find branching fractions for the decay to the $^2D_{3/2}$ state and $^2D_{5/2}$ state of 0.17(1)% and 1.08(5)%, respectively, in rough agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we measured the isotope shifts of the $^2F_{7/2} \rightarrow\,^1D\left[5/2\right]_{5/2}$ transition and determine the hyperfine structure constant for the $^1D\left[5/2\right]_{5/2}$ state in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ to be $A\left(^1D\left[5/2\right]_{5/2}\right) = -107(6)$ MHz.
