Recently a scheme has been proposed for detection of the structured light by measuring the transmission of a vortex beam through a cloud of cold rubidium atoms with energy levels of the $\Lambda$-type configuration {[}N. Radwell et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 123603 (2015){]}. This enables observation of regions of spatially dependent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Here we suggest another scenario for detection of the structured light by measuring the absorption profile of a weak nonvortex probe beam in a highly resonant five-level combined tripod and $\Lambda$ (CTL) atom-light coupling setup. We demonstrate that due to the closed-loop structure of CTL scheme, the absorption of the probe beam depends on the azimuthal angle and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the control vortex beams. This feature is missing in simple $\Lambda$ or tripod schemes, as there is no loop in such atom-light couplings. One can identify different regions of spatially structured transparency through measuring the absorption of probe field under different configurations of structured control light.
