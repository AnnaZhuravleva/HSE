The present article gives a detailed analysis of the new formulation of Titius-Bode law by (Poveda, Lara 2008) and of the hypothesis that this law may exist in extra-solar planetary system. A thorough study of the correspondences between the calculated distances and the observed ones in the Solar system and in 55 Cancri is given. It is shown that Poveda-Lara hypothesis contains serious mistakes (both in theory and in calculations) that makes it unacceptable.
