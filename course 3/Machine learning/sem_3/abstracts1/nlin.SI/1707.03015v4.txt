The work is devoted to constructing a wide class of differential-functional dynamical systems, whose rich algebraic structure makes their integrability analytically effective. In particular, there is analyzed in detail the operator Lax type equations for factorized seed elements, there is proved an important theorem about their operator factorization and the related analytical solution scheme to the corresponding nonlinear differential-functional dynamical systems.
