We use two families of parameters $\{(\epsilon_{x_j}, \epsilon_{t_j})\,|\,\epsilon_{x_j,t_j}=\pm1,\, j=1,2,...,n\}$ to first introduce a unified novel two-family-parameter system (simply called ${\mathcal Q}^{(n)}_{\epsilon_{x_{\vec{n}}},\epsilon_{t_{\vec{n}}}}$ system), connecting integrable local, nonlocal, novel mixed-local-nonlocal, and other nonlocal vector nonlinear Schr\"odinger (VNLS) equations. The ${\mathcal Q}^{(n)}_{\epsilon_{x_{\vec{n}}}, \epsilon_{t_{\vec{n}}}}$ system with $(\epsilon_{x_j}, \epsilon_{t_j})=(\pm 1, 1),\, j=1,2,...,n$ is shown to possess Lax pairs and infinite number of conservation laws. Moreover, we also analyze the ${\mathcal PT}$ symmetry of the Hamiltonians with self-induced potentials. The multi-linear forms and some symmetry reductions are also studied. In fact, the used two families of parameters can also be extended to the general case $\{(\epsilon_{x_j}, \epsilon_{t_j}) | \epsilon_{x_j} = e^{i\theta_{x_j}}, \epsilon_{t_j} = e^{i\theta_{t_j}},\, \theta_{x_j}, \theta_{t_j}\in [0, 2\pi),\, j=1,2,...,n\}$ to generate more types of nonlinear equations. The two-family-parameter idea used in this paper can also be applied to other local nonlinear evolution equations such that novel integrable and non-integrable nonlocal and mixed-local-nonlocal systems can also be found.
