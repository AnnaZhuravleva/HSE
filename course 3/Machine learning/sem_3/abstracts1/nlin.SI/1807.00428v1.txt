Using the exact Bethe Ansatz solution, we investigate methods for calculating the ground-state energy for the $p + ip$-pairing Hamiltonian. We first consider the Hamiltonian isolated from its environment (closed model) through two forms of Bethe Ansatz solutions, which generally have complex-valued Bethe roots. A continuum limit approximation, leading to an integral equation, is applied to compute the ground-state energy. We discuss the evolution of the root distribution curve with respect to a range of parameters, and the limitations of this method. We then consider an alternative approach that transforms the Bethe Ansatz equations to an equivalent form, but in terms of the real-valued conserved operator eigenvalues. An integral equation is established for the transformed solution. This equation is shown to admit an exact solution associated with the ground state. Next we discuss results for a recently derived Bethe Ansatz solution of the open model. With the aforementioned alternative approach based on real-valued roots, combined with mean-field analysis, we are able to establish an integral equation with an exact solution that corresponds to the ground-state for this case.
