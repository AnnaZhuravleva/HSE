With the aid of the symbolic computations software; Wolfram Mathematica 9, the powerful sine-Gordon expansion method is used in examining the analytical solution of the longitudinal wave equation in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod. Sine-Gordon expansion method is based on the well-known sine-Gordon equation and a wave transformation. The longitudinal wave equation is an equation that arises in mathematical physics with dispersion caused by the transverse Poisson's effect in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod. We successfully get some solutions with the complex, trigonometric and hyperbolic function structure. We present the numerical simulations of all the obtained solutions by choosing appropriate values of the parameters. We give the physical meanings of some of the obtained analytical solutions which significantly explain some practical physical problems.
