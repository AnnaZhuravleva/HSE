The Novikov equation is an integrable analogue of the Camassa-Holm equation,with cubic (rather than quadratic) nonlinear term. They both support some special weak solutions called multipeakon solutions. In this paper, Pfaffian technique is employed to study multipeakons of the Novikov equation. First, we notice that the Novikov peakon ODEs describe a flow on the manifold cut out by Pfaffian identities. Then, a bridge between the Novikov peakon and the finite Toda lattice of BKP type (B-Toda lattice) is established with the help of Pfaffian technique. Finally, generalizations of the Novikov equation and the finite B-Toda lattice are proposed together with special solutions. To our knowledge, it is the first time that the Pfaffian is introduced in the study of peakon problem.
