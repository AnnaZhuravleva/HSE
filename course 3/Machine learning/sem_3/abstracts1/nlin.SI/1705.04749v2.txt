We construct various types of degenerate multi-soliton and multi-breather solutions for the sine-Gordon equation based on B\"{a}cklund transformations, Darboux-Crum transformations and Hirota's direct method. We compare the different solution procedures and study the properties of the solutions. Many of them exhibit a compound like behaviour on a small timescale, but their individual one-soliton constituents separate for large time. Exceptions are degenerate cnoidal kink solutions that we construct via inverse scattering from shifted Lam\'{e} potentials. These type of solutions have constant speed and do not display any time-delay. We analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions and compute explicit analytic expressions for time-dependent displacements between the individual one-soliton constituents for any number of degeneracies. When expressed in terms of the soliton speed and spectral parameter the expression found is of the same generic form as the one formerly found for the Korteweg de-Vries equation.
