In the derivation of the generating function of the Gaudin Hamiltonians with boundary terms, we follow the same approach used previously in the rational case, which in turn was based on Sklyanin's method in the periodic case. Our derivation is centered on the quasi-classical expansion of the linear combination of the transfer matrix of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain and the central element, the so-called Sklyanin determinant. The corresponding Gaudin Hamiltonians with boundary terms are obtained as the residues of the generating function. By defining the appropriate Bethe vectors which yield strikingly simple off-shell action of the generating function, we fully implement the algebraic Bethe ansatz, obtaining the spectrum of the generating function and the corresponding Bethe equations.
