Motivated by the theory of Painlev\'e equations and associated hierarchies, we study non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems that are Frobenius integrable. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions under which the Hamiltonians for these systems can be obtained as polynomial-in-times deformations of explicitly time-independent Hamiltonians constituting a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the Poisson bracket. The results are illustrated by several examples.
