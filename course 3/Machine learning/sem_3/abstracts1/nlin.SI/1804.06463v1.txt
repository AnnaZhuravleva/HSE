In this paper we consider the ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric mKdV hierarchy composed of positive odd flows embedded within an affine $\hat sl(2,1)$ algebra. Its B\"acklund transformations are constructed in terms of a gauge transformation preserving the zero curvature representation. The recursion operator relating consecutive flows is derived and shown to relate their B\"acklund transformations.
