In this paper, we examine the initial values for integrable lattice equations, in particular, the lattice equations classified by Adler et al (2003), known as ABS equations. We compactify and resolve singularities explicitly to construct initial value spaces and show how the resulting initial-value space of an ABS equation reduces to that for a discrete Painlev\'e equation. The construction also leads us to the discovery of new reductions of lattice equations that are based on the coordinates that define exceptional planes in the space of initial values for that equation.
