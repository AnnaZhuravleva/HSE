An explicit formula concerning curve intersections equivalent to the time evolution of the periodic discrete Toda lattice is presented. First, the time evolution is realized as a point addition on a hyperelliptic curve, which is the spectral curve of the periodic discrete Toda lattice, then the point addition is translated into curve intersections. Next, it is shown that the curves which appear in the curve intersections are explicitly given by using the conserved quantities of the periodic discrete Toda lattice. Finally, the formulation is lifted to the framework of tropical geometry, and a tropical geometric realization of the periodic box-ball system is constructed via tropical curve intersections.
