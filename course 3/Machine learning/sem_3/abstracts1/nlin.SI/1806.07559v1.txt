It is found that two different celebrate models, the Korteweg de-Vrise (KdV) equation and the Boussinesq equation, are linked to a same model equation but with different nonlocalities. The model equation is called the Alice-Bob KdV (ABKdV) equation which was derived from the usual KdV equation via the so-called consistent correlated bang (CCB) companied by the shifted parity (SP) and delayed time reversal (DTR). The same model can be called as the Alice-Bob Boussinesq (ABB) system if the nonlocality is changed as only one of SP and DTR. For the ABB systems, with help of the bilinear approach and recasting the multi-soliton solutions of the usual Boussinesq equation to an equivalent novel form, the multi-soliton solutions with even numbers and the head on interactions are obtained. However, the multi-soliton solutions with odd numbers and the multi-soliton solutions with even numbers but with pursuant interactions are prohibited. For the ABKdV equation, the multi-soliton solutions exhibit many more structures because an arbitrary odd function of $x+t$ can be introduced as background waves of the usual KdV equation.
