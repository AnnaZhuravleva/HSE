The non-commutative integrability (NCI) is a property fulfilled by some Hamiltonian systems that ensures, among other things, the exact solvability of their corresponding equations of motion. The latter means that an "explicit formula" of the trajectories of these systems can be constructed. Such a construction rests mainly on the so-called "Lie theorem on integrability by quadratures". It is worth mentioning that, in the context of Hamiltonian systems, the NCI has been for around 40 years the unique criterium for exact solvability expressed in the terms of first integrals (containing the usual Liouville-Arnold integrability criterium as a particular case). Concretely, a Hamiltonian system with $n$ degrees of freedom is said to be non-commutative integrable if a set of independent first integrals $F_{1},...,F_{l}$ are known such that: (isotropy) the $l\times l$ matrix with coefficients $\left\{F_{i},F_{j}\right\} $, where $\left\{\cdot,\cdot\right\} $ denotes the canonical Poisson bracket, has nullity $2n-l$, and (closure) each bracket $\left\{F_{i},F_{j}\right\} $ is functionally dependent on the functions $F_{1},...,F_{l}$. In this paper, we develop two new procedures for constructing the trajectories of a Hamiltonian system which only need isotropic first integrals (closure condition is not required). One of them is based on an extended version of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and does not rely on the above mentioned Lie theorem. So, such procedures give rise to a new criterium for the exact solvability of Hamiltonian systems, which is substantially weaker than the NCI criterium.
