In 1967, Japanese physicist Morikazu Toda published a pair of seminal papers in the Journal of the Physical Society of Japan that exhibited soliton solutions to a chain of particles with nonlinear interactions between nearest neighbors. In the fifty years that followed, Toda's system of particles has been generalized in different directions, each with its own analytic, geometric, and topological characteristics. These are known collectively as the Toda lattice. This survey recounts and compares the various versions of the finite nonperiodic Toda lattice from the perspective of their geometry and topology. In particular, we highlight the polytope structure of the solution spaces as viewed through the moment map, and we explain the connection between the real indefinite Toda flows and the integral cohomology of real flag varieties.
