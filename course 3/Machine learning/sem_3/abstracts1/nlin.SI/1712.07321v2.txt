We continue the study of superintegrable systems of Thompson's type separable in Cartesian coordinates. An additional integral of motion for these systems is the polynomial in momenta of N-th order which is a linear function of angle variables and the polynomial in action variables. Existence of such superintegrable systems is naturally related to the famous Chebyshev theorem on binomial differentials.
