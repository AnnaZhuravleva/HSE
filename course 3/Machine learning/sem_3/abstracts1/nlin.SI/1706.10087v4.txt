Recently a certain $q$-Painlev\'e type system has been obtained from a reduction of the $q$-Garnier system. In this paper it is shown that the $q$-Painlev\'e type system is associated with another realization of the affine Weyl group symmetry of type $E_7^{(1)}$ and is different from the well-known $q$-Painlev\'e system of type $E_7^{(1)}$ from the point of view of evolution directions. We also study a connection between the $q$-Painlev\'e type system and the $q$-Painlev\'e system of type $E_7^{(1)}$. Furthermore determinant formulas of particular solutions for the $q$-Painlev\'e type system are constructed in terms of the terminating $q$-hypergeometric function.
