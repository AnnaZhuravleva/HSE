A systematic framework is presented for the construction of hierarchies of soliton equations. This is realised by considering scalar linear integral equations and their representations in terms of infinite matrices, which give rise to all (2+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional soliton hierarchies associated with scalar differential spectral problems. The integrability characteristics for the obtained soliton hierarchies, including Miura-type transforms, $\tau$-functions, Lax pairs as well as soliton solutions, are also derived within this framework.
