The discrete-time two-dimensional Toda lattice of $A_\infty$-type is studied within the direct linearisation framework, which allows us to deal with several nonlinear equations in this class simultaneously and to construct more general solutions of these equations. The periodic reductions of this model are also considered, giving rise to the discrete-time two-dimensional Toda lattices of $A_{r-1}^{(1)}$-type for $r\geq 2$ (which amount to the negative flows of members in the discrete Gel'fand--Dikii hierarchy) and their integrability properties.
