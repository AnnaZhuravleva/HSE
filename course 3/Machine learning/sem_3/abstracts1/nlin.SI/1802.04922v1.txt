In this paper, we construct a Darboux transformation and the related B\"acklund transformation for the supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera (SSK) equation. The associated nonlinear superposition formula is also worked out. We demonstrate that these are natural extensions of the similar results of the Sawada-Kotera equation and may be applied to produce the solutions of the SSK equation. Also, we present two semi-discrete systems and show that the continuum limit of one of them goes to the SKK equation.
