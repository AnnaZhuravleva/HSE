The pentagram map was introduced by Richard Schwartz in 1992 and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. In the present paper we show that this map, as well as all its known integrable multidimensional generalizations, can be seen as refactorization-type mappings in Poisson-Lie groups. This, in particular, provides invariant Poisson structures for multidimensional pentagram maps.
