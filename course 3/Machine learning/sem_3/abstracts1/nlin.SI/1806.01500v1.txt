We consider six-dimensional heavenly equation as a reduction in the framework of general six-dimensional linearly degenerate dispersionless hierarchy. We characterise the reduction in terms of wave functions, introduce generating relation, Lax-Sato equations and develop the dressing scheme for the reduced hierarchy. Using the dressing scheme, we construct a class of solutions for six-dimensional heavenly equation in terms of implicit functions.
