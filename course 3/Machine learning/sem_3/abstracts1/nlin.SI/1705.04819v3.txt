The reduction by restricting the spectral parameters $k$ and $k'$ on a generic algebraic curve of degree $\mathcal{N}$ is performed for the discrete AKP, BKP and CKP equations, respectively. A variety of two-dimensional discrete integrable systems possessing a more general solution structure arise from the reduction, and in each case a unified formula for generic positive integer $\mathcal{N}\geq 2$ is given to express the corresponding reduced integrable lattice equations. The obtained extended two-dimensional lattice models give rise to many important integrable partial difference equations as special degenerations. Some new integrable lattice models such as the discrete Sawada--Kotera, Kaup--Kupershmidt and Hirota--Satsuma equations in extended form are given as examples within the framework.
