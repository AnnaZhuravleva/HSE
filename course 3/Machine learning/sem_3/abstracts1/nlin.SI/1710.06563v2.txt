We study the Schwartz class of initial-boundary value (IBV) problems for the integrable Fokas-Lenells equation on the half-line via the Deift-Zhou's nonlinear descent method analysis of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem such that the asymptotics of the Schwartz class of IBV problems as t\to\infty is presented.
