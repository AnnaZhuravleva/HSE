We establish a new connection between the theory of totally positive Grassmannians and the theory of $\mathtt M$-curves using the finite--gap theory for solitons of the KP equation. Here and in the following KP equation denotes the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili 2 equation, which is the first flow from the KP hierarchy. We also assume that all KP times are real. We associate to any point of the real totally positive Grassmannian $Gr^{TP} (N,M)$ a reducible curve which is a rational degeneration of an $\mathtt M$--curve of minimal genus $g=N(M-N)$, and we reconstruct the real algebraic-geometric data \'a la Krichever for the underlying real bounded multiline KP soliton solutions. From this construction it follows that these multiline solitons can be explicitly obtained by degenerating regular real finite-gap solutions corresponding to smooth $ M$-curves. In our approach we rule the addition of each new rational component to the spectral curve via an elementary Darboux transformation which corresponds to a section of a specific projection $Gr^{TP} (r+1,M-N+r+1)\mapsto Gr^{TP} (r,M-N+r)$.
