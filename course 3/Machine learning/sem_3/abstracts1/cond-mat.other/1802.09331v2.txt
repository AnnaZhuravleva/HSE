Two state systems have wide applicability in quantum modelling of various systems. Here I return to the original two state system, that is Pauli's electron with a spin. And show how this system can be interpreted as a vortical fluid. The similarities and difference between spin flows and classical ideal flows are elucidated. It will be shown how the internal energy of the spin fluid can partially be interpreted in terms of Fisher Information.
