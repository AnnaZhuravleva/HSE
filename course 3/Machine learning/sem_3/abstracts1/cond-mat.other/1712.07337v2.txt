The coherent control of optical phonons has been experimentally demonstrated in various physical systems. While the transient dynamics for optical phonons can be explained by phenomenological models, the coherent control experiment cannot be explained due to the quantum interference. Here, we theoretically propose the generation and detection processes of the optical phonons and experimentally confirm our theoretical model using the diamond optical phonon by the double-pump-probe type experiment.
