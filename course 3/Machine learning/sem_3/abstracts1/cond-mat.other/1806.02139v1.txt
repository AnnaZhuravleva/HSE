The acoustic superradiance from a single vortex state of a Bose-Einstein condensate is formulated and numerically solved. The vortex is described by the draining bathtub model under constant density. The propagation of the fluctuations of the velocity potential are governed by the massless scalar Klein-Gordon wave equation, which establishes the rotating black-hole analogy. Using a particular coordinate transformation, the event horizon and the ergosphere can be identified termwise in the metric and further the respective spectral solutions can be obtained asymptotically at the event horizon and at the ergosphere. The energy of the perturbations is calculated in the time domain. The relation between the reflection coefficient and the rotational frequency of the vortex is calculated in the frequency domain. The independently performed time- and frequency-domain calculations demonstrate the superradiance with very good agreement.
