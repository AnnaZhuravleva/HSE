We present a machine-learning method for predicting sharp transitions in a Hamiltonian phase diagram by extrapolating the properties of quantum systems. The method is based on Gaussian Process regression with a combination of kernels chosen through an iterative procedure maximizing the predicting power of the kernels. The method is capable of extrapolating across the transition lines. The calculations within a given phase can be used to predict not only the closest sharp transition, but also a transition removed from the available data by a separate phase. This makes the present method particularly valuable for searching phase transitions in the parts of the parameter space that cannot be probed experimentally or theoretically.
