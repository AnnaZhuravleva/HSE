An on-ground observation program for high energy atmospheric phenomena in winter thunderstorms along Japan Sea has been performed via measurements of gamma-ray radiation, atmospheric electric field and low-frequency radio band. On February 11, 2017, the radiation detectors recorded gamma-ray emission lasting for 75 sec. The gamma-ray spectrum extended up to 20 MeV and was reproduced by a cutoff power-law model with a photon index of $1.36^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, being consistent with a Bremsstrahlung radiation from a thundercloud (as known as a gamma-ray glow and a thunderstorm ground enhancement). Then the gamma-ray glow was abruptly terminated with a nearby lightning discharge. The low-frequency radio monitors, installed $\sim$50 km away from the gamma-ray observation site recorded leader development of an intra/inter-cloud discharge spreading over $\sim$60 km area with a $\sim$300 ms duration. The timing of the gamma-ray termination coincided with the moment when the leader development of the intra/inter-cloud discharge passed 0.7 km horizontally away from the radiation monitors. The intra/inter-cloud discharge started $\sim$15 km away from the gamma-ray observation site. Therefore, the glow was terminated by the leader development, while it did not trigger the lightning discharge in the present case.
