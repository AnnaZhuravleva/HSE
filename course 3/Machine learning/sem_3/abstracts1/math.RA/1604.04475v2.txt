The aim of this paper is to extend the notion of bialgebra for Leibniz algebras (and Lie algebras) to $3$-Leibniz algebras (and $3$-Lie algebras) by use of the cohomology complex of $3$-Leibniz algebras. Also, some theorems about Leibniz bialgebras are extended and proved in the case of $3$-Leibniz bialgebras ($3$-Lie bialgebras). Moreover, a new theorem on the correspondence between $3$-Leibniz bialgebra and its associated Leibniz bialgebra is proved. Finally, some examples are discussed in detail.
