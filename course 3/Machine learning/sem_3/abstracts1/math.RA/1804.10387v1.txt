The study of $n$-Lie algebras which are natural generalization of Lie algebras is motivated by Nambu Mechanics and recent developments in String Theory and M-branes. The purpose of this paper is to define cohomology complexes and study deformation theory of $n$-Lie algebra morphisms. We discuss infinitesimal deformations, equivalent deformations and obstructions. Moreover, we provide various examples.
