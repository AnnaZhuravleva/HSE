We describe several methods of constructing R-matrices that are dependent upon many parameters, for example unitary R-matrices and R-matrices whose entries are functions. As an application, we construct examples of R-matrices with prescribed singular values.   We characterise some classes of indecomposable set-theoretic solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) and construct R-matrices related to such solutions. In particular, we establish a correspondence between one-generator braces and indecomposable, non-degenerate involutive set-theoretic solutions of the QYBE, showing that such solutions are abundant.   We show that R-matrices related to involutive, non-degenerate solutions of the QYBE have special form.   We also investigate some linear algebra questions related to R-matrices.
