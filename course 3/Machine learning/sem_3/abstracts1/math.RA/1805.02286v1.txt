We establish a relation between fully extended $2$-dimensional TQFTs and recognisable weighted formal languages, rational biprefix codes and lattice TFTs. We show the equivalence of $2D$ closed TFTs and rational exchangeable series and we discuss the important special case of finite groups. Finally, we outline a reformulation in terms of a restricted version of second order monadic logic.
