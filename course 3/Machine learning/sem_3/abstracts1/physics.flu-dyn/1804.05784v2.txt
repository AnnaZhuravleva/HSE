When a passive scalar in the incompressible two-dimensional (2D) flow is so smart as to track the vorticity field to have a rugged correlation, it may form large scale patterns as the vortex with inverse transfer of the scalar energy, together with the 2D kinetic energy. For the $1$-form velocity $\verb"U"$ solving the 4D ideal Euler equation, L. Tartar's relevant invariant $\mathscr{N}=\int_{\mathcal{D}} d\verb"U"\wedge d\verb"U"$ vanishes in the case of no boundary contribution (typically for $\mathcal{D} = \mathbb{T}^4$), becoming a null correlation constraint for the corresponding 3D passive scalar $\theta$ from the cylinder condition, so the absolute-equilibrium energy of $\theta$ is expected to be equipartitioned and transferred forwardly to smaller scales in turbulence, which is expected to be shared by the passive scalars in dimension $d>3$, odd or even, after the consideration of the ruggedness of the Tartar and Serre invariants.
