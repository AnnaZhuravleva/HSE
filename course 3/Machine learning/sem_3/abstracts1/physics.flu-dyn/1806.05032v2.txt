Biofuels have shown to be a reliable source of energy and a replication of fossil fuels. A well-known branch of biofuels is oxygenated ones derived from lignin compounds. Although a wide range of studies was done on oxygenated fuels, anisole has not been investigated thoroughly despite its noticeable advantages. Laminar burning speeds of anisole/air mixtures have been studied experimentally under different initial pressures (0.5-2 bar) and equivalence ratios (0.8-1.4) at temperature of 453 K. All experiments are performed using a transparent constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) and z-type schlieren optical diagnostics technique in conjunction with a high-speed CMOS camera with capability of taking pictures up to 680,000 fps. The recorded pressure data is used as the input for the newly developed multi-shell and differential-based theoretical model in order to calculate the laminar burning speeds for anisole/air mixtures.
