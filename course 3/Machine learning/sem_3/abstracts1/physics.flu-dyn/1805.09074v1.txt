We study existence of helical solitons in the vector modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations one of which is integrable, whereas another one in non-integrable. The latter one describes nonlinear waves in various physical systems, including plasma and chains of particles connected by elastic springs. By using the dynamical system methods such as the blow-up near singular points and the construction of invariant manifolds, we construct helical solitons by the efficient shooting method. The helical solitons arise as a result of co-dimension one bifurcation and exist along a curve in the velocity-frequency parameter plane. Examples of helical solitons are constructed numerically for the non-integrable equation and compared with exact solutions in the integrable vector mKdV equation. The stability of helical solitons with respect to small perturbations is confirmed by direct numerical simulations.
