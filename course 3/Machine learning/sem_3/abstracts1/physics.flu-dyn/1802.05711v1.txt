The stochastic variational approach for geophysical fluid dynamics was introduced by Holm (Proc Roy Soc A, 2015) as a framework for deriving stochastic parameterisations for unresolved scales. The key feature of transport noise is that it respects the Kelvin circulation theorem. This paper applies the variational stochastic parameterisation in a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model for a $\beta$-plane channel flow configuration. The parameterisation is tested by comparing it with a deterministic high resolution eddy-resolving solution that has reached statistical equilibrium. We describe a stochastic time-stepping scheme for the two-layer model and discuss its consistency in time. Then we describe a procedure for estimating the stochastic forcing to approximate unresolved components using data from the high resolution deterministic simulation. We compare an ensemble of stochastic solutions at lower resolution with the numerical solution of the deterministic model. These computations quantify the uncertainty of the coarse grid computation relative to the fine grid computation. The results show that the proposed parameterisation is efficient and effective for both homogeneous and heterogeneous flows, and they lay a solid foundation for data assimilation.
