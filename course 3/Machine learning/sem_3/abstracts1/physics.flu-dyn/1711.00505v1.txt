We present some new discoveries on the mathematical foundation of linear hydrodynamic stability theory. The new discoveries are: 1. Linearized Euler equations fail to provide a linear approximation on inviscid hydrodynamic stability. 2. Eigenvalue instability predicted by high Reynolds number linearized Navier-Stokes equations cannot capture the dominant instability of super fast growth. 3. As equations for directional differentials, Rayleigh equation and Orr-Sommerfeld equation cannot capture the nature of the full differentials.
