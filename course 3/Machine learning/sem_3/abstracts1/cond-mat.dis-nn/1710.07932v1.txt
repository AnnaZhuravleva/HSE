In the presence of randomness, a relativistic semimetal undergoes a quantum transition towards a diffusive phase. A standard approach relates this transition to the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model in the limit of $N \to 0$, while rare events were argued to be relevant close to the transition. In this work we reconcile previous studies by developing a functional renormalization group amenable to include non-perturbative effects. We show that the previously considered fixed point is indeed infinitely unstable, confirming the necessity to describe fluctuations beyond the Gaussian approximation. Furthermore, the disorder distribution renormalizes following the so-called porous medium equation. We find that the transition is controlled by a non-analytic fixed point drastically different from the fixed point of the $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model. We relate a self-similar solution of the porous medium equation to a mechanism of generation of a finite density of states at the nodal point responsible for the transition.
