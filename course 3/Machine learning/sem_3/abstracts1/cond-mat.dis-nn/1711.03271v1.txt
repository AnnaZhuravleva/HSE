Most of the analytical studies on spin glasses are performed by using mean-field theory and renormalization group analysis. Analytical studies on finite-dimensional spin glasses are very challenging. In this short note, a possible exten- sion of the approaches on the phase transition in spin glasses is demonstrated. To validate our extension, we compared our estimates on the critical points with the existing numerical results.
