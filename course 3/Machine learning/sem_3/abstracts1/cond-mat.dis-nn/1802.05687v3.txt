The 1-D Anderson model possesses a completely localized spectrum of eigenstates for all values of the disorder. We consider the effect of projecting the Hamiltonian to a truncated Hilbert space, destroying time reversal symmetry. We analyze the ensuing eigenstates using different measures such as inverse participation ratio and sample-averaged moments of the position operator. In addition, we examine amplitude fluctuations in detail to detect the possibility of multifractal behavior (characteristic of mobility edges) that may arise as a result of the truncation procedure.
