The impact of local reflection symmetry on wave localization and transport within finite disordered chains is investigated. Local symmetries thereby play the role of a spatial correlation of variable range. We find that a transition to more delocalized and fragmented eigenstates occurs for intermediate average symmetry domain sizes, depending on the degree of disorder. This is caused by the partial formation of states with approximate local parity confined within fictitious, disorder-induced double wells and perturbed by the coupling to adjacent domains. The dynamical evolution of wave-packets shows that the average site-resolved transfer efficiency is enhanced between regions connected by local symmetry. The transfer may further be drastically amplified in the presence of spatial overlap between the symmetry domains, and in particular when global and local symmetry coexist. Applicable to generic discrete models for matter and light waves, our work provides a perspective to understand and exploit the impact of local order at multiple scales in complex systems.
