We obtain an exact result for the midpoint probability distribution function (pdf) of the stationary continuum directed polymer, when averaged over the disorder. It is obtained by relating that pdf to the linear response of the stochastic Burgers field to some perturbation. From the symmetries of the stochastic Burgers equation we derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation so that the pdf gets given by the stationary two space-time points correlation function of the Burgers field. An analytical expression for the latter was obtained by Imamura and Sasamoto [2013], thereby rendering our result explicit. In the large length limit that implies that the pdf is nothing but the scaling function $f_{{\rm KPZ}}(y)$ introduced by Pr\"ahofer and Spohn [2004]. Using the KPZ-universality paradigm, we find that this function can therefore also be interpreted as the pdf of the position y of the maximum of the Airy process minus a parabola and a two-sided Brownian motion. We provide a direct numerical test of the result through simulations of the Log-Gamma polymer.
