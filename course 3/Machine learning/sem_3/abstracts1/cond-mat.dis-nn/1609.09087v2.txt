We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which studies correlation between discretized inverse temperature and spin configuration of 2D Ising model and show that it can find a feature of the phase transition without teaching any a priori information for it. We also define a new order parameter via the CNN and show that it provides well approximated critical inverse temperature. In addition, we compare the activation functions for convolution layer and find that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is important to detect the phase transition of 2D Ising model.
