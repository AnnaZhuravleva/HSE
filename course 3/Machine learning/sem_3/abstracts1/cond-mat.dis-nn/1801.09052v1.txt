The dimensional reductions in the branched polymer and the random field Ising model (RFIM) are discussed by a conformal bootstrap method. The small minors are applied for the evaluations of the scale dimensions of these two models and the results are compared to D-2 dimensional Yang-Lee edge singularity and to pure D-2 dimensional Ising model, respectively. For the former case, the dimensional reduction is shown to be valid and the supersymmetric condition is satisfied, but for the later case, in the lower dimension the deviation can be seen below five dimensions.
