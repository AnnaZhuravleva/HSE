The Anderson metal-insulator transition (MIT) has long been studied, but there is still no agreement on its critical exponent $\nu$ when comparing experiments and theory. In this work we employ \textit{ab initio} methods to study the MIT in a doped semiconductor. We use linear-scaling DFT to simulate prototypes of sulfur-doped silicon (Si:S). From these we build larger tight-binding models close to the critical concentration of the MIT. When the dopant concentration is increased, an impurity band forms and eventually delocalizes. We characterize the MIT via multifractal finite-size scaling, obtaining the phase diagram and estimates of $\nu$. Our results suggest a possible resolution of the long-standing exponent puzzle due to the hybridization of conduction and impurity bands.
