We study the details of the distribution of the entanglement spectrum (eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix) of a disordered spin chain exhibiting a many-body localization (MBL) transition. In the thermalizing region we identify the evolution under increasing system size of the eigenvalues distribution function, whose thermodynamic limit is close (but possibly different from) the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. From the analysis we extract a correlation length $L_s(h)$ determining the minimum system size to enter the asymptotic region. We find that $L_s(h)$ diverges at the MBL transition. We discuss the nature of the subleading corrections to the entanglement spectrum distribution and to the entanglement entropy.
