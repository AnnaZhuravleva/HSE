In this work we introduce the many-body synchronization of an interacting qubit ensemble which allows one to switch dynamically from many-body-localized (MBL) to an ergodic state. We show that applying of $\pi$-pulses with altering phases, one can effectively suppress the MBL phase and, hence, eliminate qubits disorder. The findings are based on the analysis of the Loschmidt echo dynamics which shows a transition from a power-law decay to more rapid one indicating the dynamical MBL-to-ergodic transition. The technique does not require to know the microscopic details of the disorder.
