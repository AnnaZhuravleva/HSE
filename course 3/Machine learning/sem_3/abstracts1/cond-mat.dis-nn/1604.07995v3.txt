We study the recently introduced Inverse-Beta polymer, an exactly solvable, anisotropic finite temperature model of directed polymer on the square lattice, and obtain its stationary measure. In parallel we introduce an anisotropic zero temperature model of directed polymer on the square lattice, the Bernoulli-Geometric polymer, and obtain its stationary measure. This new exactly solvable model is dual to the Inverse-Beta polymer and interpolates between models of first and last passage percolation on the square lattice. Both stationary measures are shown to satisfy detailed balance. We also obtain the asymptotic mean value of (i) the free-energy of the Inverse-Beta polymer; (ii) the optimal energy of the Bernoulli-Geometric polymer. We discuss the convergence of both models to their stationary state. We perform simulations of the Bernoulli-Geometric polymer that confirm our results.
