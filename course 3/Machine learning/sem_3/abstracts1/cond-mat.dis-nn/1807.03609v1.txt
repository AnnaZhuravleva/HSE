In this work we introduce a multi-species generalization of the Hopfield model for associative memory, where neurons are divided into groups and both inter-groups and intra-groups pair-wise interactions are considered, with different intensities. Thus, this system contains two of the main ingredients of modern Deep neural network architectures: Hebbian interactions to store patterns of information and multiple layers coding different levels of correlations. The model is completely solvable in the low-load regime with a suitable generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi technique, despite the Hamiltonian can be a non-definite quadratic form of the magnetizations. The family of multi-species Hopfield model includes, as special cases, the 3-layers Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with Gaussian hidden layer and the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) model.
