For infinite machines which are free from the classical Thompson's lamp paradox we show that they are not free from its inverted version. We provide a program for infinite machines and an infinite mechanism which simulate this paradox. While their finite analogs work predictably, the program and the infinite mechanism demonstrate an undefined behavior. As in the case of infinite Davies's machines, our examples are free from infinite masses, infinite velocities, infinite forces, etc. Only infinite divisibility of space and timeis assumed. Thus, the considered infinite devices are possible in a continuous Newtonian Universe and they do not conflict with continuous Newtonian mechanics. Some possible applications to the analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations are discussed.
