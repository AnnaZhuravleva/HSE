We construct, under semipositivity assumptions, an A-infinity morphism from the equivariant Fukaya algebra of a Lagrangian brane in the zero level set of a moment map to the Fukaya algebra of the quotient brane. The map induces a map between Maurer-Cartan solution spaces, and intertwines the disk potentials. As an application, we show the weak unobstructedness and Floer nontriviality of various Lagrangians in symplectic quotients. In the semi-Fano toric case we give another proof of the results of Chan-Lau-Leung-Tseng, by showing that the potential of a Lagrangian toric orbit in a toric manifold is related to the Givental-Hori-Vafa potential by a change of variable. We also reprove the results of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono on weak unobstructedness of these toric orbits. In the case of polygon spaces we show the existence of weakly unobstructed and Floer nontrivial products of spheres.
