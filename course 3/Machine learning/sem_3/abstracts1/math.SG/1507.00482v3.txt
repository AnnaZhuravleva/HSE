Under natural restrictions it is known that a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is a Hamiltonian PDE which defines a symplectic flow on a symplectic Hilbert space preserving the Hilbert norm. When the potential is one-periodic in time and after passing to the projectivization, it makes sense to ask whether the natural analogue of the Arnold conjecture holds. After employing methods from non-standard model theory, we show how Hamiltonian Floer theory can be used to prove the existence of infinitely many fixed points of the time-one flow of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of convolution type.
