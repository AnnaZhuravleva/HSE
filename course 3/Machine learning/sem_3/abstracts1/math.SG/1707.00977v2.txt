Let A be the space of irreducible connections (vector potentials) over a SU(n)-principal bundle on a three-dimensional manifold M. Let T be the fiber product of the tangent and cotangent bundles of A. We endow T with a symplectic structure \Omega which is represented by a vortex formula. The corresponding Poisson bracket will give a parallel formula discussed by Marsden-Weinstein in case of the electric-magnetic field, U(1)-gauge. We shall prove the Maxwell equations on T. The first two equations are the Hamilton equations of motion derived from the symplectic structure on T, and the second equations come from the moment maps of the action of the group of gauge transformations G. That is, these are conserved charges. The Yang-Mills field F is a subspace of T defined as the space with 0-charge. There is a Hamiltonian action of G on F. The moment map gives a new conserved quantity. Finally we shall give a symplectic variables (Clebsch parametrization) for (F, \Omega)
