We extend Noether's theorem to the setting of multisymplectic geometry by exhibiting a correspondence between conserved quantities and continuous symmetries on a multi-Hamiltonian system. We show that a homotopy co-momentum map interacts with this correspondence in a way analogous to the moment map in symplectic geometry.   We apply our results to generalize the theory of the classical momentum and position functions from the phase space of a given physical system to the multisymplectic phase space. We also apply our results to manifolds with a torsion-free $G_2$ structure.
