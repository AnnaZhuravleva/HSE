The transport properties of a ferromagnet-superconductor (FS) junction are studied in a scattering formulation. Andreev reflection at the FS interface is strongly affected by the exchange interaction in the ferromagnet. The conductance G_FS of a ballistic point contact between F and S can be both larger or smaller than the value G_FN with the superconductor in the normal state, depending on the ratio of the exchange and Fermi energies. If the ferromagnet contains a tunnel barrier (I), the conductance G_FIFS exhibits resonances which do not vanish in linear response -- in contrast to the Tomasch oscillations for non-ferromagnetic materials.
