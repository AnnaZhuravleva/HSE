Motivated from the action functional for bosonic strings with extrinsic curvature term we introduce an action functional for maps between Riemannian manifolds that interpolates between the actions for harmonic and biharmonic maps. Critical points of this functional will be called semi-biharmonic maps. In this article we initiate a rigorous mathematical treatment of this functional and study various basic aspects of its critical points.
