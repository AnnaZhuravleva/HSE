This paper, the third in a series, completes our description of all (radial) solutions on C* of the tt*-Toda equations, using a combination of methods from p.d.e., isomonodromic deformations (Riemann-Hilbert method), and loop groups.   We place these global solutions into the broader context of solutions which are smooth near 0. For such solutions, we compute explicitly the monodromy data (in particular, the connection matrix) of the associated meromorphic system, in the resonant cases as well as the non-resonant case.   This allows us to give a complete picture of the monodromy data of the global solutions.
