We construct a family of instanton metric obtained from new exact singular solutions for minimal surfaces by noticing the correspondence between minimal surfaces in the three dimesional Euclidean space and gravitational instantons possessing two killing vectors. By Calabi's correspondence, we derive a family of explicit maximal surface solution for spacelike surface with zero mean curvature equation.
