Quite a number of distinct versions of Bartnik's definition of quasi-local mass appear in the literature, and it is not a priori clear that any of them produce the same value in general. In this paper we make progress on reconciling these definitions. The source of discrepancies is two-fold: the choice of boundary conditions (of which there are three variants) and the non-degeneracy or "no-horizon" condition (at least six variants). To address the boundary conditions, we show that given a 3-dimensional region $\Omega$ of nonnegative scalar curvature ($R \geq 0$) extended in a Lipschitz fashion across $\partial \Omega$ to an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with $R \geq 0$ (also holding distributionally along $\partial \Omega$), there exists a smoothing, arbitrarily small in $C^0$ norm, such that $R \geq 0$ and the geometry of $\Omega$ are preserved, and the ADM mass changes only by a small amount. With this we are able to show that the three boundary conditions yield equivalent Bartnik masses for two reasonable non-degeneracy conditions. We also discuss subtleties pertaining to the various non-degeneracy conditions and produce a nontrivial inequality between a no-horizon version of the Bartnik mass and Bray's replacement of this with the outward-minimizing condition.
