For a Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ with Lie algebroid $A$, we realize the symplectic leaves of the Lie-Poisson structure on $A^*$ as orbits of the affine coadjoint action of the Lie groupoid $\mathcal{J}\mathcal{G}\ltimes T^*M$ on $A^*$, which coincide with the groupoid orbits of the symplectic groupoid $T^*\mathcal{G}$ over $A^*$. It is also shown that there is a fiber bundle structure on each symplectic leaf. In the case of gauge groupoids, a symplectic leaf is the universal phase space for a classical particle in a Yang-Mills field.
