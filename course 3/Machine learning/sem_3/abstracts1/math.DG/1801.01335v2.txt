Sobolev spaces on vector bundles   II. Smooth heat kernels on vector bundles   III. Basis differential operators in Riemannian manifolds   IV. Some specific results for the minimal heat kernel   V. Wiener measure and Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds   VI. Contractive Dynkin and Kato potentials   VII. Foundations of covariant Schr\"odinger semigroups   VIII. Compactness of $V(H^{\nabla}+1)^{-1}$   IX. $L^q$-properties of covariant Schr\"odinger semigroups   X. Continuity properties of covariant Schr\"odinger semigroups   XI. Integral kernels for covariant Schr\"odinger semigroups   XII. Essential self-adjointness of covariant Schr\"odinger semigroups   XIII. Smooth compactly supported sections as form core   XIV. Applications (in quantum mechanics and geometric analysis)
