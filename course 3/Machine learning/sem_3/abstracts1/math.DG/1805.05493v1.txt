We derive new inequalities between the boundary capacity of an asymptotically flat 3-dimensional manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature and its boundary mean curvature deficit, a quantity that relates to the Brown--York quasi-local mass. These inequalities give new variational characterizations of Riemannian Schwarzschild manifolds. We argue by recasting the setup to the study of mean-convex fill-ins with nonnegative scalar curvature and, in the process, we consider fill-ins with singular metrics, which may have independent interest.
