It is of interest to study supergravity solutions preserving a non-minimal fraction of supersymmetries. A necessary condition for supersymmetry to be preserved is that the spacetime admits a Killing spinor and hence a null or timelike Killing vector field. Any spacetime admitting a covariantly constant null vector field ($CCNV$) belongs to the Kundt class of metrics, and more importantly admits a null Killing vector field. We investigate the existence of additional non-spacelike isometries in the class of higher-dimensional $CCNV$ Kundt metrics in order to produce potential solutions that preserve some supersymmetries.
