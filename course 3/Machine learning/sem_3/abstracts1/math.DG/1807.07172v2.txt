The Madelung transform is known to relate Schr\"odinger-type equations in quantum mechanics and the Euler equations for barotropic-type fluids. We prove that, more generally, the Madelung transform is a K\"ahler map (i.e. a symplectomorphism and an isometry) between the space of wave functions and the cotangent bundle to the density space equipped with the Fubini-Study metric and the Fisher-Rao information metric, respectively. We also show that Fusca's momentum map property of the Madelung transform is a manifestation of the general approach via reduction for semi-direct product groups. Furthermore, the Hasimoto transform for the binormal equation turns out to be the 1D case of the Madelung transform, while its higher-dimensional version is related to the problem of conservation of the Willmore energy in binormal flows.
