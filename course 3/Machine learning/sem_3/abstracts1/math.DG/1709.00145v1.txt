Instantons on the Taub-NUT space are related to `bow solutions' via a generalization of the ADHM-Nahm transform. Both are related to complex geometry, either via the twistor transform or via the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence. We explore various aspects of this complex geometry, exhibiting equivalences. For both the instanton and the bow solution we produce two monads encoding each of them respectively. Identifying these monads we establish the one-to-one correspondence between the instanton and the bow solution.
