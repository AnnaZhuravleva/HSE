We study the stability of the Positive Mass Theorem (PMT) and the Riemannian Penrose Inequality (RPI) in the case where a region of an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold $M^3$ can be foliated by a smooth solution of Inverse Mean Curvature Flow (IMCF) which is uniformly controlled. We consider a sequence of regions of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds $U_T^i\subset M_i^3$, foliated by a smooth solution to IMCF which is uniformly controlled, and if $\partial U_T^i = \Sigma_0^i \cup \Sigma_T^i$ and $m_H(\Sigma_T^i) \rightarrow 0$ then $U_T^i$ converges to a topological annulus portion of hyperbolic space with respect to $L^2$ metric convergence. If instead $m_H(\Sigma_T^i)-m_H(\Sigma_0^i) \rightarrow 0$ and $m_H(\Sigma_T^i) \rightarrow m >0$ then we show that $U_T^i$ converges to a topological annulus portion of the Anti-deSitter Schwarzschild metric with respect to $L^2$ metric convergence.
