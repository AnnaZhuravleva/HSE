The geometry of the quaternionic anti-de Sitter fibration is studied in details. As a consequence, we obtain formulas for the horizontal Laplacian and subelliptic heat kernel of the fibration. The heat kernel formula is explicit enough to derive small time asymptotics. Related twistor spaces and corresponding heat kernels are also discussed and the connection to the quaternionic magnetic Laplacian is done.
