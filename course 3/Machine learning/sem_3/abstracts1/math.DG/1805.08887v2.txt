We study geodesics along a noncompact Kerr-Newman instanton, where the asymptotic geometry is either de Sitter or anti-de Sitter. We use first integrals for the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to characterize trajectories both near and away from horizons. We study the interaction of geodesics with special features of the metric, particularly regions of angular degeneracy or "theta horizons" in the de Sitter case. Finally, we characterize a number of stable equilibrium orbits.
