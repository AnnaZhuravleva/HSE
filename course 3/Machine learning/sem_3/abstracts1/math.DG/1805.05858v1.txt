In this paper most of the classes of G2-structures with Einstein induced metric of negative, null or positive scalar curvature are realized. This is carried out by means of warped G2-structures with fiber an Einstein SU(3) manifold. The torsion forms of any warped G2-structure are explicitly described in terms of the torsion forms of the SU(3)-structure and the warping function, which allows to give characterizations of the principal classes of Einstein warped G2 manifolds. Similar results are obtained for Einstein warped Spin(7) manifolds with fiber a G2 manifold.
