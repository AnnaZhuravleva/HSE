We give examples illustrating the fact that the different space/time splittings of the tangent bundle of a semi-Riemannian spin manifold give rise to non-equivalent norms on the space of compactly supported sections of the spinor bundle, and as a result, to different completions. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for two space/time splittings to define equivalent norms in terms of a generalized Doppler shift between maximal negative definite subspaces. We explore some consequences for the Noncommutative Geometry program.
