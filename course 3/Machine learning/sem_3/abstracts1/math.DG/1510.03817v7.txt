We prove several abstract versions of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality for an analytic functional on a Banach space that generalize previous abstract versions of this inequality, weakening their hypotheses and, in particular, the well-known infinite-dimensional version of the gradient inequality due to Lojasiewicz proved by Simon (1983). We also prove that the optimal exponent of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality is obtained when the functional is Morse-Bott, improving on similar results due to Chill (2003, 2006), Haraux and Jendoubi (2007), and Simon (1996). We apply our abstract Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities to prove a Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities for the harmonic map energy functional using Sobolev spaces which impose minimal regularity requirements on maps between closed, Riemannian manifolds. Our Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequalities for the harmonic map energy functional generalize those of Kwon (2002), Liu and Yang (2010), Simon (1983, 1985), and Topping (1997).
