We prove that the automorphism group of a compact 6-manifold $M$ endowed with a symplectic half-flat SU(3)-structure has abelian Lie algebra with dimension bounded by min$\{5,b_1(M)\}$. Moreover, we study the properties of the automorphism group action and we discuss relevant examples. In particular, we provide new complete examples on $T\mathbb{S}^3$ which are invariant under a cohomogeneity one action of SO(4).
