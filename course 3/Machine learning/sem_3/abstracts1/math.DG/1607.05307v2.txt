For any integer $k$ we construct an explicit example of a twistor space which contains a one--parameter family of jumping rational curves, where the normal bundle changes from $O(1)+O(1)$ to $O(k)+O(2-k)$. For $k>3$ the resulting anti--self--dual Ricci-flat manifold is a Zariski cone in the space of holomorphic sections of $O(k)$. In the case $k=2$ we recover the canonical example of Hitchin's folded hyper-Kahler manifold, where the jumping lines form a three--parameter family. We show that in this case there exist normalisable solutions to the Schrodinger equation which extend through the fold.
