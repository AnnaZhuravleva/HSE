Penrose's two-spinor notation for $4$-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds can be extended to two-component notation for quaternionic manifolds, which is a very useful tool for calculation. We construct a family of quaternionic complexes over unimodular quaternionic manifolds by elementary calculation. On complex quaternionic manifolds, which are essentially the complexification of real analytic quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds, the existence of these complexes was established by Baston by using twistor transformations and spectral sequences. Unimodular quaternionic manifolds constitute a nice and large class of quaternionic manifolds: the conformal change of a unimodular quaternionic structure is still unimodular quaternionic and the complexes over such manifolds are conformally invariant. This class of manifolds, including quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds, are the real version of torsion-free QCFs introduced by Bailey and Eastwood. We show the ellipticity of these complexes and its Hodge-type decomposition. We also obtain a Weitzenb\"ock formula to establish vanishing of the cohomology groups of these complexes for quaternionic K\"ahler manifolds with negative scalar curvatures.
