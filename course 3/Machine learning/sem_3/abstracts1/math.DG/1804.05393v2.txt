We consider almost quasi-Yamabe solitons in Riemannian manifolds, derive a Bochner-type formula in the gradient case and prove that under certain assumptions, the manifold is of constant scalar curvature. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a gradient almost quasi-Yamabe soliton on the base manifold to induce a gradient almost quasi-Yamabe soliton on the warped product manifold.
