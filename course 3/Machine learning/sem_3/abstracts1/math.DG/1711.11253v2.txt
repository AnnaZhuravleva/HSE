In this paper, we study the Atiyah class and Todd class of the DG manifold $(F[1],d_F)$ corresponding to an integrable distribution $F \subset T_{\mathbb{K}} M = TM \otimes_{\mathbb{R}} \mathbb{K}$, where $\mathbb{K} = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. We show that these two classes are canonically identical to those of the Lie pair $(T_{\mathbb{K}} M, F)$. As a consequence, the Atiyah class of a complex manifold $X$ is isomorphic to the Atiyah class of the corresponding DG manifold $(T^{0,1}_X[1],\bar{\partial})$. Moreover, if $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold, then the Todd class of $X$ is also isomorphic to the Todd class of the corresponding DG manifold $(T^{0,1}_X[1],\bar{\partial})$.
