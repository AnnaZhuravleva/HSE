We define the operations of conformal change and elementary deformation in the setting of generalized complex geometry. Then we apply Swann's twist construction to generalized (almost) complex and Hermitian structures obtained by these operations and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the Courant integrability of the resulting twisted structures. In particular, we associate to any appropriate generalized Kahler manifold (M, G, \mathcal J ) with a Hamiltonian Killing vector field a new generalized Kahler manifold, depending on the choice of a pair of non-vanishing functions and compatible twist data. We study this construction when (M, G, \mathcal J) is (diagonal) toric, with emphasis on the four dimensional case. In particular, we apply it to deformations of the standard flat Kahler metric on C^{n}, the Fubini-Study Kahler metric on CP^{2} and the so called admissible Kahler metrics on Hirzebruch surfaces. As a further application, we recover the KK (Kahler-Kahler) correspondence, which is obtained by specializing to the case of an ordinary Kahler manifold.
