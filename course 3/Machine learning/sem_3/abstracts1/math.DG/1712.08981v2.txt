We study periodic monopoles satisfying some mild conditions, called of GCK type. Particularly, we give a classification of periodic monopoles of GCK type in terms of difference modules with parabolic structure, which is a kind of Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence between differential geometric objects and algebraic objects. We also clarify the asymptotic behaviour of periodic monopoles of GCK type around infinity.
