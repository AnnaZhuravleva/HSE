We compute the formal Poisson cohomology of a broken Lefschetz fibration by calculating it at fold singularities and singular points. Near a fold singularity the computation reduces to that for a point singularity in 3 dimensions. For the Poisson cohomology around singular points we adapt techniques developed for the Sklyanin algebra. As a side result, we give compact formulas for the Poisson coboundary operator of an arbitrary Jacobian Poisson structure in $4$ dimensions.
