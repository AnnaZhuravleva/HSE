In this paper we propose and investigate in full generality new notions of (continuous, non-isometric) symmetry on hyperk\"ahler spaces. These can be grouped into two categories, corresponding to the two basic types of continuous hyperk\"ahler isometries which they deform: tri-Hamiltonian isometries, on one hand, and rotational isometries, on the other. The first category of deformations give rise to Killing spinors and generate what are known as hidden hyperk\"ahler symmetries. The second category give rise to hyperholomorphic line bundles over the hyperk\"ahler manifolds on which they are defined and, by way of the Atiyah-Ward correspondence, to holomorphic line bundles over their twistor spaces endowed with meromorphic connections, generalizing similar structures found in the purely rotational case by Haydys and Hitchin. Examples of hyperk\"ahler metrics with this type of symmetry include the c-map metrics on cotangent bundles of affine special K\"ahler manifolds with generic prepotential function, and the hyperk\"ahler constructions on the total spaces of certain integrable systems proposed by Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke in connection with the wall-crossing formulas of Kontsevich and Soibelman, to which our investigations add a new layer of geometric understanding.
