We derive an inequality that relates nodal set and eigenvalues of a class of twisted Dirac operators on closed surfaces and point out how this inequality naturally arises as an eigenvalue estimate for the $\rm Spin^c$ Dirac operator. This allows us to obtain eigenvalue estimates for the twisted Dirac operator appearing in the context of Dirac-harmonic maps and their extensions, from which we also obtain several Liouville type results.
