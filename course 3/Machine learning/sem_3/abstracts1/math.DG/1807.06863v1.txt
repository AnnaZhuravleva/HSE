In this paper, we construct for the first time, the Witten genus and elliptic genera on noncompact manifolds with a proper cocompact action by an almost connected Lie group and prove a vanishing result that generalise known results for compact group actions on compact manifolds. Under the additional assumption that the loop Dirac induction modularity conjecture that is formulated here holds, we are able to prove a rigidity result for the elliptic genera in our context. We also compute our genera for some interesting examples.
