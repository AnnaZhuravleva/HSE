In this paper, we study the spectrum of warped products in order to obtain a class of G-manifolds so that is possible to describe their generic spectrum. We establish a kind of splitting eigenvalues theorem considering a specific family of operators on the base of a warped product. As a consequence, we prove a density theorem for a set of warping functions that makes the spectrum of the Laplacian a warped-simple spectrum. As an application, we give an answer to the generic situation of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a class of compact G-manifolds. In particular, we give a partial answer to a question posed in 1990 by Steven Zelditch about the generic situation of multiplicity of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on principal bundles.
