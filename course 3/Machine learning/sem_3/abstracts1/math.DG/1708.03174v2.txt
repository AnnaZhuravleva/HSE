We introduce the concept of a higher algebroid, naturally generalizing the notions of an algebroid and a higher tangent bundle. Our ideas are based on a description of (Lie) algebroids as Zakrzewski morphisms -- differential relations of a special kind. In our approach higher algebroids are Zakrzewski morphism between graded-linear bundles satisfying natural axioms. We provide natural examples and discuss applications in geometric mechanics.
