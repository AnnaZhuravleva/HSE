We consider expanding vacuum spacetimes with a CMC foliation by compact spacelike hypersurfaces. Under scale invariant a priori geometric bounds (type-III), we show that there are arbitrarily large future time intervals that are modelled by a flat spacetime or a Kasner spacetime. We give related results for a class of expanding vacuum spacetimes that do not satisfy the a priori bounds (type-II).
