Let G be a compact Lie group acting on a smooth manifold M. In this paper, we consider Meinrenken's G-equivariant bundle gerbe connections on M as objects in a 2-groupoid. We prove this 2-category is equivalent to the 2-groupoid of gerbe connections on the differential quotient stack associated to M, and isomorphism classes of G-equivariant gerbe connections are classified by degree three differential equivariant cohomology. Finally, we consider the existence and uniqueness of conjugation-equivariant gerbe connections on compact semisimple Lie groups.
