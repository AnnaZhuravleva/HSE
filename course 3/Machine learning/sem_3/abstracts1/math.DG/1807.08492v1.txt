We study parallelisable bimodule noncommutative Riemannian geometries in small dimensions, working over the field ${\mathbb F}_2$ of 2 elements and with coordinate algebras up to dimension $n\le 3$. We find a rich moduli of examples for $n=3$ and top form degree 2, including 9 that are Ricci flat but not flat. Their coordinate algebras are commutative but their differentials are not. We also study the quantum Laplacian $\Delta=(\ ,\ )\nabla d$ on our models and characterise when it has a massive mode.
