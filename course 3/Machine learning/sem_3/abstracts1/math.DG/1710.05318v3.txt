We study Finsler spacetimes and Killing vector fields taking care of the fact that the generalized metric tensor associated to the Lorentz-Finsler function $L$ is in general well defined only on a subset of the slit tangent bundle. We then introduce a new class of Finsler spacetimes endowed with a timelike Killing vector field that we call stationary splitting Finsler spacetimes. We characterize when a Finsler spacetime with a timelike Killing vector field is locally a stationary splitting. Finally, we show that the causal structure of a stationary splitting is the same of one of two Finslerian static spacetimes naturally associated to the stationary splitting.
