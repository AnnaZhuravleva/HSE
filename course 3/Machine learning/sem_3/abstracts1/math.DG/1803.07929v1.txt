We obtain a Hitchin-Kobayashi-type correspondence for symplectic vortex equations, with the target a Kahler cone over a compact Sasakian manifold. We show that the correspondence reduces to studying the existence and uniqueness of Kazdan-Warner equations. Using this, we construct a map between the moduli space of solutions to the symplectic vortex equations and effective divisors.
