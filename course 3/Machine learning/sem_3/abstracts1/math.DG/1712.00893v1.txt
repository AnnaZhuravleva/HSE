We provide an introduction to the mathematics and physics of the deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills equation, a fully nonlinear geometric PDE on Kahler manifolds which plays an important role in mirror symmetry. We discuss the physical origin of the equation, and some recent progress towards its solution. In dimension 3 we prove a new Chern number inequality and discuss the relationship with algebraic stability conditions.
