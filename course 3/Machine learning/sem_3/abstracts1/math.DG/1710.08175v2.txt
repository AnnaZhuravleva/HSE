The theory of multidimensional Poisson vertex algebras (mPVAs) provides a completely algebraic formalism to study the Hamiltonian structure of PDEs, for any number of dependent and independent variables. In this paper, we compute the cohomology of the PVAs associated with two-dimensional, two-components Poisson brackets of hydrodynamic type at the third differential degree. This allows us to obtain their corresponding Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology, which is the main building block of the theory of their deformations. Such a cohomology is trivial neither in the second group, corresponding to the existence of a class of not equivalent infinitesimal deformation, nor in the third, corresponding to the obstruction to extend such deformations
