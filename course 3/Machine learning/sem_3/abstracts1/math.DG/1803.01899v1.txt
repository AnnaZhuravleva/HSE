The positive mass theorem states that the total mass of a complete asymptotically flat manifold with non-negative scalar curvature is non-negative; moreover, the total mass equals zero if and only if the manifold is isometric to the Euclidean space. Huang and Lee [2015] proved the stability of the Positive Mass Theorem for a class of $n$-dimensional ($n \geq 3$) asymptotically flat graphs with non-negative scalar curvature, in the sense of currents. Motivated by their work and using results of Dahl, Gicquaud and Sakovich [2013], we adapt their ideas to obtain a similar result regarding the stability of the positive mass theorem, in the sense of currents, for a class of $n$-dimensional $(n \geq 3)$ asymptotically hyperbolic graphs with scalar curvature bigger than or equal to $-n(n-1)$.
