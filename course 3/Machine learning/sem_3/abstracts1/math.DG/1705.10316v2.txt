In this paper, we first discuss the relation between VB-Courant algebroids and E-Courant algebroids and construct some examples of E-Courant algebroids. Then we introduce the notion of a generalized complex structure on an E-Courant algebroid, unifying the usual generalized complex structures on even-dimensional manifolds and generalized contact structures on odd-dimensional manifolds. Moreover, we study generalized complex structures on an omni-Lie algebroid in detail. In particular, we show that generalized complex structures on an omni-Lie algebra $\gl(V)\oplus V$ correspond to complex Lie algebra structures on V.
