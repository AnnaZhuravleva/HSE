We study for which polynomials $F$ a thin shell wormhole with a continuous metric (connecting two Schwarzschild spacetimes of the same mass) satisfy the null energy condition (NEC) in $F(R)$-gravity. We avoid junction conditions by using the mathematical framework of the Colombeau algebra which describes a generalized framework of the distributional geometry such that one can define multiplications between distributions generalizing the tensor product of smooth tensors. The aim for physics is to motivate a conjecture about the satisfaction of the NEC for suitable quadratic $F$ while the aim for mathematics is to derive a rigorous framework describing this situation.
