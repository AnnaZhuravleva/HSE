We develop a systematic study of (smooth, strong) cone structures $\mathcal{C}$ and (smooth) Lorentz-Finsler metrics $L$ which includes: (a) to associate each $L$ (defined on some conic domain) with a $\mathcal{C}$, (b) to describe any $\mathcal{C}$ by means of a cone triple $(\Omega,T, F)$, where $\Omega$ (resp. $T$) is a 1-form (resp. vector field) with $\Omega(T)\equiv 1$ and $F$, a Finsler metric on $\ker (\Omega)$, (c) to associate each $(\Omega,T, F)$ with a continuous Lorentz-Finsler metric $G$, which is smooth everywhere up to Span$(T)$, (d) to develop a procedure in order to smoothen continuous Lorentz-Finsler metrics maintaining its cone, in particular, applicable to previous $G$, (e) to associate bijectively each $\mathcal{C}$ with a class of anisotropically conformal metrics $L$, developing then natural notions such as cone geodesics, (f) to provide systematic procedures in order to construct mathematically and physically interesting smooth Lorentz-Finsler metrics, including a general characterization of any $L$ in terms of Finslerian and Riemannian metrics. As a non-relativistic application, the time-dependent Zermelo navigation problem is stated and solved.
