Using the relativistic Fermat's principle, we establish a bridge between stationary-complete manifolds which satisfy the observer-manifold condition and pre-Randers metrics, namely, Randers metrics without any restriction on the one-form. As a consequence, we give a description of the causal ladder of such spacetimes in terms of the elements associated with the pre-Randers metric: its geodesics and the associated distance. We obtain, as applications of this interplay, the description of conformal maps of Killing submersions, and existence and multiplicity results for geodesics of pre-Randers metrics and magnetic geodesics.
