A vector field is called a Beltrami vector field, if $B\times(\nabla\times B)=0$. In this paper we construct two unique Beltrami vector fields $\mathfrak{I}$ and $\mathfrak{Y}$, such that $\nabla\times\mathfrak{I}=\mathfrak{I}$, $\nabla\times\mathfrak{Y}=\mathfrak{Y}$, and such that both have an orientation-preserving icosahedral symmetry. Both of them have an additional symmetry with respect to a non-trivial automorphism of the number field $\mathbb{Q}(\,\sqrt{5}\,)$.
