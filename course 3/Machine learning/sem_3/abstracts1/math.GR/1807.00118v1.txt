We study the spaces of twisted conformal blocks attached to A-curves with marked A-orbits and an action of A on a simple Lie algebra g, where A is a finite group. We prove that if A stabilizes a Borel subalgebra of g, then Propogation Theorem and Factorization Theorem hold. We endow a projectively flat connection on the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks attached to a smooth family of pointed A-curves; in particular, it is locally free. We also prove that the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks on the stable compactification of Hurwitz stack is locally free.
