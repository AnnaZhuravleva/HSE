There are two well-known ways of describing elements of the rotation group $SO(m)$. First, according to the Cartan-Dieudonn\'e theorem, every rotation matrix can be written as an even number of reflections. And second, they can also be expressed as the exponential of some anti-symmetric matrix.   In this paper, we study similar descriptions of the corresponding extension of $SO(m)$ to superspace. The setting is natural to describe the behavior of bosonic and fermionic particles. This group of super-rotations $SO_0$ is also an extension of the symplectic group. While still being connected, it is thus no longer compact. As a consequence, it cannot be fully described by just one action of the exponential map on its Lie algebra. Instead, we obtain an Iwasawa-type decomposition for this group in terms of three exponentials acting on three direct summands of the corresponding Lie algebra of supermatrices.   At the same time, $SO_0$ strictly contains the group generated by super-vector reflections. Therefore, its Lie algebra is isomorphic to a certain extension of the algebra of superbivectors. This means that the Spin group in superspace has to be seen as the group generated by the exponentials of the so-called extended superbivectors in order to cover $SO_0$. We also study the actions of this Spin group on supervectors and provide a proper subset of it that is a double cover of $SO_0$. Finally, we show that every fractional Fourier transform in n bosonic dimensions can be seen as an element of the spin group in superspace.
