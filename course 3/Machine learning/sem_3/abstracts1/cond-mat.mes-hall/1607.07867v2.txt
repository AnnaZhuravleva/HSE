Effects of short-range electronic interactions in a three-dimensional line-node semimetal that supports linearly dispersing quasiparticles around an isolated loop in the Brillouin zone are discussed. Due to vanishing density of states ($\varrho(E) \sim |E|$) various orderings in the bulk of the system, such as the antiferromagnet and charge-density-wave, set in for sufficiently strong onsite ($U$) and nearest-neighbor ($V$) repulsions, respectively. While onset of these two orderings from the semimetallic phase takes place through continuous quantum phase transitions, a first-order transition separates two ordered phases. By contrast, topologically protected drumhead shaped surface states can undergo charge or spin orderings, depending on relative strength of $U$ and $V$, even when they are sufficiently weak. Such surface orderings as well as weak long-range Coulomb interaction can be conducive to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the bulk for weaker interactions. We numerically establish such proximity effect driven spontaneous symmetry breaking in the bulk for subcritical strength of interactions due to flat surface band and also discuss possible superconducting orders in this system.
