Collinear antiferromagnets (AFs) support two degenerate magnon excitations carrying opposite spin polarizations, by which magnons can function as electrons in spin transport. We explore the interlayer coupling mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in an insulating ferromagnet (F)/AF/F trilayer structure. The internal energy of the AF depends on the orientations of the two Fs, which manifests as effective interlayer interactions JS1.S2 and K(S1.S2)^2. Both J and K are functions of temperature and the AF thickness. Interestingly, J is antiferromagnetic at low temperatures and ferromagnetic at high temperatures. In the high-temperature regime, J is estimated to be much larger than the interlayer dipole-dipole interaction, allowing direct experimental verification.
