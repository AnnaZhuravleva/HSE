We show that the appropriate on-off switching of Josephson coupling between exciton-polaritons in coupled semiconductor microcavities can reveal the full capacity for generating entanglement with a recently proposed method which essentially enhances the nonlinearity of the system. The improvement achieved with this simple modulation of the coupling is substantial over the case where it is kept constant. The suggested procedure is expected to find also application in other research areas, where nonlinear interacting bosons are encountered.
