We introduce two-dimensional topological insulators in proximity to high-temperature cuprate or iron-based superconductors as high-temperature platforms of Majorana Kramers pairs. The proximity-induced pairing at the helical edge states of TI serves as a Dirac mass, whose sign changes at the sample corner due to the advantageous pairing symmetry of high-$T_c$ superconductors. This intrinsic sign changing naturally creates at each corner a pair of Majorana zero modes protected by time-reversal symmetry. Conceptually, this is a topologically-trivial-superconductor-based approach for Majorana zero modes. We provide quantitative criteria and suggest candidate materials for this proposal.
