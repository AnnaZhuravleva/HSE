Tunneling between two classically disconnected regular regions can be strongly affected by the presence of a chaotic sea in between. This phenomenon, known as chaos-assisted tunneling, gives rise to large fluctuations of the tunneling rate. Here we study chaos-assisted tunneling in the presence of Anderson localization effects in the chaotic sea. Our results show that the standard tunneling rate distribution is strongly modified by localization, going from the known Cauchy distribution in the ergodic regime to a log-normal distribution in the strongly localized case. We develop an analytical single-parameter scaling theory which accurately describes the numerical data, for both a deterministic and a disordered model. Several possible experimental implementations using cold atoms, photonic lattices or microwave billiards are discussed.
