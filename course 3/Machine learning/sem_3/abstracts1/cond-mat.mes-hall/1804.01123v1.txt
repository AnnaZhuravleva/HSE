We study the effects of an electron-electron effective interaction on the formation of entangled states in a two-qubit system, driven by the coupling of electronic states with vibrational modes. The system is composed by four quantum dots separated in pairs, each pair with one excess electron, which is able to tunnel between the dots. Also, the dots from each pair are coupled with different vibrational modes. The combined action of both, this effective interaction and the electronic tunneling, explains not only features on the spectrum and the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, but also the formation of electronic Bell states by exploiting the quantum dynamics of the system.
