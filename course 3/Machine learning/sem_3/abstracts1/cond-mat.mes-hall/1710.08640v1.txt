Inverted type-I heterostructure core/crown quantum rings (QRs) are quantum-efficient luminophores, whose spectral characteristics are highly tunable. Here, we study the optoelectronic properties of type-I core/crown CdS/CdSe QRs in the zincblende phase - over contrasting lateral size and crown width. For this we inspect their strain profiles, transition energies, transition matrix elements, spatial charge densities, electronic bandstructure, band-mixing probabilities, optical gain spectra, maximum optical gains and differential optical gains. Our framework uses an effective-mass envelope function theory based on the 8-band k$\cdot$p method employing the valence force field model for calculating the atomic strain distributions. The gain calculations are based on the density-matrix equation and take into consideration the excitonic effects with intraband scattering. Variations in the QR lateral size and relative widths of core and crown (ergo the composition) affect their energy levels, band-mixing probabilities, optical transition matrix elements, emission wavelengths/intensity, etc. The optical gain of QRs is also strongly dimension and composition dependent with further dependency on the injection carrier density causing band-filling effect. They also affect the maximum and differential gain at varying dimensions and compositions.
