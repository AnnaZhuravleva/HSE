Many quantum dot qubits operate in regimes where the energy splittings between qubit states are large and phonons can be the dominant source of decoherence. The recently proposed charge quadrupole qubit, based on one electron in a triple quantum dot, employs a highly symmetric charge distribution to suppress the influence of charge noise. To study the effects of phonons on the charge quadrupole qubit, we consider Larmor and Ramsey pulse sequences to identify favorable operating parameters. We show that it is possible to implement typical gates with $>99.99\%$ fidelity in the presence of phonons and charge noise.
