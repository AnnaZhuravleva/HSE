Several semiconductor quantum dot technologies have been investigated for the generation of entangled photon pairs. Among the others, droplet epitaxy enables control of the shape, size, density, and emission wavelength of the quantum emitters. However, the fraction of entanglement-ready quantum dots that can be fabricated with this method is still limited to values around 5%, and matching the energy of the entangled photons to atomic transitions - a promising route towards quantum networking - remains an outstanding challenge.   Here, we overcome these hurdles by introducing a modified approach to droplet epitaxy on a high symmetry (111)A substrate, where the fundamental crystallization step is performed at a significantly higher temperature as compared to previous reports. Our method improves drastically the yield of entanglement-ready photon sources near the emission wavelength of interest, which can be as high as 95% thanks to the low values of fine structure splitting and radiative lifetime, together with the reduced exciton dephasing offered by the choice of GaAs/AlGaAs materials. The quantum dots are designed to emit in the operating spectral region of Rb-based slow-light media, providing a viable technology for quantum repeater stations.
