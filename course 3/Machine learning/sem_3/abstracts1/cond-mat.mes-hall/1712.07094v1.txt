Using a periodic train of Lorentzian voltage pulses, which generates soliton-like electronic excitations called Levitons, we investigate the charge density backscattered off a quantum point contact in the fractional quantum Hall regime. We find a regular pattern of peaks and valleys, reminiscent of analogous self-organization recently observed for optical solitons in non-linear environments. This crystallization phenomenon is confirmed by additional side dips in the Hong-Ou-Mandel noise, a feature that can be observed in nowadays electron quantum optics experiments.
