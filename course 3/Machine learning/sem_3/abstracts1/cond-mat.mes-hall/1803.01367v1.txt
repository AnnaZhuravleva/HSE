We have fabricated at wafer scale graphene-based configurations suitable for implementing at room temperature one-qubit quantum gates and a modified Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Our measurements confirmed the (quasi-)ballistic nature of charge carrier propagation through both types of devices, which have dimensions smaller than the room-temperature mean-free-path in graphene. As such, both graphene-based configurations were found to be suitable for quantum computation. These results are encouraging for demonstrating a miniaturized, room-temperature quantum computer based on graphene.
