Majorana zero modes are non-Abelian quasiparticles that emerge on the edges of topological phases of superconductors. Evidence of their presence has been reported in transport measurements on engineered superconducting-based nanostructures. In this manuscript we identify signatures of a topologically protected dynamical manipulation of Majorana zero modes via continuous transport measurement during the manipulation. Specifically, we show that, in a two-terminal geometry, the heat pumped across the terminals at low temperature and voltage bias is characterized by a universal value. We show that this feature is inherent to the presence of Majorana zero modes and discuss its robustness against temperature, voltage bias and the detailed coupling to the contacts.
