Hybrid superconductor/semiconductor devices constitute a powerful platform where intriguing topological properties can be investigated. Here we present fabrication methods and analysis of Josephson junctions formed by a high-mobility InAs quantum-well bridging two Nb superconducting contacts. We demonstrate supercurrent flow with transport measurements, critical temperature of 8.1 K, and critical fields of the order of 3 T. Modulation of supercurrent amplitude can be achieved by acting on two side gates lithographed close to the two-dimensional electron gas. Low-temperature measurements reveal also well-developed quantum Hall plateaus, showing clean quantization of Hall conductance. Here the side gates can be used to manipulate channel width and electron carrier density in the device. These findings demonstrate the potential of these hybrid devices to investigate the coexistence of superconductivity and Quantum Hall effect and constitute the first step in the development of new device architectures hosting topological states of matter.
