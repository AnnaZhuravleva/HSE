Geometrical and topological properties of quantum ground state manifolds permits to characterize phases of matter, and identify phase transitions. Here, we study the effect of a quantum dissipative environment on the geometrical properties of the ground state manifold of a single spin 1/2 in an external effective magnetic field. We show that the quantum phase transition at zero temperature in the model is associated with a universal metric singularity related to the divergence of the spin susceptibility. The absence of transition at finite temperature corresponds to a smooth variation of the associated metric with temperature, without singular points.
