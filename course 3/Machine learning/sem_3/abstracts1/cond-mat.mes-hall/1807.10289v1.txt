We measure singlet-triplet mixing in a precision fabricated double donor dot comprising of 2 and 1 phosphorus atoms separated by $16{\pm}1$ nm. We identify singlet and triplet-minus states by performing sequential independent spin readout of the two electron system and probe its dependence on magnetic field strength. The relaxation of singlet and triplet states are measured to be $12.4{\pm}1.0$ s and $22.1{\pm}1.0$ s respectively at $B_z{=}2.5$ T.
