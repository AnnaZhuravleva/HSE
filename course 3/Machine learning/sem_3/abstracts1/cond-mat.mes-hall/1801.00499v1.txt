A topological superconducting wire with balanced gain and loss is shown to possess two distinct types of unconventional edge modes, those with complex energies and nonorthogonal Majorana zero modes. The latter edge modes cause a nonlocal transport with currents being localized at the edges and absent in the bulk as a result of the interplay between parity-time symmetry and topology.
