Stochastic systems feature, in general, both coherent dynamics and incoherent transitions between different states. We propose a method to identify the coherent part in the full counting statistics for the transitions. The proposal is illustrated for electron transfer through a quantum-dot spin valve, which combines quantum-coherent spin precession with electron tunneling. We show that by counting the number of transferred electrons as a function of time, it is possible to distill out the coherent dynamics from the counting statistics even in transport regimes, in which other tools such as the frequency-dependent current noise and the waiting-time distribution fail.
