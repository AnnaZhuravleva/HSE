We present a combined classical and quantum electrodynamics description of the coupling between two circularly-polarized quantum emitters held above a metal surface supporting surface plasmons. Depending on their position and their natural frequency, the emitter-emitter interactions evolve from being reciprocal to non-reciprocal, which makes the system a highly tunable platform for chiral coupling at the nanoscale. By relaxing the stringent material and geometrical constraints for chirality, we explore the interplay between coherent and dissipative coupling mechanisms in the system. Thus, we reveal a quasi-chiral regime in which its quantum optical properties are governed by its subradiant state, giving rise to extremely sharp spectral features and strong photon correlations.
