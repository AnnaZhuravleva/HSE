We demonstrated electrical detection of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin coherence of NV centers at room temperature. Because nuclear spins are candidates for quantum memories in quantum-information devices and quantum sensors, electrical detection of nuclear spin coherence is essential to develop and integrate quantum devices. In the present study, we used a pulsed electrically detected electron- nuclear double resonance technique to measure the Rabi oscillations and the coherence time ($T_2$) of the $^{14}$N nuclear spins in NV centers at room temperature. We observed $T_2 \approx$ 0.8 ms, which is limited by the longitudinal relaxation time of the NV electron spins at room temperature. Our results will pave the way for novel electron- and nuclear-spin-based diamond quantum devices.
