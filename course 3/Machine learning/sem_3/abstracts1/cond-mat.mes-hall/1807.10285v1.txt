In this work we perform direct single-shot readout of the singlet-triplet states in exchange coupled electrons confined to precision placed donor atoms in silicon. Our method takes advantage of the large energy splitting given by the Pauli-spin blockaded (2,0) triplet states, from which we can achieve a single-shot readout fidelity of 98.4$\pm$0.2%. We measure the triplet-minus relaxation time to be of the order 3s at 2.5T and observe its predicted decrease as a function of magnetic field, reaching 0.5s at 1T.
