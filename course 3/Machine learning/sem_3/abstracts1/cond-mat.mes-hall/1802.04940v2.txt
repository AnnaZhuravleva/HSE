We study charge transport in the Peierls-Harper model with a quasi-periodic cosine potential. We compute the Landauer-type conductance of the wire. Our numerical results show the following: (i) When the Fermi energy lies in the absolutely continuous spectrum that is realized in the regime of the weak coupling, the conductance is quantized to the universal conductance. (ii) For the regime of localization that is realized for the strong coupling, the conductance is always vanishing irrespective of the value of the Fermi energy. Unfortunately, we cannot make a definite conclusion about the case with the critical coupling. We also compute the conductance of the Thue-Morse model. Although the potential of the model is not quasi-periodic, the energy spectrum is known to be a Cantor set with zero Lebesgue measure. Our numerical results for the Thue-Morse model also show the quantization of the conductance at many locations of the Fermi energy, except for the trivial localization regime. Besides, for the rest of the values of the Fermi energy, the conductance shows a similar behavior to that of the Peierls-Harper model with the critical coupling.
