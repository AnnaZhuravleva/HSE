The properties of the intramolecular vibrational excitation (vibron) in a quasi 1D macromolecular structure are studied. It is supposed that due to the vibron interaction with optical phonon modes, a vibron might form partially dressed small polaron states. The properties of these states are investigated in dependence on the basic system parameters and temperature of a thermal bath. We also investigate the process of damping of the polaron amplitude as a function of temperature and vibron-phonon coupling strength. Two different regimes of the polaron damping are found and discussed.
