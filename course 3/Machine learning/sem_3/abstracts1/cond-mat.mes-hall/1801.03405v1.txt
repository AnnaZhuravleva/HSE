We describe a formulation of the group action principle, for linear Nambu flows, that explicitly takes into account all the defining properties of Nambu mechanics and illustrate its relevance by showing how it can be used to describe the off-shell states and superpositions thereof that define the transition amplitudes for the quantization of Larmor precession of a magnetic moment. It highlights the relation between the fluctuations of the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetization. This formulation has been shown to be consistent with the approach that has been developed in the framework of the non commutative geometry of the 3-torus. In this way the latter can be used as a consistent discretization of the former.
