We present a theoretical description for circuits consisting of weak anharmonic qubits coupled to cavity multimodes. We obtain a unitary transformation that diagonalizes harmonic sector of the circuit. Weak anharmonicity does not alter the normal mode basis, however it can modify energy levels. We study two examples of a transmon and two transmons coupled to bus resonator, and we determine dressed frequencies and Kerr nonlinearities in closed form formulas. Our results are valid for arbitrary frequency detuning and coupling within and beyond dispersive regime.
