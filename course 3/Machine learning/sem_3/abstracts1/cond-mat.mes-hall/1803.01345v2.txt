We study the Landau levels in curved graphene sheets by measuring the discrete energy spectrum in the presence of a magnetic field. We observe that in rippled graphene sheets, the Landau energy levels satisfy the same square root dependence on the energy quantum number as in flat sheets, $E_n \sim \sqrt{n}$. Though, we find that the Landau levels in curved sheets are shifted towards lower energies by an amount proportional to the average spatial deformation of the sheet. Our findings are relevant for the quantum Hall effect in curved graphene sheets, which is directly related to Landau quantization. For the purpose of this study, we develop a new numerical method, based on the quantum lattice Boltzmann method, to solve the Dirac equation on curved manifolds, describing the low-energetic states in strained graphene sheets.
