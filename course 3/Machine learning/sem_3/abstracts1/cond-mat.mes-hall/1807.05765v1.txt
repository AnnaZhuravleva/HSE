We are interested in the emission characteristics of an atom interacting with the polaritonic excitations of a semiconductor or insulator embedded in a one-mode cavity. Since polaritons inside of the cavity exhibit intrinsic squeezing, we discuss how the squeezed polariton ground state modifies the atomic emission and how an indirect evidence of polariton squeezing outside of he cavity may be obtained.
