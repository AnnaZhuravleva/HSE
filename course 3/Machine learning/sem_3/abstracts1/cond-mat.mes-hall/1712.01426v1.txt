Short-range forces have important real-world relevance across a range of settings in the nano world, from colloids and possibly for protein folding to nano-mechanical devices, but also for detection of weak long-range forces, such as gravity, at short distances and of candidates to solve the problem of dark energy. Short-range forces, such as Casimir-Polder or van der Waals are in general difficult to calculate as a consequence of their non-additive nature, and challenging to measure due to their small magnitude - especially for charged particles where dispersion forces are normally many orders of magnitude smaller than electrostatic image forces. Therefore short-range forces have represented a continuing theoretical and experimental challenge over the last half-century. Here we report on experiments with a single glass nanoparticle levitated in close proximity to a neutral silicon surface in vacuum, which allow for direct measurement of short-range forces in a new distance and sensitivity regime - outperforming existing force microscopies.
