We study the effects of the quantum geometric tensor, i.e., the Berry curvature and the Fubini-Study metric, on the steady state of driven-dissipative bosonic lattices. We show that the quantum-Hall-type response of the steady-state wave function in the presence of an external potential gradient depends on all the components of the quantum geometric tensor. Looking at this steady-state Hall response, one can map out the full quantum geometric tensor of a sufficiently flat band in momentum space using a driving field localized in momentum space. We use the two-dimensional Lieb lattice as an example and numerically demonstrate how to measure the quantum geometric tensor.
