In this paper we investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of a massive excitation in a graphene layer with a wedge disclination in the presence of an uniform magnetic field. We use a Dirac oscillator type coupling to introduce the confining potential for massive fermions in this system. We obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions for the quantum ring pierced by Aharonov-Bohm flux resulting in appearance of persistent current and spontaneous magnetization.
