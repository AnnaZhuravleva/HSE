We introduce a hybrid metal-dielectric cavity device that allows one to access the nonlinear cavity-QED regime for molecular optomechanics using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Our metal-dielectric system yields a carefully designed hybrid mode that not only provides deep sub-wavelength plasmonic confinement, but also offers confinement times that are more than two orders of magnitude longer than typical plasmonics modes. Under cavity pumping, this enhanced interaction time (or quality factor) reveals clear signatures of anharmonic strong coupling behavior in the emitted spectrum of the system. This nonlinear optomechanical interaction opens up new regimes of quantum plasmonics using hybrid cavity modes, where semiclassical models fail.
