It is proposed that strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields in Dirac and Weyl materials could be used as valley and chirality sensitive lenses for beams of Weyl quasiparticles. The study of the (pseudo-)magnetic lenses is performed by using the eikonal approximation for describing the Weyl quasiparticles propagation in magnetic and strain-induced pseudomagnetic fields. Analytical expressions for the locations of the principal foci and the focal lengths are obtained in the paraxial approximation in the models with uniform as well as nonuniform effective magnetic fields inside the lens. The results show that the left- and right-handed quasiparticles can be focused at different spatial locations when both magnetic and pseudomagnetic fields are applied. It is suggested that the use of magnetic and pseudomagnetic lenses could open new ways of producing and manipulating beams of chiral Weyl quasiparticles.
