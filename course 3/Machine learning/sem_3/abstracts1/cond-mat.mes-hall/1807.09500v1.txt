The performance requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing are very stringent. Qubits must be manipulated, coupled, and measured with error rates well below 1%. For semiconductor implementations, silicon quantum dot spin qubits have demonstrated average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelities of 99.86% in isotopically enriched 28Si/SiGe devices. While this performance may meet the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing in some architectures, it will be necessary to further improve these single qubit gate fidelities in order to reduce the overhead for quantum computing, especially if these gates are to be used in combination with lower-fidelity two-qubit gates and measurements. Here we show that pulse engineering techniques, widely used in magnetic resonance, improve average Clifford gate fidelities for silicon quantum dot spin qubits to 99.957% experimentally; that is, gate error rates have been improved by a factor of 3 from previous best results for silicon devices, from 0.14% down to to 0.043%. By including tomographically complete measurements in randomised benchmarking, we infer higher-order features of the noise, which in turn allow us to theoretically predict that average gate fidelities as high as 99.974% may be achievable with further pulse improvements. These fidelities are ultimately limited by Markovian noise, which we attribute to charge noise emanating from the silicon device structure itself, or the environment.
