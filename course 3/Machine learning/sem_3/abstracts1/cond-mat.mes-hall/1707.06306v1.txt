Using a dimensional reduction scheme based on scattering theory, we show that the classification tables for topological insulators and superconductors with reflection symmetry can be organized in two period-two and four period-eight cycles, similar to the Bott periodicity found for topological insulators and superconductors without spatial symmetries. With the help of the dimensional reduction scheme the classification in arbitrary dimensions $d \ge 1$ can be obtained from the classification in one dimension, for which we present a derivation based on relative homotopy groups and exact sequences to classify one-dimensional insulators and superconductors with reflection symmetry. The resulting classification is fully consistent with a comprehensive classification obtained recently by Shiozaki and Sato [Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 90}, 165114 (2014)]. The use of a scattering-matrix inspired method allows us to address the second descendant $\bZ_2$ phase, for which the topological nontrivial phase was previously reported to be vulnerable to perturbations that break translation symmetry.
