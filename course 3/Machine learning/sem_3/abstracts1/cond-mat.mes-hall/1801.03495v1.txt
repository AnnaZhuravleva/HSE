We here report the scaling of optical conductivity (OC) in the \emph{collisionless} regime ($\hbar \omega \gg k_B T$) in the vicinity of a relativistic quantum critical point, separating two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions from a fully gapped insulator. Inside the critical regime gapless fermionic and bosonic excitations are strongly coupled, leading to a \emph{universal} suppression of the inter-band OC according to $\sigma^{\rm IB}_0 [1-N_b/(2N_f)]$ for $N_f \gg 1$ as $T \to 0$ to the leading order in $\epsilon$-expansion, where $N_f (N_b)$ is the fermionic(bosonic) flavor number, $\sigma^{\rm IB}_0$ is the OC of a non-interacting Dirac fluid, and $\epsilon=3-d$. Furthermore, the weight of the Drude peak inside the critical regime also gets suppressed following a universal scaling function, while maintaining its delta function profile. Correction to the OC at such a non-Gaussian critical point due to the long-range Coulomb interaction and generalization of these scenarios to a strongly interacting three-dimensional Dirac or Weyl liquid are also presented.
