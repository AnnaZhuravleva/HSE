We present the quantum critical theory of an interacting nodal Fermi-liquid of quasi-relativisitc (pseudo)-spin-3/2 fermions that have a non-interacting \emph{birefringent} spectrum with \emph{two} distinct Fermi velocities. When such quasiparticles interact with gapless bosonic degrees of freedom that mediate either the long-range Coulomb interaction or its short range component (responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking), in the deep infrared or quantum critical regime in two dimensions the system is respectively described by a \emph{marginal-} or a \emph{non-Fermi liquid} of relativistic spin-1/2 fermions (possessing a \emph{unique} velocity), and is always a \emph{marginal Fermi liquid} in three dimensions. We consider a possible generalization of these scenarios to fermions with an arbitrary half-odd-integer spin, and conjecture that critical spin-1/2 excitations represent a \emph{superuniversal} description of the entire family of interacting quasi-relativistic fermions.
