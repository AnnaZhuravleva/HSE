High temporal stability and spin dynamics of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond crystals make them one of the most promising quantum emitters operating at room temperature. We demonstrate a chip-integrated cavity-coupled emission into propagating surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes narrowing NV center's broad emission bandwidth with enhanced coupling efficiency. The cavity resonator consists of two distributed Bragg mirrors that are built at opposite sides of the coupled NV emitter and are integrated with a dielectric-loaded SPP waveguide (DLSPPW), using electron-beam lithography of hydrogen silsesquioxane resist deposited on silver-coated silicon substrates. A quality factor of ~ 70 for the cavity (full width at half maximum ~ 10 nm) with full tunability of the resonance wavelength is demonstrated. An up to 42-fold decay rate enhancement of the spontaneous emission at the cavity resonance is achieved, indicating high DLSPPW mode confinement.
