We compute the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in multi-Weyl semimetals (multi-WSMs) based on the chiral kinetic theory. Multi-WSMs are WSMs with multiple monopole charges that have nonlinear and anisotropic dispersion relations near Weyl points, and we need to extend conventional computation of CME in WSMs with linear dispersion relations. Topological properties of CME in multi-WSMs are investigated in details for not only static magnetic fields but also time-dependent (dynamic) ones. We propose an experimental setup to measure the multiple monopole charge via the topological nature hidden in the dynamic CME.
