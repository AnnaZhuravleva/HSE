Entanglement in quantum mechanics contradicts local realism, and is a manifestation of quantum non-locality. Its presence can be detected through the violation of Bell, or CHSH inequalities. Paradigmatic quantum systems provide examples of both, non-entangled and entangled states. Here we consider a minimal complexity setup consisting of 6 Majorana bound states. We find that any allowed state in the degenerate Majorana space is non-locally entangled. We show how to measure (with available techniques) the CHSH-violating correlations, using either intermediate strength or weak measurement protocols.
