We investigate the resonant regime of a mesoscopic cavity made of graphene or a doped beam splitter. Using Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics, we consider the Bender-Boettcher assumption that a system must obey parity and time reversal symmetry. Therefore, we describe such system by coupling chirality, parity and time reversal symmetries through the scattering matrix formalism and apply it in the shot noise functions, also derived here. Finally we show how to achieve the resonant regime only by setting properly the parameters concerning the chirality and the PT symmetry.
