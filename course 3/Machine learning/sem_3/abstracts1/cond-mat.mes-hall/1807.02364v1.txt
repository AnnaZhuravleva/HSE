We consider the coupling of a single mode microwave resonator to a tunnel junction whose contacts are at thermal equilibrium. We derive the quantum master equation describing the evolution of the resonator field in the strong coupling regime, where the characteristic impedance of the resonator is larger than the quantum of resistance. We first study the case of a normal-insulator-normal junction and show that a dc driven single photon source can be obtained. We then consider the case of a superconductor-insulator-normal and superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction. There, we show that the Lamb shift induced by the junction gives rise to a nonlinear spectrum of the resonator even when the junction induced losses are negligible. We discuss the resulting dynamics and consider possible applications including quantum Zeno dynamics and the realization of a qubit.
