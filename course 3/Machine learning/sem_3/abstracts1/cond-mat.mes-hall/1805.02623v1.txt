We present a theory predicting how the linear magnetotransport of a two-dimensional electron gas is modified by the presence of a passive cavity resonator where no real photon is injected. For a cavity photon mode with in-plane polarization, the dc bulk magnetoresistivity of the 2D electron gas is anisotropic. In the regime of high filling factors of the Landau levels, the envelope of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations is profoundly modified. In the limit of low magnetic fields, the resistivity along the cavity-mode polarization direction is enhanced in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime.
