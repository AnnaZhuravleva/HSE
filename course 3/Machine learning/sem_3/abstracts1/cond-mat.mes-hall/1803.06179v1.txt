Capturing the rotational motion of single nanoparticles has been hindered owing to the difficulty of acquiring directional information under the optical diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate that electron spins of single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers can sense the rotational Brownian motion of their host nanodiamonds. When nanodiamonds are gradually detached from the substrates that they were fixed to, their optically detected spin resonance peaks are broadened by 1.8 MHz, which corresponds to the rotational diffusion constant of nanoparticles with a diameter of 11.4 nm from the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation.
