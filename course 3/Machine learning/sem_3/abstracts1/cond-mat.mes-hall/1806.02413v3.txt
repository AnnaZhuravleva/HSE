Charge qubits formed in double quantum dots represent quintessential two-level systems that enjoy both ease of control and efficient readout. Unfortunately, charge noise can cause rapid decoherence, with typical single-qubit gate fidelities falling below $90\%$. Here, we develop analytical methods to study the evolution of strongly driven charge qubits, for general and $1\!/\!f$ charge-noise spectra. We show that special pulsing techniques can simultaneously suppress errors due to strong driving and charge noise, yielding single-qubit gates with fidelities above $99.9\%$. These results demonstrate that quantum dot charge qubits provide a potential route to high-fidelity quantum computation.
