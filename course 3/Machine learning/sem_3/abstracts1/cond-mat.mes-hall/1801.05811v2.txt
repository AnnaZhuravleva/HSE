Combining physical and synthetic dimensions allows a controllable realization and manipulation of high dimensional topological states. In our work, we introduce two quasiperiodically driven 1D systems which enable tunable topological energy conversion between different driving sources. Using three drives, we realize a 4D quantum Hall state which allows energy conversion between two of the drives within the bulk of the 1D system. With only two drives, we achieve energy conversion between the two at the edge of the chain. Both effects are a manifestation of the effective axion electrodynamics in a 3D time-reversal invariant topological insulator. Furthermore, we explore the effects of disorder and commensurability of the driving frequencies, and show the phenomena is robust. We propose two experimental platforms, based on semiconductor heterostructures and ultracold atoms in optical lattices, in order to observe the topological energy conversion.
