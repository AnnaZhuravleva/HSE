Level repulsion - the opening of a gap between two degenerate modes due to coupling - is ubiquitous anywhere from solid state theory to quantum chemistry. In contrast, if one mode has negative energy, the mode frequencies attract instead. They converge and develop imaginary components, leading to an instability; an exceptional point marks the transition. This, however, only occurs if the dissipation rates of the two modes are comparable. Here we expose a theoretical framework for the general phenomenon and realize it experimentally through engineered dissipation in a multimode superconducting microwave optomechanical circuit. Level attraction is observed for a mechanical oscillator and a superconducting microwave cavity, while an auxiliary cavity is used for sideband cooling. Two exceptional points are demonstrated that could be exploited for their topological properties.
