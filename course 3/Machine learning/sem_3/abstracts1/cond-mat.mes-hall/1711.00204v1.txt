We investigate the nonequilibrium quantum heat transfer in a triangle-coupled spin-boson system within a three-terminal setup. By including the nonequilibrium noninteracting blip approximation approach combined with the full counting statistics, we analytically obtain the steady state populations and heat currents. The negative differential thermal conductance and giant heat amplification factor are clearly observed at strong qubit-bath coupling. %and the heat amplification is dramatically suppressed in the moderate coupling regime. Moreover, the strong interaction between the gating qubit and gating thermal bath is unraveled to be compulsory to exhibit these far-from equilibrium features.
