Anyons (intermediate between bosons and fermions) occur in two-dimensional electron systems in high magnetic field as fractional excitations with charge e*=e/q in the topological ordered states of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). Owing to their importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence free quantum information approaches, understanding anyons is of utmost importance. However, experiments probing their dynamics are lacking. Here we report on a dynamical property of anyons: their long predicted Josephson frequency fJ=e*V/h for charge e*=e/3 and e/5. It manifests as marked signatures in the Photo Assisted Shot Noise (PASN) versus voltage V when irradiating contacts at microwaves frequency f=fJ. The validation of FQHE PASN models opens the way to realize on-demand anyon sources based on levitons to perform time-domain anyon braiding.
