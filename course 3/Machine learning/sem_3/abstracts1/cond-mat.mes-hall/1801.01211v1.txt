We study the generation of an electromagnetic current in monolayer graphene immersed in a weak perpendicular magnetic field and radiated with linearly polarized monochromatic light. Such a current emits Bremsstrahlung radiation with the same amplitude above and below the plane of the sample, in the latter case consistent with the small amount of light absorption in the material. This mechanism could be an important contribution for the reflexion of light phenomenon in graphene.
