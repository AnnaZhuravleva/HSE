Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention as they provide condensed matter realization of chiral anomaly, feature topologically protected Fermi arc surface states and sustain sharp chiral Weyl quasiparticles up to a critical disorder at which a continuous quantum phase transition (QPT) drives the system into a metallic phase. We here numerically demonstrate that with increasing strength of disorder the Fermi arc gradually looses its sharpness, and close to the WSM-metal QPT it completely dissolves into the metallic bath of the bulk. Predicted topological nature of the WSM-metal QPT and the resulting bulk-boundary correspondence across this transition can directly be observed in angle-resolved-photo-emmision-spectroscopy (ARPES) and Fourier transformed scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) measurements by following the continuous deformation of the Fermi arcs with increasing disorder in recently discovered Weyl materials.
