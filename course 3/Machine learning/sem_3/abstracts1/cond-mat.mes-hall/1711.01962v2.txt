We study the frequency dependencies of the fermion and photon dressing functions in dynamical gap generation in graphene. We use a low energy effective QED-like description, but within this approximation, we include all frequency dependent effects including retardation. We obtain the critical coupling by calculating the gap using a non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger approach. Compared to the results of our previous calculation [1] which used a Lindhard screening approximation instead of including a self-consistently calculated dynamical screening function, the critical coupling is substantially reduced.
