We study longitudinal magnetotransport in three-dimensional multi-Weyl semimetals, constituted by pairs of (anti)-monopole of arbitrary integer charge $n$, with $n=1,2$ and $3$ in crystalline environment. For any $n>1$, even though the distribution of the underlying Berry curvature in the medium is \emph{anisotropic}, the corresponding intrinsic component of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (bearing the signature of the chiral anomaly) is \emph{insensitive} to the direction of the external magnetic field ($B$) and increases as $B^2$, at least when it is sufficiently weak. In addition, the magnetoconductivity scales (roughly) as $n^3$ with the monopole charge. However, the net \emph{positive} longitudinal magnetoconductivity receives correction from other sources as well (such as the metallic contribution), which ultimately turns it into a direction dependent quantity for any $n>1$ (neglecting a velocity anisotropy for $n=1$), stemming from the underlying anisotropic quasiparticle dispersion in the system. The predicted scaling of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity and signature of the chiral anomaly can, in principle, be observed in recently proposed candidate materials for multi-Weyl semimetals in various solid state compounds.
