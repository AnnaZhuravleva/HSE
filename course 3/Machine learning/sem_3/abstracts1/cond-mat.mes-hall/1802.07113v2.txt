Anticrossing behavior between magnons in a non-collinear chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and a two-mode X-band microwave resonator was studied in the temperature range 5-100 K. In the field-induced ferrimagnetic phase, we observed a strong coupling regime between magnons and two microwave cavity modes with a cooperativity reaching 3600. In the conical phase, cavity modes are dispersively coupled to a fundamental helimagnon mode, and we demonstrate that the magnetic phase diagram of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ can be reconstructed from the measurements of the cavity resonance frequency. In the helical phase, a normal-mode splitting between a higher-order helimagnon mode and a cavity mode was found. Our results reveal a new class of magnetic systems where strong coupling of microwave photons to non-trivial spin textures can be observed.
