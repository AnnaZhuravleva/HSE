Magnetic domain walls (DWs) are widely regarded as classical objects in physics community, even though the concepts of electron spins and spin-spin exchange interaction are quantum mechanical in nature. One intriguing question is whether DWs can survive at the quantum level and acquire the quantum properties such as entanglement. Here we show that spins within a DW are highly entangled in their quantum description. The total magnetization of a magnetic DW is nonzero, which is a manifestation of the global entanglement of the collective spin state. These results significantly deepen our understanding of magnetic DWs and enable the application of DWs in quantum information science. The essential physics can be generalized to skyrmions so that they can also play a role in quantum information processing.
