This mini-review is intended as a short introduction to electron flow in nanostructures. Its aim is to provide a brief overview of this topic for people who are interested in the thermodynamics of quantum systems but know little about nanostructures. We particularly emphasize devices that work in the steady-state, such as simple thermoelectrics, but also mention cyclically driven heat engines. We do not aim to be either complete or rigorous, but use a few pages to outline some of the main ideas in the topic.
