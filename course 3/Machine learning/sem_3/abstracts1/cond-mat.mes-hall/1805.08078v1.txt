We consider the process of cold emission of electrons from a metal in a strong low-frequency laser field. An expression is obtained for the electron spectrum with allowance for their rescattering at the metal surface as a result of an extension of the Fowler-Nordheim theory and modification of the Simplemen model. The numerically simulated features of the electron spectrum are similar to the ATI spectra for atoms and have the same form as the experimental surface emission dependencies for a metal.
