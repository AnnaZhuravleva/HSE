We demonstrate a technique for precision sensing of temperature or the magnetic field by simultaneously driving two hyperfine transitions involving distinct electronic states of the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Frequency modulation of both driving fields is used with either the same or opposite phase, resulting in the immunity to fluctuations in either the magnetic field or the temperature, respectively. In this way, a sensitivity of 1.4 nT Hz$^{-1/2}$ or 430 $\mu$K Hz$^{-1/2}$ is demonstrated. The presented technique only requires a single frequency demodulator and enables the use of phase-sensitive camera imaging sensors. A simple extension of the method utilizing two demodulators allows for simultaneous, independent, and high-bandwidth monitoring of both the magnetic field and temperature.
