This paper is the second in a series revisiting the (effect of) Faraday rotation. We formulate and prove the thermodynamic limit for the transverse electric conductivity of Bloch electrons, as well as for the Verdet constant.   The main mathematical tool is a regularized magnetic and geometric perturbation theory combined with elliptic regularity and Agmon-Combes-Thomas uniform exponential decay estimates.
