The ability to create large highly entangled `cluster' states is crucial for measurement-based quantum computing. We show that deterministic multi-photon entanglement can be created from coupled solid state quantum emitters without the need for any two-qubit gates and regardless of whether the emitters are identical. In particular, we present a general method for controlled entanglement creation by making direct use of the always-on exchange interaction, in combination with single-qubit operations. This is used to provide a recipe for the generation of two-dimensional, cluster-state entangled photons that can be carried out with existing experimental capabilities in quantum dots.
