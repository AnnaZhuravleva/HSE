We propose a spin-selective coherent electron transfer in a silicon-quantum-dot array. Oscillating magnetic fields and temporally controlled gate voltages are utilised to separate the electron wave function into different quantum dots depending on the spin state. We introduce non-adiabatic and adiabatic protocols which offer fast electron transfer and the robustness against the error in the control-field pulse area, respectively. We also study a shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocol which compromises these two protocols. We show that this scheme can be extended to multi-electron systems straightforwardly and used for non-local manipulations of the electrons.
