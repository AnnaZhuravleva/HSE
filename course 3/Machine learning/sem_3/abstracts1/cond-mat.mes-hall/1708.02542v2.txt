Quantum phase transitions are ubiquitous in many exotic behaviors of strongly-correlated materials. However the microscopic complexity impedes their quantitative understanding. Here, we observe thoroughly and comprehend the rich strongly-correlated physics in two profoundly dissimilar regimes of quantum criticality. With a circuit implementing a quantum simulator for the three-channel Kondo model, we reveal the universal scalings toward different low-temperature fixed points and along the multiple crossovers from quantum criticality. Notably, an unanticipated violation of the maximum conductance for ballistic free electrons is uncovered. The present charge pseudospin implementation of a Kondo impurity opens access to a broad variety of strongly-correlated phenomena.
