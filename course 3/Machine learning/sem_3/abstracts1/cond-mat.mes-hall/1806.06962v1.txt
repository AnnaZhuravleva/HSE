We calculate the transmission coefficient through a potential barrier in monolayer graphene with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and in bilayer graphene. We show that in both the cases one can go from Klein tunneling regime, characterized by perfect normal transmission, to anti-Klein tunneling regime, with perfect normal reflection, by tuning the Rashba spin-orbit coupling for a monolayer or the interplane coupling for a bilayer graphene. We show that the intermediate regime is characterized by a non-monotonic behavior of the transmission amplitude.
