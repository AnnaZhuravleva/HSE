We show that a nonlinear optical response associated with a resonant, atomically thin material can be dramatically enhanced by placing it in front of a partially reflecting mirror, rendering otherwise weakly nonlinear systems suitable for experiments and applications involving quantum nonlinear optics. Our approach exploits the nonlinear response of long-lived polariton resonances that arise at particular distances between the material and the mirror. The scheme is entirely based on free-space optics, eliminating the need for cavities or complex nanophotonic structures. We analyze a specific implementation based on exciton-polariton resonances in two-dimensional semiconductors and discuss the role of imperfections and loss.
