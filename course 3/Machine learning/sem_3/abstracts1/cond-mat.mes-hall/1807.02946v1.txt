Diamond materials are central to an increasing range of advanced technological demonstrations, from high power electronics, to nano-scale quantum bio-imaging with unprecedented sensitivity. However, the full exploitation of diamond for these applications is often limited by the uncontrolled nature of the diamond material surface, which suffers from Fermi-level pinning and hosts a significant density of electro-magnetic noise sources. These issues occur despite the oxide-free and air-stable nature of the diamond crystal surface, which should be an ideal candidate for functionalization and chemical-engineering. In this work we reveal a family of previously unidentified and near-ubiquitous primal surface defects which we assign to differently reconstructed surface vacancies. The density of these defects is quantified with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, their energy structures are elucidated by ab initio calculations, and their effect on near-surface quantum probes is measured directly. Subsequent ab-initio calculation of band-bending from these defects suggest they are the source of Fermi-level pinning at most diamond surfaces. Finally, an investigation is conducted on a broad range of post-growth surface treatments and concludes that none of them can reproducibly reduce this defect density below the Fermi-pinning threshold, making this defect a prime candidate as the source for decoherence-limiting noise in near-surface quantum probes.
