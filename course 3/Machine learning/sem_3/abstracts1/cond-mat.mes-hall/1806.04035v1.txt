The electrons forming a Cooper pair in a superconductor can be spatially separated preserving their spin entanglement by means of quantum dots coupled to both the superconductor and independent normal leads. We investigate the thermoelectric properties of such a Cooper pair splitter and demonstrate that cooling of a reservoir is an indication of non-local correlations induced by the entangled electron pairs. Therefore, a Cooper pair splitter device becomes an entanglement-induced quantum thermal machine with optimal coefficient of performance within experimental reach. Moreover, we show that the Cooper pair splitter can be operated as a Carnot-efficient non-local thermoelectric heat engine. As such, our work introduces an experimentally accessible heat engine and a refrigerator driven by entangled electron pairs in which the role of quantum correlations can be tested.
