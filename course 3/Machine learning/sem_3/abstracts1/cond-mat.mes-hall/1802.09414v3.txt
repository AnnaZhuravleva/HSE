We study theoretically the spin fluctuations of nuclei in quantum dots. We employ the central spin model which accounts for the hyperfine interaction of the nuclei with the electron spin. We present an analytical solution in the frame of the box model approximation where all hyperfine coupling constants are assumed to be equal. These results are in good agreement with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that in rather high magnetic field the nuclear spin noise spectra has a two-peak structure centered at the nuclear Zeeman frequency with the shape of the spectrum controlled by the distribution of the hyperfine constants.
