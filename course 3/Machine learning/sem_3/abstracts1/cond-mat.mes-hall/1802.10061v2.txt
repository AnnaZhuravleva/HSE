Topological phase of matter is now a mainstream of research in condensed matter physics, of which the classification, synthesis, and detection of topological states have brought many excitements over the recent decade while remain incomplete with ongoing challenges in both theory and experiment. Here we propose to establish a universal dynamical characterization of the topological quantum phases classified by integers, with the framework of the study consisting of basic theorems. First, we uncover that classifying a generic $d$-dimensional ($d$D) gapped topological phase can reduce to a ($d-1$)D invariant defined on so-called band inversion surfaces (BISs), rendering a fundamental {\it bulk-surface} duality. Further, we show in quenching across phase boundary the (pseudo)spin dynamics to exhibit unique topological patterns on BISs, which are attributed to the post-quench bulk topology and manifest a dynamical {\it bulk-surface} correspondence. The topological phase is then classified by a dynamical topological invariant measured from dynamical spin-texture field on the BISs. Applications to quenching experiments on feasible models are proposed and studied. This work opens a new direction to classify and detect topological phases by quantum dynamics.
