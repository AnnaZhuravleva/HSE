Singlet-triplet qubits in lateral quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures exhibit high-fidelity single-qubit gates via exchange interactions and magnetic field gradients. High-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates are challenging to generate since weak interqubit interactions result in slow gates that accumulate error in the presence of noise. However, the interqubit electrostatic interaction also produces a shift in the local double well detunings, effectively changing the dependence of exchange on the gate voltages. We consider an operating point where the effective exchange is first order insensitive to charge fluctuations while maintaining nonzero interactions. This "sweet spot" exists only in the presence of interactions. We show that working at the interacting sweet spot can directly produce maximally entangling gates and we simulate the gate evolution under realistic 1/f noise. We report theoretical two-qubit gate fidelities above 99% in GaAs and Si systems.
