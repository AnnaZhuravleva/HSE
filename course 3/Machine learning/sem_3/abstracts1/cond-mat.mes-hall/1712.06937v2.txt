True on-demand high-repetition-rate single-photon sources are highly sought after for quantum information processing applications. However, any coherently driven two-level quantum system suffers from finite re-excitation processes under pulsed excitation, limiting the purity of on-demand single-photon emission. Here, we present a solid-state source of on-demand single-photons yielding a raw multi-photon emission probability of $g^{(2)}(0)=(7.5\pm1.6)\cdot10^{-5}$ without any background subtraction nor data processing. To this date, this is the lowest value of $g^{(2)}(0)$ reported for any single-photon source even compared to the previously best background subtracted values. We achieve this result on GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots embedded in a low-Q planar cavity by employing (i) a two-photon excitation process and (ii) a filtering and detection setup featuring two superconducting single-photon detectors with ultralow dark-count rates of $(0.01^{+0.02}_{-0.01})\text{Hz}$ and $(0.02^{+0.04}_{-0.02})\text{Hz}$, respectively. Re-excitation processes are dramatically suppressed by (i) , while (ii) removes false coincidences resulting in a negligibly low noise floor.
