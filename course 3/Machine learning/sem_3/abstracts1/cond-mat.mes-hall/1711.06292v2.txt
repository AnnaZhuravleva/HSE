Orbital modeling of two electron spins confined in a double quantum dot is revisited. We develop an extended Hund Mulliken approach that includes excited orbitals, allowing for a triplet configuration with both electrons residing in a single dot. This model improves the reliability and applicability of the standard Hund Mulliken approximation, while remaining largely analytical, thus it enables us to identify the mechanisms behind the exchange coupling dynamics that we find. In particular, our calculations are in close agreement with exchange values that were recently measured at a high interdot bias regime, where the double occupancy triplet configuration is energetically accessible, demonstrating reduced sensitivity to bias fluctuations, while maintaining the large exchange needed for fast gating.
