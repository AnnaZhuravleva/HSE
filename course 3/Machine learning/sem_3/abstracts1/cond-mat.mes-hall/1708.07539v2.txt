We study a pair of capacitively coupled singlet-triplet spin qubits. We characterize the two-qubit decoherence through two complementary measures, the decay time of coupled-qubit oscillations and the fidelity of entangled state preparation. We provide a quantitative map of their dependence on charge noise and field noise, and we highlight the magnetic field gradient across each singlet-triplet qubit as an effective tool to suppress decoherence due to charge noise.
