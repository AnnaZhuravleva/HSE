In this letter, we have considered an electron in a coupled quantum dot system interacting with a detector represented by a point contact. We present a dynamical model for wave function collapse in the strong coupling to the detector limit. In our model, the electron in the double quantum dot makes a fast transition minimizing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. In this way, a principle of leats emitted radiation can provide a possible description of wave function collapse.
