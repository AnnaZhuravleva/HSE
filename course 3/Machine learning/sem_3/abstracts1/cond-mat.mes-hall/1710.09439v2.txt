Nanomechanical resonators have demonstrated great potential for use as versatile tools in a number of emerging quantum technologies. For such applications, the performance of these systems is restricted by the decoherence of their fragile quantum states, necessitating a thorough understanding of their dissipative coupling to the surrounding environment. In bulk amorphous solids, these dissipation channels are dominated at low temperatures by parasitic coupling to intrinsic two-level system (TLS) defects, however, there remains a disconnect between theory and experiment on how this damping manifests in dimensionally-reduced nanomechanical resonators. Here, we present an optomechanically-mediated thermal ringdown technique, which we use to perform simultaneous measurements of the dissipation in four mechanical modes (3 - 19 MHz) of a cryogenically-cooled silicon nanoresonator. Analyzing the low-temperature (10 mK - 10 K) dependence of the device's mechanical damping rate, we demonstrate quantitative agreement with a tunneling model for TLS ensembles confined to one dimension. From these fits, we extract the defect density of states ($P_0 \sim$ 1 - 4 $\times$ 10$^{44}$ J$^{-1}$ m$^{-3}$) and deformation potentials ($\gamma \sim$ 1 - 2 eV), showing that each mechanical mode couples on average to less than a single thermally-active defect at 10 mK.
