We will analyse the effect of time-dependent strain on a sheet of graphene by using the field theory approach. It will be demonstrated that in the continuum limit, such a strain will induce a non-abelian gauge field in graphene. We will analyse the effective field theory of such system near the Dirac points and study its topological properties.
