Achieving strong coupling between light and matter is usually a challenge in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED), especially in solid state systems. For this reason is useful taking advantage of alternative approaches to reach this regime, and then, generate reliable quantum polaritons. In this work we study a system composed of a quantized single mode of a mechanical resonator interacting linearly with both a single mode nanocavity and a two-level single quantum dot. In particular, we focus on the behavior of the indirect light-matter interaction when the phonon mode interfaces both parts. By diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and computing the density matrix in a master equation approach, we evidence several features of strong coupling between photons in optical cavities and excitons in a quantum dot. For large energy detuning between the cavity and the mechanical resonator it is obtained a phonon-dispersive effective Hamiltonian which is able to retrieve much of the physics of the conventional Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In order to characterize this mediated coupling, we make a quantitative comparison between both models and analyze light-matter entanglement and purity of the system leading to similar results in cQED.
