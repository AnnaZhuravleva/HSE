The shape of a few-cycle terahertz (THz) laser pulse can be optimized to provide control over conduction band populations in graphene. To demonstrate this control, a spectral parametrization of the incident pulse using $B$-splines is used in order to obtain experimentally realistic pulses of bandwidth $\sim$ 30 THz. Optimization of the spectral shape is performed numerically via differential evolution, using the $B$-splines expansion coefficients as decision variables. Using this high-level optimization procedure, we find that it is possible to change the carrier density in graphene by a factor of 4 for a fixed pulse energy. The selective suppression of multi-photon absorption features in reciprocal space is also discussed.
