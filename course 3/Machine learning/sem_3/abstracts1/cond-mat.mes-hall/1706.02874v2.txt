Single-molecule electronics has been envisioned as the ultimate goal in the miniaturisation of electronic circuits. While the aim of incorporating single-molecule junctions into modern technology still proves elusive, recent developments in this field have begun to enable experimental investigation fundamental concepts within the area of chemical physics. One such phenomenon is the concept of Environment-Assisted Quantum Transport which has emerged from the investigation of exciton transport in photosynthetic complexes. Here, we study charge transport through a two-site molecular junction coupled to a vibrational environment. We demonstrate that vibrational interactions can also significantly enhance the current through specific molecular orbitals. Our study offers a clear pathway towards finding and identifying environment-assisted transport phenomena in charge transport settings.
