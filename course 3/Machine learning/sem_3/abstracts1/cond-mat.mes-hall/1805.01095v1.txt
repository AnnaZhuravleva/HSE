We present a general formulation of the ground state binding energy of a shallow hydrogenic impurity in spherical quantum dot with parabolic confinement, considering the effects of polarization and self energy. The variational approach within the effective mass approximation is employed here. The binding energy of an on-center impurity is computed for a $\mathrm{GaAs}$/ $\mathrm{{Al}_{x}{Ga}_{1-x}As}$ quantum dot as a function of the dot size with the dot barrier as parameter. The influence of polarization and self energy are also treated separately. Results indicate that the binding energy increases due to the presence of polarization charge, while decreases due to the self energy of the carrier. An overall enhancement in impurity binding energy, especially for small dots is noted.
