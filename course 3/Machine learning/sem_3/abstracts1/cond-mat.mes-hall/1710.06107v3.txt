We study the transport of the fermions with a small mass in the presence of Coulomb impurities, which could be realized in slightly distorted Dirac semimetals. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann equation, we derive the relaxation times for two kinds of intra-cone transition process. One is due to the effect of mass, and the other is due to the excited states in Landau levels under the weaker magnetic field. Hence we derive the mass dependence and the magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields.
