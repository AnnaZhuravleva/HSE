Josephson-photonics devices have emerged in the last years as versatile platforms to study light-charge interactions far from equilibrium and to create nonclassical radiation. Their potential to operate as nanoscale heat engines has also been discussed. The complementary mode of cooling is investigated here in the regimes of low and large photon occupancy, where nonlinearities are essential.
