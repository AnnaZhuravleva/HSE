We theoretically discuss the possibility of realizing the negative refractive index in Weyl/Dirac semimetals. We consider the Maxwell equations with the plasma gap and the chiral magnetic effect. We study the dispersion relations of electromagnetic waves, and show that the refractive index becomes negative at frequencies (just) below the plasma frequency. We find that axial anomaly, or more specifically, negative magnetoresistance (electric current parallel to magnetic fields) opens a new route to realize the negative refractive index. Reflection and transmission coefficients are computed in a slab of Weyl/Dirac semimetals.
