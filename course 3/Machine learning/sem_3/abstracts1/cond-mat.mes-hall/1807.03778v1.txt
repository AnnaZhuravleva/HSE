We study thermodynamic manifestations of the chiral anomaly in disordered Weyl semimetals. We focus, in particular, on the effect which we call "adiabatic dechiralisation", the phenomenon in which a change in the imbalance of quasiparticles with different chiralities (at different Weyl nodes) leads to a change of temperature and/or an absorption or release of heat. This effect is {similar} to that of adiabatic demagnetisation, which is commonly used as a method of low-temperature refrigeration. We describe this phenomenon quantitatively and discuss experimental conditions favourable for its observation. A related phenomenon, which we analyse and which is readily observable in experiment, is the dependency of the heat capacity of a Weyl semimetal on parallel electric and magnetic fields.
