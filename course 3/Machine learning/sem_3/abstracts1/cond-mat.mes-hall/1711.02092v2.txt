In addition to magnetic field and electric charge noise adversely affecting spin qubit operations, performing single-qubit gates on one of multiple coupled singlet-triplet qubits presents a new challenge---crosstalk, which is inevitable (and must be minimized) in any multiqubit quantum computing architecture. We develop a set of dynamically-corrected pulse sequences that are designed to cancel the effects of both types of noise (i.e., field and charge) as well as crosstalk to leading order, and provide parameters for these corrected sequences for all 24 of the single-qubit Clifford gates. We then provide an estimate of the error as a function of the noise and capacitive coupling to compare the fidelity of our corrected gates to their uncorrected versions. Dynamical error correction protocols presented in the current work are important for the next generation of singlet-triplet qubit devices where coupling among many qubits will become relevant.
