We investigate the non-equilibrium evolution of concurrence of a Bell pair constituted of two qubits, locally coupled to a one-dimensional disordered Ising spin chain, by measuring the Loschmidt echo (LE) under the scope of generalized central spin model. Our study indicates that disorder prohibits a rapid decay of entanglement in long time regime; the non-trivial outcomes associated with the Griffiths phase, appearing due to the disorder, are also analyzed by examining the temporal decay of LE. The extent of the Griffiths phase is identified by a peak in the derivative of LE. In particular, it has been observed for sudden quenching between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phase that LE shows an exponential fall, dependent on coupling strength, in small time limit followed by a power law decay, governed by disorder strength, in the long time limit. Noticeably, for quenching inside the Griffiths phase, the LE vanishes in the late time limit and hence power law fall is absent. Additionally, we show that the Gaussian fall of LE in the ultra small time window remains unaltered even with disorder. Finally, we show LE for disordered spin chain does not sense the singular time scales that appear for clean spin chain with qubits coupled at symmetric positions.
