We investigate spin and charge dynamics of a quantum dot of phosphorus atoms coupled to a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rf-SET) using full counting statistics. We show how the magnetic field plays a role in determining the bunching or anti-bunching tunnelling statistics of the donor dot and SET system. Using the counting statistics we show how to determine the lowest magnetic field where spin-readout is possible. We then show how such a measurement can be used to investigate and optimise single electron spin-readout fidelity.
