Quantizing the electromagnetic vacuum and medium fields of two nanoparticles, we investigate the heat transfer between them. One of the particles has been considered to rotate by angular velocity $ \omega_0 $. The effect of rotation on the absorbed heat power by the rotating nanoparticle is discussed. The results for angular velocities much smaller than the relaxation frequency $ \Gamma $ of the dielectrics are in agreement with the static nanoparticles, however increasing the angular velocity $ \omega_0 $ in comparison to the relaxation frequency of the dielectrics $ (\omega_0\geqslant \Gamma) $ generates two sidebands in the spectrum of the absorbed heat power. The well-known near-field and far-field effects are studied and it is shown that the sidebands peaks in far-field are considerable in comparison to the main peak frequency of the spectrum.
