The classification of topological states of matter in terms of unitary symmetries and dimensionality predicts the existence of nontrivial topological states even in zero-dimensional systems, i.e., a system with a discrete energy spectrum. Here, we show that a quantum dot coupled with two superconducting leads can realize a nontrivial zero-dimensional topological superconductor with broken time-reversal symmetry, which corresponds to the finite size limit of the one-dimensional topological superconductor. Topological phase transitions corresponds to a change of the fermion parity, and to the presence of zero-energy modes and discontinuities in the current-phase relation at zero temperature. These fermion parity transitions therefore can be revealed by the current discontinuities or by a measure of the critical current at low temperatures.
