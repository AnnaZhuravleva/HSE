Emergent Majorana bound states (MBSs) in topological superconductors appear capable of providing a naturally fault-tolerant basis for quantum computing. Key to topological protection is the separation, or non-locality, of MBSs, which makes Majorana qubits immune to decoherence by a local disturbance. While a number of experiments have reported signatures of MBSs based on zero-bias peaks in tunneling conductance, the non-local character of Majorana modes -- in contrast to Andreev bound states at zero energy -- has not been previously demonstrated. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-locality of Majorana modes in epitaxial semiconductor-superconducting nanowires. This is achieved using recent theory showing that non-locality can be measured via the interaction of the zero-energy state in the nanowire with a quantum-dot state at one end. By comparing coupling to even versus odd occupied quantum dots states, we measure a high degree of non-locality, consistent with topological MBSs, as well as the spin canting angles of the Majorana modes.
