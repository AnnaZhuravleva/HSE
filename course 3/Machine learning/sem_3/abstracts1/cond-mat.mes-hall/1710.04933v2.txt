Working in the effective-mass approximation, we apply a powerful convergent perturbative technique of Turbiner's to the calculation of the ground state energy and the wave function of an exciton confined to a three-dimensional parabolic quantum dot. Unlike the usual Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, Turbiner's approach works well even in the regime of strong coupling and does not require the knowledge of the full solution to the undisturbed problem. The second-order convergent calculation presented below is in excellent agreement with the results of exact numerical simulations for a wide range of system's confinement parameters.
