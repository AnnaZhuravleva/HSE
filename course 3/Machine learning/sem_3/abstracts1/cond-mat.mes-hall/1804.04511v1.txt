We calculate the exact many-body time dynamics of polaritonic states supported by an optical cavity filled with organic molecules. Optical, vibrational and radiative processes are treated on an equal footing employing the Time-Dependent Variational Matrix Product States algorithm. We demonstrate signatures of non-Markovian vibronic dynamics and its fingerprints in the far-field photon emission spectrum at arbitrary light-matter interaction scales, ranging from the weak to the strong coupling regimes. We analyse both the single and many-molecule cases, showing the crucial role played by the collective motion of molecular nuclei and dark states in determining the polariton dynamics and the subsequent photon emission.
