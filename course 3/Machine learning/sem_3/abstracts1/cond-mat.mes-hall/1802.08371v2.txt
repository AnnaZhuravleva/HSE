We realized highly tunable Weyl semimetal-bands and subsequently emulated the topological chiral magnetic effects in superconducting quantum circuits. Driving the superconducting quantum circuits with elaborately designed microwave fields, we mapped the momentum space of a lattice to the parameter space, realizing the Hamiltonian of a Weyl semimetal. By measuring the energy spectrum, we directly imaged the Weyl points of cubic lattices, whose topological winding numbers were further determined from the Berry curvature measurement. In particular, we used an additional microwave field to produce a momentum-dependent chemical potential, from which the chiral magnetic topological current was extracted in the presence of an artificial magnetic field. This pure topological current is proportional to the magnetic field, which is in contrast to the famous Ampere's law, and may have significant impacts on topological materials and quantum devices.
