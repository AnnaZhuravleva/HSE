The effects of strains on the low-energy electronic properties of double-Weyl semimetal phases are studied in solids and cold-atom optical lattices. Our principal finding is that deformations do not couple, in general, to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian as a pseudoelectromagnetic gauge potential. The response of an optical lattice to strains is simpler, but still only one of several strain-induced terms in the corresponding low-energy Hamiltonian can be interpreted as a gauge potential. Most interestingly, the strains can induce a nematic order parameter that splits a double-Weyl node into a pair of Weyl nodes with the unit topological charges. The effects of deformations on the motion of the wavepackets in the optical lattice model are studied. It is found that, even in the undeformed lattices, the wavepackets with opposite topological charges can be spatially split. Strains, however, modify their velocities in a very different way and lead to a spin polarization of the wavepackets.
