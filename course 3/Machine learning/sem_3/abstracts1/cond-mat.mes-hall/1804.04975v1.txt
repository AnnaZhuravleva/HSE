Nonperturbative coupling between cavity photons and excitons leads to formation of hybrid light-matter excitations termed polaritons. In structures where photon absorption leads to creation of excitons with aligned permanent dipoles, the elementary excitations, termed dipolar polaritons, are expected to exhibit enhanced interactions. Here, we report a substantial increase in interaction strength between dipolar polaritons as the size of the dipole is increased by tuning the applied gate voltage. To this end, we use coupled quantum well structures embedded inside a microcavity where coherent electron tunneling between the wells controls the size of the excitonic dipole. Modifications of the interaction strength are characterized by measuring the changes in the reflected intensity of light when polaritons are driven with a resonant laser. Factor of 6.5 increase in the interaction strength to linewidth ratio that we obtain indicates that dipolar polaritons could be used to demonstrate a polariton blockade effect and thereby form the building blocks of many-body states of light.
