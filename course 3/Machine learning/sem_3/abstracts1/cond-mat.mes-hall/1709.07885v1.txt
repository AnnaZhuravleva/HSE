We study fractional quantum Hall states at filling fractions in the Jain sequences using the framework of composite Dirac fermions. Synthesizing previous work, we write down an effective field theory consistent with all symmetry requirements, including Galilean invariance and particle-hole symmetry. Employing a Fermi liquid description, we demonstrate the appearance of the Girvin--Macdonlald--Platzman algebra and compute the dispersion relation of neutral excitations and various response functions. Our results satisfy requirements of particle-hole symmetry. We show that while the dispersion relation obtained from the HLR theory is particle-hole symmetric, correlation functions obtained from HLR are not. The results of the Dirac theory are shown to be consistent with the Haldane bound on the projected structure factor, while those of the HLR theory violate it.
