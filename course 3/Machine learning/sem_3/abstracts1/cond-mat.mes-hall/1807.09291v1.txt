With the discovery of Majorana quasiparticles in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures, topologically protected qubits have emerged as a promising contender for quantum information processing. While the construction of a universal quantum computer with topological protection likely requires significant advances in materials science, intermediate-scale devices are nearly within the reach of current technology. As a near-term milestone for topological qubits, we propose a network of topological superconductors as a simulator of a large variety of quantum spin systems, including those with frustration. Our proposal is founded on existing technology, combining advantages of semiconducting and superconducting qubits. We identify local measurement protocols that give access to information about ground and excited states as well as dynamic correlations. The topological protection of the qubits results in longer coherence times, and relaxation to the groundstate can be controlled by coupling the network an external bath. We conclude by pointing out specific applications of the quantum simulator, e.g., spin liquids, quantum criticality, and thermalization.
