Scalable architectures for quantum information technologies require to selectively couple long-distance qubits while suppressing environmental noise and cross-talk. In semiconductor materials, the coherent coupling of a single spin on a quantum dot to a cavity hosting fermionic modes offers a new solution to this technological challenge. Here, we demonstrate coherent coupling between two spatially separated quantum dots using an electronic cavity design that takes advantage of whispering-gallery modes in a two-dimensional electron gas. The cavity-mediated long-distance coupling effectively minimizes undesirable direct cross-talk between the dots and defines a scalable architecture for all-electronic semiconductor-based quantum information processing.
