Reservoir engineering is a powerful tool for the robust generation of quantum states or transport properties. Using both a weak-coupling quantum master equation and the exact solution, we show that directional transport of electrons through a double quantum dot can be achieved through an appropriately designed electronic environment. Directionality is attained through the interference of coherent and dissipative coupling. The relative phase is tuned with an external magnetic field, such that directionality can be reversed, as well as turned on and off dynamically. Our work introduces fermionic reservoir engineering, paving the way to a new class of nanoelectronic devices.
