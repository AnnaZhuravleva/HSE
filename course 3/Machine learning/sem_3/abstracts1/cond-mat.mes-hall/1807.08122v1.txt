We study theoretically the photon statistics of the field emitted from two optically coupled semiconductor microcavities each containing a quantum well. The emission is determined by the interplay between exciton-photon coupling in each quantum well and internal interaction between the two optically coupled microcavities. A high degree of coherent control and tunability via the quantum well-cavity coupling strength and photon tunneling over the photon statistics of the transmitted field can be achieved. We demonstrate that the optical property of radiation emitted by one quantum well can be controlled by the properties of the second quantum well. This result has the potential to be used in quantum information processing. We show that the exciton-photon coupling influences the polariton resonances in the intensity spectrum of the transmitted field. The results obtained in this investigation has the potential to be used for designing efficient controllable all-optical switch and high sensitive optical sensor.
