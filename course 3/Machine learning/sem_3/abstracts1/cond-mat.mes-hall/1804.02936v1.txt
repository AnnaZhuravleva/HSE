We study nonreciprocal microwave transmission based on the Gebhard-Ruckenstein hopping. We consider a superconducting device that consists of microwave resonators and a coupler. The Gebhard-Ruckenstein hopping between the resonators gives rise to a linear energy dispersion which manifests chiral propagation of microwaves in the device. This device functions as an on-chip circulator with a wide bandwidth when transmission lines are attached.
