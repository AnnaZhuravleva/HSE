The thermoelectric transport coefficients are calculated in a generic lattice model of multi-Weyl semimetals with a broken time-reversal symmetry by using the Kubo's linear response theory. The contributions connected with the Berry curvature-induced electromagnetic orbital and heat magnetizations are systematically taken into account. It is shown that the thermoelectric transport is profoundly affected by the nontrivial topology of multi-Weyl semimetals. In particular, the calculation reveals a number of thermal coefficients of the topological origin which describe the anomalous Nernst and thermal Hall effects in the absence of background magnetic fields. Similarly to the anomalous Hall effect, all anomalous thermoelectric coefficients are proportional to the integer topological charge of the Weyl nodes. The dependence of the thermoelectric coefficients on the chemical potential and temperature is also studied.
