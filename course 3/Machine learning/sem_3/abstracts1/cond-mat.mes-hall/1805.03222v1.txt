The motion of electron wavepackets in the Dirac semimetals A$_3$Bi (A=Na,K,Rb) is studied in a semiclassical approximation. Because of the two-fold degeneracy of the Dirac points and a momentum-dependent gap term in the low-energy Hamiltonian, the associated Berry curvature is non-Abelian. In the presence of background electromagnetic fields, the latter leads to a splitting of trajectories for the wavepackets that originate from different Dirac points and chiral sectors. The nature of the splitting strongly depends on the background fields as well as the initial chiral composition of the wavepackets. In parallel electric and magnetic fields, while a well-pronounced valley splitting is achieved for any chirality composition, the chirality separation takes place predominantly for the initially polarized states. On the other hand, in perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, there are clear deviations from the conventional Abelian trajectories, albeit without a well-pronounced valley splitting.
