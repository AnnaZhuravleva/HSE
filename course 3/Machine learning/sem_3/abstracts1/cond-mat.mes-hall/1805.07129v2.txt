We use shortcuts to adiabaticity, a method introduced to speed up adiabatic quantum dynamics, for the efficient generation of entanglement between exciton-polaritons in coupled semiconductor microcavities. A substantial improvement is achieved, compared to a recently proposed method which essentially enhances the nonlinearity of the system. Our method takes advantage of a time-dependent nonlinearity which can become larger than the Josephson coupling between the cavities, while the conventional method is restricted to a constant nonlinearity lower than the coupling. The suggested procedure is expected to find also application in other research areas in optics, where nonlinear interacting bosons are encountered.
