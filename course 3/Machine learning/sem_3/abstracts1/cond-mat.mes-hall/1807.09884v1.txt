Periodically driven quantum systems host a range of non-equilibrium phenomena which are unrealizable at equilibrium. Discrete time-translational symmetry in a periodically driven many-body system can be spontaneously broken to form a discrete time crystal, a putative quantum phase of matter. We present the observation of discrete time crystalline order in a driven system of paramagnetic \ce{P} spin impurities in isotopically enriched \ce{^{28}Si} cooled below \SI{10}{\kelvin}, and compare two samples of different spin concentrations as a means of tuning the spin-spin interaction strength. The observations are consistent with a stable subharmonic peak at half the drive frequency which remains pinned even in the presence of pulse error for the strongly interacting sample. We propose a theoretical model based on the paradigmatic central spin model and show that the observations are consistent even in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, a simple non-interacting Floquet dissipative model of a spin coupled to a bath appears remarkably close to the experiments. This suggests that the DTC order realised in solid-state experiments which are not fully isolated from the environment provide a novel realization of dissipative, semiclassical DTC order, and poses questions as to how to distinguish this phenomenon from the purely quantum effect.
