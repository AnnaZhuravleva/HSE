In some recent papers, the so called $(H,\rho)$-induced dynamics of a system $\mathcal{S}$ whose time evolution is deduced adopting an operatorial approach, borrowed in part from quantum mechanics, has been introduced. Here, $H$ is the Hamiltonian for $\mathcal{S}$, while $\rho$ is a certain rule applied periodically (or not) on $\mathcal{S}$. The analysis carried on throughout this paper shows that, replacing the Heisenberg dynamics with the $(H,\rho)$-induced one, we obtain a simple, and somehow natural, way to prove that some relevant dynamical variables of $\mathcal{S}$ may converge, for large $t$, to certain asymptotic values. This can not be so, for finite dimensional systems, if no rule is considered. In this case, in fact, any Heisenberg dynamics implemented by a suitable hermitian operator $H$ can only give an oscillating behavior. We prove our claims both analytically and numerically for a simple system with two degrees of freedom, and then we apply our general scheme to a model describing a biological system of bacteria living in a two-dimensional lattice, where two different choices of the rule are considered.
