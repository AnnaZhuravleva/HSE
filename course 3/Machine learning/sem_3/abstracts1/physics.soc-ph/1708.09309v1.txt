On the occasion of the UN International Day of Women and Girls in Science (February 11) Masterclass activities were launched by the International Particle Physics Outreach Group to support and promote the access of women and girls to science education and research activities. Universities and research laboratories organised 10 Masterclasses for girls on February 10 and 11, with participation from Barcelona, Cagliari, Cosenza, Heidelberg, Madrid, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo. About 300 girls participated in the events and analysed LHC data while being tutored by female scientists. Three video conferences with CERN were held where the girls could talk to CERN women scientists and learn about the careers of these role models.
