We review and classify stochastic processes without detailed balance condition. We obtain stationary distributions and investigate their stability in terms of generalized entropic divergences beyond the Kullback-Leibler formula. A simple stochastic model with local growth rates and direct resetting to the ground state is investigated and applied to various networks, scientific citations and Facebook popularity, hadronic yields in high energy particle reactions, income and wealth distributions, biodiversity and settlement size distribution.
