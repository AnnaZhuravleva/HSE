In a series of recent papers, a harmonic and hypercomplex function theory in superspace has been established and amply developed. In this paper, we address the problem of establishing Cauchy integral formulae in the framework of Hermitian Clifford analysis in superspace. This allows us to obtain a successful extension of the classical Bochner-Martinelli formula to superspace by means of the corresponding projections on the space of spinor-valued superfunctions.
