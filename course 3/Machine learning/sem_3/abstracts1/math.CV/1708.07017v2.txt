In the context of the complex-analytic structure within the unit disk centered at the origin of the complex plane, that was presented in a previous paper, we show that singular Schwartz distributions can be represented within that same structure, so long as one defines the limits involved in an appropriate way. In that previous paper it was shown that essentially all integrable real functions can be represented within the complex-analytic structure. The infinite collection of singular objects which we analyze here can thus be represented side by side with those real functions, thus allowing all these objects to be treated in a unified way.
