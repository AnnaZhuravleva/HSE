A complex-analytic structure within the unit disk of the complex plane is presented. It can be used to represent and analyze a large class of real functions. It is shown that any integrable real function can be obtained by means of the restriction of an analytic function to the unit circle, including functions which are non-differentiable, discontinuous or unbounded. An explicit construction of the analytic functions from the corresponding real functions is given. The complex-analytic structure can be understood as an universal regulator for analytic operations on real functions.
