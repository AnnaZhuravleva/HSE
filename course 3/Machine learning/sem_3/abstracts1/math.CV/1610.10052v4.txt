We study two-dimensional eigenvalue ensembles close to certain types of singular points in the bulk of the droplet. We prove existence of a microscopic density which quickly approaches the classical equilibrium density, as the distance from the singularity increases beyond the microscopic scale. As a consequence we obtain asymptotics for the Bergman function of certain Fock-Sobolev spaces of entire functions.
