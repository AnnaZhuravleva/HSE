We consider the correlation structure of the random coefficients for a wide class of wavelet systems on the sphere (Mexican needlets) which were recently introduced in the literature by Geller and Mayeli (2007). We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these coefficients to be asymptotic uncorrelated in the real and in the frequency domain. Here, the asymptotic theory is developed in the high resolution sense. Statistical applications are also discussed, in particular with reference to the analysis of cosmological data.
