We derive the energy of the surface between the normal and superfluid components of a mixed phase of a system composed of two particle species with different densities. The surface energy is obtained by the integration of the free energy density in the interface between the two phases. We show that the mixed phase remains as the favored ground state over the gapless phase in weak coupling. We find that the surface energy effects emerge only at strong coupling.
