We propose theoretically an effective scheme for braiding Majorana bound states by manipulating the point potential. The vortex pinning effect is carefully elucidated. This effect may be used to control the vortices and Majorana bound states in topological superconductors. The exchange of two vortices induced by moving the potentials is simulated numerically. The zero-energy state in the vortex core is robust with respect to the strength of the potential. The Majorana bound states in a pinned vortex are identified numerically.
