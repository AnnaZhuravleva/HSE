Recently two fundamental topological properties of a magnetic vortex at the interface of a superconductor (SC) and a strong topological insulator (TI) have been established: the vortex carries both a Majorana zero-mode relevant for topological quantum computation and, for a time-reversal invariant TI, a charge of $e/4$. This fractional charge is caused by the axion term in the electromagnetic Lagrangian of the TI. Here we determine the angular momentum $J$ of the vortices, which in turn determines their mutual statistics. Solving the axion-London electrodynamic equations including screening in both SC and TI, we find that the elementary quantum of angular momentum of the vortex is $-n^2\hbar/8$, where $n$ is the flux quantum of the vortex line. Exchanging two elementary fluxes thus changes the phase of the wavefunction by $-\pi/4$.
