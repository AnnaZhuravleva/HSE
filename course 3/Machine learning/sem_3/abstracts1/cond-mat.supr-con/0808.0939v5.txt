A general phenomenological theory is presented for the phase behavior of ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet electron Cooper pairing. The theory accounts in detail for the temperature-pressure phase diagram of ZrZn$_2$, while the main features of the diagram for UGe$_2$ are also described. Quantitative criteria are deduced for the U-type (type I) and Zr-type (type II) unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet Cooper electron pairing. Some basic properties of quantum phase transitions are also elucidated.
