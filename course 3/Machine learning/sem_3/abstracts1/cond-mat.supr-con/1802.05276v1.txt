We develop a new theoretical approach for modelling a wide range of semiconductor-superconductor structures with arbitrary potential barriers and a spatially-dependent superconducting order parameter. We demonstrate asymmetry in the conductance spectrum as a result of a Schottky barrier shape. We further show that Andreev reflection process can be significantly enhanced through resonant tunneling with appropriate barrier configuration, which can incorporate the Schottky barrier as a contributing component of the device. Moreover, we show that resonant tunneling can be achieved in superlattice structures as well. These theoretically demonstrated effects along with our modelling approach enable much more efficient Cooper pair injection into semiconductor-superconductor structures, including superconducting optoelectronic devices.
