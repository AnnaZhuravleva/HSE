The number of electrons on small metallic islands and semiconductor quantum dots is quantized. When tunnelling is enabled via opaque barriers this number can change by an integer [1,2]. In superconductors the addition is in units of 2e charges, reflecting that the Cooper pair condensate must have an even parity [3]. This even-parity ground state (GS) is foundational for all superconducting qubit devices [4]. Here, we study a hybrid superconducting (Al)-semiconducting (InSb) island and find three typical GS transitions in a parallel magnetic field at controllable gate configurations: a 2e-periodic even-parity GS, a 2e-periodic odd-parity GS transition, and a transition from a 2e- to 1e-periodic GS.The observation of a 2e-periodic, odd-parity GS persistent in gate-voltage represents a novelty in the physics of Coulomb-blockaded hybrid islands and occurs when a single, spin-resolved subgap state crosses zero energy and reaches a negative energy larger than the charging energy. For our 1e-periodic GSs we explicitly show the origin being a single zero-energy state that is gapped from the continuum, i.e. compatible with an Andreev bound states (ABSs) stabilized at zero energy [5] or the presence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) [6,7].
