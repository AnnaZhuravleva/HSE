Controlling quasiparticle dynamics can improve the performance of superconducting devices. For example, it has been demonstrated effective in increasing lifetime and stability of superconducting qubits. Here we study how to optimize the placement of normal-metal traps in transmon-type qubits. When the trap size increases beyond a certain characteristic length, the details of the geometry and trap position, and even the number of traps, become important. We discuss for some experimentally relevant examples how to shorten the decay time of the excess quasiparticle density. Moreover, we show that a trap in the vicinity of a Josephson junction can reduce the steady-state quasiparticle density near that junction, thus suppressing the quasiparticle-induced relaxation rate of the qubit. Such a trap also reduces the impact of fluctuations in the generation rate of quasiparticles, rendering the qubit more stable.
