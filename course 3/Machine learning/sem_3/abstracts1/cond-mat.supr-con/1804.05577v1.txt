A gapful Higgs mode is a collective excitation that arises in a system involving spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry, along with a gapless Nambu-Goldstone mode. Here we construct a new framework to explain the appearance of a Higgs mode as a pure amplitude mode in fermionic systems with a particle-hole (p-h) symmetric dispersion. To this end, we introduce nontrivial charge-conjugation ($\mathcal C$), parity ($\mathcal P$), and time-reversal ($\mathcal T$) operations involving the swapping of pairs of the wave vectors symmetrical with respect to the Fermi surface. It is shown that a fermionic Hamiltonian with a p-h symmetric dispersion exhibits the discrete symmetries under $\mathcal C$, $\mathcal P$, $\mathcal T$, and $\mathcal{CPT}$. We find that in the superconducting ground state, $\mathcal T$ and $\mathcal P$ are spontaneously broken simultaneously with the U(1) symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of $\mathcal T$ is responsible for the emergence of a gapful Higgs mode that induces pure amplitude oscillation of the gap function due to the unbroken $\mathcal C$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the broken $\mathcal T$ is restored in the excited state with a Higgs mode.
