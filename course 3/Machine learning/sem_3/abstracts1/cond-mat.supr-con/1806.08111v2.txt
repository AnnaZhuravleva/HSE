We study Josephson junctions based on inversion-asymmetric Weyl semimetals under the influence of Zeeman fields. We show that, due to distinct spin textures, the Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities respond differently to a Zeeman field in a particular direction. Remarkably, a Zeeman field perpendicular to the junction modulates the phase in the current-phase relation (CPR) of opposite chiralities differently, leading to the striking phenomenon of a finite chirality Josephson current existing even in the absence of a phase difference across the junction. This phenomenon can be understood as a novel type of quantum anomaly at low energies. We predict that, the chirality-dependent CPR and hence the chirality Josephson current can be detected experimentally by an anomalous Fraunhofer pattern which is insensitive to chemical potentials, junction length, and (low) temperature.
