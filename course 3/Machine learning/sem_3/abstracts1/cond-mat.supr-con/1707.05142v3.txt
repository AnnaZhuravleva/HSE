We discuss the susceptibility of the Cooper condensate in the s-wave $2+1$ superconductor in the external magnetic field and in the rotating frame. The extended holographic model involving the charged rank-two field is considered and it is argued that the susceptibility does not vanish. We interpret non-vanishing susceptibilities as the admixture of the p-wave triplet component in the Cooper condensate in the external field.
