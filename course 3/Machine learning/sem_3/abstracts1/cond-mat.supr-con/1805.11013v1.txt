We study theoretically single-particle spectra of Weyl superconductors. Three different superconducting pairing states are addressed, which are the BCS-type states with the $s$-wave pairing symmetry and the $p+ip$-wave pairing symmetry, and the FFLO pairing state. We elaborate that these three states can be resolved well based on the bulk and surface spectral functions as well as the local density of states. The single impurity effect is also explored, which may help us to differentiate the BCS-type pairing states and the FFLO state further.
