We study the negative refractive index in cubic noncentrosymmetric superconductors. We consider the Maxwell equations under the Meissner effect, and magnetoelectric effect arising due to broken inversion symmetry. We derive dispersion relations of electromagnetic waves, and show that the refractive index becomes negative at frequencies just below the Higgs gap. We find that the chiral mechanism of the negative refractive index, which is usually discussed in chiral materials with negative permittivity can be applied to superconductors with positive permittivity by replacing the plasma gap with the Higgs gap. Estimation from the experimental values of the penetration depth of LiPt$_3$B indicates that the negative refractive index may appear in UV regions. LiPt$_3$B may exhibit the negative refractive index at wavelengths shorter than any other material observed so far.
