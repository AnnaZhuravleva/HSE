Low-energy electron impact excitations of S_2 molecules are studied using the fixed-bond R-matrix method based on state-averaged complete active space SCF orbitals. Integral cross sections are calculated for elastic electron collision as well as impact excitation of the 7 lowest excited electronic states. Also, differential cross sections are obtained for elastic collision and excitation of the a^1 Delta_g, b^1 Sigma_g^+ and B^3 Sigma_u^- states. The integrated cross section of optically allowed excitation of the B^3 Sigma_u^- state agrees reasonably well with the available theoretical result.
