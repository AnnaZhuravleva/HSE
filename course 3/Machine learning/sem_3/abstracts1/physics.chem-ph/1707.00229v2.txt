We present and compare several many-body methods as applied to two-dimensional quantum dots with circular symmetry. We calculate the approximate ground state energy using a harmonic oscillator basis optimized by Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and further improve the ground state energy using two post-HF methods: in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) and coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD). With the application of quasidegenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) or the equations-of-motion (EOM) method to the results of the previous two methods, we obtain addition and removal energies as well. Our results are benchmarked against full configuration interaction (FCI) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) where available. We examine the rate of convergence and perform extrapolations to the infinite basis limit using a power-law model.
