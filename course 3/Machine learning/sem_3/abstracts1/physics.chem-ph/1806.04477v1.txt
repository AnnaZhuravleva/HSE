Electron-positron interactions have been utilized in various fields of science. Here we develop time-dependent multi-component density functional theory to study the coupled electron-positron dynamics from first principles. We prove that there are coupled time-dependent single-particle equations that can provide the electron and positron density dynamics, and derive the formally exact expression for their effective potentials. Introducing the adiabatic local density approximation to time dependent electron-positron correlation, we apply the theory to the dynamics of a positronic lithium hydride molecule under a laser field. We demonstrate the significance of electron-positron dynamical correlation by revealing the complex positron detachment mechanism and the suppression of electronic resonant excitation by the screening effect of the positron.
