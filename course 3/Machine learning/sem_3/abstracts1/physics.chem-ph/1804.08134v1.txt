The Coupled-Cluster theory is one of the most successful high precision methods used to solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation. In this article, we address the mathematical foundation of this theory and the advances made in the past decade. Rather than solely relying on spectral gap assumptions, we highlight the importance of coercivity assumptions - G\aa rding type inequalities - for the uniqueness of the Coupled-Cluster solution. In the extended Coupled-Cluster theory the Lagrange multipliers are wave function parameters and, by means of the bivariational principle, we here derive a connection between the exact cluster amplitudes and the Lagrange multipliers. This relation might proof useful when determining the quality of a Coupled-Cluster solution. Furthermore, the use of an Aubin-Nitsche duality type method in different Coupled-Cluster approaches is discussed and contrasted with the bivariational principle.
