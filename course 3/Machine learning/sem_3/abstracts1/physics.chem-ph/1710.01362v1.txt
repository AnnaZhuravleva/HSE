We develop a powerful tree tensor network states method that is capable of simulating exciton-phonon quantum dynamics of larger molecular complexes and open quantum systems with multiple bosonic environments. We interface this method with ab initio density functional theory to study singlet exciton fission (SF) in a pentacene dimer. With access to the full vibronic many-body wave function, we track and assign the contributions of different symmetry classes of vibrations to SF and derive energy surfaces, enabling us to dissect, understand, and describe the strongly coupled electronic and vibrational dynamics, relaxation, and reduced state cooling. This directly exposes the rich possibilities of exploiting the functional interplay of molecular symmetry, electronic structure and vibrational dynamics in SF material design. The described method can be similarly applied to other complex (bio-) molecular systems, characterised by a rich manifold of electronic states and vibronic coupling driving non-adiabatic dynamics.
