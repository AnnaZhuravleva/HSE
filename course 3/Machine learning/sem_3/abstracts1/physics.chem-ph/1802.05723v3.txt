We give an explicit and general description of the energy, linear momentum, angular momentum and boost momentum of a molecule to order $1/c^2$, where it necessary to take account of kinetic contributions made by the electrons and nuclei as well as electromagnetic contributions made by the intramolecular field. A wealth of interesting subtleties are encountered that are not seen at order $1/c^0$, including relativistic Hall shifts, anomalous velocities and hidden momenta. Some of these have well known analogues in solid state physics.
