In the mean-field theory, the stabilization of chiral molecules is understood as a quantum phase transition where the mean-field ground state of molecules changes from the achiral eigenstate of the molecular Hamiltonian to one of the degenerated chiral states due to the increase of the intermolecular interaction. Starting from the many-body Hamiltonian of the molecular gases with electric dipole-dipole interactions, we give static Gross-Pitaevskii equations without free parameters in the vibrational dimension to explore the achiral-chiral transitions of chiral molecules. We find that the achiral-chiral transitions can be classified into two categories: in one category the mean-field ground state changes continuously with the increase of the intermolecular interaction, in the other category the mean-filed ground state changes discontinuously. In order to summarize our results, we give the mean-field phase diagram of the achiral-chiral transitions.
