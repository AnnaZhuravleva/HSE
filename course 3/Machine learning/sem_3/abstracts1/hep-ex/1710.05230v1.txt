A list of searches is presented for massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, ZH and HH boson pairs in proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data are taken at centre-of-mass energies of 13TeV, corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 12.9/fb(ICHEP) and up to 35.9/fb. The results are interpreted in the context of heavy vector triplet and singlet models that mimic properties of composite-Higgs models predicting W' and Z' bosons decaying to WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons. A model with a bulk graviton that decays into WW and ZZ is also considered. Upper limits are set on the production cross section of the two models and no evidence is found for a signal.
