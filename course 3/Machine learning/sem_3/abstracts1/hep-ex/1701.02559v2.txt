The T2K experiment is a long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiment using a near detector complex ND280 and a far detector, Super-Kamiokande. Neutrino interactions are detected by Cherenkov light in Super-Kamiokande in order to measure neutrino oscillation parameters. The accuracy of the oscillation parameter measurements depends on our knowledge of neutrino interactions, the neutrino flux and the detector response. ND280 is composed of a tracker and several sub-detectors designed to characterise the neutrino beam before oscillation, which allow us to constrain the uncertainties on the neutrino interaction and the accelerator flux models. In this talk we present the result of a fit on the ND280 data, as well as a study of the robustness of the fit to the choice of neutrino interaction model. The constraint obtained on the oscillation parameters is also discussed.
