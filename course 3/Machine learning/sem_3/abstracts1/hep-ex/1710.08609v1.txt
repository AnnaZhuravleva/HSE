The MoEDAL experiment at the LHC is optimised to detect highly-ionising particles such as magnetic monopoles, dyons and (multiply) electrically-charged stable massive particles predicted in a number of theoretical scenarios. MoEDAL, deployed in the LHCb cavern, combines passive nuclear track detectors with magnetic monopole trapping volumes, while backgrounds are being monitored with an array of MediPix detectors. The detector concept and its physics reach is presented with emphasis given to recent results on monopoles.
