Recent top quark event modelling studies done using CMS proton-proton data collected at a centre of mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV and state-of-the-art theoretical predictions accurate to next-to-leading order QCD interfaced with \PYTHIA and \HERWIG event generators are summarised. The particle-level top quark (pseudo-top), underlying event measurement in \ttbar events and parton shower tuning using \ttbar events are discussed.
