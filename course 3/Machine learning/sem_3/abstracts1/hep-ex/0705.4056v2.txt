Anomalous production of low-energy photons from the galactic center have fueled speculations on the nature and properties of dark matter particles. In particular, it has been proposed that light scalars may be responsible for the bulk of the matter density of the universe, and that they couple to ordinary matter through a light spin-1 boson. If this is the case, then such particles may be produced in the quasi-elastic low-energy scattering of electrons off protons. We present a proposal for an experiment to search for this process and assess its viability.
