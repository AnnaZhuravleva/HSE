Supersymmetry is one of the most popular extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, as it offers solutions to several shortcomings of the Standard Model. Natural supersymmetric models favor masses for the new particles which are predicted by supersymmetry in the range of hundreds of GeV, well within the reach of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. If squarks and gluinos are much heavier, the production of charginos and neutralinos may be the dominant production mode for supersymmetric particles. These proceedings present results from new searches for the production of charginos and neutralinos, focusing on the recent paper by the ATLAS collaboration that summarizes and extends the searches for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles using data from Run-1 of the LHC.
