We present the reach of the proposed INO-ICAL in measuring the atmospheric-neutrino-oscillation parameters $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$ using full event-by-event reconstruction for the first time. We also study the fluctuations in the data and their effect on the precision measurements and mass-hierarchy analysis for a five-year exposure of the 50 kton ICAL detector. We find a mean resolution of $\Delta\chi^2 \approx 2.9$, which rules out the wrong mass hierarchy of the neutrinos with a significance of approximately $1.7\sigma$. These results are similar to those to presented earlier studies that approximated the performance of the ICAL detector.
