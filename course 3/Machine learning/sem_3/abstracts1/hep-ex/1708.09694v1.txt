Measurements of single boson production cross sections are presented. They are based on proton-proton collision data at 8 and 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. Inclusive and differential cross sections with respect to various observables are measured in various phase spaces. These measurements are compared to perturbative QCD predictions and generally show good agreement with the prediction.
