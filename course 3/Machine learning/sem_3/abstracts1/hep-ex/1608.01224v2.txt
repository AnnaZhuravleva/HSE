A dedicated search is presented for new phenomena in inclusive eight- and ten-jet final states with low missing transverse momentum, with and without identification of jets originating from b quarks. The analysis is based on data from proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The dominant multijet background expectations are obtained from low jet multiplicity control samples. Data agree well with the standard model background predictions, and limits are set in several benchmark models. Colorons (axigluons) with masses between 0.6 and 0.75 (up to 1.15) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Similar exclusion limits for gluinos in R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios are from 0.6 up to 1.1 TeV. These results comprise the first experimental probe of the coloron and axigluon models in multijet final states.
