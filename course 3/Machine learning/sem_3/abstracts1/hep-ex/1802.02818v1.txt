Results from recent soft QCD measurements by LHC experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, LHCf and TOTEM are reported. The measurements include total, elastic and inelastic cross sections, inclusive and identified particle spectra, underlying event and hadronic chains. Results from particle correlations in all three collision systems, namely pp, pPb and PbPb, exhibit unexpected similarities.
