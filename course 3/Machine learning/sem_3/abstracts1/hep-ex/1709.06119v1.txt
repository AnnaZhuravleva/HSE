Searches for resonances in final states with leptons and photons have always been a powerful tool for discovery in high energy physics. We present here the latest results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, based on up to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton-proton collisions produced at the Large Hadron Collider. Detailed results on single lepton, dilepton, diphoton and Z$\gamma$ resonances are included.
