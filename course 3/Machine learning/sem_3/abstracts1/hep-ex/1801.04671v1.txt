Precise measurements of electroweak processes at the International Linear Collider (ILC) will provide unique opportunities to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. Fermion pair productions are sensitive to a new contact interaction or a new heavy gauge boson by comparing cross section and angular distribution with expectations of the new physics models. In this proceedings we report a simulation study of fermion pair productions at a center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV, with a focus on lepton pairs, to demonstrate the potential of the first phase of the ILC.
