Precision studies of top quark properties provide a unique playground to test the predictions of the standard model and to search for new physics. Reviewed results from the CMS experiment done with the data collected at 8 TeV include studies of top quark Wtb anomalous and FCNC couplings, polarization, CP-violation, and spin correlation effects. No significant deviations from the SM predictions are observed.
