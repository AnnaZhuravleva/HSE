The present work continues a series of the KEDR measurements of the $R$ value that started in 2010 at the VEPP-4M $e^+e^-$ collider. By combining new data with our previous results we measured the values of $R_{\text{uds}}$ and $R$ at nine center-of-mass energies between 3.08 and 3.72 GeV. The total accuracy is about or better than $2.6\%$ at most of energy points with a systematic uncertainty of about $1.9\%$.
