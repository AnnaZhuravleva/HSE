Measurements of the di- and multiboson production cross sections at the LHC constitute stringent tests of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model and provide a model-independent means to search for new physics at the TeV scale. The ATLAS collaboration has performed studies of $ZZ$, $WZ$, $WW$, $WW\gamma$ and $WZ\gamma$ productions in various decay modes at $\sqrt{s}$=8 and 13 TeV, including total, fiducial and differential cross-section measurements. These results are compared to state-of-the art theory predictions and are used to provide constraints on new physics, by setting limits on anomalous gauge boson couplings.
