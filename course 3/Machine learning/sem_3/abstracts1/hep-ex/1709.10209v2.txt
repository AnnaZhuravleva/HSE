The plan for the International Linear Collider is now being prepared as a staged design, with the first stage at 250 GeV and later stages achieving the full project specifications with 4 ab-1 at 500 GeV. This talk will present the capabilities for precision Higgs boson measurements at 250 GeV and their relation to the full ILC program. It will show that the 250 GeV stage of ILC will already provide many compelling results in Higgs physics, with new measurements not available at LHC, model-independent determinations of key parameters, and tests for and possible discrimination of a variety of scenarios for new physics.
