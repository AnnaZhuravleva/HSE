Thank to the stable operation at intense beam power, T2K data with neutrino-mode operation almost doubled in one year. A number of critical improvements to the oscillation analysis have been introduced and resulted in an unprecedented level of sensitivity in searching for CP violation in the neutrino sector. T2K firstly reports that the CP-conserving values of parameter $\delta_{CP}$ in the PMNS mixing matrix fall out of its 2$\sigma$ C.L. measured range.
