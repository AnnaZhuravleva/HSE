Continuous wavelet transform approach has been applied to the pseudo-rapidity distribution of shower particles produced in 16O-AgBr interactions at 60 AGeV and 32S-AgBr interactions at 200 AgeV. Multiscale analysis of wavelet pseudo-rapidity spectra has been performed in order to find out the presence of ring-like correlation, which could be either due to production of Cherenkov gluons or due to propagation of Mach Shock wave through excited nuclear matter. This approach fulfils the basic requirement of both effects that they lead to an overabundance of considered particles at some typical pseudo-rapidities. Comparison of experimental results with that obtained from analyzing events generated by FRITIOF code are not reproduced.
