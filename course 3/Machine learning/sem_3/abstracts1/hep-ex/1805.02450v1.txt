Dihadron and isolated direct photon-hadron angular correlations are measured in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. The correlations are sensitive to nonperturbative initial-state and final-state transverse momentum $k_T$ and $j_T$ in the azimuthal nearly back-to-back region $\Delta\phi\sim\pi$. In this region, transverse-momentum-dependent evolution can be studied when several different hard scales are measured. To have sensitivity to small transverse momentum scales, nonperturbative momentum widths of $p_{\rm out}$, the out-of-plane transverse momentum component perpendicular to the trigger particle, are measured. These widths are used to investigate possible effects from transverse-momentum-dependent factorization breaking. When accounting for the longitudinal momentum fraction of the away-side hadron with respect to the near-side trigger particle, the widths are found to increase with the hard scale; this is qualitatively similar to the observed behavior in Drell-Yan and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering interactions. The momentum widths are also studied as a function of center-of-mass energy by comparing to previous measurements at $\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV. The nonperturbative jet widths also appear to increase with $\sqrt{s}$ at a similar $x_T$, which is qualitatively consistent to similar measurements in Drell-Yan interactions. To quantify the magnitude of any transverse-momentum-dependent factorization breaking effects, calculations will need to be performed to compare to these measurements.
