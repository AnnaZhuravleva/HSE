The spatial extents of particle emission source in high-energy collisions can be measured using two-particle femtoscopic correlations. In collisions with small multipli cities, such as proton-proton collisions, correlation functions can be distorted by non-femtos copic effects, for example due to the correlations that caused by energy-momentum conservatio n laws, jets and mini-jets. To estimate these effects, a simulation of p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200 and $\sqrt{s}$=510 GeV using PYTHIA 6.4.28 and HIJING 1.383, and p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV using HIJING were performed. Charged pion and kaon correlation functions obtained from the Monte Carlo generators and their comparison to the experimental data are p resented.
