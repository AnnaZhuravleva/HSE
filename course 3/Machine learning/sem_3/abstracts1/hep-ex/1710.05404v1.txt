NA61/SHINE is a fixed target experiment at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron. The main goals of the experiment are to discover the critical point of strongly interacting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement. In order to reach these goals, a study of hadron production properties is performed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei. In this talk, recent results on particle production in p+p interactions, as well as Be+Be and Ar+Sc collisions in the SPS energy range are reviewed. Transverse momentum, transverse mass and rapidity spectra obtained with various analysis methods are presented. Surprises in studies of signatures of onset of deconfinement are discussed. The results are compared with available world data.
