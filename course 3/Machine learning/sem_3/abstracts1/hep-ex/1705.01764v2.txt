T2K is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, in which a muon-neutrino beam is directed over a 295 km baseline from the J-PARC facility to the Super-Kamiokande detector. This allows neutrino oscillation to be studied in two channels: disappearance of muon neutrinos and appearance of electron neutrinos. T2K has collected data using both a neutrino-enhanced and an antineutrino-enhanced beam, and these proceedings present the first T2K results using both neutrino and antineutrino oscillation data. Combining the two data sets gives the first ever sensitivity to neutrino-sector CP violation from T2K data alone, as well as the most precise T2K measurement of the other neutrino oscillation parameters.
