$K^{+}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\nu\overline{\nu}$ is one of the theoretically cleanest meson decay where to look for indirect effects of new physics complementary to LHC searches. The NA62 experiment at CERN SPS is designed to measure the branching ratio of this decay with 10\% precision. NA62 took data in pilot runs in 2014 and 2015 reaching the final designed beam intensity. The quality of 2015 data acquired, in view of the final measurement, will be presented.
