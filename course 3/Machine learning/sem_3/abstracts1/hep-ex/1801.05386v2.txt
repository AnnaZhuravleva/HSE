Neutrinos from nuclear reactors have played a major role in advancing our knowledge on the properties of neutrinos. The first direct detection of neutrino, confirming its existence, was performed with reactor neutrinos. More recent experiments utilizing reactor neutrinos also found clear evidence for neutrino oscillations, providing unique inputs for neutrino masses and neutrino mixings. Ongoing and future reactor neutrino experiments will explore other important issues, including neutrino mass hierarchy and the search for sterile neutrinos and new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this article, we review the recent progress in physics with reactor neutrinos and the opportunities for future discoveries.
