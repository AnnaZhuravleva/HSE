In this article we present an idea of using liquid scintillator Cherenkov neutrino detectors to detect the mantle and K-40 components of geoneutrinos. Liquid scintillator Cherenkov detectors feature both energy and direction measurement for charge particles. Geoneutrinos can be detected with the elastic scattering process of neutrino and electron. With the directionality, the dominant intrinsic background originated from solar neutrinos in common liquid scintillator detectors can be suppressed. The mantle geoneutrinos can be distinguished because they come mainly underneath. The K-40 geoneutrinos can also be identified, if the detection threshold for direction measurement can be lower than, for example, 0.8 MeV. According to our calculation, a moderate, kilo-ton scale, detector can observe tens of candidates, and is a practical start for an experiment.
