We report the preliminary measurement of the $CP$ asymmetry of the $D^0 \rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$ decay, which is consistent with no $CP$ violation and improves the uncertainty with respect to the previous measurement of this quantity by more than a factor of three. Also, the expected precision on $CP$ asymmetry of the $D^0 \rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$ decay by the Belle II experiment is presented.
