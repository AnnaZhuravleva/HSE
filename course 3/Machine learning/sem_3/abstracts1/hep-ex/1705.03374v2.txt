A measurement of $b$-hadron pair production is presented, based on a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 11.4 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions recorded at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are selected in which a $b$-hadron is reconstructed in a decay channel containing $J/\psi \rightarrow \mu\mu$, and a second $b$-hadron is reconstructed in a decay channel containing a muon. Results are presented in a fiducial volume defined by kinematic requirements on three muons based on those used in the analysis. The fiducial cross section is measured to be $17.7 \pm 0.1 ($stat.$) \pm 2.0 ($syst.$)$ nb. A number of normalised differential cross sections are also measured, and compared to predictions from the Pythia8, Herwig++, MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and Sherpa event generators, providing new constraints on heavy flavour production.
