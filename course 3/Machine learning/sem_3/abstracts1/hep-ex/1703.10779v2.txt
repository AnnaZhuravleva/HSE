We present the first measurements of tritium beta-decay spectrum in the electron energy range 16-18.6 keV. The goal is to find distortions which may correspond to the presence of a heavy sterile neutrinos. A possible contribution of this kind would manifest itself as a kink in the spectrum with a similar shape but with end point shifted by the value of a heavy neutrino mass. We set a new upper limits to the neutrino mixing matrix element U^2_{e4} which improve existing limits by a factor from 2 to 5 in the mass range 0.1-2 keV.
