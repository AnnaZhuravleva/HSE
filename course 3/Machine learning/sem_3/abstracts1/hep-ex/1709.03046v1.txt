We report on the measurement of the decay $B\to K^{\star}\gamma$, lepton-flavor dependent angular analysis of the decay $B\to K^{\star}\ell\ell$, and search for the decays $B\to h\nu\nu$. All these analyses are performed on the 711 $fb^{-1}$ data sample recorded by the Belle detector at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.
