As a Higgs factory, The CEPC (Circular Electron-Positron Collider) project aims at the precise measurement of the Higgs boson properties. A baseline detector concept, APODIS (A PFA Oriented Detector for the HIggS factory), has been proposed for the CEPC CDR (Conceptual Design Report) study. We explore the Higgs signatures at this baseline setup with nunuHiggs events. The detector performance of the charged particles, the photons, and the jets are quantified with Higgs -> mumu, gammagamma, and jet final states respectively. The accuracy of reconstructed Higgs boson mass is comparable at different decay modes with jets in the final states. We also analyze the Higgs -> WW* and ZZ* decay modes, where a clear separation between different decay cascades is observed.
