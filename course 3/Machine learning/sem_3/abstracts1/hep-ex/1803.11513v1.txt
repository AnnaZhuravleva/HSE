T2K is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a $\nu_{\mu}$ beam produced at the J-PARC facility. Neutrinos are detected at a Near Detector complex (ND280) and at the Far Detector (Super-Kamiokande). The most recent oscillation results presented by T2K are described in these proceedings. With these data T2K has produced the first constraints on $\delta_{CP}$, excluding CP conserving values at 2$\sigma$ and the world best measurement of the $\theta_{23}$ mixing angle.
