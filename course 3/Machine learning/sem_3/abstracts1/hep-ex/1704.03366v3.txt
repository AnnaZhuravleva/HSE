A search for the production of heavy resonances decaying into top quark-antiquark pairs is presented. The analysis is performed in the lepton+jets and fully hadronic channels using data collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV using the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 inverse femtobarns. The selection is optimized for massive resonances, where the top quarks have large Lorentz boosts. No evidence for resonant t t-bar production is found in the data, and upper limits on the production cross section of heavy resonances are set. The exclusion limits for resonances with masses above 2 TeV are significantly improved compared to those of previous analyses at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV.
