A search for flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes in associated production of a top quark and Higgs boson, with the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b quarks, is presented. To experimentally probe the top-Higgs FCNC couplings, for the first time the single-top production is considered as a signal process. One isolated lepton and at least three reconstructed jets, among which at least two are identified as b quark jets, are found in the final state. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $35.9\,\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}\,=\,13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ in 2016, and the final results are presented in the form of the observed and expected 95\% CL upper limits on the branching ratio of top quark decays.
