Proton-proton collisions at the LHC provide the ground for tests of the strong interactions through the study of the production mechanisms for quarkonia and hadrons containing charm or beauty flavours. This review addresses recent results and includes studies of kinematical correlations, polarisation and associated production. QCD-based models are briefly discussed and compared to measurements.
