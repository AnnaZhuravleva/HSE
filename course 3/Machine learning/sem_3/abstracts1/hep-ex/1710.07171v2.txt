A search for massive coloured resonances which are pair-produced and decay into two jets is presented. The analysis uses 36.7 fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV pp collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant deviation from the background prediction is observed. Results are interpreted in a SUSY simplified model where the lightest supersymmetric particle is the top squark, $\tilde{t}$, which decays promptly into two quarks through $R$-parity-violating couplings. Top squarks with masses in the range 100 GeV < $m_{\tilde{t}}$ < 410 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. If the decay is into a $b$-quark and a light quark, a dedicated selection requiring two $b$-tags is used to exclude masses in the ranges 100 GeV < $m_{\tilde{t}}$ < 470 GeV and 480 GeV < $m_{\tilde{t}}$ < 610 GeV. Additional limits are set on the pair-production of massive colour-octet resonances.
