We present the first measurements of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ for dijets with at least one jet reconstructed within the pseudorapidity range $0.8 < \eta < 1.8$. The dijets were measured in polarized $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. Values for $A_{LL}$ are determined for several distinct event topologies, defined by the jet pseudorapidities, and span a range of parton momentum fraction $x$ down to $x \sim$ 0.01. The measured asymmetries are found to be consistent with the predictions of global analyses that incorporate the results of previous RHIC measurements. They will provide new constraints on $\Delta g(x)$ in this poorly constrained region when included in future global analyses.
