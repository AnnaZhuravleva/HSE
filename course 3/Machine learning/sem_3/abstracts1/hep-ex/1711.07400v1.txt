A review of ATLAS and CMS measurements of the inclusive $t\bar{t}$ production cross-section in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$7-13 TeV is presented, focusing on the most precise results in the dilepton and lepton+jets final states. The measurements are in good agreement with state-of-the-art QCD predictions, and have been used to determine the top quark pole mass and provide constraints on proton parton distribution functions.
