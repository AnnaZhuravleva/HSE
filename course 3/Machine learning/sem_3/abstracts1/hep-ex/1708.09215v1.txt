The latest measurements of the Higgs boson properties in both the $\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ decay channel and the $\mathrm{H}\rightarrow{\rm Z}{\rm Z}\rightarrow4\ell$ ($\ell={\rm e},\mu$) decay channel using the proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=13$ $TeV$, including the signal strength relative to the standard model prediction, signal strength modifiers for different Higgs production modes, coupling modifiers to fermions and bosons, and effective coupling modifiers to photons and gluons, are presented. In addition, dedicated measurements of the Higgs boson's mass, width, total and differential fiducial cross sections have been summarized. All results are consistent, within their uncertainties, with the expectations for the SM Higgs boson.
