Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $2.93\,\rm fb^{-1}$ taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773\,GeV with the BESIII detector operated at the BEPCII collider, we perform an analysis of the semi-leptonic decays $D^{0(+)}\to \pi^{-(0)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$. The branching fractions of ${\mathcal B}(D^0\to \pi^-\mu^+\nu_\mu)$ and ${\mathcal B}(D^+\to \pi^0\mu^+\nu_\mu)$ are measured to be $(0.267 \pm 0.007_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.007_{\rm syst.})\%$ and $(0.342 \pm 0.011_{\rm stat.} \pm 0.010_{\rm syst.})\%$, respectively, where the former is of much improved precision compared to previous results and the latter is determined for the first time. Using these results along with previous BESIII measurements, we calculate ${\mathcal B}(D^{0}\to \pi^{-}\mu^+\nu_\mu)/{\mathcal B}(D^{0}\to \pi^{-}e^+\nu_e)$ and ${\mathcal B}(D^{+}\to \pi^{0}\mu^+\nu_\mu)/{\mathcal B}(D^{+}\to \pi^{0}e^+\nu_e)$ to be $0.905\pm 0.027_{\rm stat.}\pm0.023_{\rm syst.}$ and $0.942\pm 0.037_{\rm stat.}\pm0.027_{\rm syst.}$, which are compatible with the theoretical prediction of lepton universality within $1.9\sigma$ and $0.6\sigma$, respectively. Combining these results with the world-average lifetimes of $D^{0(+)}$, the ratio of the partial widths is determined to be $\Gamma(D^0\to \pi^-\mu^+\nu_\mu)/2\Gamma(D^+\to \pi^0\mu^+\nu_\mu)= 0.990\pm 0.041_{\rm stat.}\pm0.035_{\rm syst.}$, which is consistent with unity within the uncertainty and supports isospin conservation in the two decays.
