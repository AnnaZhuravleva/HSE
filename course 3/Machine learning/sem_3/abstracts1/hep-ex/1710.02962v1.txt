Hadronic $B$ decays without a charm quark constitute a powerful probe to search for physics beyond the standard model as well as to provide constraints on $CP$ violation parameters. We report final measurements from Belle of the branching fractions and $CP$ asymmetries for the decays $B^{0} \rightarrow \pi^{0} \pi^{0}$ and $B^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} \pi^{\pm}$. The $B^{0} \rightarrow \pi^{0} \pi^{0}$ measurements enable us to improve constraints on the angle $\phi_{2}$ of the CKM unitarity triangle. For $B^{\pm} \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} \pi^{\pm}$ we measure $CP$ asymmetry as a function of the invariant mass of the $K^{+}K^{-}$ system, where we find a strong evidence for large $CP$ violation and a large increase in yield at low mass region. This result challenges conventional theoretical approaches as it requires a large enhancement in both tree and loop level diagrams in the same small region of phase-space.
