Recent results on searches for Beyond Standard Model production of Higgs bosons in fermion decay channels are presented. The analyses are based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at 7, 8, and 13 TeV centre-of-mass energies. The exclusion limits determined by the null results of the searches are interpreted in the framework of models that include extensions of the standard Higgs sector.
