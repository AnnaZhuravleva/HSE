The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured the differential cross section of $\phi$(1020) meson production at forward rapidity in $p$$+$$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$510 GeV via the dimuon decay channel. The integrated cross section in the rapidity and $p_T$ ranges $1.2<|y|<2.2$ and $2<p_T<7$ GeV/$c$ is $\sigma_\phi=2.79 \pm 0.20\,{\rm (stat)} \pm 0.17\,{\rm (syst)} \pm 0.34\, {\rm (norm)} \times 10^{-2}$~mb. The energy dependence of $\sigma_\phi$ ($1.2<|y|<2.2$; $2<p_T<5$ GeV/$c$) is studied using the PHENIX measurements at $\sqrt{s}=$200 and 510 GeV and the Large-Hadron-Collider measurements at $\sqrt{s}=$2.76 and 7 TeV. The experimental results are compared to various event generator predictions (pythia6, pythia8, phojet, ampt, epos3, and epos-lhc).
