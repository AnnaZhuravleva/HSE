Numbers of tabletop experiments have made efforts to detect large extra dimensions for the range from solar system to submillimeter system, but the direct evidence is still lacking. Here we present a scheme to test the gravitational law in 4+2 dimensions at microns by using cavity optomechanical method. We have investigated the probe spectrum for coupled quantum levitated oscillators in optical cavities. The results show that the spectral splitting can be obtained once the large extra dimensions present. Compare to the previous experiment, the sensitivity can be improved by the using of a specific geometry and a shield mirror to control and suppress the effect of the Casimir background. The weak frequency splitting can be optically read by the pump-probe scheme. Thus we can detect the gravitational deviation in the bulk based ADD model via spectroscopy without the isoelectronic technique.
