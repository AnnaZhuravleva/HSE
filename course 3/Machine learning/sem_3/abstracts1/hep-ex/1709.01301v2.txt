The polarization of the $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S) $mesons, produced in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$=7 and 8TeV, is measured using data samples collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1 and 2fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The measurements are performed in three polarization frames, using $\Upsilon\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays in the kinematic region of the transverse momentum $p_{T}(\Upsilon)<30GeV/c$, and rapidity $2.2<y(\Upsilon)<4.5$. No large polarization is observed.
