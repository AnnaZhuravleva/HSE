A variety of top quark mass measurements has been made in the recent years by the CMS Collaboration. The most recent measurements performed at 8 TeV are reported here, along with a new measurement based on data collected in 2016 at 13 TeV. The current combination of these measurements has a relative uncertainty smaller than 0.3%, making the top quark the most accurately measured quark.
