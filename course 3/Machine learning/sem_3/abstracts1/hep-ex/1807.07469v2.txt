One of the key results of the LHC Run 1 was the observation of an enhanced production of strange particles in high multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The strangeness enhancement is investigated by measuring the evolution with multiplicity of single-strange and multi-strange baryon production relative to non-strange particles. A smooth increase of strange particle yields relative to the non-strange ones with event multiplicity has been observed in such systems. We report the latest results on multiplicity dependence of strange and multi-strange hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV with ALICE. We also presented recent measurements of mesonic and baryonic resonances in small collision systems like pp and p--Pb at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 13 and 8.16 TeV, respectively. The system size dependent studies in pp and p-Pb collisions have been used to investigate how the hadronic scattering processes affect measured resonance yields and to better understand the interplay between canonical suppression and strangeness enhancement. The measurement of the $\phi(1020)$ meson as a function of multiplicity provides crucial constraints in this context.
