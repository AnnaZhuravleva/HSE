A search for Higgs boson decays to $\tau$ leptons is performed using events recorded in proton-proton collisions by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 $fb^{-1}$. An excess of events is observed over the expected background prediction with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations.
