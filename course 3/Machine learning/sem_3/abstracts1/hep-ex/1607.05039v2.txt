In this paper we study the performance in $e^+e^-$ collisions of classical $e^+e^-$ jet reconstruction algorithms, longitudinally invariant algorithms and the recently-proposed Valencia algorithm. The study includes a comparison of perturbative and non-perturbative jet energy corrections and the response under realistic background conditions. Several algorithms are benchmarked with a detailed detector simulation at $\sqrt{s}= 3$~\tev. We find that the classical $e^+e^-$ algorithms, with or without beam jets, have the best response, but are inadequate in environments with non-negligible background. The Valencia algorithm and longitudinally invariant $k_t$ algorithms have a much more robust performance, with a slight advantage for the former.
