Several recent theories suggest that light moduli or particles in "large" extra dimensions could mediate macroscopic forces exceeding gravitational strength at length scales below a millimeter. Such new forces can be parameterized as a Yukawa-type correction to the Newtonian potential of strength $\alpha$ relative to gravity and range $\lambda$. To extend the search for such new physics we have improved our apparatus utilizing cryogenic micro-cantilevers capable of measuring attonewton forces, which now includes a switchable magnetic force for calibration. Our most recent experimental constraints on Yukawa-type deviations from Newtonian gravity are more than three times as stringent as our previously published results, and represent the best bound in the range of 5 - 15 microns, with a 95 percent confidence exclusion of forces with $|\alpha| > 14,000$ at $\lambda$ = 10 microns.
