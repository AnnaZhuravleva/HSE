In this paper, an overview of recent $\mathrm D^{0}$, $\mathrm D^{+}$ and $\mathrm D^{*+}$ measurements, performed by ALICE in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}~=~2.76$, 5, 7, 8 and 13 TeV, is reported. The minimum-bias production cross sections, as well as their energy and species dependences, are compared to perturbative QCD calculations. The evolution of the D-meson yields with the event multiplicity is compared to phenomenological models.
