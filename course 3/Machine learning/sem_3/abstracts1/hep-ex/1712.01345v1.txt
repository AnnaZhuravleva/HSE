Exotic charmonium-like states have been targeted by various experiments in the last 15 years, but their nature still is unknown. Photo-(muo)production is a new promising instrument to study them. COMPASS, a fixed target experiment at CERN, analyzed the full set of the data collected with a muon beam between 2002 and 2011, covering the range from 7 GeV to 19 GeV in the centre-of-mass energy of the (virtual)photon-nucleon system. Production of the X(3872) state in the reaction $\mu^+~N \rightarrow \mu^+(J/\psi\pi^+\pi^- )\pi^{\pm} N'$ has been observed with a statistical significance of around 5 $\sigma$. The shape of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ mass distribution from the decay $X(3872)\rightarrow J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ shows disagreement with previous observations. The product of the cross section and the branching fraction of the $X(3872)$ decay into $J/\psi\pi\pi$ is estimated as 71$\pm$28(stat)$\pm$39(syst) pb. The results obtained for the production of the $Z_c^{\pm}(3900)$ are also reported as well as future perspectives.
