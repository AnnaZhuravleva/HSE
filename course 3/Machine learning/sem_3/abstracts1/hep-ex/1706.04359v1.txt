It was found that at cryogenic temperatures the spontaneous emission of single electrons from cathode of PMT is increased by lowering the temperature of PMT. This effect has not found yet a satisfactory explanation. It was suggested by us that the source of cryogenic dark current is a conversion of hidden photons on a metallic surface. To check this hypothesis a series of measurements have been performed using a multicathode counter developed by us as a detector of single electrons. Upon the results of measurements during 78 days in configurations R1 and R2 of a multicathode counter with a copper cathode the dependence of the counting rate of single electrons on temperature has been obtained. The results obtained are in agreement with the hypotheses that hidden photons are the source of a cryogenic dark current. These very preliminary results have to be checked by further measurements.
