Axion Like Particles (ALPs) with a sub-keV range mass are searched by using the light-shining-through-a-wall technique. A novel system is developed in which injected X rays are converted and reconverted by the Laue-case conversion within a silicon single crystal with dual blades. The resonant ALPs' mass of the conversion is scanned by varying the X-ray injection angle to the crystal. No significant signals are observed, and 90% C. L. upper limits on the ALP-two photon coupling constant are obtained as follows, g_{a\gamma\gamma} < 4.2 \times 10^{-3} GeV^{-1} (m_a < 10 eV), g_{a\gamma\gamma} < 5.0 \times 10^{-3} GeV^{-1} (46 eV < m_a < 1020 eV). These are the most stringent laboratorial constraints on ALPs heavier than 300 eV.
