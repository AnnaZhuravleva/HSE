Several anomalies are discussed in neutrino physics, linked to the possible existence of light sterile neutrinos. These sterile neutrinos would not interact weakly, but they could leave an imprint in various measurements, such as neutrino oscillation experiments or precise measurements of beta decay spectra. Global analyses of neutrino oscillation data suggest sterile neutrinos with a mass in the eV range, but reveal at the same time tensions with the observed neutrino anomalies. In the next years several experiments will test the sterile neutrino hypothesis with masses in the eV range with promising sensitivities.
