The Full Event Interpretation is presented: a new exclusive tagging algorithm used by the high-energy physics experiment Belle~II. The experimental setup of the Belle~II experiment allows the precise measurement of otherwise inaccessible $B$ meson decay-modes. The Full Event Interpretation algorithm enables many of these measurements. The algorithm relies on machine learning to automatically identify plausible $B$ meson decay chains based on the data recorded by the detector. Compared to similar algorithms employed by previous experiments, the Full Event Interpretation provides a greater efficiency, yielding a larger effective sample size usable in the measurement.
