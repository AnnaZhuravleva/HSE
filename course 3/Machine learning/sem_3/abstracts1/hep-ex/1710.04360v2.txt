A number of short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments have observed an anomalous excess of neutrinos in the low energy range. This may hint towards the existence of additional neutrino mass splittings. If true, additional sterile (non-interacting) neutrino states above the current 3 neutrino model would be required. On the other hand, many parameters of the allowed space are limited by experiments that have seen no anomaly. We will introduce models which accommodate these additional neutrinos, and then discuss our work towards fitting these models to the available global high $\Delta m^{2}$ oscillation data. We will then present the latest results of these fits.
