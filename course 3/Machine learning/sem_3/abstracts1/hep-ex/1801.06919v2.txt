The fixed-target NA61/SHINE experiment (SPS CERN) looks for the critical point of strongly interacting matter and the properties of the onset of deconfinement. It is a two dimensional scan of measurements of particle spectra and fluctuations in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as a function of collision energy and system size, corresponding to a two dimensional phase diagram (temperature T - baryonic chemical potential $\mu_B$). New NA61/SHINE results are presented here, such as transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations in Ar+Sc collisions compared to NA61/SHINE p+p and Be+Be data, as well as to earlier NA49 A+A results. Recently, a preliminary signature for the new size dependent effect - rapid changes in system size dependence was observed in NA61-SHINE data, labeled as percolation threshold or onset of fireball. This would be closely related to the vicinity of the hadronic phase transition region.
