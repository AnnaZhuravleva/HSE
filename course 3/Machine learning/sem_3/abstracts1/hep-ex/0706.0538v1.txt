MINOS is the first large magnetic detector deep underground and is the first to measure the muon charge ratio with high statistics in the region near 1 TeV.\cite{bib:adamson} An approximate formula for the muon charge ratio can be expressed in terms of $\epsilon_\pi$ = 115 GeV, $\epsilon_K$ = 850 GeV and $\ec$. The implications for K production in the atmosphere will be discussed.
