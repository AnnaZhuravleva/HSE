In this write-up we present the general theory of the signal formation in various detectors. We follow a pedagogical analysis and presentation such that the results could be easily understood and applied by the interested reader to the different detector configurations. We include few applications to gaseous detectors, namely, Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) and micro-pattern gaseous detectors of the Micromegas type.
