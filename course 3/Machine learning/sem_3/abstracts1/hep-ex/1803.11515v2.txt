The Big Bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter; however today matter remains in the Universe. The European Spallation Source neutrino Super Beam's (ESSnuSB) main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the European Spallation Source (ESS) proton linac to produce the world's most intense neutrino beam simultaneously with the 5 MW proton generation for neutron production and measure the parameters of the neutrino oscillation, leading to the determination of the value of ${\delta}CP$. Once it is constructed ESSnuSB project aims to explain the matter/antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. The Cost Action EuroNuNet's (Combining forces for a novel European facility for neutrino-antineutrino symmetry-violation discovery ) major goals are to bring together the European neutrino physicists to study this concept in a spirit of inclusiveness and to impact the priority list of High Energy Physics policy makers and of funding agencies to this new approach to the experimental discovery of leptonic CP violation.
