The light quark $uds$ mesons have been a foundation of our understanding of the strong interaction for decades. New experiments with modern detectors and large data sets are furthering our understanding of the spectrum and dynamics of these states. In this paper, I review several recent results on the spectroscopy of light mesons and discuss the future of this field.
