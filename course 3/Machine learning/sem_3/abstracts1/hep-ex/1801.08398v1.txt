After the discovery of the top quark more than 20 years ago, top quark production cross sections have been meticulously studied. The rich variety of results from the LHC experiments are complemented with increasingly accurate theoretical predictions of heavy quark production and decay. Measurements of the top quark production provide a benchmark test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics and the standard model (SM), constraining at the same time the background in Higgs boson searches as well as extensions beyond the SM. Recent top quark measurements from CMS are reviewed, illustrating past and current experimental methods along with their attained precision. A perspective of top quark physics at the High-Luminosity LHC and at future colliders is briefly given.
