The measurements of the top quark mass given are obtained from ATLAS data taken at proton--proton centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7$ and $8$ TeV. An extraction of the top quark pole mass ($m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{pole}}$) at next-to-leading order (NLO) is presented. This result is obtained from normalised differential cross-sections in the $t\bar{t}\to\mbox{dilepton}$ channel leading to: $m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{pole}} = 173.2 \pm 0.9 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.8 (\mathrm{syst.}) \pm 1.2 (\mathrm{theo.})$ GeV. In addition, measurements of $m_{\mathrm{top}}$ are discussed that are based on the template method performed in three $t\bar{t}$ decay channels. For all results the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. Finally, the 2016 ATLAS combined value of $m_{\mathrm{top}}$ is: $m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.84 \pm 0.34 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.61 (\mathrm{syst.})$ GeV,with a total uncertainty of 0.70 GeV, i.e. a precision of 0.4$\%$.
