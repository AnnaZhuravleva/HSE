An overview of recent ALICE results aimed to understand collective phenomena in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC is presented. These include the centrality dependence of the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distributions of charged pions, kaons, and protons as well as results on anisotropic flow using data from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV. In addition, comparisons between data and model predictions are presented.
