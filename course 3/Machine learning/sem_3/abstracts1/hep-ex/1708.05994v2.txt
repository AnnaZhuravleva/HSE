Kinematic correlations for pairs of beauty hadrons, produced in high energy proton-proton collisions, are studied. The data sample used was collected with the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement is performed using inclusive $b\rightarrow J/\psi X$ decays in the rapidity range $2<y^{J/\psi}<4.5$. The observed correlations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.
