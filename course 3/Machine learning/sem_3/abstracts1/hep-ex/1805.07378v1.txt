Over the last decade, there has been enormous effort to measure neutrino interaction cross sections important to oscillation experiments. However, a number of results from modern experiments appear to be in tension with each other, despite purporting to measure the same processes. The TENSIONS2016 workshop was held at University of Pittsburgh July 24-31, 2016 and was sponsored by the Pittsburgh High Energy Physics, Astronomy, and Cosmology Center (PITT-PACC). The focus was on bringing experimentalists from three experiments together to compare results in detail and try to find the source of tension by clarifying and comparing signal definitions and the analysis strategies used for each measurement. A set of comparisons between the measurements using a consistent set of models was also made. This paper summarizes the main conclusions of that work.
