Using $e^{+}e^{-}$ collision data collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.2 $fb^{-1}$ at center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s}$) from 4.009 to 4.600 GeV, the process $e^{+}e^{-} \to \pi^{0} \pi^{0}\psi(3686)$ is studied for the first time. The corresponding Born cross sections are measured and found to be half of those of the reaction $e^{+}e^{-} \to \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\psi(3686)$. This is consistent with the expectation from isospin symmetry. Furthermore, the Dalitz plots for $\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\psi(3686)$ are accordant with those of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\psi(3686)$ at all energy points, and a neutral analogue to the structure in $\pi^\pm \psi(3686)$ around 4040 MeV/$c^{2}$ first observed at $\sqrt{s}$=4.416 GeV is observed in the isospin neutral mode at the same energy.
