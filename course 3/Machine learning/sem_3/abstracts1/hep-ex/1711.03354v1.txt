A search for resonant absorption of the solar axion by $^{83}\rm{Kr}$ nuclei was performed using the proportional counter installed inside the low-background setup at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory. The obtained model independent upper limit on the combination of isoscalar and isovector axion-nucleon couplings $|g_3-g_0|\leq 8.4\times 10^{-7}$ allowed us to set the new upper limit on the hadronic axion mass of $m_{A}\leq 65$ eV (95\% C.L.) with the generally accepted values $S$=0.5 and $z$=0.56.
