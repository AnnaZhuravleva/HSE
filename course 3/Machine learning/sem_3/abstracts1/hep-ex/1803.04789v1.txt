Using $1.31\times10^9$ $J/\psi$ events collected by the BESIII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider, we search for the process $J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.$ for the first time. In this process, both baryon and lepton number conservation is violated. No signal is found and the upper limit on the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to\Lambda_c^+e^-+c.c.)$ is set to be $6.9\times10^{-8}$ at the 90\% Confidence Level.
