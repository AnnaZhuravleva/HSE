The measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson are presented in the H$\rightarrow$ZZ$\rightarrow$4$\ell$ ($\ell$=e,$\mu$) decay channel using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC. The signal-strength modifier $\mu$, defined as the production cross section of the Higgs boson times its branching fraction to four leptons relative to the standard model expectation, is measured to be $\mu=1.05^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$ at $m_{\mathrm{H}}=125.09~\mathrm{GeV}$. Constraints are set on the strength modifiers for the main Higgs boson production modes. The mass is measured to be $m_{\mathrm{H}}=125.26 \pm 0.21~\mathrm{GeV}$ and the width is constrained using on-shell production to be $\Gamma_{\mathrm{H}}<1.10~\mathrm{GeV}$, at $95\%$ CL. The fiducial cross section is measured to be $2.90^{+0.48}_{-0.44}({\rm stat.})^{+0.27}_{-0.22}({\rm sys.})~{\mathrm{fb}}$, which is compatible with the standard model prediction of $2.72\pm0.14~{\mathrm{fb}}$.
