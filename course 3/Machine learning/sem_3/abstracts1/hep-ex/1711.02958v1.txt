Many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics predict a parallel sector of a new U(1) symmetry, giving rise to hidden photons. These hidden photons are candidate particles for cold dark matter. They are expected to kinetically mix with regular photons, which leads to a tiny oscillating electric-field component accompanying dark matter particles. A conducting surface can convert such dark matter particles into photons which are emitted almost perpendicularly to the surface. The corresponding photon frequency follows from the mass of the hidden photons. In this contribution we present a preliminary result on a hidden photon search in the visible and near-UV wavelength range that was done with a large, 14 m2 spherical metallic mirror and discuss future dark matter searches in the eV and sub-eV range by application of different detectors for electromagnetic radiation.
