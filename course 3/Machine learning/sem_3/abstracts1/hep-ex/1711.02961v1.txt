It has been proposed that an additional U(1) sector of hidden photons could account for the Dark Matter observed in the Universe. When passing through an interface of materials with different dielectric properties, hidden photons can give rise to photons whose wavelengths are related to the mass of the hidden photons. In this contribution we report on measurements covering the visible and near-UV spectrum that were done with a large, 14 m2 spherical metallic mirror and discuss future dark-matter searches in the eV and sub-eV range by application of different electromagnetic radiation detectors.
