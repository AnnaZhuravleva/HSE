This Letter reports the first scientific results from the observation of antineutrinos emitted by fission products of $^{235}$U at the High Flux Isotope Reactor. PROSPECT, the Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, consists of a segmented 4 ton $^6$Li-doped liquid scintillator detector covering a baseline range of 7-9 m from the reactor and operating under less than 1 meter water equivalent overburden. Data collected during 33 live-days of reactor operation at a nominal power of 85 MW yields a detection of 24608 $\pm$ 277 (stat.) inverse beta decays. Observation of reactor antineutrinos can be achieved in PROSPECT at 5$\sigma$ statistical significance within two hours of on-surface reactor-on data-taking. A reactor-model independent analysis of the inverse beta decay prompt energy spectrum as a function of baseline constrains significant portions of the previously allowed sterile neutrino oscillation parameter space at 95% confidence level and disfavors the best fit of the Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly at 98.7% confidence level.
