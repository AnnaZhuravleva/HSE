Recently, three successful antineutrino experiments (Daya Bay, Double Chooz, and RENO) measured the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ using nuclear reactor power plant. However, significant discrepancies were found, both in the absolute flux and spectral shape. In reactor, the neutron have many kinds of energy, and different neutron energy will cause different fission yield. Different fission yield may be the reason for the antineutrino spectrum discrepancies. In this study,neutron spectrum has been expended investigating the possible reasons for the discrepancies. We found that there are no obvious excess from 5 $\sim$ 7 MeV for these isotopes. However, the neutron flux will make the antineutron spectrum decrease in the 7 $\sim$ 8 MeV, and therefor, it will affect the distribution of the antineutrino spectrum, especially at the high energy region.
