The Belle II collaboration operates a substantially upgraded Belle detector at the SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric e+ e- collider. Belle II will start recording collisions at the Upsilon(4S) energy in 2018, aiming to collect by 2025 50 ab^{-1} of data, 50 times more than the Belle experiment. We report prospects for measuring quantities associated with charge-parity violation, with special emphasis on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle phi_3 (gamma) and observables in semileptonic B meson decays associated with the quark-mixing matrix element Vub.
