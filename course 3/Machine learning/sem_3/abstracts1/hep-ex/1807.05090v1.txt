As a colorless probe, direct photons balance the $p_T$ of the away-side jet at leading order. Direct photon-hadron correlations are thus an excellent probe for nuclear structure and QCD effects, including parton energy loss in the Quark-Gluon Plasma. PHENIX has measured $\pi^{0}$ and direct photon-triggered two-particle azimuthal correlations in a variety of collision systems ranging from $p$$+$$p$ to Au+Au at 200 GeV. In $p$$+$Au and $d$$+$Au collisions, no modification of the per-trigger jet yield or away-side correlation width compared to $p$$+$$p$ collisions is observed for direct photon triggered correlations while an increase in the away-side width for $\pi^{0}$ triggered correlations in $p$$+$Au has been measured. In Au+Au collisions, direct photons have been identified statistically as well as using an isolation cut. Combining data sets from different collision systems allows us to quantify the transition from suppression at high $z_T$ $(p_{T,h}/p_{T,\gamma})$ to the enhancement of low $z_T$ particles relative to $p$$+$$p$, and to study this transition as a function of trigger $p_T$.
