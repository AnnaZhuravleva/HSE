NOvA is a long-baseline accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment that is optimized for electron-neutrino appearance measurements. It uses the upgraded NuMI beam from Fermilab and consists of a Far Detector in Ash River, Minnesota and a Near Detector at Fermilab. An accurate prediction of the neutrino flux is key to both oscillation and cross-section measurements. The precisely known neutrino-electron elastic scattering cross section provides an in situ constraint on the absolute flux. This talk discusses the status of the measurement of the rate of neutrino-electron elastic scattering in the NOvA Near Detector.
