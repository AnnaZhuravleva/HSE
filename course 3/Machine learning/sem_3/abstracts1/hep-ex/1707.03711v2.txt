As a community, our goal is to understand the fundamental nature of energy, matter, space, and time, and to apply that knowledge to understand the birth, evolution and fate of the universe. Our scope is broad and we use many tools: accelerator, non-accelerator & cosmological observations, all have a critical role to play. The progress we have made towards our goal, the tools we need to progress further, the opportunities we have for achieving transformational paradigm-altering scientific advances: great discoveries, and the importance of being a united global field to make progress toward our goal are the topics of this talk.
