Single top quarks in the $t$ channel are produced though the electroweak force and are therefore an excellent way to probe the electroweak sector of the standard model with top quark physics. The recent cross section measurement of single top $t$-channel production from the CMS collaboration is presented in this poster. The analyzed data was taken during the LHC Run II in 2015 at a center-of-mass energy of $13\,\textrm{TeV}$. A multivariate classifier is used to distinguish signal and background processes and the cross section is then extracted using a binned maximum-likelihood fit.
