The main goal of the future MPD experiment at NICA is to explore the QCD phase diagram in the region of highly compressed and hot baryonic matter in the energy range corresponding to the highest chemical potential. Properties of such dense matter can be studied using azimuthal anisotropy which is categorized by the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distribution decomposition. Performance of the detector response based on simulations with realistic reconstruction procedure is presented for centrality determination, reaction plane estimation, directed and elliptic flow coefficients.
