Two-particle angular correlations are studied in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=\,13\,$TeV, collected with the LHCb detector at the LHC. The LHCb detector provides measurement in the very forward region, $2 < \eta < 5$. This region is complementary to other experiments and allows to explore low Bjorken-$x$ region. The correlations are studied as a function of difference in pseudorapidity $\left(\Delta\eta\right)$ and azimuthal angle $\left(\Delta\phi\right)$ in several $p_T$ and activity classes. Proton-proton collisions are studied using two datasets corresponding to minimum-bias sample and a sample obtained via a dedicated trigger to study the highest-activity events.
