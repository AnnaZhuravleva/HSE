The searches for Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment using data collected during proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV in 2016 are presented. The decay modes of the Higgs boson that are discussed here correspond to the $H \rightarrow ZZ^{*}$, $H \rightarrow WW^{*}$, $H \rightarrow \tau\tau$ and $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ channels.
