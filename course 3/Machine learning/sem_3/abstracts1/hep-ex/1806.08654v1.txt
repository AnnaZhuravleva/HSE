Using 1.63 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by the KLOE experiment about $7\times 10^4$ $K_S \rightarrow \pi^{\pm}e^{\mp}\nu$ decays have been reconstructed. The measured value of the charge asymmetry for this decay is $A_S = (-4.9 \pm 5.7_{stat} \pm 2.6_{syst}) \times 10^{-3}$, which is almost twice more precise than the previous KLOE result. The combination of these two measurements gives $A_S = (-3.8 \pm 5.0_{stat} \pm 2.6_{syst}) \times 10^{-3}$ and, together with the asymmetry of the $K_L$ semileptonic decay, provides significant tests of the CP T symmetry. The obtained results are in agreement with CPT invariance.
