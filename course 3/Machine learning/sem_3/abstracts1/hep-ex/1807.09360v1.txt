We present the measurement of the charge-dependent 3-particle azimuthal correlation for unidentified charged particles in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in ALICE. The results are compared with corresponding results from Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. We observe no significant difference in the charge-sensitive 3-particle correlator ($\gamma_{112}$) between the two collision energies. Charged-dependent mixed-harmonic correlator ($\gamma_{132}$) is also presented and compared with the predictions from a blast-wave model incorporating local charge conservation.
