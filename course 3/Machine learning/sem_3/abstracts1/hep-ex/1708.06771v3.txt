This paper reports the first differential measurement of the charged-current interaction cross section of $\nu_{\mu}$ on water with no pions in the final state. This flux-averaged measurement has been made using the T2K experiment's off-axis near detector, and is reported in doubly-differential bins of muon momentum and angle. The flux-averaged total cross section in a restricted region of phase space was found to be $ \sigma= (0.95 \pm 0.08 (\mbox{stat}) \pm 0.06 (\mbox{det. syst.}) \pm 0.04(\mbox{model syst.}) \pm{} 0.08(\mbox{flux}) ) \times 10^{-38} \mbox{cm}^2$ per n.
