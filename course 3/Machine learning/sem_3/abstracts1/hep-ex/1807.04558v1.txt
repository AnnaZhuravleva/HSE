Two-particle number and transverse momentum correlations are powerful tools for studying the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Correlations in the angular separation of pairs of hadrons can provide information on the medium transport characteristics. In particular, the transverse momentum correlations are sensitive to momentum currents, and provide information about the system life time, the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\eta/s$) and the system relaxation time ($\tau_{\pi}$). Furthermore, the interaction of the jets produced in the initial stages of a collision can be studied using number correlations, by observing the medium-induced modification of the near-side jet peak. Measurements of both sets of correlations from Pb-Pb collisions are reported as a function of centrality. Theoretical interpretations and results from Monte Carlo generators are then confronted with the experimental data.
