After many years of searches, the Higgs boson was observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in July 2012. Since then, its properties have been measured using primarily the bosonic decay channels: $H \to \gamma\gamma $, $H \to Z Z$, $H \to W^+ W^-$. In order to probe the predictions of the Standard Model and the nature of the Higgs boson, it is also fundamental to measure its couplings to fermions and, in particular, to quarks. In this paper we present the ATLAS results in the search for the Higgs boson decaying to b-quark pairs using two different production channels: associated production with a vector boson and vector boson fusion with an additional hard photon, using 36.1 $\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ the $pp$ collisions delivered by the LHC at a center of mass energy of 13 $\mathrm{TeV}$.
