Recent literature on deep neural networks for tagging of highly energetic jets resulting from top quark decays has focused on image based techniques or multivariate approaches using high-level jet substructure variables. Here, a sequential approach to this task is taken by using an ordered sequence of jet constituents as training inputs. Unlike the majority of previous approaches, this strategy does not result in a loss of information during pixelisation or the calculation of high level features. The jet classification method achieves a background rejection of 45 at a 50% efficiency operating point for reconstruction level jets with transverse momentum range of 600 to 2500 GeV and is insensitive to multiple proton-proton interactions at the levels expected throughout Run 2 of the LHC.
