We present and discuss some experimental approaches involving spectroscopy from heavy meson decays going to light mesons. In particular we emphasis the scalar resonance $f_0(980)$, which have different well determined parameter of mass and width obtained from $J/\psi$ and D decays. We will also show how the CP violation observed in charmless three body decay can be used as tool to understand hadron hadron interaction at low mass region
