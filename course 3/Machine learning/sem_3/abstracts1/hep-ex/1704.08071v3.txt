The NA61/SHINE fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS studies the onset of deconfinement and searches for the critical point of strongly interacting matter by measuring hadron production as a function of the collision energy and the colliding system size.   This contribution summarises recent results on hadron spectra and fluctuations, in particular new results on charged kaon production in $^7$Be+$^9$Be collisions. Also an overview of the proposed future program of NA61/SHINE is presented.
