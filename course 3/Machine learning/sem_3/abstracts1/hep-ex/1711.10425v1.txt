The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle discovered at the Fermilab Tevatron more than twenty years ago, has taken a central role in the study of fundamental interactions. Due to its large mass, the top quark provides a unique environment for tests of the standard model. With a cumulative luminosity of more than 100~fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\sqrt{s}=7,8,13$ TeV by each of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in the first ten years of operation, top quark physics is probing uncharted territories in precision and rare measurements with sensitivity to New Physics processes. This document summarizes the latest experimental measurements and studies of top quark properties.
