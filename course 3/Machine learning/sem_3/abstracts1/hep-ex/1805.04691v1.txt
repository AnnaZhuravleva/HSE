A measurement of the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of dijet azimuthal decorrelations is presented, using the quantity $R_{\Delta \phi}$. The quantity $R_{\Delta \phi}$ specifies the fraction of the inclusive dijet events in which the azimuthal opening angle of the two jets with the highest transverse momenta is less than a given value of the parameter $\Delta \phi_\mathrm{max}$. The quantity $R_{\Delta \phi}$ is measured in proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$8 TeV as a function of the dijet rapidity interval, the event total scalar transverse momentum, and $\Delta \phi_\mathrm{max}$. The measurement uses an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Predictions of a perturbative QCD calculation at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling with corrections for non-perturbative effects are compared to the data. The theoretical predictions describe the data in the whole kinematic region. The data are used to determine the strong coupling $\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}$ and to study its running for momentum transfers from 260 GeV to above 1.6 TeV. An analysis that combines data at all momentum transfers results in $\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}(m_{Z}) = 0.1127^{+0.0063}_{-0.0027}$.
