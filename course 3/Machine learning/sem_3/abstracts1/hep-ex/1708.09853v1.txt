In this talk we present a selection of forward physics results recently obtained with the run-1 and run-2 LHC data by the CMS, LHCf and TOTEM experiments. The status of the very forward LHC proton spectrometer, CT-PPS, is discussed: emphasis is given to the physics potential of CT-PPS and to the analyses that are currently ongoing with the data collected in 2016. Very recent forward measurements obtained with the LHCf and the CMS-CASTOR calorimeter are then addressed. In particular, CMS measured the inclusive energy spectrum in the very forward direction for proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and the jet cross sections for p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. The LHCf experiment has instead recently published the inclusive energy spectra of forward photons for pp collisions at 13 TeV. Finally, the new measurements of the total, elastic and inelastic cross sections obtained by the TOTEM collaboration at 2.76 and 13 TeV center of mass energy are presented.
