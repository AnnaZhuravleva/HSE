This paper summarises a few selected topics discussed during Working Group 5 of the Deep Inelastic Scattering 2017 conference, Physics with Heavy Flavours, related to the study of charm, bottom, and top quark physics. While the programme of this Working Group was structured by thematic areas, this conference was the occasion for intense cross-pollination between traditionally disjoint research lines. The four LHC experiments all contribute to heavy-flavour physics, with some degree of overlap in most areas, while experiments at other accelerators provide vital input in complimentary kinematic regions. Theorists now have the possibility to take inputs from more sources, and experimentalists focus on measurements that maximise utility. The interplay of LHC heavy quark cross-section measurements with DIS expertise is greatly improving PDF precision, leading to much improved models that, amongst other things, better inform the prospects for future colliders.
