In this contribution we present opportunities to address questions about the origin of mass and spin, probe the existence and nature of the LHCb pentaquark state, and probe the color Van der Waal forces among two color neutral hadrons. The key reaction is elastic production of heavy quarkonia (J/psi and Upsilon) on the nucleon from threshold to large nucleon-quarkonium invariant masses. This is possible when combining the energy range of two high luminosity facilities, Jefferson Lab 12 GeV and an electron ion collider (EIC).
