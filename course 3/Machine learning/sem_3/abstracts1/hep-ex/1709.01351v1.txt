The identification of hadronic tau lepton decays is an important requirement for the LHC physics program, both in terms of standard model measurements and the search for beyond-the-standard-model physics. The ATLAS and CMS algorithms for identification and energy calibration of hadronic tau lepton decays are conceptually different. They are described together with measurements of relevant performance figures.
