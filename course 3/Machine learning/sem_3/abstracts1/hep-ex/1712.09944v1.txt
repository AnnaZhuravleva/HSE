The Flavor Changing Neutral Current mediated decays $B \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and $B^{0} \rightarrow K^{*0}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ provide high sensitivity to new physics contributions. Sensitive observables include the branching fraction, the muon forward-backward asymmetry, the fraction of $K^{*0}$ longitudinal polarisation and the differential branching fraction. We report herein the recent results from CMS on these decay modes.
