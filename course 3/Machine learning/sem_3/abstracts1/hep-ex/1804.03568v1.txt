Results of a search for gluino pair production with subsequent R-parity-violating decays to quarks are presented. This search uses 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at the LHC. The analysis is performed using requirements on the number of jets and the number of jets tagged as containing a $b$-hadron as well as a topological observable formed by the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets in the event. No significant excess above the expected Standard Model background is observed. Limits are set on the production of gluinos in models with the R-parity-violating decays of either the gluino itself (direct decay) or the neutralino produced in the R-parity-conserving gluino decay (cascade decay). In the gluino cascade decay model, gluinos with masses between 1000 GeV and 1875 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the neutralino mass. For the gluino direct decay model, the 95% confidence level upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio varies between 0.80 fb at $m_{\tilde{g}}$ = 900 GeV and 0.011 fb at $m_{\tilde{g}}$ = 1800 GeV.
