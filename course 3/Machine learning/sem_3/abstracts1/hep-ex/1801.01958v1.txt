The product of the electronic width of the $J/\psi$ meson and the branching fractions of its decay to hadrons and electrons has been measured using the KEDR detector at the VEPP-4M $e^+e^-$ collider. The obtained values are: $\Gamma_{ee}(J/\psi) = 5.550 \pm 0.056 \pm 0.089 \, \text{keV}, $ $\Gamma_{ee}(J/\psi) \cdot \mathcal{B}_\text{hadrons}(J/\psi) = 4.884 \pm 0.048 \pm 0.078 \, \text{keV}, $ $\Gamma_{ee}(J/\psi) \cdot \mathcal{B}_{ee}(J/\psi) = 0.3331 \pm 0.0066 \pm 0.0040 \, \text{keV}.$ The uncertainties shown are statistical and systematic, respectively. Using the result presented and the world-average value of the electronic branching fraction, one obtains the total width of the $J/\psi$ meson: $\Gamma = 92.94 \pm 1.83 \, \text{keV}.$ These results are consistent with the previous experiments.
