We report on the first measurement of exclusive single-photon muoproduction on the proton by COMPASS using 160 GeV/$c$ polarized $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ beams of the CERN SPS impinging on a liquid hydrogen target. We determine the dependence of the average of the measured $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ cross sections for deeply virtual Compton scattering on the squared four-momentum transfer $t$ from the initial to the final final proton. The slope $B$ of the $t$-dependence is fitted with a single exponential function, which yields $B=(4.3 \ \pm \ 0.6_{\text{stat}}\_{- \ 0.3}^{+ \ 0.1}\big\rvert_{\text{sys}}) (\text{GeV}/c)^{-2}$. This result can be converted into an average transverse extension of partons in the proton, $\sqrt{\langle r_{\perp}^2 \rangle} = (0.58 \ \pm \ 0.04_{\text{stat}}\_{- \ 0.02}^{+ \ 0.01}\big\rvert_{\text{sys}})\text{fm}$. For this measurement, the average virtuality of the photon mediating the interaction is $\langle Q^2 \rangle = 1.8\,(\text{GeV/}c)^2$ and the average value of the Bjorken variable is $\langle x_{\text{Bj}} \rangle = 0.056$.
