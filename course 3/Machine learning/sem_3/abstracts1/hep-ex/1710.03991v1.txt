The main aim of the LHCf experiment is to provide precise measurements of the production spectra relative to neutral particle produced by high energy proton-ion collisions in the very forward region. This information is necessary in order to test and tune hadronic interaction models used by ground-based cosmic rays experiments. In order to reach this goal, LHCf makes use of two small sampling calorimeters installed in the LHC tunnel at $\pm 140$ m from IP1, able to detect neutral particles having pseudo-rapidity $\eta > 8.4$. In this paper we will present the current status of the LHCf experiment, regarding in particular the first analysis results from data taking relative to p-p collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 13 TeV.
