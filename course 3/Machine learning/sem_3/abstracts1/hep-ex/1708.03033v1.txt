We present a search for new high mass phenomena using the latest data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The search is conducted for both resonant and non-resonant new phenomena in dimuon final states. The dimuon invariant mass spectrum is the discriminating variable used in the search. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are observed. Lower limits are set on the signal parameters of interest at 95% credibility level, using a Bayesian interpretation. In particular, a Sequential Standard Model Z' resonance is excluded for masses below 4.0 TeV.
