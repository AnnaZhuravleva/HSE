In the polarised Drell-Yan experiment at the COMPASS facility at CERN the beam of negatively-charged pions with 190 GeV/c momentum and intensity about $10^8$ pions/s interacted with transversely polarised NH$_3$ target. Muon pairs produced in Drell-Yan process (DY) were detected. Recently, the first ever Transverse Spin Asymmetries (TSAs) measurement in DY has been presented by COMPASS. A complementary analysis of the TSAs weighted by powers of the dimuon transverse momentum $q_T$ are presented. In the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) PDF formalism, the $q_T$-weighted TSAs can be written in terms of products of the TMD PDFs of two colliding hadrons, unlike the conventional TSAs, which are their convolutions over quarks transverse momenta. The results are compared in a straightforward way with the weighted Sivers asymmetry in the SIDIS process, released by COMPASS in 2016.
