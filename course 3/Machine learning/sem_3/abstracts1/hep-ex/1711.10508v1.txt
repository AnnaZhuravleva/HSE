We present the first search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) produced with large transverse momentum ($\mathrm{p_{T}}$) via gluon fusion and decaying to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$). The search is performed using a data set of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{\mathrm{-1}}$. A highly Lorentz-boosted Higgs boson decaying to $\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ is reconstructed as a single, large radius jet and is identified using jet substructure and dedicated b tagging techniques. The method is validated with the first observation of the Z$\rightarrow\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ process in the single-jet topology, with a local significance of 5.1 standard deviations (5.8 expected).
