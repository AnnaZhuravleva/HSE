We report on an improved measurement of the $^8$B solar neutrino interaction rate with the Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Neutrinos are detected via their elastic scattering on electrons in a large, radio-pure liquid scintillator target. Novel analysis approaches exploiting most of the active volume of the detector have enabled the collection of data from 1.5 kt$\cdot$y exposure between 2008 and 2016. The measured rate of solar neutrino-induced, scattered electrons above 3 MeV of energy is $0.220\substack{+0.015 \\ -0.016}\,(stat)\,\substack{+0.006 \\ -0.006}\,(syst)$~cpd/100~t, which corresponds to an observed solar neutrino flux assuming no neutrino flavor conversion of 2.55$\substack{+0.17 \\ -0.19}(stat)\substack{+0.07\\ -0.07}(syst)\times$10$^6$~cm$^{-2}\,$s$^{-1}$. If one assumes the $^8$B solar neutrino flux predicted by the high metallicity Standard Solar Model, the average $^8$B solar $\nu_e$ survival probability is 0.36$\pm$0.08 at the mean visible energy of 7.9~MeV, in good agreement with the MSW-LMA
