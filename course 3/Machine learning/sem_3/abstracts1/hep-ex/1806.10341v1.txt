With about 12 fb$^{-1}$ collected XYZ data sets, BESIII continues the exploration of the exotic charmonium-like states. In this talk, recent results on the measurements of the spin-parity determination of $Z_{\rm c}(3900)$, as well as on line-shapes of $e^+e^- \rightarrow J/\psi\,\pi\pi, h_{\rm c}\pi\pi, \psi(2S)\,\pi^0\pi^0/\pi^+\pi^-$, and $\pi^+ D^0 D^{*-}$ from open charm are discussed. Also, the recent observation of $e^+ e^- \rightarrow \phi \chi_{c1/2}$ at $\sqrt(s)=4.6$ GeV is reported.
