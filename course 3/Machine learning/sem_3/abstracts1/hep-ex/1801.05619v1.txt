The mass of the top quark is measured using a sample of $\rm{t}\bar{\rm t}$ candidate events with one lepton, muon or electron, and at least four jets in the final state, collected by the CMS detector in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\mathrm{TeV}$ at the CERN LHC. The candidate events are selected from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $35.9~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. For each event the mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a $\rm{t}\bar{\rm t}$ hypothesis. The top quark mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in $\rm{q}\bar{\rm q}$ decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be $172.25\pm 0.08\,\rm{(stat+JSF)} \pm 0.62\,\rm{(syst)}~\mathrm{GeV}$. The dependence of this result on event kinematical properties is studied and compared to predictions of different models of $\rm{t}\bar{\rm t}$ production.
