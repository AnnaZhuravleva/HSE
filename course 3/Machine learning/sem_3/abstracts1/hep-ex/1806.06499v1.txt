Limits on the cross section for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scattering off nucleons in the NaI(Tl) detectors at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory are obtained with a 2967.4 kg*day data exposure. Nuclei recoiling are identified by the pulse shape of scintillating photon signals. Data are consistent with no nuclear recoil hypothesis, and 90% confidence level upper limits are set. These limits partially exclude the DAMA/LIBRA region of WIMP-sodium interaction with the same NaI(Tl) target detector. This 90% confidence level upper limit on WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section is 3.26*10^-4 pb for a WIMP mass at 10 GeV/c^2.
