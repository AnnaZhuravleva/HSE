ALICE at the LHC has a unique potential to study proton-proton collisions with the goal to probe Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD). The apparatus was designed to reconstruct particles over a large range in transverse momentum and rapidity. In particular, quarkonia are very interesting probes of QCD, because their production mechanisms are governed by both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD processes. In ALICE, quarkonia are reconstructed via their dilepton decay channel down to zero transverse momentum. This contribution gives a short overview of quarkonium production results in proton-proton collisions with ALICE and a comparison to other experimental results and to theoretical models.
