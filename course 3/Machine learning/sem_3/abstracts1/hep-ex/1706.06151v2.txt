The modelling of minimum bias interactions is a crucial ingredient to learn about the description of soft QCD processes. It has also a significant relevance for the simulation of the environment at the LHC with many concurrent pp interactions (pileup). The ATLAS collaboration has provided new measurements of the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity and its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity in special data sets with low LHC beam currents, recorded at center of mass energies of 8 TeV and 13 TeV. The measurements use charged-particle selections with minimum transverse momentum of both 100 MeV and 500 MeV, and various phase-space regions characterized by low and high charged-particle multiplicities.
