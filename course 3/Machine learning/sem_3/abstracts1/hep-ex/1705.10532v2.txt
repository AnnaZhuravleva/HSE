A search is reported for a narrow vector resonance decaying to quark-antiquark pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 inverse femtobarns. The vector resonance is produced at large transverse momenta, with its decay products merged into a single jet. The resulting signature is a peak over background in the distribution of the invariant mass of the jet. The results are interpreted in the framework of a leptophobic vector resonance and no evidence is found for such particles in the mass range of 100-300 GeV. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on the production cross section are presented in a region of mass-coupling phase space previously unexplored at the LHC. The region below 140 GeV has not been explored by any previous experiments.
