The KLOE-2 detector records decays of quantum-entangled pairs of neutral kaons produced in decays of phi mesons provided by the DAFNE accelerator at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, Italy. This system allows for a broad range of studies of fundamental discrete symmetries including tests which are only feasible with entangled neutral mesons. This work reports on the Lorentz non-invariance and CPT violation searches with the KSKL->pi+pi-pi+pi- process in the framework of the Standard Model Extension. Moreover, status and results of quantum coherence tests with the same process are discussed. Finally, the status of ongoing direct tests of T and CPT in neutral kaon transitions is presented. For each of thereported studies, perspectives are discussed for the KLOE-2 experiment, which is presently taking data.
