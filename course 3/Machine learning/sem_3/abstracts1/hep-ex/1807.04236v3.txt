We report measurements of isospin asymmetry $\Delta_{0-}$ and difference of direct $CP$ asymmetries $\Delta A_{CP}$ between charged and neutral $B \to X_s \gamma$ decays. This analysis is based on the data sample containing $772 \times 10^6 B\bar{B}$ pairs that was collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB energy-asymmetric $e^+ e^-$ collider. Using a sum-of-exclusive technique with invariant $X_s$ mass up to 2.8~GeV/$c^2$, we obtain $\Delta_{0-} = \bigl[+1.70 \pm 1.39 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.87 {\rm (syst.)} \pm 1.15 {(f_{+-}/f_{00})}\bigr]$\% and $\Delta A_{CP} = \bigl[+1.26 \pm 2.40 {\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.67{\rm (syst.)}\bigr]$\%, where the last uncertainty for $\Delta_{0-}$ is due to the uncertainty on the fraction of $B^+B^-$ to $B^0\bar{B}^0$ production in $\Upsilon(4S)$ decays. The measured value of $\Delta_{0-}$ is consistent with zero, allowing to constrain the resolved photon contributions in the $B \to X_s \gamma$ decay as well as to improve the branching fraction prediction. The result for $\Delta A_{CP}$ is consistent with a prediction of the SM. We also measure the direct $CP$ asymmetries for charged and neutral $B \to X_s \gamma$ decays. All the measurements are the most precise to date.
