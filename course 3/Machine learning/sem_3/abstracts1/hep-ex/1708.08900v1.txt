Searches for rare and exotic Higgs decays using proton-proton collision data with the center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector are presented. Various final states are considered. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectations are found. The results are interpreted in different Beyond Standard Model theories.
