Recent measurements of top quark properties with ${\rm t{\bar t}}$ events collected by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=8$ and $13$ TeV, are presented. The measurements of the top quark width, spin and spin correlations, polarisation, the $W$ boson helicity fractions, charge and CP asymmetries are discussed. Finally, recent results obtained on colour flow effects in ${\rm t{\bar t}}$ events are presented. All the measurements are consistent with the Standard Model expectations.
