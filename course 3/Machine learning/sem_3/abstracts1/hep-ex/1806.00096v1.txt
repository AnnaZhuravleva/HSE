We present updated results from the NOvA experiment for $\nu_\mu\rightarrow\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\mu\rightarrow\nu_e$ oscillations from an exposure of $8.85\times10^{20}$ protons on target, which represents an increase of 46% compared to our previous publication. The results utilize significant improvements in both the simulations and analysis of the data. A joint fit to the data for $\nu_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e$ appearance gives the best fit point as normal mass hierarchy, $\Delta m^2_{32} = 2.44\times 10^{-3}{{\rm eV}^2}/c^4$, $\sin^2\theta_{23} = 0.56$, and $\delta_{CP} = 1.21\pi$. The 68.3% confidence intervals in the normal mass hierarchy are $\Delta m^2_{32} \in [2.37,2.52]\times 10^{-3}{{\rm eV}^2}/c^4$, $\sin^2\theta_{23} \in [0.43,0.51] \cup [0.52,0.60]$, and $\delta_{CP} \in [0,0.12\pi] \cup [0.91\pi,2\pi]$. The inverted mass hierarchy is disfavored at the 95% confidence level for all choices of the other oscillation parameters.
