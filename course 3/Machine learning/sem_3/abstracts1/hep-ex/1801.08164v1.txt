In many models with extended Higgs sectors, $e.g.$ 2HDM, NMSSM, there exists a light scalar $h$, lighter than the Standard Model (SM) like Higgs, and the coupling of $hZZ$ can be very small, as expected from the likeness of the 125 GeV Higgs boson measured at the LHC to the SM Higgs boson. Such a light scalar with suppressed couplings to the $Z$ boson would have escaped detection at LEP due to its limited luminosity. With a factor of 1000 higher luminosity and polarized beams, the International Linear Collider (ILC) is expected to have substantial discovery potential for such states. Furthermore, searches for additional scalars at LEP and LHC are usually dependent on the model details, such as decay channels. Thus, it is necessary to have a more general analysis with model-independent assumptions.   In this work, we perform a search for a light higgs boson produced in association with $Z$ boson at the ILC with a center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV, using the full Geant4-based simulation of the ILD detector concept. In order to be as model-independent as possible, the analysis is performed using the recoil technique, in particular with the $Z$ boson decaying into a pair of muons. As a preliminary result, the ILC's exclusion limits will be shown for different higgs masses between 30 and 115 GeV.
