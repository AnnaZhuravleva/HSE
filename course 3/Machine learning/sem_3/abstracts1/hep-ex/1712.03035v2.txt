As a part of the homage on Guido Altarelli, summarised in the book "From my vast repertoire - the legacy of Guido Altarelli" edited by S. Forte, A. Levy and G. Ridolfi, this contribution collects some of the technological and scientific highlights of precision physics at LEP, the Large Electron-Positron collider operated, from 1989 to 2000, at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, CERN.
