A search for the charmless $B^{0}_{s} \to \eta^{\prime}\phi$ decay is performed using $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. No signal is observed and upper limits on the $B^{0}_{s} \to \eta^{\prime}\phi$ branching fraction are set to $0.82\times 10^{-6}$ at $90\%$ and $1.01\times 10^{-6}$ at $95\%$ confidence level.
