Measurements of normalized differential cross sections for top quark pair production are performed in the dilepton decay channels in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The differential cross sections are measured with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. We have measured the cross sections differentially as a function of the kinematic properties of the leptons (electron or muon), jets from bottom quark hadronization, top quarks, and top quark pairs at the particle and parton levels. The $t\bar{t}$ differential cross section measurements are compared to several Monte Carlo generators that implement calculations up to next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics interfaced with parton showering, and also to fixed-order theoretical calculations of top quark pair production beyond next-to-leading order accuracy.
