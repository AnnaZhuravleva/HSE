Due to the large production cross-section, many of the top quark properties can be measured very precisely at the LHC. A very few recent results, probed only through the top quark decay vertices are presented here. These results are based on proton-proton collision datasets recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at sqrt(s)=7, 8 and 13 TeV. All the measurements and observed limits are consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions, while strong bounds on anomalous Wtb couplings are established.
