The exclusive Born cross sections of the production of $D^0$, $D^+$ and $D_s^+$ mesons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at 13 energy points between 3.970 and 4.260 GeV are obtained by applying corrections for initial state radiation and vacuum polarization to the observed cross sections measured by CLEO-c experiment. Both the statistical and the systematic uncertainties for the obtained Born cross sections are properly estimated.
