The Monte Carlo (MC) setups used by ATLAS to model boson$+\mathrm{jets}$ and multi-boson processes at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in proton-proton collisions are described. Comparisons between data and several event generators are provided for key kinematic distributions. Issues associated with the evaluation of systematic uncertainties are also discussed. This proceeding is a summary of the results collected in two recent ATLAS PUB notes published for the MC workshop jointly-organised by the the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations and held at CERN in May 2017.
