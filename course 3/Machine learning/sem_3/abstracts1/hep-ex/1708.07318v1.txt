The latest results of high mass searches for new physics in a variety of final states from the CMS and ATLAS collaborations are presented. These searches are based on $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collisions data at the LHC collected in the year 2016 and 2015. No excess above expectation from Standard Model processes are observed and exclusion limits are set at the 95% confidence level on various benchmark models.
