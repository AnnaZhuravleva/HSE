Based on a sample of $1.31\times10^9$ $J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector, the matrix elements for the decays $\eta^{\prime}\to\eta\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\eta^{\prime}\to\eta \pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ are determined using 351,016 $\eta^{\prime}\to(\eta\to\gamma\gamma)\pi^+\pi^-$ and 56,249 $\eta^{\prime}\to(\eta\to\gamma\gamma)\pi^0\pi^0$ events with background levels less than 1\%. Two commonly used representations are used to describe the Dalitz plot density. We find that an assumption of a linear amplitude does not describe the data well. A small deviation of the obtained matrix elements between $\eta^{\prime}\to\eta\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $\eta^{\prime}\to\eta \pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is probably caused by the mass difference between charged and neutral pions or radiative corrections. No cusp structure in $\eta^{\prime}\to\eta \pi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is observed.
