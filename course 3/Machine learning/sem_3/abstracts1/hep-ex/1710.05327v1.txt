Searches for physics beyond the standard model are considered one of the corner stones of the physics program at the two multipurpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS, at the LHC. Both experiments have conducted numerous searches for new supersymmetric particles in a wide variety of final states at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The datasets discussed in these proceedings consist of 36 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions collected during the 2016 run of the LHC. No signs of new physics are found, however, limits on different supersymmetric scenarios are placed and extend previous exclusion regions from 7 and 8 TeV by several hundred GeV.
