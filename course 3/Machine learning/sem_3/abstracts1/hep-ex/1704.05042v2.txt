Searches for double beta decay of $^{134}$Xe were performed with EXO-200, a single-phase liquid xenon detector designed to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe. Using an exposure of $29.6\text{ kg}\!\cdot\!\text{yr}$, the lower limits of $\text{T}_{1/2}^{2\nu\beta\!\beta}>8.7\cdot10^{20}\text{ yr}$ and $\text{T}_{1/2}^{0\nu\beta\!\beta}>1.1\cdot10^{23}\text{ yr}$ at 90% confidence level were derived, with corresponding half-life sensitivities of $1.2\cdot10^{21}\text{ yr}$ and $1.9\cdot10^{23}\text{ yr}$. These limits exceed those in the literature for $^{134}$Xe, improving by factors of nearly $10^{5}$ and 2 for the two antineutrino and neutrinoless modes, respectively.
