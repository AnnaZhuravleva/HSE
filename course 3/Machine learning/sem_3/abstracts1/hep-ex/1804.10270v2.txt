Searches for baryon number violation are expected to play an important role in the evolution of our understanding of beyond standard model physics, including searches for proton decay and neutron-antineutron transformation. The latter is a key prediction of certain popular theories of baryogenesis, and experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment and the European Spallation Source plan to search for this process with bound- and free-neutron systems, respectively. Accurate simulation of this process in Monte Carlo will be important for proper reconstruction of these rare events. This article presents recent developments towards accurate simulation of the annihilation process for use in a cold, free-neutron beam for neutron-antineutron searches from antineutron annihilation on carbon nuclei, as carbon is the target of choice for the European Spallation Source's NNbar collaboration. Initial efforts are made in this paper to perform analogous studies for intranuclear transformation searches in argon nuclei, although this latter work is in its preliminary stages. Such future work looks forward to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment's searches for intranuclear neutron-antineutron transformation.
