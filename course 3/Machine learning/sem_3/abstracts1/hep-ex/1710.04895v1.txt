The most recent results of Standard Model physics using 8 and 13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector during the LHC Runs I and II are reviewed. This overview includes studies of several results of vector boson production in association with jets. The outlined results are compared to the corresponding theoretical predictions and no significant deviation is observed.
