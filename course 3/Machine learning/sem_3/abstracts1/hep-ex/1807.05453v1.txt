We study the impact of picosecond precision timing detection systems on the LHC experiments' long-lived particle search program during the HL-LHC era. We develop algorithms that allow us to reconstruct the mass of such charged particles and perform particle identification using the time-of-flight measurement. We investigate the reach for benchmark scenarios as a function of the timing resolution, and find sensitivity improvement of up to a factor of 10, depending on the new heavy particle mass.
