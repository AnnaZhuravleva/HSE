Many physics signals presently studied at the high energy collision experiments lead to final states with jets originating from heavy flavor quarks. This report reviews the algorithms for heavy flavor jets identification developed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in view of the Run2 data taking period at the Large Hadron Collider. The improvements of the algorithms used in 2015 and 2016 data analyses with respect to previous data taking periods are discussed, as well as the ongoing developments in view of the next years of data taking. The measurements of the performance of the algorithms on data as well as the dedicated techniques for the identification of heavy flavor jets in events with boosted topologies are also presented. Finally, the effectiveness of heavy flavor jet identification in the complex environment expected during the high luminosity LHC phase is discussed.
