We present measurements of hadronic resonance, strange and multi-strange particle production in collisions of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb at the center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ and $5.02$ TeV, respectively, by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC. Particle ratios are presented as a function of multiplicity for $K^{0}_{s}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$, $\rho(770)^{0}$, $K^{\ast}(892)^{0}$, $\phi(1020)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$. Our results are discussed and compared with predictions of QCD-inspired event generators. Additionally, comparisons with lower energy measurements and smaller systems are also presented.
