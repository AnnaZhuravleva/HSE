The performance of the missing transverse momentum (E$_{T}^{miss}$) reconstruction with the ATLAS detector is evaluated using data collected in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in 2015. To reconstruct E$_{T}^{miss}$, fully calibrated electrons, muons, photons, hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons, and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various E$_{T}^{miss}$ contributions. The individual terms as well as the overall reconstructed E$_{T}^{miss}$ are evaluated with various performance metrics for scale (linearity), resolution, and sensitivity to the data-taking conditions. The method developed to determine the systematic uncertainties of the E$_{T}^{miss}$ scale and resolution is discussed. Results are shown based on the full 2015 data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$.
