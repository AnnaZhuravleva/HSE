Searches for high-mass resonances decaying to pairs of standard model bosons using ATLAS and CMS detectors are presented. The searches use 15 - 36 $\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the LHC. Many different final states have been considered and the results are interpreted in a range of theories beyond the standard model of particle physics, most common being heavy vector triplet and warped extra dimensions.
