The strong force is responsible for a rich set of phenomena that can be probed using a variety of techniques over a wide energy and angular range at the Large Hadron Collider. This talk reports on the latest results from the ATLAS Collaboration that measure the high energy, wide angle, collinear, and soft regimes of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). There is also an important connection between QCD at high energies and electroweak phenomena including massive gauge bosons as well as photons.
