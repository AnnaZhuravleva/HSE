Fast simulation tools are highly appreciated in particle physics phenomenology studies, especially in the exploration of the physics potential of future experimental facilities. The Circular Electron Positron Collider is a proposed Higgs and Z factory that can precisely measure the Higgs boson properties and the electroweak precision observables. A fast-simulation toolkit dedicated to the CEPC detector has been developed using Delphes. The comparison shows that this fast simulation tool is highly consistent with the full simulation, on a set of benchmark distributions. Therefore, we recommend this fast simulation toolkit for CEPC phenomenological investigations.
