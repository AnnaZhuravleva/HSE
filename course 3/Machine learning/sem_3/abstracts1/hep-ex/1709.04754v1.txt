Events containing a pair of high energy hadronic jet can provide clear signatures in the search for new physics at high energy hadron colliders. The ATLAS and CMS experiments collected the data from LHC collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV during 2015 and 2016, looking for evidence of new resonances or deviations from the Standard Model predictions. Althoug no hint of new physics was seen, strong limits have been set on the most interesting benchmark models, improving LHC Run1 reach.
