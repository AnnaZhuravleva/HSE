Searches for direct electroweak production of charginos and neutralinos in signatures with two light leptons of the same charge and with three or more leptons including up to two hadronically decaying {\tau} leptons are presented . The full 2016 dataset of pp collisions recorded by CMS at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 /fb. The observed event rates are in agreement with expectations from the standard model. These results probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to values between 225 and 1150 GeV, depending on the model parameters assumed.
