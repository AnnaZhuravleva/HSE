We present constraints on the WIMP-nucleon effective interaction from the PandaX-II experiment. We consider well-motivated dimensional-four interactions consisting of couplings among vector and axial vector currents, as well as several typical dimension-five and dimension-six operators in effective field theory. The data set corresponding to a total exposure of 54-ton-day is reanalyzed, and limits on the effective couplings have been obtained as a function of the WIMP mass, both in isoscalar and isovector channels. We obtain the most stringent upper limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section of $9.0\times 10^{-42}$cm$^2$ for neutron-only coupling with mass of 40 GeV/$c^2$ at 90% confidence level. Similarly, the minimum constraint on WIMP-proton cross section is $2.2 \times 10^{-38}$cm$^2$.
