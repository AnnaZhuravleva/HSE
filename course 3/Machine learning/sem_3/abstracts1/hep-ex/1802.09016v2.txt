We report the first results of a light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) search from the CDEX-10 experiment with a 10 kg germanium detector array immersed in liquid nitrogen at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory with a physics data size of 102.8 kg day. At an analysis threshold of 160 eVee, improved limits of 8 $\times 10^{-42}$ and 3 $\times 10^{-36}$ cm$^{2}$ at a 90\% confidence level on spin-independent and spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections, respectively, at a WIMP mass ($m_{\chi}$) of 5 GeV/${c}^2$ are achieved. The lower reach of $m_{\chi}$ is extended to 2 GeV/${c}^2$.
