We report here on the results from the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) search with the LUX dark matter experiment. LUX, a two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) with 250 kg of active mass, has been operated from 2012 until 2016. During the operation, we observed no evidence for WIMP elastic scattering events. LUX achieved the most stringent limit on both the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section (1.1$\times{10}^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for a 50 GeV/c${}^{2}$, 90% C.L.) and on the WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross section (1.6$\times{10}^{-41}$ cm$^2$ for a 35 GeV/c${}^{2}$, 90% C.L.).
