The multiplicity dependence of charmed-particle production can unveil new information on processes taking part at the parton level and on the interplay of soft and hard production mechanisms in collisions of relativistic hadrons. In this contribution, we report on multiplicity-differential measurements of $\rm{J}/\psi$ in pp and p-Pb collisions studied by the ALICE Collaboration. Comparisons between measurements at different energies are drawn as well as comparisons with $\rm{D}$ mesons. We also discuss the comparison with different theoretical predictions.
