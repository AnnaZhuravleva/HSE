We search for $CP$ violation in the charged charm meson decay $D^{+}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{0}$, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $\rm 921~fb^{-1}$ collected by the Belle experiment at the KEKB $e^{+}e^{-}$ asymmetric-energy collider. The measured $CP$ violating asymmetry is $[+2.31\pm1.24({\rm stat})\pm0.23({\rm syst})]\%$, which is consistent with the standard model prediction and has a significantly improved precision compared to previous results.
