The most recent results from the KLOE experiment are presented, covering: the measurement of the running fine-structure constant alpha_em,the Dalitz plot measurement of eta to pi+pi-pi0, the search of a U boson, tests of discrete symmetries and quantum coherence. The KLOE-2 Collaboration will take data until mid 2018 aiming to collect 5 inversed fb increasing the data set, in order to produce new precision measurements and continue studies of fundamental symmetries and New Physics.
