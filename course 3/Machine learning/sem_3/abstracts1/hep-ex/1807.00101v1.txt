We studied a feasibility of observing the light-by-light scattering in a photon-photon collider based on an existing accelerator complex and a laser system which can be commercially available. We investigated a statistical significance of the signal over the QED backgrounds through a Monte Carlo simulation with a detector model. The study showed that the light-by-light scattering can be observed with the statistical significance of 9 sigma in a year of operation.
