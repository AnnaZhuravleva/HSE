PHENIX has measured the azimuthal correlations of muon pairs from charm and bottom semi-leptonic decays in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV, using a novel analysis technique utilizing both unlike- and like-sign muon pairs to separate charm, bottom and Drell-Yan contributions. The dimuon measurements combined with the previous electron-muon and dielectron measurements span a wide range in rapidity, and are well described by PYTHIA Tune A. Through a Bayesian analysis based on PYTHIA Tune A, we show that leading order pair creation is the dominant $(76\%\pm^{14}_{19}\%)$ contribution for $b\bar{b}$ production, whereas the data favor the scenario in which next-to-leading-order processes dominate $c\bar{c}$ production. The small contribution of next-to-leading-order processes in $b\bar{b}$ production at the collision energies of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider contrasts with the case at Large-Hadron-Collider energies, where next-to-leading-order processes are expected to dominate.
