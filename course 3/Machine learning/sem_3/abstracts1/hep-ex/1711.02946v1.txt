The Large Hadron Collider has entered a new era in Run 2, with centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV and instantaneous luminosity reaching $\mathcal{L}_\textrm{inst} = 1.4\times$10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ for pp collisions. In order to cope with those harsher conditions, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have improved their online selection infrastructure to keep a high efficiency for important physics processes - like W, Z and Higgs bosons in their leptonic and diphoton modes - whilst keeping the size of data stream compatible with the bandwidth and disk resources available. In this note, we describe some of the trigger improvements implemented for Run 2, including algorithms for selection of electrons, photons, muons and hadronic final states.
