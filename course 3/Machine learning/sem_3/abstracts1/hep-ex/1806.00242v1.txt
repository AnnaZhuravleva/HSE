The mass of the Higgs boson is measured in the $H\rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell$ and in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay channels with 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. The measured value in the $H\rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 4\ell$ channel is $m_{H}^{ZZ^{*}} = 124.79 \pm 0.37$ GeV, while the measured value in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ channel is $m_{H}^{\gamma \gamma} = 124.93 \pm 0.40$ GeV. Combining these results with the ATLAS measurement based on 7 TeV and 8 TeV proton-proton collision data yields a Higgs boson mass of $m_H=124.97 \pm 0.24$ GeV.
