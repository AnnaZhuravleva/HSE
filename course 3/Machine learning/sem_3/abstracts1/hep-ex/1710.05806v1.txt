The only comparative study of the inclusive pion single-spin asymmetries produced in the interactions of the polarized protons and antiprotons in collisions with unpolarized proton was carried out at E-704 experiment. Significant asymmetries were found at large $x_{F}$ and middle $p_{T}$, $\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{0}$ asymmetries have positive signs while $\pi^{-}$ has negative one in the $p^{\uparrow}+p$ collisions, while in the $\bar{p}^{\uparrow}+p$ interactions the $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{0}$ asymmetries have positive signs while $\pi^{+}$ has negative sign. Similar experimental study can be done in the SPASCHARM experiment at U-70 accelerator at IHEP for various secondary particles with the use of 16 GeV polarized proton and antiproton beams.
