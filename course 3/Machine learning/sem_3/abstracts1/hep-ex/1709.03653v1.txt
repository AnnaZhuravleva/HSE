The numbers of $\psi(3686)$ events accumulated by the BESIII detector for the two rounds of data taking during 2009 and 2012 are determined to be $(107.0\pm0.8)\times 10^6$ and $(341.1\pm 2.1)\times 10^6$, respectively, by counting inclusive hadronic events, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematics and the statistical uncertainty is negligible. The number of events for the sample taken in 2009 is consistent with that of the previous measurement. The total number of $\psi(3686)$ events for the two data-taking periods is $(448.1\pm2.9)\times10^6$.
