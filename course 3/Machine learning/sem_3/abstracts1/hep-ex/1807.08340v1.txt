$K\rightarrow \pi\nu \bar\nu$ is one of the theoretically cleanest meson decay where to look for indirect effects of new physics complementary to LHC searches. The NA62 experiment at CERN SPS is designed to measure the branching ratio of the $K^+\rightarrow \pi^+\nu \bar\nu$ decay with 10\% precision. After commissioning, in 2016 first data set good for physics has been collected. The data taking is foreseen till the LS2 at the end of 2018. The analysis method has been tested with 5\% of the full 2016 statistics. Results obtained with this subsample will be shown. The status of the experiment will be reviewed, and prospects will be presented, together with a mention to the broader NA62 physics program.
