Jet substructure has emerged to play a central role at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where it has provided numerous innovative new ways to search for new physics and to probe the Standard Model, particularly in extreme regions of phase space. In this article we focus on a review of the development and use of state-of-the-art jet substructure techniques by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. ALICE and LHCb have been probing fragmentation functions since the start of the LHC and have also recently started studying other jet substructure techniques. It is likely that in the near future all LHC collaborations will make significant use of jet substructure and grooming techniques. Much of the work in this field in recent years has been galvanized by the Boost Workshop Series, which continues to inspire fruitful collaborations between experimentalists and theorists. We hope that this review will prove a useful introduction and reference to experimental aspects of jet substructure at the LHC. A companion overview of recent progress in theory and machine learning approaches is given in 1709.04464, the complete review will be submitted to Reviews of Modern Physics.
