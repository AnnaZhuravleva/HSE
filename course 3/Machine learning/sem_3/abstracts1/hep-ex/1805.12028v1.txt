The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab reports results from an analysis of $\nu_e$ appearance data from $12.84 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in neutrino mode, an increase of approximately a factor of two over previously reported results. A $\nu_e$ charged-current quasi-elastic event excess of $381.2 \pm 85.2$ events ($4.5 \sigma$) is observed in the energy range $200<E_\nu^{QE}<1250$~MeV. Combining these data with the $\bar \nu_e$ appearance data from $11.27 \times 10^{20}$ protons on target in antineutrino mode, a total $\nu_e$ plus $\bar \nu_e$ charged-current quasi-elastic event excess of $460.5 \pm 95.8$ events ($4.8 \sigma$) is observed. If interpreted in a standard two-neutrino oscillation model, ${\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow {\nu}_e$, the best oscillation fit to the excess has a probability of $20.1\%$ while the background-only fit has a $\chi^2$-probability of $5 \times 10^{-7}$ relative to the best fit. The MiniBooNE data are consistent in energy and magnitude with the excess of events reported by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND), and the significance of the combined LSND and MiniBooNE excesses is $6.1 \sigma$. All of the major backgrounds are constrained by in-situ event measurements, so non-oscillation explanations would need to invoke new anomalous background processes. Although the data are fit with a standard oscillation model, other models may provide better fits to the data.
