Using a data sample of $448.1\times10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII, we perform search for the hadronic transition $h_c\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi$ via $\psi(3686)\rightarrow\pi^0h_c$. No signals of the transition are observed, and the upper limit on the product branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686)\rightarrow\pi^0h_c)\mathcal{B}(h_c\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-J/\psi)$ at the 90% confidence level is determined to be $2.0\times10^{-6}$. This is the most stringent upper limit to date.
