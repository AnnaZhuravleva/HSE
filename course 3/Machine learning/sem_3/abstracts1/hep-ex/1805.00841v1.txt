The study of the J/$\psi$ production in pp collisions provides important information on perturbative and non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Using high multiplicity pp events, we can study how charmonium production depends on the event activity. These measurements are used to investigate the possible influence of multiple partonic interactions to the J/$\psi$ production and the interplay between soft and hard processes.In this work we report on studies of J/$\psi$ production as a function of event multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at mid-rapidity with ALICE. The J/$\psi$ are reconstructed via their dielectron decay channel in events where at least one of the decay electrons was triggered on by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). The availability of a high-$p_{\rm T}$ electron trigger enhances the sampled luminosity significantly relative to the available minimum-bias triggered data set and extends the $p_{\rm T}$ reach for the J/$\psi$ measurement. Using these data, the J/$\psi$ measurement is performed in the transverse momentum interval $8 < p_{\rm T} < 30~\textrm{GeV}/c$.
