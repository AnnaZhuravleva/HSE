We present the latest ATLAS and CMS measurements of several properties of the Higgs boson, such as signal-strength modifiers for the main production modes, fiducial and differential cross sections, and the Higgs mass. We have analyzed the 13 TeV proton-proton LHC collision data recorded in 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities up to $36.1~{\rm fb}^{-1}$. Results for the ${\rm H\to ZZ}\to 4\ell$ (${\rm \ell = e\mu}$), ${\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma$, and ${\rm H}\to\tau\tau$ decay channels are presented. In addition, searches for new phenomena in the ${\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma + E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ and ${\rm H}\to{\rm b\bar{b}} + E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}$ decay channels are presented.
