The COMPASS experiment at CERN, as part of its programme addresses the exploration of the transverse spin structure of the nucleon by measuring spin (in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive DIS and, recently, also in Drell-Yan processes. Between 2002 and 2010 COMPASS performed a series of SIDIS measurements, using a longitudinally polarized muon beam impinging on transversely polarized $^6LiD$ or $NH_3$ targets. Drell-Yan measurements with a $\pi^-$ beam interacting with a transversely polarized $NH_3$ target started with the 2015 run and will be continued in 2018. In this Letter the first measurement of transverse-spin-dependent azimuthal asymmetries in the pion-induced Drell-Yan process is reported. Measured asymmetries giving access to different transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are extracted using dimuon events with invariant mass between 4.3~\gvcw\, and 8.5~\gvcw. A recent COMPASS SIDIS measurement was obtained at a hard scale comparable to that of these DY results. This provides a unique possibility to test predicted in QCD sign change of the Sivers TMD PDF and other (pseudo-)universal features of transvers momentum dependent parton distribution functions.
