Searches for heavy neutrinos can be successfully performed by fixed target experiments at the CERN SPS. New results obtained by the NA62 and NA48/2 kaon experiments are summarized in this paper. The physics potential of future projects exploiting SPS protons with beam dump facilities to enlarge the sensitivity to heavy neutrinos above the kaon mass limit are also outlined.
