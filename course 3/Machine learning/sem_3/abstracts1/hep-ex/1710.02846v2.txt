Angular distributions of the decay $\mathrm{B}^0 \to \mathrm{K}^{*0} \mu^+ \mu^-$ are studied using a sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = $ 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.5 fb$^{-1}$. An angular analysis is performed to determine the $P_1$ and $P_5'$ parameters, where the $P_5'$ parameter is of particular interest because of recent measurements that indicate a potential discrepancy with the standard model predictions. Based on a sample of 1397 signal events, the $P_1$ and $P_5'$ parameters are determined as a function of the dimuon invariant mass squared. The measurements are in agreement with predictions based on the standard model.
