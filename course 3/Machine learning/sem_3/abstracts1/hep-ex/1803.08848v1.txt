Neutrino interactions with nuclei have been the subject of intense interest over the last 15 years. Current and future measurements of neutrino oscillation and exotic physics use order 0.1--10 GeV neutrinos on a range of nuclear targets ($^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ar). As the precision of these experiments has increased, information from their detectors and dedicated experiments indicate deficiencies in the modeling of neutrino interactions on nuclear targets. Here, we present the current state of knowledge about neutrino-nucleus interactions, the challenge of extracting the cross section of these processes, and current experimental puzzles in the field. We also look forward to new and novel measurements and efforts in the future which seek to resolve these questions.
