We report a fuel-dependent reactor electron antineutrino ($\overline{\nu}_e$) yield using six 2.8\,GW$_{\text{th}}$ reactors in the Hanbit nuclear power plant complex, Yonggwang, Korea. This analysis uses an event sample acquired through inverse beta decay (IBD) interactions in identically designed near and far detectors for 1807.9 live days from August 2011 to February 2018. Based on multiple fuel cycles, we observe a fuel dependent variation in the IBD yield of $(6.08 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission for $^{235}$U and $(4.10\pm 0.26) \times 10^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission for $^{239}$Pu while a total average IBD yield per fission ($\overline{y}_f$) is $(5.78 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-43}$~cm$^2$/fission. The hypothesis of no fuel dependent IBD yield or identical spectra of fuel isotopes is ruled out at 6.7\,$\sigma$. The measured IBD yield per $^{235}$U fission shows the largest deficit relative to a reactor model prediction. Reevaluation of the $^{235}$U IBD yield per fission may mostly solve the reactor antineutrino anomaly. We also report a hint of correlation between the 5\,MeV excess in observed IBD spectrum and the reactor fuel isotope fraction of $^{235}$U.
