T2K is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment taking data since 2010. A neutrino beam is produced at the J-PARC accelerator in Japan and is sampled at a Near Detector complex 280 m from the neutrino production point and at the far detector, Super-Kamiokande, located 295 km from the source. Beams predominantly composed of muon neutrinos or muon anti-neutrinos have been produced by changing the currents in the magnetic focusing horns. This presentation will show the most recent T2K oscillation results obtained from a combined analysis of the entire available data set in the muon neutrino and muon anti-neutrino disappearance channels, and in the electron neutrino and electron anti-neutrino appearance channels. The data cover runs 1 to 8 (2010 to 2017) and consist of $7.252 \cdot 10^{20}$ POT in neutrino mode and $7.531 \cdot 10^{20}$ POT in antineutrino mode. Using these data, we measure four oscillations parameters: $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$, $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$, $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\delta_{CP}$. The analysis excludes CP-conservation in the neutrino sector at 90\% C.L.
