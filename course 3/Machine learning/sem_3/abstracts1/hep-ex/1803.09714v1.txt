Using a data sample of $448.1 \times 10^6$ $\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we report the first observation of the electromagnetic Dalitz decay $\psi(3686) \to \eta' e^+ e^-$, with significances of 7.0$\sigma$ and 6.3$\sigma$ when reconstructing the $\eta'$ meson via its decay modes $\eta'\to\gamma \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\eta'\to\pi^+\pi^-\eta$ ($\eta \to \gamma\gamma$), respectively. The weighted average branching fraction is determined to be $\mathcal{B}(\psi(3686) \to \eta' e^+ e^-)= (1.64 \pm 0.22 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-6}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
