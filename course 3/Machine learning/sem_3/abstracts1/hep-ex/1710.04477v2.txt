Heavy flavor productions are important tests of QCD. In proton-proton collisions collected at LHCb, a long list of measurements for charm and bottom productions have been made. This talk focuses on the studies of fragmentation functions and production asymmetries for bottom hadrons. They provide inputs for absolute branching fraction measurements and CP violation studies at LHCb respectively.
