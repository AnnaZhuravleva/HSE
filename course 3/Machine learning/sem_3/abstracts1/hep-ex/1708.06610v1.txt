Analyses of single top-quark production via $tW$ production, via $tZq$ production, and in the $s$-channel are presented, showing the scope of recent ATLAS and CMS analyses of $pp$ collisions produced at the LHC at $\sqrt{s}=7,8$, and ${13}\,\text{TeV}$. Cross-section values and signal significance estimates are established, confirming good agreement with the most precise available fixed-order calculations for each production mode.
