Using $e^+e^-$ annihilation data taken at the CESR collider with the CLEO-c detector, measurements of two main $\Omega^-$ branching fractions have been made using the reaction $\psi(2S)\to\Omega^-\overline{\Omega}^+$, hyperon pair production at $\sqrt{s}=3.69$~GeV, the peak of the $\psi(2S)$ resonance. $\Omega^-$ decay channels are identified through momentum distributions of charged particles, and systematics of the $\Omega^-$ branching fractions have been studied. The result gives: $\mathcal{B}(\Omega^- \to \Lambda^0 K^-) = (68.9\pm9.5\pm4.3)\%$, and $ \mathcal{B}(\Omega^- \to \Xi^0 \pi^-) = (19.0\pm4.0\pm1.2)\%$.
