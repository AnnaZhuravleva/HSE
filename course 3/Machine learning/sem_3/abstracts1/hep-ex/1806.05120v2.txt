We report on the first results from a new dish antenna search for hidden photon dark matter (HPDM) in the meV mass region. A double mirror system composed of a plane and a parabolic mirror is designed to convert HPDMs into photons focused on a receiver. In this phase 1 experiment we obtain an upper limit on the photon-HP kinetic mixing $\chi \lesssim 10^{-8}$ for the mass range of $0.67-0.92\,{\rm meV}$ using conventional mm-wave technology with a room-temperature receiver and a small-sized mirror system.
