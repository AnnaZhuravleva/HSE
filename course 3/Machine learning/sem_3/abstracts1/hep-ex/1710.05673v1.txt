Recent results from the CMS experiment on the production of multiple vector bosons in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC are presented. Measurements of WZ and ZZ production with fully leptonic decays, Z$(\nu\nu)\gamma$, and WV (V $=$ W,Z $\rightarrow q\bar{q}$) production at 8 and 13 TeV are discussed. Selected cross section measurements, unfolded differential measurements, and limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings are presented and compared with theoretical predictions.
