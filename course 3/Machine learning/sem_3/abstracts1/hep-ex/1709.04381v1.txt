A review of the searches for the SM Higgs boson produced in association with a pair of top quarks, ${t\bar{t}H}$, using up to 13.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. Searches in the diphoton, multilepton and $b\bar{b}$ decay channels are summarised. The combination of these searches yields a measured (expected) significance for the observation of the ${t\bar{t}H}$ production process of $2.8 \sigma$ ($1.8 \sigma$).
