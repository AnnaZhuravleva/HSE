The unexpected absence of unambiguous signals of New Physics at the TeV scale at the Large Hadron Collider puts today flavour physics at the forefront. In particular rare decays of b-hadrons represent a unique probe to challenge the Standard Model paradigm and test models of New Physics at a scale much higher than that accessible by direct searches. This article reviews the status of the field.
