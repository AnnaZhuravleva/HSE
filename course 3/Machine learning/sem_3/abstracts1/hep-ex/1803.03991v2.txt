Measurements of differential $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ production cross sections are presented in the single-lepton decay channel, as a function of a number of kinematic event variables. The measurements are performed with proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2016, with an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The data are compared to a variety of state-of-the-art leading-order and next-to-leading-order $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ simulations.
