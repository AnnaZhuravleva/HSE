The measurement of the $t\bar{t}$ inclusive production cross section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$ is crucial to probe QCD predictions, constrain new physic scenarios, proton PDFs, top quark pole mass, $\alpha_S$ and many other parameters from the SM. The CMS Collaboration has measured this quantity in different final states and at different centre-of-mass energies, probing QCD calculations and deriving several constraints. In this document a summary of the latest results at each channel and centre-of-mass energy is presented.
