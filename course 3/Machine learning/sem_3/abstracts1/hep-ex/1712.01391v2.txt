Dark matter is one of the main puzzles in fundamental physics and the goal of a diverse, multi-pronged research program. Underground and astrophysical searches search for dark matter particles in the cosmos, either by interacting directly or by searching for dark matter annihilation. Particle colliders, in contrast, might produce dark matter in the laboratory and are able to probe all basic interactions. They are sensitive to low dark matter masses, provide complementary information at higher masses and are subject to different systematic uncertainties. Collider searches are therefore an important part of an inter- disciplinary dark matter search strategy. This article highlights the experimental and phenomenological development in collider dark matters searches of recent years and their connection with the wider field.
