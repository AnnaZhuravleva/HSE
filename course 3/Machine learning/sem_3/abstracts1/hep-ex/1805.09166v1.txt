We present recent measurements on top quark physics obtained at the Fermilab Tevatron $p\bar p$ collider by the CDF and D0 collaborations. We discuss the measurements of the top quark mass using direct and indirect methods of extraction, the forward-backward production asymmetries, and the top quark polarization.
