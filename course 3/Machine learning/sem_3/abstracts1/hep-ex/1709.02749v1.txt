A comprehensive review of the recent results on measurements of single top-quark production cross-sections at $\sqrt{s} =$ 7, 8 and 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations is presented. The cross-section measurements include inclusive, fiducial and differential results. In addition, the latest measurements, based on angular distributions in $t$-channel single-top-quark processes, of the top-quark polarisation and $W$ boson spin observables at $\sqrt{s} =$ 8 TeV, and the analyses of the $Wtb$ vertex at $\sqrt{s} =$ 7 and 8 TeV are also discussed. All measurements are in good agreement with predictions and no deviations from Standard Model expectations have been observed so far.
