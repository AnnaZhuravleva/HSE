This talk is dedicated to the most recent measurements of the processes that feature the production of a top quark pair either with an electroweak standard model boson, or another pair of top, bottom or light quarks. For the measurement of the production cross-section of top quark pair in association with a photon, 19.7 $\rm fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected by CMS detector at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV is used, while for four top production, $\rm t\bar{t}$ + bb, $\rm t\bar{t}$ + jj, $\rm t\bar{t}$W and $\rm t\bar{t}$Z the data collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV amounting to 35.9 $\rm fb^{-1}$, is used. The measurement of $\rm t\bar{t}\gamma$ is performed in the fiducial phase space corresponding to the semileptonic decay chain of the top quark pair, and the cross section is measured relative to the inclusive top quark pair production cross section. The fiducial cross section for this process is found to be 127 $\pm$ 27 (stat + syst) fb. The most recent search for the four top quark production, that explores the same-sign dilepton final state, set the upper observed (expected) limit to 4.6 ($2.9^{+1.4}_{-0.9}$) times predicted standard model cross section. The measured cross section of the top pair production with two b quarks is found to be $\sigma$($\rm t\bar{t}$ + bb) = 3.9 $\pm$ 0.6 (stat) $\pm$ 1.3 (syst) pb in the full phase space. The measurement of the $\rm t\bar{t}$W and $\rm t\bar{t}$Z processes combines three final states with two same-sign, three and four leptons. The $\rm t\bar{t}$W and $\rm t\bar{t}$Z production cross sections are measured to be $\sigma$($\rm t\bar{t}$Z) = $\rm 1.00^{+0.09}_{-0.08} (stat.)^{+0.12}_{-0.10} (sys.)$ pb and $\sigma$($\rm t\bar{t}$W) = $\rm 0.80^{+0.12}_{-0.11} (stat.)^{+0.13}_{-0.12} (sys.)$ pb with an expected (observed) significance of 4.6 (5.5) and 9.5 (9.9) standard deviations from the background-only hypothesis.
