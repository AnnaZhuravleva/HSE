Study of double parton scattering processes (DPS) involving heavy quarks provides the most precise probing of factorization hypothesis for DPS for gluon-mediated processes. The measurements are performed for the different final states, including open and hidden-flavour hadrons and for the different kinematic ranges of incoming gluons
