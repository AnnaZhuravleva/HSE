This documents the proceedings from a workshop titled `Illuminating Standard candles at the LHC: V+jets' held at Imperial College London on 25th-26th April 2017. It summarises the numerous contributions to the workshop, from the experimental overview of V+jets measurements at CMS and ATLAS and their role in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model to the status of higher order perturbative calculations to these processes and their inclusion in state of the art Monte Carlo simulations. An executive summary of the ensuing discussions including a list of outcomes and wishlist for future consideration is also presented.
