To investigate the nature of the $\psi(3770)$ resonance and to measure the cross section for $e^+e^- \to D\bar{D}$, a cross-section scan data sample, distributed among 41 center-of-mass energy points from 3.73 to 3.89~GeV, was taken with the BESIII detector operated at the BEPCII collider in the year 2010. By analyzing the large angle Bhabha scattering events, we measure the integrated luminosity of the data sample at each center-of-mass energy point. The total integrated luminosity of the data sample is $76.16\pm0.04\pm0.61$~pb$^{-1}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.
