Chaos and complex-network based study is performed to look for signature of phase transition in Pb-Pb collision data sample at 3.5 TeV from ALICE Collaboration. The analysis is done on the pseudorapidity(eta) values extracted from the data of ALICE experiment and the methods used are Multifractal-Detrended Fluctuation Analysis(MF-DFA), and a rigorous chaos-based, complex-network based method - Visibility Graph analysis. The fractal behavior of pionisation process is studied by utilizing MF-DFA method for extracting the Hurst exponent and Multifractal spectrum width to analyze the scale-freeness and fractality inherent in the fluctuation pattern of eta. Then Visibility Graph method is used to analyze the fluctuation from a completely different perspective of complex network. This algorithm's scale-freeness detection mechanism to extract the Power-of-Scale-freeness-of-Visibility-Graph(PSVG), re-establishes the scale-freeness and fractality. Earlier, it has been shown that the scaling behavior is different from one hadron-nucleus to one nucleus-nucleus interaction which is of comparatively higher total energy. In this work, we have compared the fluctuation pattern in terms of 3 rigorous parameters - Multifractal spectrum width, Hurst exponent and PSVG, between Pb-Pb interaction data at 3.5 TeV and either of pi^{-}-AgBr(350 GeV) or ^{32}S-AgBr(200 A GeV) interaction data, where both the pi^{-}-AgBr(350 GeV) and ^{32}S-AgBr(200 A GeV) interaction data are of much less energy than the ALICE data. Then we have found that the values of the 3 parameters are substantially different for ALICE data compared to the other two interaction data. As remarkably different value of long-range correlation indicates phase transition, similar change in the fluctuation pattern in terms of these parameters can be attributed to a phase transition and also the onset of QGP.
