Using a data sample of $(448.1\pm2.9)\times 10^6~\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we present measurements of branching fractions for the decays $\chi_{cJ} \rightarrow \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$ and $\Sigma^0 \bar{\Sigma}^0$. The decays $\chi_{c1,2}\rightarrow \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$ and $\Sigma^0 \bar{\Sigma}^0$ are observed for the first time, and the branching fractions for $\chi_{c0}\rightarrow \Sigma^+ \bar{\Sigma}^-$ and $\Sigma^0 \bar{\Sigma}^0$ decays are measured with improved precision. The branching fraction ratios between the charged and neutral modes are consistent with the prediction of isospin symmetry.
