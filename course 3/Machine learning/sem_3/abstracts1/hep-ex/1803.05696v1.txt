Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in the year 2012, the CMS experiment continuously makes use of a variety of final states to measure the properties of the Higgs boson, as well as to search for it in final states where the discovery could not yet be established. This article concentrates on Higgs searches in fermionic final states including a search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in the $H \rightarrow b\overline{b}$ channel. Furthermore, three different searches for Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model are presented. These comprise two searches for heavy neutral Higgs bosons and one search for a heavy charged Higgs boson, all of them exploiting final states with tau leptons.
