Two equations for the calculation of the critical energy required for homogeneous nucleation in a superheated liquid, and the related critical radius of the nucleated vapour bubble, are obtained, the former by the direct application of the first law of thermodynamics, the latter by considering that the bubble formation implies the overcoming of a barrier of the free enthalpy potential. Comparisons with the currently used relationships demonstrate that the sensitivity of the bubble chambers employed in dark matter searches can be sometimes notably overestimated.
