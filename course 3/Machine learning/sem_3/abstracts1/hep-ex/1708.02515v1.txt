Semileptonic $b \rightarrow s\ell \ell$ processes constitute a good probe for new physics phenomena: new particles contributing to the loops could affect branching fractions and angular distributions, and have different couplings to different lepton families, thus violating lepton flavour universality.   Recent results from the LHCb experiment are reviewed.
