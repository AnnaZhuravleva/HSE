ATLAS has made several measurements of the top quark mass using proton-proton collision data recorded in 2012 at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Those summarised here include an indirect determination of the top quark pole mass from lepton differential cross-sections; previous direct measurements of the top quark mass in the $t\bar{t}\to\textrm{dilepton}$ and $t\bar{t}\to\textrm{all-jets}$ decay channels as well as in the $t$-channel of single-top-quark production; and lastly, the new direct measurement of the top quark mass in the $t\bar{t}\to\textrm{lepton+jets}$ decay channel and its combination with previous measurements.
