The presence of multiple candidates per event can cause raw biases which are large compared to statistical uncertainties. Selecting a single candidate is common practice but only helps if the likelihood of selecting the true candidate is very high. Otherwise, the precision of the measurement can be affected, and additional biases can be generated, even if none are present in the data sample prior to this operation.   This paper is an attempt at describing the problem in a systematic way. It sets definitions, provides examples of potential biases using pseudoexperiments and gives recommendations.
