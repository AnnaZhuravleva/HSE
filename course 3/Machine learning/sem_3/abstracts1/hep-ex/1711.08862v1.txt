The $e^+e^- \to \eta\pi^+\pi^-$ cross section is measured at the SND detector in the $\eta$ decay mode $\eta\to 3\pi^0$. The analysis is based on the data sample with an integrated luminosity of 32.7 pb$^{-1}$ collected at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider in the center-of-mass energy range $\sqrt{s}=1.075-2.000$ GeV. The data obtained in the $\eta\to 3\pi^0$ decay mode are found to be in agreement with the previous SND measurements in the $\eta\to \gamma\gamma$ mode. Therefore the measurements in the two modes are combined.
