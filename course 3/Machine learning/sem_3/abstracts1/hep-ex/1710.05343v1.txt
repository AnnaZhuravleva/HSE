The status of Higgs boson measurements in the $WW^{\ast}$, $\tau\tau$, and $\mu\mu$ decay modes with the ATLAS experiment is presented. These measurements are done using $pp$ collision data from the Large Hadron Collider with either the full Run 1 dataset at $\sqrt{s}= 7\,\mathrm{TeV}$ and $\sqrt{s}= 8\,\mathrm{TeV}$ or with a partial Run 2 dataset at $\sqrt{s}= 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ of either $5.81\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ or $36.1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The different couplings to the Higgs boson are probed by measuring the production cross sections and extracting the signal strengths. Depending on the analysis, the measurements are sensitive to the gluon-fusion or vector-boson fusion Higgs boson production, or associated production of a vector boson and a Higgs boson.
