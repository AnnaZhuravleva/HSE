An overview of recent measurements of inclusive and differential single top quark cross sections at 13 TeV with the CMS experiment is given in this note. This includes measurements targeting the $t$-channel and tW production modes resulting in inclusive cross sections of $\sigma_{t\mathrm{\mbox{-}ch.}}=238\pm32~\mathrm{pb}$ and $\sigma_\mathrm{tW}=63.1\pm6.6~\mathrm{pb}$ respectively. In addition, the $t$-channel cross section has been measured differentially as a function of the top quark transverse momentum and rapidity. The results are found in agreement with the standard model expectations. Furthermore, a search for single top quark production in association with a Z boson is detailed which yields an observed (expected) significance of 3.7 (3.1) standard deviations.
