In the Standard Model, the three charged lepton are identical copies of each other, apart from mass differences. Experimental tests of this feature in decays of semileptonic b hadrons, such as $B\rightarrow D^* \tau\ nu$, are highly sensitive to New Physics particles which preferentially couple to the 3rd generation.A measurement of $R(D^{*-})$ using 3-prong $\tau$ decays performed by LHCb is reported.
