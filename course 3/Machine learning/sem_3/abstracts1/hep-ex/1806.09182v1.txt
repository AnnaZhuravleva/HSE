We report evidence for the charged charmed-strange baryon $\Xi_{c}(2930)$ with a signal significance of 3.9$\sigma$. The charged $\Xi_{c}(2930)$ is found in its decay to $K_{S}^{0} \Lambda_{c}$ in the substructure of $B^{0} \to K^{0}_{S} \Lambda_{c}^{+} \bar{\Lambda}_{c}^{-}$ decays. The measured mass and width are $[2942.3 \pm 4.4 (\rm stat.) \pm 1.6(\rm syst.)]$~MeV/$c^{2}$ and $[14.8 \pm 8.8(\rm stat.) \pm 7.1(\rm syst.)]$~MeV, respectively, and the product branching fraction is ${\cal B}(B^{0} \to \Xi_{c}^{+}(2930) \bar{\Lambda}_{c}^{-}) {\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}(2930)\to K^{0} \Lambda_{c}^{+})=[2.28 \pm 0.49(\rm stat.) \pm 0.29(\rm syst.)]\times 10^{-4}$. We also measure ${\cal B}(B^{0} \to K^{0} \Lambda_{c}^{+} \bar{\Lambda}_{c}^{-}) = [3.84 \pm 0.73(\rm stat.) \pm 0.48(\rm syst.)] \times 10^{-4}$ with greater precision than previous experiments, and present the results of a search for the charmonium-like state $Y(4660)$ and its spin partner, $Y_{\eta}$, in the $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\bar{\Lambda}_{c}^{-}$ invariant mass spectrum. No clear signals of the $Y(4660)$ or $Y_{\eta}$ are observed and the 90\% credibility level (C.L.) upper limits on their production rates are determined. These measurements are obtained from a sample of $(772\pm11)\times 10^{6} B\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy electron-positron collider.
