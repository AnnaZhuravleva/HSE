Cumulants of conserved charges fluctuations are regarded as a potential tool to study the criticality in the QCD phase diagram and to determine the freeze-out parameters in a model-independent way. At LHC energies, the measurements of the ratio of the net-baryon (net-proton) cumulants can be used to test the lattice QCD predictions. In this work, we present the first measurements of cumulants of the net-proton number distributions up to $4^{th}$ order in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV as a function of collision centrality. We compare our cumulant ratios results with the STAR experiment net-proton results measured in the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC. The results can be used to obtain the chemical freeze-out parameters at LHC.
