The suppressed decay $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow p\pi^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, excluding the $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ resonances, is observed for the first time with a significance of 5.5 standard deviations. The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected with the LHCb experiment. The $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow p\pi^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ branching fraction is measured relative to the $\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow J/\psi(\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})p\pi^{-}$ branching fraction giving \begin{align} \nonumber   \frac{\mathcal{B}(\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow p\pi^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-})}{\mathcal{B}({\Lambda^{0}_{b}\rightarrow J/\psi(\rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-})p\pi^{-}})} &= 0.044\pm0.012\pm0.007, \end{align} where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This is the first observation of a $b\rightarrow d$ transition in a baryonic decay.
