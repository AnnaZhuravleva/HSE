We review the results on the bottomonium system from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Measurements have been carried out at different center-of-mass energies in proton collisions and in collisions involving heavy ions. These include precision measurements of cross sections and polarizations, shedding light on hadroproduction mechanisms, and the observation of quarkonium sequential suppression, a notable indication of quark-gluon plasma formation. The observation of the production of bottomonium pairs is also reported along with searches for new states. We close with a brief outlook of the future physics program.
