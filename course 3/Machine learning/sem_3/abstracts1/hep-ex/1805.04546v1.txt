This paper presents several measurements of total production cross sections and total inelastic cross sections for the following reactions: $\pi^{+}$+C, $\pi^{+}$+Al, $K^{+}$+C, $K^{+}$+Al at 60 GeV/c, $\pi^{+}$+C and $\pi^{+}$+Al at 31 GeV/c . The measurements were made using the NA61/SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS. Comparisons with previous measurements are given and good agreement is seen. These interaction cross sections measurements are a key ingredient for neutrino flux prediction from the reinteractions of secondary hadrons in current and future accelerator-based long-baseline neutrino experiments.
