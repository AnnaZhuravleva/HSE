This report summarizes latest ATLAS and CMS results on Higgs boson couplings to fermions.~Presented topics include decays into final states of pairs of tau leptons and pairs of bottom quarks as well as results on the ttH production mode.~Results are complemented by tests of the CP invariance and searches for lepton flavor violating decays.~Finally, prospects of future Higgs boson analyses within the scope of the High Luminosity LHC program are discussed.~The presented results mostly use LHC 2016 data collected at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}}=13~$TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 36$~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$.
