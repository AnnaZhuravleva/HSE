We present a measurement of the fundamental parameter of the standard model, the weak mixing angle, in $p\bar{p}\rightarrow Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ events at a center of mass energy of 1.96 TeV, using data corresponding to 9.7 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The effective weak mixing angle is extracted from the forward-backward charge asymmetry as a function of the invariant mass around the Z boson pole. The measured value of $\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\text{$\ell$}}=0.23147 \pm 0.00047$ is the most precise measurement from light quark interactions to date, with a precision close to the best LEP and SLD results.
