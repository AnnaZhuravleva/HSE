Supersymmetry is one of the most motivated scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model. This article summarizes recent ATLAS results on searches for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at LHC, which target supersymmetric particles produced by strong interaction in events with leptonic final states. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed and exclusion limits have been set on squark and gluino masses in various scenarios.
