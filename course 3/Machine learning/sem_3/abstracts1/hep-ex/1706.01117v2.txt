The direct measurement of the top quark-Higgs coupling is one of the important questions in understanding the Higgs boson. The coupling can be obtained through measurement of the top quark pair-associated Higgs boson production cross-section. Of the multiple challenges arising in this cross-section measurement, we investigate the reconstruction of the partons originating from the hard scattering process using the measured jets in simulated ttH events. The task corresponds to an assignment challenge of m objects (jets) to n other objects (partons), where m>=n. We compare several methods with emphasis on a concept based on deep learning techniques which yields the best results with more than 50% of correct jet-parton assignments.
