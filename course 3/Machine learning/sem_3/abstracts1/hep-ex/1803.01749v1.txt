We present measurements of azimuthal correlations of charged hadron pairs in $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV Au$+$Au collisions after subtracting an underlying event using a model that includes higher-order azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$. After subtraction, the away-side ($\Delta\phi\sim\pi)$ of the highest transverse-momentum trigger ($p_T>4$ GeV/$c$) correlations is suppressed compared to that of correlations measured in $p$$+$$p$ collisions. At the lowest associated particle $p_T$, the away-side shape and yield are modified. These observations are consistent with the scenario of radiative-jet energy loss. For the lowest-$p_T$ trigger correlations, an away-side yield exists and we explore the dependence of the shape of the away-side within the context of an underlying-event model. Correlations are also studied differentially versus event-plane angle $\Psi_n$. The angular correlations show an asymmetry when selecting the sign of the trigger-particle azimuthal angle with respect to the $\Psi_2$ event plane. This asymmetry and the measured suppression of the pair yield out of plane is consistent with a path-length-dependent energy loss. No $\Psi_3$ dependence can be resolved within experimental uncertainties.
