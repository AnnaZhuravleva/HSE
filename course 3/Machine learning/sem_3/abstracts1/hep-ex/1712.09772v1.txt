This presentation gives the prospects of measuring the general Lorentz structures of $VVH$ ($V=Z$, $\gamma$ and $W$) couplings at the International Linear Collider (ILC). Sensitivities to Higgs CP-even and CP-odd structures are evaluated by using various Higgs production channels and employing measurements of kinematical distributions. The evaluation is performed based on full detector simulation of the International Large Detector (ILD) at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}=$ 250 and 500 GeV. Combined sensitivities on the anomalous $ZZH$ couplings are provided for a realistic operating scenario of the ILC.
