The study of $C\!P$ violation in decays of beauty- and charm-hadrons provides a fundamental test of the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) and represents a sensitive probe to search for physics effects that cannot be described within the SM. In these proceedings, precision measurements are presented of several observables related to the so-called unitary triangles, that arise from the unitarity requirements on the 3x3 Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix describing the quark mixing. Moreover, recent measurements of $C\!P$ violation in beauty- and charm-hadrons are illustrated. In particular, a recent analysis providing the first evidence for $C\!P$ violation in the beauty baryon sector and the world best precise measurement of $C\!P$ violation in the charm system will be described in detail. The discussed analyses are based on proton-proton collision data collected during 2011 and 2012 (LHC Run 1) by the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments.
