Top quarks are produced copiously at the LHC, and a variety of related measurements has been made in the recent years by the two collaborations ATLAS and CMS. The most recent measurements of the top quark mass by the two collaborations are reported here. The top quark mass has been measured with a relative uncertainty smaller than 0.3%, making the top quark the most accurately measured quark.
