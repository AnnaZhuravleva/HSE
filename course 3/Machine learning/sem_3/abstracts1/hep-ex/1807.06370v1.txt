In a thermal system, fluctuations of particle yields are directly encoded in the equation of state of the system under the study. By measuring differential properties of fluctuation signals one can explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter created, for instance, in head-on collisions of heavy nuclei. However, in practice, particles cannot be uniquely identified in each collision. This incomplete particle identification distorts the measured fluctuations. In this report we provide an in-depth discussion of an innovative technique, the Identity Method, which was proposed to circumvent this problem. After describing its implementation, we provide a user's guide for running a number of specific examples.
