Heavy-flavour quarks are important to probe Quark-Gluon Plasma(QGP) properties. Cold Nuclear Matter(CNM) effects can be accessed by $p$Pb collisions. LHCb is a heavy-flavour precision experiment and has collected large collision data samples. Production cross-section measurements of prompt $D^{0}$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$= 5 TeV and $J/\psi$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$= 8.16 TeV are presented.
