The Belle II experiment is under construction at the KEK laboratory in Japan. Belle II will study e+e- collisions at or near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the goal of collecting 50 ab-1 of data, which is a large increase over that recorded by the Belle and BaBar experiments. This data will provide a large sample of charm meson decays. In this report we present the expected sensitivity of Belle II for measuring time-dependent mixing and CP violation in the D0-D0bar system. We focus on measurements of D0-> K+ pi-, D0-> K+ pi- pi0, and D0-> K0_S pi+ pi- decays.
