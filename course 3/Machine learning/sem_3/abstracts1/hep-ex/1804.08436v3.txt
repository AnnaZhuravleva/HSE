We report the status and progress of the Heavy Flavour Averaging Group work on the global fit of tau lepton branching fractions, on the lepton universality tests and on the measurement of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |Vus| using tau lepton measurements. We also review the prospects for improving the precision of the |Vus| measurement.
