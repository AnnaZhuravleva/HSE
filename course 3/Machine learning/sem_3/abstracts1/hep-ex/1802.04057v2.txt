Based on a data sample of $(448.1\pm2.9)\times10^6~\psi(3686)$ decays collected with the BESIII experiment, a search for the flavor changing neutral current transition $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+ \overline{p} e^+ e^- + c.c.$ is performed for the first time. No signal candidates are observed and the upper limit on the branching fraction of $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \Lambda_c^+ \overline{p} e^+ e^-$ is determined to be $1.7\times10^{-6}$ at the 90\% confidence level. The result is consistent with expectations from the Standard Model, and no evidence for new physics is found.
