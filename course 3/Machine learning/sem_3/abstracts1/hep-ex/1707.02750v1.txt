Production of prompt D$^0$ mesons is studied in proton-lead and lead-proton collisions recorded at the LHCb detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $1.58\pm0.02$ nb$^{-1}$ recorded at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=5$ TeV. Measurements of the differential cross-section, the forward-backward production ratio and the nuclear modification factor are reported using D$^0$ candidates with transverse momenta less than 10 GeV/c and rapidities in the ranges $1.5<y^*<4.0$ and $-5.0<y^*<-2.5$ in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass system.
