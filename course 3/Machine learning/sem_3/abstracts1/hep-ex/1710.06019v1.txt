Results of top-quark mass measurements in the di-lepton and the all-jets top-antitop decay channels with the ATLAS detector are presented. The measurements are obtained using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 $fb^{-1}$. The top-quark mass in the di-lepton channel is measured to be 172.99 $\pm$ 0.41 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.74 (syst.) GeV. In the all-jets analysis, the top-quark mass is measured to be 173.72 $\pm$ 0.55 (stat.) $\pm$ 1.01 (syst.) GeV. In addition, the top-quark pole mass is determined from inclusive cross-section measurements in the top-antitop di-lepton decay channel with the ATLAS detector. The measurements are obtained using data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 $fb^{-1}$ and 20.2 $fb^{-1}$ respectively. The top-quark pole mass is measured to be $172.9^{+2.5}_{-2.6}$ GeV.
