We report first measurements of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production at low transverse momentum ($p_T<$ 0.15 GeV/$c$) in non-central Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and U$+$U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. Significant enhancement factors, expressed as ratios of data over known hadronic contributions, are observed in the 40-80% centrality of these collisions. The excess yields peak distinctly at low-$p_T$ with a width ($\sqrt{\langle p^2_T\rangle}$) between 40 to 60 MeV/$c$. The absolute cross section of the excess depends weakly on centrality while those from a theoretical model calculation incorporating in-medium broadened $\rho$ spectral function and radiation from a Quark Gluon Plasma or hadronic cocktail contributions increase dramatically with increasing number of participant nucleons ($N_{\rm part}$). Model calculations of photon-photon interactions generated by the initial projectile and target nuclei describe the observed excess yields but fail to reproduce the $p^{2}_{T}$ distributions.
