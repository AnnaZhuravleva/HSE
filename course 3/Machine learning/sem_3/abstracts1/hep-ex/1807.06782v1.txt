We report the measurement of the branching fraction and $CP$ asymmetry for the $\bar{B}^{0}(B^{0})\to K^{0}_{S}K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}$ decay. The analysis is performed on a data sample of 711 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. We obtain a branching fraction of $(3.60\pm0.33\pm0.15)\times10^{-6}$ and an $\mathcal{A}_{CP}$ of $(-8.5\pm8.9\pm0.2)\%$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. Hints of peaking structures are also observed in the differential branching fraction as functions of Dalitz variables.
