RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation) is the first reactor neutrino experiment which began data-taking in 2011 with two identical near and far detectors in Yonggwang, Korea. Using 1500 live days of data, sin^2(2{\theta}_13) and |{\Delta}m^2_ee| are updated using spectral measurements: sin^2(2{\theta}_13) = 0.086 +/- 0.006 (stat.) +/- 0.005 (syst.) and |{\Delta}m^2_ee| = 2.61+0.15-0.16 (stat.) +/- 0.09 (syst.) (x10^-3 eV^2). The correlation between the 5 MeV excess rate and the reactor thermal power is again clearly observed with the increased data set.
