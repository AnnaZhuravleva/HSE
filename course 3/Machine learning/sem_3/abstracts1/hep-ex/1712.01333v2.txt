Using a data sample of 980 ${\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data taken with the Belle detector operating at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider, we report the results of a study of the decays of the $\Omega_c^0$ charmed baryon into hadronic final states. We report the most precise measurements to date of the relative branching fractions of the $\Omega_c^0$ into $\Omega^-\pi^+\pi^0$, $\Omega^-\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$, $\Xi^-K^-\pi^+\pi^+$, and $\Xi^0K^-\pi^+$, as well as the first measurements of the branching fractions of the $\Omega_c^0$ into $\Xi^-\bar{K}^0\pi^+$, $\Xi^0\bar{K}^0$, and $\Lambda \bar{K}^0\bar{K}^0$, all with respect to the $\Omega^-\pi^+$ decay. In addition, we investigate the resonant substructure of these modes. Finally, we present a limit on the branching fraction for the decay $\Omega_c^0\to\Sigma^+K^-K^-\pi^+$.
