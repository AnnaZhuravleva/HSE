The cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0\eta$ has been measured using a data sample of 21.8 pb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider. 2769$\pm$95 signal events have been selected in the center-of-mass energy range 1394--2005 MeV. The production dynamics is dominated by the $\omega(782)\eta$ and $\phi(1020)\eta$ intermediate states in the lower energy range, and by the $a_0(980)\rho(770)$ intermediate state at higher energies.
