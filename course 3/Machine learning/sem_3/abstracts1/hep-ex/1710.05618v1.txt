An overview of the latest results for top pair production in association with a vector gauge boson in the ATLAS detector at LHC is presented. The results involving $Z$ and $W$ bosons are recorded at $\sqrt{13}$ TeV collision energy, while the results involving photons are recorded at $\sqrt{7}$ TeV and $\sqrt{8}$ TeV collision energy.
