We calculate the charged current cross sections obtained at the T2K near detector for $\nu_\mu$-induced events without pions in the final state. The method used is quantum-kinetic transport theory. Results are shown first, as a benchmark, for electron inclusive cross sections on $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O to be followed with a detailed comparison with the data measured by the T2K collaboration on C$_8$H$_8$ and H$_2$O targets. The contribution of 2p2h processes is found to be relevant mostly for backwards angles; their theoretical uncertainties are within the experimental uncertainties. Particular emphasis is then put on a discussion of events in which pions are first created, but then reabsorbed. Their contribution is found to be essential at forward angles.
