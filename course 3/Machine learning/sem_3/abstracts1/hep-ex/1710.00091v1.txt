In the present document a selected sample of the latest results on CP violation by the LHCb collaboration are presented. These include the first measurement of $\phi_s^{c\overline{c}s} = 0.119 \pm0.107\pm0.034$ rad in a final state dominated by a tensor resonance, the most precise measurements of $C_{\pi^+\pi^-}$ and $S_{\pi^+\pi^-}$ to date, the first values ever measured of $C_{K^+K^-}$, $S_{K^+K^-}$ and $A_{K^+K^-}^{\Delta\Gamma}$, the latest constraints on $\gamma = (76.8^{+5.1}_{-5.7})^\circ$ from the combination of several LHCb results and the first evidence for CP violation in baryonic mater at the level of 3.3$\sigma$. All results show a good agreement with the SM expectations.
