Many extensions of the Standard Model predict new resonances decaying to a $Z$, $W$, or Higgs boson and a photon. This paper presents a search for such resonances produced in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ $\mathrm{TeV}$ using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The $Z/W/H$ bosons are identified through their decays to hadrons. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectation in the entire investigated mass range. Upper limits are set on the production cross section times branching fraction for resonance decays to $Z/W+\gamma$ in the mass range from 1.0 to 6.8 $\mathrm{TeV}$, and for the first time into $H+\gamma$ in the mass range from 1.0 to 3.0 $\mathrm{TeV}$.
