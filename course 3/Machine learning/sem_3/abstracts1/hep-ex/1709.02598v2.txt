These proceedings report on lepton and photon performance results obtained using data recorded in 2015 and 2016 at the LHC by the two experiments ATLAS and CMS. For each particle (electrons, photons and muons), the reconstruction and identification efficiencies are presented for the two experiments together with the isolation studies. Results concerning the electron and photon energy calibration as well as the muon momentum scale and resolution are also reported. Despite more challenging pile-up conditions with respect to Run 1, the two experiments achieved impressive performance in early Run 2.
