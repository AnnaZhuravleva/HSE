The mass of the top quark is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model and has to be determined experimentally. In these proceedings, I review recent direct measurements of the top quark mass in $p\bar p$ collisions at $\sqrt s=1.96$ TeV recorded by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron. The measurements are performed in final states containing one and two charged leptons. I will present the legacy combination of all top quark mass measurements from the D0 experiment and their combination with results from the CDF experiment. A relative precision of down to 0.3\% is attained.
