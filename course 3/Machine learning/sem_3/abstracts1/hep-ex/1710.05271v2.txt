We propose using the storage ring EDM method to search for the axion dark matter induced EDM oscillation in nucleons. The method uses a combination of B and E-fields to produce a resonance between the $g-2$ spin precession frequency and the background axion field oscillation to greatly enhance sensitivity to it. An axion frequency range from $10^{-9}$ Hz to 100 MHz can in principle be scanned with high sensitivity, corresponding to an $f_a$ range of $10^{13} $ GeV $\leq f_a \leq 10^{30}$ GeV, the breakdown scale of the global symmetry generating the axion or axion like particles (ALPs).
