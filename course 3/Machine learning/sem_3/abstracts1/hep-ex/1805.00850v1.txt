Deep generative models parametrised by neural networks have recently started to provide accurate results in modeling natural images. In particular, generative adversarial networks provide a semi-supervised solution to this problem. In this work we apply this kind of technique to the simulation of particle-detector response to hadronic jets. We show that deep neural networks can achieve high accuracy in this task, while attaining a speed increase of several orders of magnitude with respect to traditional algorithms.
