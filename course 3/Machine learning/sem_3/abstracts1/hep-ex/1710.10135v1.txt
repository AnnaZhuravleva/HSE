Measurements on vector boson scattering in the same-sign WW and fully leptonic ZZ channel, and a measurement of vector boson fusion of a Z boson are summarized. The three measurements are based on a dataset of proton--proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{Te\hspace{-.08em}V}$ with an integrated luminosity of $35.9\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ recorded by the CMS experiment. The first observation for the electroweak production of a pair of same-sign W bosons is reported with an observed (expected) significance of 5.5 (5.7) standard deviations. The first measurement of vector boson fusion of a Z boson at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{Te\hspace{-.08em}V}$ is presented. The first measurement of the electroweak production of two Z bosons at the LHC is also presented, reporting a signal significance of 2.7 standard deviations (1.6 standard deviations expected). The data are in general agreement with the expectations from the standard model. Limits on physics beyond the standard model are presented in the vector boson scattering analyses, providing the most stringent constraints on such scenarios to date.
