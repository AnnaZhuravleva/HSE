CMS measurements of properties related to top quark decays are discussed. The results presented regard the measurement of the W boson helicity, the investigation of anomalous couplings in the Wtb vertex, and the search for very rare decays, such as t -> Zq and t -> Hq, which are associated to flavor-changing neutral currents.
