An overview of recent measurements of differential top quark pair production cross sections performed by the CMS experiment at the LHC is presented. Measurements at different proton-proton center-of-mass energies are available using the dilepton, lepton+jets, and all-jets decay channels of the top quark. In addition to the measurements of parton-level top quarks, many measurements at particle level in an experimental accessible phase space are now available. For these results the dependence on theoretical extrapolations is reduced. A common observation of all measurements is a softer transverse momentum of the top quark than predicted by state of the art standard model calculations. However, new calculations with NNLO QCD and NLO electro-weak precision show an improved agreement.
