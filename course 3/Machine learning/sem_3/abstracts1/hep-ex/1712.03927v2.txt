The proton-proton collision energy at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been 7, 8 and 13 TeV recently with the goal of reaching to 14 TeV which is the maximum capacity of the LHC. However, there is still more physics yet to be explored and tested beyond the energy regime of the LHC to reach new discoveries. Therefore, a new collider bigger than the LHC machine, which will be able to collide protons at 100 TeV center-of-mass energy, is under consideration by the high-energy physics community. To provide an insight to the transition from LHC to 100 TeV collider, some properties of W and Z processes are investigated in a range of collision energy from 7 to 100 TeV using HERAPDF2.0, MMHT2014, NNPDF3.1 and CT14 NNLO PDF models at NNLO QCD. The considered properties are the production rates of W and Z bosons, the change of uncertainties (PDF, renormalization and factorization scales, strong coupling constant, model and parameterization), W boson lepton charge asymmetry, forward-backward asymmetry, and k-Factors of W and Z bosons.
