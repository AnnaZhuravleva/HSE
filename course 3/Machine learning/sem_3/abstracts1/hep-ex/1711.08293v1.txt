The process $e^+ e^- \to D_{s}^{*+} D_{s0}^{*-}(2317)+c.c.$ is observed for the first time with the data sample of 567~pb$^{-1}$ collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 4.6$~GeV. The statistical significance of the $D_{s0}^{*-}(2317)$ signal is $5.8\sigma$ and the mass is measured to be ($2318.3\pm 1.2\pm 1.2$)~MeV/$c^{2}$. The absolute branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D_{s0}^{*-}(2317)\to \pi^0 D_{s}^{-})$ is measured as $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.14}\pm 0.14$ for the first time. The uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively.
