A set of selected electroweak measurements from the LHC experiments is discussed. Results on forward-backward asymmetry in production of the Drell-Yan events in both dielectron and dimuon decay channels are presented together with results on the effective mixing angle measurements.   Angular coefficients measured in the Z boson production are compared with theoretical predictions. Electroweak production of the vector bosons in association with two jets is presented.
