RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation) is the reactor neutrino experiment which has been taking data from August 2011 with two identical near and far detectors at Hanbit Nuclear Power Plant, Yonggwang, Korea. Using 1,500 live days of data, $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and $|\Delta m^2_{ee}|$ are updated using spectral measurements: $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} = 0.086 \pm 0.006 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.005 ({\rm syst.})$ and $|\Delta m^2_{ee}| = 2.61+0.15-0.16 ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.09 ({\rm syst.}) (\times 10^{-3} {\rm eV^2})$. The 5 MeV excess dependency on the reactor thermal power rate is again clearly observed with the increased data set.
