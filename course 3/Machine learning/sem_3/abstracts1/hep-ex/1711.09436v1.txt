Using 5,326 days of atmospheric neutrino data, a search for atmospheric tau neutrino appearance has been performed in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. Super-Kamiokande measures the tau normalization to be 1.47$\pm$0.32 under the assumption of normal neutrino hierarchy, relative to the expectation of unity with neutrino oscillation. The result excludes the hypothesis of no-tau-appearance with a significance level of 4.6$\sigma$. The inclusive charged-current tau neutrino cross section averaged by the tau neutrino flux at Super-Kamiokande is measured to be $(0.94\pm0.20)\times 10^{-38}$ cm$^{2}$. The measurement is consistent with the Standard Model prediction, agreeing to within 1.5$\sigma$.
