A search for a non-random co-variation between the Neutrino Flux and Mental Activity was undertaken, using the 5-day period version of the SK-I data taken from May 31st, 1996 to July 15th, 2001. For the whole 1996-2001 period, a significant correlation between the Neutrino Flux and Mental Activity was found for each of the two midnight hours, i.e. for each of the two hours between 23:00-1:00. A significant correlation was also found across all hours for the whole year of 1998. It is not clear why this particular year should have been different from the other calendar years of 1996-2001. More specifically, significant correlations were also found for each of its hours around noon, i.e. for each of the hours between 10:00-16:00, for the year of 1998. An attempt was made to interpret why significant correlations were found only for midnight hours and hours around noon, but not for any other hours: when the sun-earth axis and the staff-detector axis coincided, the likelihood increased that staff neutrinos (if any) were counted - as solar neutrinos. Unruh's second quantization in the Kerr metric was suggested as an example of theoretical support for this conjecture that Mental Activity is a quantum-gravitational process which influences the Neutrino Flux.
