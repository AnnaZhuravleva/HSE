The decay $\tau^{-}\to K^{-}K_S\nu_{\tau}$ has been studied using $430\times10^6$ $e^+e^-\to \tau^+\tau^-$ events produced at a center-of-mass energy around 10.6 GeV at the PEP-II collider and studied with the BABAR detector. The mass spectrum of the $K^{-}K_S$ system has been measured and the spectral function has been obtained. The measured branching fraction ${\cal B}(\tau^{-}\to K^{-}K_S\nu_{\tau}) = (0.739\pm 0.011(\rm stat.)\pm 0.020(\rm syst.))\times 10^{-3}$ is found to be in agreement with earlier measurements.
