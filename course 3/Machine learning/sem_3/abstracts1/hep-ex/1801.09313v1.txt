LHCb continues to expand its world-leading sample of charmed hadrons collected during LHC's Run 1 (2010-2012) and Run 2 (2015-present). This sample is yielding some of the most stringent tests of the Standard Model understanding of charm physics. This includes precise measurements of the neutral D-meson mixing parameters and some of the most sensitive searches for direct and indirect CP violation in charm interactions.
