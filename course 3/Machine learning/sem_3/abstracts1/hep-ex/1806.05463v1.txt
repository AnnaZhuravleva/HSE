Study of methods of resolved top quarks kinematic reconstruction in the $t\bar{t} \rightarrow \ell+$jets channel is presented at the particle level as well as the fast-simulation detector level. Previous and current pseudo-top quark reconstruction algorithms are compared with suggestions presented on how to improve the reconstructed top-quark mass line shape, including the check of performance on physics observables in terms of correlations between detector, particle and parton levels, and in unfolding, with implications for current high energy physics experiments.
