We present measurements of the inclusive jet production at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, and of multijets at 8 TeV. These measurements allow to constrain PDFs and the strong coupling constant. Two measurements of the azimuthal correlations at 8 and 13 TeV are also presented, testing higher order QCD calculations.
