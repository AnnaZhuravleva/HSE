This paper presents combinations of inclusive and differential measurements of the charge asymmetry ($A_{\mathrm{C}}$) in top quark pair ($\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$) events with a lepton+jets signature by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, using data from LHC proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 5 and 20 fb$^{-1}$ for each experiment, respectively. The resulting combined LHC measurements of the inclusive charge asymmetry are $A_{\mathrm{C}}^{\mathrm{LHC7}} = 0.005 \pm0.007 \text{ (stat)}\pm0.006 \text{ (syst)}$ at 7 TeV and $A_{\mathrm{C}}^{\mathrm{LHC8}} = 0.0055 \pm0.0023\text{ (stat)}\pm0.0025\text{ (syst)}$ at 8 TeV. These values, as well as the combination of $A_{\mathrm{C}}$ measurements as a function of the invariant mass of the $\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$ system at 8 TeV, are consistent with the respective standard model predictions.
