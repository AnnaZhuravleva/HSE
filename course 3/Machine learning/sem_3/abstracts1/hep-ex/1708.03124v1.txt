We present a search for single production of heavy vector-like quarks (VLQs), carried out by the CMS collaboration analyzing LHC pp collisions at 13 TeV. The vector like quark is a massive top quark partner that is searched for in a mass range between 0.7 and 1.7 TeV and a width between $<$1\% and 30\%. Single production can be dominant over pair production, depending on the mass of the new quark. The search is performed in a variety of final states including boosted topologies that can increase the sensitivity of the analysis.
