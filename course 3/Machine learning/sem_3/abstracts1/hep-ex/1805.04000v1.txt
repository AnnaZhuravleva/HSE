An angular analysis of the decay $B^0_d \rightarrow K^{*}\mu^+\mu^-$ is presented, based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The study is using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity collected during 2012 at centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. Measurements of the $K^{*}$ longitudinal polarisation fraction and a set of angular parameters obtained for this decay are presented. The results are compatible with the Standard Model predictions.
