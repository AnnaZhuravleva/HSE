In the year 2011, the CMS collaboration introduced the novel concept of data scouting, allowing to take data that otherwise would be rejected by the usual trigger filters. This special data flow, based on event-size reduction, was created to maintain sensitivity to new light resonances decaying to jets or muons, with very small online and offline resources allocated to it. The challenges implied by this new workflow and the solutions developed within the CMS experiment are shown. This technique is now a standard ingredient for CMS data-taking strategy. The present status of data scouting in CMS is presented.
