Searches for exotic decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson performed with data collected by the CMS experiment are presented. Three classes of searches are detailed: searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson, searches for lepton flavor violating Higgs decays, and searches for decays to the Higgs boson to light pseudoscalars decaying to SM particle pairs. These analyses are based on data collected at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV.
