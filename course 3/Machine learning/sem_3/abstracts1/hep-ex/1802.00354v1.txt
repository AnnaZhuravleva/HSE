This review covers results of searches for new elementary particles that decay into boson pairs (dibosons), performed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at 7-, 8-, and 13-TeV center-of-mass energy until the year 2017. The available experimental results of the analysis of final states including most of the possible two-object combinations of W and Z bosons, photons, Higgs bosons, and gluons place stringent constraints on a variety of theoretical ideas that extend the standard model, pushing into the multi-TeV region the scale of allowed new physics phenomena.
