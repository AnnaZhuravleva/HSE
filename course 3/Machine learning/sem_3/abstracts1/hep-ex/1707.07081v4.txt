We present a measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters using three years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The DeepCore infill array in the center of IceCube enables detection and reconstruction of neutrinos produced by the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere at energies as low as $\sim5$ GeV. That energy threshold permits measurements of muon neutrino disappearance, over a range of baselines up to the diameter of the Earth, probing the same range of $L/E_\nu$ as long-baseline experiments but with substantially higher energy neutrinos. This analysis uses neutrinos from the full sky with reconstructed energies from $5.6$ - $56$ GeV. We measure $\Delta m^2_{32}=2.31^{+0.11}_{-0.13} \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{23}=0.51^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$, assuming normal neutrino mass ordering. These results are consistent with, and of similar precision to, those from accelerator and reactor-based experiments.
