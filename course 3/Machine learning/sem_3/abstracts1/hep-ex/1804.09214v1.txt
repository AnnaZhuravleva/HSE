The production cross-sections of $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV are measured with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $277 \pm 11$ $\rm pb^{-1}$ recorded by the LHCb experiment in 2015. The $\Upsilon$ mesons are reconstructed in the decay mode $\Upsilon\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. The differential production cross-sections times the dimuon branching fractions are measured as a function of the $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, and rapidity, $y$, over the range $0 < p_{\rm T}< 30$ GeV/c and $2.0 < y < 4.5$. The ratios of the cross-sections with respect to the LHCb measurement at $\sqrt{s}$= 8 TeV are also determined. The measurements are compared with theoretical predictions based on NRQCD.
