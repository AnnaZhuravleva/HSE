During the Run 2 period of the LHC, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have accumulated proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of around 3 fb$^{-1}$ in 2015 and 36 fb$^{-1}$ in 2016 at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. In the journey of finding new physics, it is of importance to understand the standard model which seems to be complete after the Higgs discovery. Precision tests must be performed in every corner of the phase space since new physics can appear in any different places. In this proceedings, measurements of the differential cross sections of global event variables from the top quark pair productions at the both experiments using the data collected during the Run 2 period by the time of the year 2016 are presented.
