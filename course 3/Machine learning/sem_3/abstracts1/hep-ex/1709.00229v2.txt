The most recent results on searches in lepton plus jet final states motivated by different models beyond the standard model are presented, using pp collision data collected by the ATLAS and CMS detectors during Run I and Run II at the CERN LHC. Leptoquarks and heavy Majorana neutrinos that arise in the left-right model are looked for in the final states with two leptons and two jets (ll + jj; l = e; mu; tau ). Heavy Majorana neutrinos are further investigated by relying on a composite-fermion scenario, considering two leptons and one large-radius jet (ll + J; l = e, mu), and in the context of a model with Type-1 seesaw mechanism, requiring two same-sign leptons plus dijet (ll' + jj; l,l' = e, mu). Finally, models of microscopic black holes with two to six extra dimensions are tested by analysing the channels with at least one lepton and two additional jets (l + jj; l = e, mu). In all the searches, the observed data are in good agreement with the standard model prediction and 95% confidence level upper limits are set on the parameters of difierent models.
