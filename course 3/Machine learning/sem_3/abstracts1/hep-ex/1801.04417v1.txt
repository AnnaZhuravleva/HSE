Many models beyond the standard model predict the existence of vector-like quarks or other types of heavy resonances. Using proton-proton collision data at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have performed a multitude of searches for pair and singly produced vector-like quarks decaying to W, Z, or Higgs bosons. Heavy gauge and (pseudo)scalar resonances decaying to top quarks have been searched for as well. No evidence for any of these hypothetical particles has been found yet, and stringent exclusion limits are derived on their masses, cross sections and couplings in various models.
