The helium standard of Japan, referred to as HESJ, is an inter-laboratory standard for the 3He/4He ratio. While the ratio of 3He and 4He of the HESJ was previously determined by a relative comparison to atmospheric helium, the absolute value of the 3He/4He ratio of the HESJ has not been directly determined yet. Therefore, it relays on the early measurements of that of atmospheric helium. The accuracy of the absolute 3He/4He ratios of the atmosphere and other working standards including HESJ is crucial in some applications of helium isotopes, such as tritium-3He dating, surface-exposure age determination based on cosmogenic 3He, and the accurate measurement of the neutron lifetime. In this work, new control samples of helium gases with 3He/4He ratios of 14, 28, and 42 ppm were fabricated with accuracy of 0.25-0.38% using a gas-handling system for a neutron lifetime experiment at Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). The relative 3He/4He ratios of these samples and the HESJ were measured using a magnetic-sector-type, single-focusing, noble gas mass spectrometer with a double collector system. As a result, the absolute 3He/4He ratio of the HESJ was determined as 27.36 +/- 0.11 ppm. The atmospheric 3He/4He ratio was determined as 1.340 +/- 0.006 ppm, based on this work and averaged 3He/4He ratio of the HESJ relative to the atmosphere (Ra) in the previous works. We recommend 1.364 +/- 0.010 ppm as the best estimate of the atmospheric 3He/4He ratio taking errors associated with the new result and reported ones so far into account.
