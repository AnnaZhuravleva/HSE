We have investigated the migration behaviors of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) in Earth and other terrestrial planets. Theoretical models of U and Th migration have been proposed. These models suggest that the unique features of Earth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and distribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative volatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form an enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the crusts through magmatism and metamorphism. We emphasize that the formation of an EZ of U, Th and other heat-producing elements is a prerequisite for the formation of a plate tectonic system. The heat-producing elements, currently mainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation and evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental crusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ can not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water. For this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these planets. We also emphasize the influence of U and Th in EZ on the development and evolution of life on Earth. We propose that since the Earth and planets were born in a united solar system, there should be some common mechanisms to create the similarities and differences between them. We have tried to develop an integrated view to explain some problems in the tectonics of Earth and evolution, bio-evolution, and planetary dynamics through U and Th geochemistry. We believe that a comprehensive exploration on energy sources and their evolution is a good way to build bridges between different disciplines of science in order to better understand the Earth and planets.
