We present a new rheological model depending on a real parameter $\nu \in [0,1]$ that reduces to the Maxwell body for $\nu=0$ and to the Becker body for $\nu=1$. The corresponding creep law is expressed in an integral form in which the exponential function of the Becker model is replaced and generalized by a Mittag-Leffler function of order $\nu$. Then, the corresponding non-dimensional creep function and its rate are studied as functions of time for different values of $\nu$ in order to visualize the transition from the classical Maxwell body to the Becker body. Based on the hereditary theory of linear viscoelasticity, we also approximate the relaxation function by solving numerically a Volterra integral equation of the second kind. In turn, the relaxation function is shown versus time for different values of $\nu$ to visualize again the transition from the classical Maxwell body to the Becker body. Furthermore, we provide a full characterization of the new model by computing, in addition to the creep and relaxation functions, the so-called specific dissipation $Q^{-1}$ as a function of frequency, which is of particularly relevance for geophysical applications
