A very strong period of 3592+-57 yrs in 10Be deposition rates from Vostok ice core raw data was detected and verified against concentration raw data at Taylor Dome and Vostok. Data show Hallstadzeit Solar cycle at 2296+-57 yrs, and indicate LaViolette period at 12500 yrs. The 99% confidence Gauss Vanicek spectral analysis was used, making data alteration avoidable thus enabling data separation that reflected cosmic ray background conditions at Galactic boundary. After the separation only the new period remains and converges, hence it is of extrasolar and Galactic origin. Since dominant spectral peaks from 10Be can only be explained by excesses in cosmic ray influx, the discovered signature indicates bursts occurring regularly in a single source. Based on recent sky surveys, Galactic Core makes the best candidate host for the bursts. A previously reported 3600 yrs period in geomagnetic field declinations means the discovered phase can overpower astronomical magnetic fields at distances such as Galactic Core to Earth. The epoch of the most recent 10Be maximum is estimated as 1085+-57, coinciding with 1054 to 1056 alleged account of Crab supernova. The next maximum 10Be on Earth is predicted in year 4463+-57, meaning Earth climate alternates due to geophysical or nonsolar cosmic forcing.
