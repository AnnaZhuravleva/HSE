A stochastic differential equation with coefficients defined in a scale of Hilbert spaces is considered. The existence and uniqueness of finite time solutions is proved by an extension of the Ovsyannikov method. This result is applied to a system of equations describing non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of (real-valued) spins of an infinite particle system on a typical realization of a Poisson or Gibbs point process in a Euclidean space.
