In this work we derive a simple argument which shows that Gabor systems consisting of odd functions of $d$ variables and symplectic lattices of density $2^d$ cannot constitute a Gabor frame. In the 1--dimensional, separable case, this is a special case of a result proved by Lyubarskii and Nes, however, we use a different approach in this work exploiting the algebraic relation between the ambiguity function and the Wigner distribution as well as their relation given by the (symplectic) Fourier transform. Also, we do not need the assumption that the lattice is separable and, hence, new restrictions are added to the full frame set of odd functions.
