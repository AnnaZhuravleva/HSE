It is known that complementary oblique projections $\hat{P}_0 + \hat{P}_1 = I$ on a Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$ have the same standard operator norm $\|\hat{P}_0\| = \|\hat{P}_1\|$ and the same singular values, but for the multiplicity of $0$ and $1$. We generalize these results to Hilbert spaces endowed with a positive-definite metric $G$ on top of the scalar product. Our main result is that the volume elements (pseudodeterminants $\det_+$) of the metrics $L_0,L_1$ induced by $G$ on the complementary oblique subspaces $\mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_0 \oplus \mathscr{H}_1$, and of those $\mathit{\Gamma}_0,\mathit{\Gamma}_1$ induced on their algebraic duals, obey the relations \begin{align} \frac{\det_+ L_1}{\det_+ \mathit{\Gamma}_0} = \frac{\det_+ L_0}{\det_+ \mathit{\Gamma}_1} = {\det}_+ G. \nonumber \end{align} Furthermore, we break this result down to eigenvalues, proving a "supersymmetry" of the two operators $\sqrt{\mathit{\Gamma}_0 L_0}$ and $\sqrt{L_1 \mathit{\Gamma}_1}$. We connect the former result to a well-known duality property of the weighted-spanning-tree polynomials in graph theory and the latter to the mesh analysis of electrical resistor circuits driven by either voltage or current generators. We conclude with some speculations about an over-arching notion of duality that encompasses mathematics and physics.
