We give a method to construct Poisson brackets $\{\cdot,\cdot\}$ on Banach manifolds~$M$, for which the value of $\{f,g\}$ at some point $m\in M$ may depend on higher order derivatives of the smooth functions $f,g\colon M\to{\mathbb R}$, and not only on the first-order derivatives, as it is the case on all finite-dimensional manifolds. We discuss specific examples in this connection, as well as the impact on the earlier research on Poisson geometry of Banach manifolds. Those brackets are counterexamples to the claim that the Leibniz property for any Poisson bracket on a Banach manifold would imply the existence of a Poisson tensor for that bracket.
