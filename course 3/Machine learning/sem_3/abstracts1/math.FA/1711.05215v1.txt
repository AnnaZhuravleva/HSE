We study continuity properties in Lebesgue spaces for a class of Fourier integral operators arising in the study of the Boltzmann equation. The phase has a H\"older-type singularity at the origin. We prove boundedness in $L^1$ with a precise loss of decay depending on the H\"older exponent, and we show by counterexamples that a loss occurs even in the case of smooth phases. The results can be seen as a quantitative version of the Beurling-Helson theorem for changes of variables with a H\"older singularity at the origin. The continuity in $L^2$ is studied as well by providing sufficient conditions and relevant counterexamples. The proofs rely on techniques from Time-frequency Analysis.
