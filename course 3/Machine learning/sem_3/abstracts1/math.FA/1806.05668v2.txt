We consider a family of norms (called operator E-norms) on the algebra $B(H)$ of all bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space $H$ induced by a positive densely defined operator $G$ on $H$. Each norm of this family produces the same topology on $B(H)$ depending on $G$. By choosing different generating operator $G$ one can obtain operator E-norms producing different topologies, in particular, the strong operator topology on bounded subsets of $B(H)$. We obtain a generalised version of the Kretschmann-Schlingemann-Werner theorem, which shows continuity of the Stinespring representation of CP linear maps w.r.t. the energy-constrained $cb$-norm (diamond norm) on the set of CP maps and the operator E-norm on the set of Stinespring operators. We describe two Banach spaces: the completion of $B(H)$ w.r.t. the operator E-norm and the maximal extension of $B(H)$ on which the operator E-norms are well defined. Some results concerning extensions of energy-limited quantum channels and operations to unbounded observables are presented in the last part of the paper.
