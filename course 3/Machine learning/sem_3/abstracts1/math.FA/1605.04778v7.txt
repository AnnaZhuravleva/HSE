We introduce the semiclassical, or Wigner, measures associated to regular states that act on the tensor product of a unitary C*-representation of the Heisenberg group of arbitrary dimension, and a C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$. The Wigner measures are identified with the cluster points of (generalized) sequences of regular states, indexed by the semiclassical parameter $h\to 0$. All the measures are vector-valued, with values in the positive continuous functionals of $\mathfrak{A}$. If the Heisenberg group is infinite dimensional, the Wigner measures are cylindrical measures, i.e. finitely additive measures on the algebra of (dual) cylinders. Our analysis shows that, for infinite-dimensional Heisenberg groups, the semiclassical structure that emerges in the limit is richer than in the finite-dimensional case. Some examples and physical applications to both non-relativistic and relativistic quantum field theories are discussed.
