The Bargmann-Fock-Segal space plays an important role in mathematical physics, and has been extended into a number of directions. In the present paper we imbed this space into a Gelfand triple. The spaces forming the Fr\'echet part (i.e. the space of test functions) of the triple are characterized both in a geometric way and in terms of the adjoint of multiplication by the complex variable, using the Stirling numbers of the second kind. The dual of the space of test functions has a topological algebra structure, of the kind introduced and studied by the first named author and G. Salomon.
