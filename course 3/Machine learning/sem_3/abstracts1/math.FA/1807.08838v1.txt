We prove a version of Talagrand's concentration inequality for subordinated sub-Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold using tools from noncommutative geometry. As an application, motivated by quantum information theory, we show that on a finite dimensional matrix algebra the set of self-adjoint generators satisfying a tensor stable modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality is dense.
