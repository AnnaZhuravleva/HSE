We generalize Lyapunov's convexity theorem for classical (scalar-valued) measures to quantum (operator-valued) measures. In particular, we show that the range of a nonatomic quantum probability measure is a weak$^*$-closed convex set of quantum effects (positive operators whose eigenvalues are less than or equal to one). To prove the operator-valued version of Lyapunov's theorem, we must first define the notions of essentially bounded, essential support, and essential range for quantum random variables (Borel measurable functions from a set to the bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space).
