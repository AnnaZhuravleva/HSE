In this note, two decompositions for dissipative linear relations are given on the basis of Sz. Nagy-Foia\c{s}-Langer and the von Neumann-Wold decompositions. The obtained decompositions permit the separation of the selfadjoint and completely nonselfadjoint parts of a dissipative relation and some refinements of this splitting up. The decomposition is realized by transforming invariant subspaces for contractions into their corresponding parts for dissipative relations by means of the Z transform.
