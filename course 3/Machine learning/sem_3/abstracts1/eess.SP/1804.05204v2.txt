This paper is about the surprising connection between the Fourier heat equation and the Schr\"odinger wave equation. In fact, if the independent "time" variable in the heat equation is replaced by the time variable multiplied by $i=\sqrt{-1}$, the heat equation becomes the Schr\"odinger equation. Two quite different physical phenomena are put in close connection: the heat diffusion in a material and the probability amplitude of particles in an atom. It is a fact of life that the movements of a small particle floating randomly in a fluid, the well-known Brownian motion, is regulated by the Fourier equation while the probabilistic behavior of the matter around us, the quantum world, is driven by the Schr\"odinger equation but no known stochastic process seems at work here. The apparent simplicity of the formal connection by a "time-rotation", a Wick rotation as it is commonly known, seems to point otherwise. Why this connection? Is there any physical intuitive explanation? Is there any practical value? In this paper, the authors attempt to shed some light on the above questions. The recent concept of volume quantization in noncommutative geometry, due to Connes, Chamseddine and Mukhanov, points again to stochastic processes also underlying the quantum world making Fourier and Schr\"oodinger strict relatives.
