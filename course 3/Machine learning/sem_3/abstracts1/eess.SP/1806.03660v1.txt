Superconducting quantum computer is manufactured based on semiconductor process which makes qubits integration possible. At the same time, this kind of qubit exhibits high performance fidelity, de-coherence time, scalability and requires a programmable arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). This paper presents implementation of an AWG which composed of two gigabit samples per second (GSPS) sampling rate, 16 bit vertical resolution digital to analog converters (DACs). The AWG integrated with separate microwave devices onto a metal plate for the scale-up consideration. A special waveform sequence output controller is designed to realize seamless waveform switching and arbitrary waveform generator. The jitter in multiple AWG channels is around 10ps, Integral nonlinearity (INL) as well as differential nonlinearity (DNL) is about 2 LSB, and the qubit performance of the de-coherence time (T2*) achieved 33% promotion over that of a commercial 1 GSPS, 14 bit AWG.
