Superconducting quantum computers (SQC) can solve some specific problems which are deeply believed to be intractable for classical computers. The control and measurement of qubits can't go on without the synchronous operation of digital-to-analog converters (DAC) array and the controlled sampling of analog-to-digital converters (ADC). In this paper, a scalable self-adaptive synchronous triggering system is proposed to ensure the synchronized operation of multiple qubits. The skew of the control signal between different qubits is less than 25 ps. After upgrading the clock design, the 250 MHz single-tone phase noise of DAC has been increased about 15 dB. The phase noise of the 6.25 GHz qubit control signal has an improvement of about 6 dB.
