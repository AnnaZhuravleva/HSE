At the heart of the issue of quantizing general relativity lies the puzzling question of defining a version of space-time diffeomorphisms compatible with the Planck length $\ell_{P}$. Implementing continuous space-time symmetries while preserving a universal minimal length scale seem to be two conflicting fundamental aspects of quantum gravity. We explore this problematic in the context of the simplest cosmological model consisting of a massless scalar field minimally coupled to flat Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker homogeneous cosmology. This gravitational system exhibits a scale invariance, which can be extended to a symmetry under the one-dimensional conformal group SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$). Working within the polymer quantization framework inspired by loop quantum cosmology (LQC), one modifies the cosmological model by introducing the minimal length scale prior to quantization. After noticing that the standard approach to LQC fails to preserve the scale invariance, we show how to preserve the SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) symmetry at the quantum level by a suitable non-linear redefinition of scale transformations. This provides a non-trivial example of a consistent scale-invariant quantum gravitational system with a universal minimal length scale.
