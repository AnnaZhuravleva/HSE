We consider the piecewise flat spacetime and a simplicial analog of the Palatini form of the general relativity (GR) action where the discrete Christoffel symbols are given on the tetrahedra as variables that are independent of the metric. Excluding these variables classically gives exactly the Regge action.   This paper continues our previous work. Now we include the parity violation term and the analogue of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter introduced in the orthogonal connection form of GR. We consider the path integral and the functional integration over connection. The result of the latter (for certain limiting cases of some parameters) is compared with the earlier found result of the functional integration over connection for the analogous {\it orthogonal} connection representation of Regge action.   These results, mainly as some measures on the lengths/areas, are discussed for the possibility of the diagram technique where the perturbative diagrams for the Regge action calculated using the measure obtained are finite. This finiteness is due to these measures providing elementary lengths being mostly bounded and separated from zero, just as finiteness of a theory on a lattice with an analogous probability distribution of spacings.
