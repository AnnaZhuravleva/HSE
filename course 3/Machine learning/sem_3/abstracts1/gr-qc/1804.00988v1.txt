A self--sustained traversable wormhole is obtained as a vacuum solution of a scale-dependent gravitational theory. Comparison with other approaches towards wormhole self--sustainability are presented, with emphasis on the running of the gravitational coupling and on a possible effective description of gravity near the Planck scale.
