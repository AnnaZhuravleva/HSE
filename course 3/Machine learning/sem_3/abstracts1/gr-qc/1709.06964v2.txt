Recently, in a series of papers, we established the existence and found a general solution for the simultaneously rotating and twisting locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes in general relativity, which can model inhomogeneous and dynamic astrophysical bodies. However, these spacetimes necessarily require imperfect fluids with entropy flux. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the existence of these spacetimes in generic f(R)-gravity models, where the entropy flux is generated purely by higher order curvature effects, while the standard matter still remains a perfect fluid. However, we transparently demonstrate here, that the symmetries of these spacetimes force the theory to be general relativity. This is a novel study that shows how the geometrical properties of a spacetime can be used to restrict the theories of gravity.
