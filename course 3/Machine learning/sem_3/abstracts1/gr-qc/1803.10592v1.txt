This essay aims at emphasizing the potential of a synergy between quantum gravity and the quantum computing technologies. Such a combination would be beneficial for both understanding the Planck scale physics and the stimulation of development of the quantum technologies. This is especially important in the present early days of commercial quantum computers, when challenges originating from the basic research may catalyze the technological progress. Our attention is focused on simulations of a Planck scale system with the use of existing adiabatic quantum computers. Current possibilities, technological challenges and prospects for the future are outlined.
