Since Lorentz invariance plays an important role in modern physics, it is of interest to test the possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). The time-lag (the arrival time delay between light curves in different energy bands) of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively used to this end. However, to our best knowledge, one or more particular cosmological models were assumed {\it a priori} in (almost) all of the relevant works in the literature. So, this makes the results on LIV in those works model-dependent and hence not so robust in fact. In the present work, we try to avoid this problem by using a model-independent approach. We calculate the time delay induced by LIV with the cosmic expansion history given in terms of cosmography, without assuming any particular cosmological model. Then, we constrain the possible LIV with the observational data, and find weak hints for LIV.
