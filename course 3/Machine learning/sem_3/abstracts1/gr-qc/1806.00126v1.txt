Reflection features commonly observed in the X-ray spectrum of black holes can be used to probe the strong gravity region around these objects. In this paper, we extend previous work in the literature and we employ the first full emission model for relativistic reflection in non-Kerr spacetime to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. We analyze a composite spectrum from the detector RXTE PCU-2 of the stellar-mass black hole GX 339-4 in its brightest hard state. With an unprecedented sensitivity of $\sim0.1\%$ and 40 million counts to capture the faint features in the reflection spectrum, we demonstrate that it is possible with existing data and an adequate model to place constraints on the black hole spin $a_*$ and the Johannsen deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$. For a Kerr black hole of general relativity, $\alpha_{13}=0$. Our measurement, which should be regarded as principally a proof of concept, is $a_*=0.92^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ and $\alpha_{13}=-0.76^{+0.78}_{-0.60}$ with a 90% confidence level and is consistent with the hypothesis that the compact object in GX 339-4 is a Kerr black hole.
