Nonlocal cosmological models are studied extensively in recent times because of their interesting cosmological consequences. In this paper, we have analyzed background cosmology on a class of non-local models which are motivated by the perturbative nature of gravity at infrared scale. We show that inflationary solutions are possible in all constructed non-local models. However, exit from inflation to RD era is not possible in most of the models.
