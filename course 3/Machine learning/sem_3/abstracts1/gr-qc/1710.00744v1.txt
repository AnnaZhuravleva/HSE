In the membrane paradigm of black holes, it is usually assumed that the normal vector of the stretched horizon has a vanishing acceleration. This assumption breaks down for black bottles, a class of solutions discovered recently in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime. In this paper, the membrane paradigm is generalized to the stretched horizon with a nonvanishing acceleration of normal vector, and then it is applied to the static black bottle. In this example, the membrane stress tensor and the fluid quantities are similar to those of black holes, while the fluid continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equation are well satisfied in the near-horizon limit.
