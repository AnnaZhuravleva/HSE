We give a full analysis of the conservation along null surfaces of generalized energy and super-momenta, for gravitational systems enclosed by a finite boundary. In particular we interpret the conservation equations in a canonical manner, revealing a notion of symplectic potential and a boundary current intrinsic to null surfaces. This generalizes similar analyses done at asymptotic infinity or on horizons.
