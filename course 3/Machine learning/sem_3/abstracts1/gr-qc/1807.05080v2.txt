In continuation of a preceding work on introducing asymmetric thin-shell wormholes as an emerging class of traversable wormholes within the context, this time cylindrically symmetric spacetimes are exploited to construct such wormholes. Having established a generic formulation, first the Linet-Tian metric generally, and then the cosmic string metric and a black string metric in greater details are studied as constructing blocks of cylindrical asymmetric thin-shell wormholes. The corresponding wormholes are investigated within the linearized stability analysis framework to firstly, demonstrate that they can exist from the mechanical stability point of view, and secondly, indicate the correlation between the stability and symmetry in each case, if there is any at all. From here, we have extracted a pattern for the way stability changes with the asymmetry degree for the two examples; however, it was observed that the symmetric state is not the most neither the less stable state. There are also some side results: It was learned that any cylindrical thin-shell wormhole made of two cosmic string universes cannot be supported by a barotropic equation of state. Furthermore, as another side outcome, it was perceived that the radius dependency of the so-called variable equation of state, which is used all over this article, has a great impact on the mechanical stability of the cylindrical asymmetric thin-shell wormholes studied in this brief.
