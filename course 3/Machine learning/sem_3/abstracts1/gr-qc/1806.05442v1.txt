Stationary axisymmetric binary configurations of unequal Kerr sources with a massless strut among them are developed in a physical representation. In order to describe interacting black holes, the axis conditions in the most general case are solved analytically deriving the corresponding $5$-parametric asymptotically flat exact solution. In addition, we obtain concise formulas for the black hole horizons, the interaction force, as well as the thermodynamical characteristics of each source in terms of physical Komar parameters: mass $M_{i}$, angular momentum $J_{i}$, and coordinate distance $R$, where such parameters are contained inside of the coefficients of a cubic equation which can be interpreted as a dynamical law for interacting black holes with struts. Some limits are obtained and discussed.
