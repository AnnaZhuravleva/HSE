The topological charge of a maximally symmetric black hole naturally arise in holography, which can be viewed as the last (lost) charge of the black hole in the sense that it together with all other known charges satisfies the Gibbs-Duhem-like relation as a completeness relation. It is then observed that this topological charge fits perfectly into the black hole thermodynamics from two different appoaches, not only in Einstein's gravity, but also in the general Lovelock-Maxwell theory. The generalization of the topological charge to black holes beyond the maximally symmetric case is discussed.
