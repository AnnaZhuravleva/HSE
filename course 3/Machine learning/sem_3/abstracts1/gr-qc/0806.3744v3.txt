This paper aims to show the possibility of the existence of super-massive compact objects with radii less than the Schwarzschild one, which is one of the principal consequences of the author's geodesic-invariant gravitation equations (Ann. Phys. (Berlin), 17 (2008) 28). The physical interpretation of the solutions of the equations is based on the conclusion that only an aggregate "space-time geometry + used reference frame" has a physical sense.
