In this paper, we explore the final stages of the black hole evaporation for Hayward solutions. Our results show that the behavior of Hawking's radiation changes considerably at the small radii regime such that the black hole does not evaporate completely and a stable remnant is left. We show that stability conditions hold for the Hayward solutions found in the Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics. We analyse the effect that an inspired model of the noncommutativity of spacetime can have on the thermodynamics of Hayward spacetimes. This has been done by applying the noncommutative effects to the non-rotating and rotating Hayward black holes. In this setup, all point structures get replaced by smeared distributions owing to this inspired approach. The noncommutative effects result in a colder black hole in the small radii regime as Hayward's free parameter $g$ increases. As well as the effects of noncommutativity and the rotation factor, the configuration of the remnant can be substantially affected by the parameter $g$. However, in the rotating solution it is not so sensitive to $g$ with respect to the non-rotating case. As a consequence, Hayward's parameter, the noncommutativity and the rotation may raise the minimum value of energy for the possible formation of black holes in TeV-scale collisions. This observation can be used as a potential explanation for the absence of black holes in the current energy scales produced at particle colliders. However, it is also found that if extra dimensions do exist, then the possibility of the black hole production at energy scales accessible at the LHC for large numbers of extra dimensions will be larger.
