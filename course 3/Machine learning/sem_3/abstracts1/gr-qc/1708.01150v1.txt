Theoretical arguments and cosmological observations suggest that Einstein's theory of general relativity needs to be modified at high energies. One of the best motivated higher-curvature extensions of general relativity is Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, in which a scalar field is coupled to quadratic curvature invariants. This theory is inspired by an effective string-theory model and its predictions dramatically differ from Einstein's theory in high-curvature regions - such as the interior of black holes and the early universe - where it aims at resolving curvature singularities. In this work we derive cosmological solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity for quadratic and for exponential coupling functions, and for any spatial curvature. We discuss already known solutions and find new nonsingular, inflationary, and bouncing solutions. We study the linear stability of these solutions and the absence of ghosts, finding that all the aforementioned solutions are unstable against tensor perturbations. We then introduce a simple, quadratic potential for the scalar field. In some cases the presence of a mass term cures the tensor instability. The proposed model is therefore a viable and attractive candidate for inflation, and one in which the scalar field is naturally provided by the gravitational sector.
