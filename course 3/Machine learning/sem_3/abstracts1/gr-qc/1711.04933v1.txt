Quantum cosmology of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model with cosmological constant in the Ho$\check{\rm r}$ava-Lifshitz type gravity is studied in the phase space by means of the Wigner function. The conditions for a tunneling solution are analyzed where the modification of the usual general relativity description by the Ho$\check{\rm r}$ava-Lifshitz type gravity induce a new scenario for the origin of the universe without an initial singularity. In addition, in this new scenario an embryonic era is possible for the universe where it can exist classically before the tunneling process takes place and which gives rise to the current evolution of the universe. The Wigner functions corresponding to the Hartle-Hawking, Vilenkin and Linde boundary conditions are obtained employing numerical calculations. In particular three cases were studied, with and without initial singularity and where a barrier of potential is not present. The quantum behavior of these three cases are analyzed using the Wigner function for the three boundary conditions considered.
