The 5-dimensional (5d) Birkhoff theorem gives the class of 5d vacuum space-times containing spatial hypersurfaces with cosmological symmetries. This theorem is violated by the 5d vacuum Gergely-Maartens (GM) space-time, which is not a representant of the above class, but contains the static Einstein brane as embedded hypersurface. We prove that the 5d Birkhoff theorem is still satisfied in a weaker sense: the GM space-time is related to the degenerated horizon metric of certain black-hole space-times of the allowed class. This result resembles the connection between the Bertotti-Robinson space-time and the horizon region of the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom space-time in general relativity.
