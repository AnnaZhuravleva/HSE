This paper explores the non-equilibrium behavior of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of isotropic and homogeneous universe model in $f(\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity ($\mathcal{G}$ and $T$ represent the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively). We construct the corresponding field equations and analyze the first as well as generalized second law of thermodynamics in this scenario. It is found that an auxiliary term corresponding to entropy production appears due to the non-equilibrium picture of thermodynamics in first law. The universal condition for the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics is also obtained. Finally, we check the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics for the reconstructed $f(\mathcal{G},T)$ models (de Sitter and power-law solutions). We conclude that this law holds for suitable choices of free parameters.
