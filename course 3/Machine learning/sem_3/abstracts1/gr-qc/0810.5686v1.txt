We adopt methods from statistical field theory to stochastic inflation. For the example of a free test field in de Sitter and power-law inflation, the power spectrum of long-wavelength fluctuations is computed. We study its dependence on the shape of the filter that separates long from short wavelength modes. While for filters with infinite support the phenomenon of dimensional reductions is found on large super-horizon scales, filters with compact support return a scale-invariant power spectrum in the infra-red. Features of the power spectrum, induced by the filter, decay within a few e-foldings. Thus the late-time power spectrum is independent of the filter details.
