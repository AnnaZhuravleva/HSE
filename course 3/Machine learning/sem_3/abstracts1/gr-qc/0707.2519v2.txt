We match collapsing inhomogeneous as well as spatially homogeneous but anisotropic spacetimes to vacuum static exteriors with a negative cosmological constant and planar or hyperbolic symmetry. The collapsing interiors include the inhomogeneous solutions of Szekeres and of Barnes, which in turn include the Lemaitre-Tolman and the McVittie solutions. The collapse can result in toroidal or higher genus asymptotically AdS black holes.
