An algorithm is given for explicitly computing Penrose diagrams for spacetimes of the form $ds^2 = -f(r)\, dt^2 + f(r)^{-1} \, dr^2 + r^2 \, d\Omega^2$. The resulting diagram coordinates are shown to extend the metric continuously and nondegenerately across an arbitrary number of horizons. The method is extended to include piecewise approximations to dynamically evolving spacetimes using a standard hypersurface junction procedure. Examples generated by an implementation of the algorithm are shown for standard and new cases. In the appendix, this algorithm is compared to existing methods.
