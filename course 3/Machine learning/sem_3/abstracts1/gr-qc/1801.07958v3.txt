An interesting proposal has recently been made to extend massive gravity models beyond dRGT by a disformal transformation of the metric. In this Letter we want to note that it can be viewed as a mimetic extension of dRGT gravity which enormously simplifies the Hamiltonian analysis. In particular, pure gravity sector is equivalent to the usual dRGT gravity coupled to a constrained scalar field. And we also give some comments about possible matter couplings.
