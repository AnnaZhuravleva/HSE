Feldbrugge, Lehners and Turok argue that large perturbations render the no-boundary proposal for the origin of the universe ill-defined (PRL 119, 171301 (2017) and PRD 97, 023509 (2018)). We refute this claim by evaluating the no-boundary path integral exactly in a Bianchi IX minisuperspace with two scale factors. In this model the no-boundary proposal can be implemented by requiring one scale factor to be zero initially together with a judiciously chosen regularity condition on the momentum conjugate to the second scale factor. Taking into account the non-linear backreaction of the perturbations we recover the predictions of the original semiclassical no-boundary proposal. In particular we find that large perturbations are strongly suppressed.
