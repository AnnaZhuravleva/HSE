A new Vaidya-type generalisation of Kerr space-time is constructed by requiring the Kerr mass and angular momentum per unit mass to depend upon a variable which has a simple geometrical origin. The matter distribution introduced in this way radiates mass and angular momentum at future null infinity. The Vaidya generalisation of the Schwarzschild space-time is a special case of the newly found solution.
