Neutral test particles around a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external uniform magnetic field have no interactions of electromagnetic forces, but their motions can be chaotic. This chaotic behavior is induced owing to the gravitational effect of the magnetic field leading to the nonintegrability of the magnetized Ernst-Schwarzschild spacetime geometry. In fact, chaos is strengthened typically with an increase of the energy or the magnetic field under appropriate circumstances. When these test particles have charges, the electromagnetic forces are included. As a result, the electromagnetic forces have an effect on strengthening or weakening the extent of chaos caused by the gravitational effect of the magnetic field.
