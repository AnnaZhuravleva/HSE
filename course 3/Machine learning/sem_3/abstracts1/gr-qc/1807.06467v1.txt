This paper is devoted to study the cosmological behavior of homogeneous and isotropic universe model in the context of $f(R,T^{\varphi})$ gravity where $\varphi$ is the scalar field. For this purpose, we follow the first order formalism defined by $H=W(\varphi)$. We evaluate Hubble parameter, effective equation of state parameter $(\omega^{eff})$, deceleration parameter and potential of scalar field for three different values of $W(\varphi)$. We obtain phantom era in some cases for the early times. It is found that exponential expression of $W(\varphi)$ yields $\omega^{eff}$ independent of time for flat universe and independent of model parameter otherwise. It is concluded that our model corresponds to $\Lambda$CDM for both initial as well as late times.
