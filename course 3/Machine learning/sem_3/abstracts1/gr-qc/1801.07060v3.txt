A small compact object spiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) forms an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). It is one of the most important sources of gravitational waves (GWs) because the waveform is several months long and contains rich information about the space-time geometry of the SMBH. Recently, we have shown that the small bodies in EMRIs could be binary black holes (BBHs). In this Letter we demonstrate that these binary-EMRIs (b-EMRIs) emit both $10^2$ Hz and $10^{-3}$ Hz GWs at the same time, and hence are ideal targets for future joint observations using both ground- and space-based GW detectors, because the BBHs would coalesce into single black holes (BHs) at a small distance from the SMBHs. Since the coalescence induces a large recoil velocity to the post-merger remnants, we propose a novel method of detecting b-EMRIs by looking for glitches in the waveforms of EMRIs and cross-correlating them with LIGO/Virgo events. The detection, in turn, can be used to measure the magnitude and direction of the recoil velocity to a precision as high as $(0.3-0.4)\%$, as well as constrain the mass loss due to the GW radiation to a precision of $0.1\%$.
