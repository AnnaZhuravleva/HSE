Hamilton-Jacobi formalism as a powerful method is being utilized to reconsider warm inflationary scenario, where the scalar field as the main component deriving inflation interacts with other field. Separating the context to strong and weak dissipative regimes, the goal is followed for two popular function of dissipation coefficient. Applying slow-rolling approximations, the required perturbation parameters are extracted and by comparison to the latest Planck data, the free parameters are restricted. Possibility of producing an acceptable inflation is studied where the result shows that for all cases the model could successfully suggests amplitude of scalar perturbation, scalar spectral index , its running, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
