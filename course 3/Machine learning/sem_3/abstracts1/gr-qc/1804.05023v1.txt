We study for the first time how a new class of stars could impact an ensemble of pulsars with known masses and spin-periods. These new compact objects are strange stars admixed with condensed dark matter. In this exploratory theoretical work, our goal is to determine how the basic parameters of pulsars are modified for such a new class of compact objects. In particular we consider three different scenarios that correspond to a dark matter mass fraction of $~5\%$, $~11\%$ and $~25\%$. Within each scenario with fixed parameters we predict theoretically other properties of the pulsars, such as the radius, the compactness, the moment of inertia, as well as the angular momentum. Our numerical results are summarized in tables and also shown graphically for better visualization, where a comparison between the different scenarios can be made.
