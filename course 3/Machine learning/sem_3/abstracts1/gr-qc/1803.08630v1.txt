The $f(R,T)$ gravity theory was proposed as an extension of the $f(R)$ theories, for which besides geometrical correction terms, proportional to the Ricci scalar $R$, one has also material correction terms, proportional to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Those material extra terms prevent the energy-momentum tensor of the theory to be conserved. In the present letter we consider discrete time evolution and energy non-conservation in non-commutative physics, that is a result of non-commutative geometry and index theory in which the coordinate functions are non-commutative. As a result we find a link between the energy non-conservation in $f(R,T)$ gravity with non-commutative quantum theory, i.e., we obtain further insights about that semi-quantum gravity mechanism which improves Einstein gravity. Our predictions corroborate with the existing literature in the physics and phenomenology of non-commutative theory and $f(R,T)$ gravity.
