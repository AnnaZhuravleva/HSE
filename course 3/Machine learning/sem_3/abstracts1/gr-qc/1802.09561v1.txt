An explicit AdS/CFT correspondence is shown for the Lie group $SO(4,2)$. The Lie symmetry structures allow for the construction of two physical theories through the tools of Cartan geometry. One is a gravitational theory that has anti-de Sitter symmetry. The other is also a gravitational theory but is conformally symmetric and lives on 8-dimensional biconformal space. These "extra" four dimensions have the degrees of freedom used to construct a Yang-Mills theory. The two theories, based on AdS or conformal symmetry, have a natural correspondence in the context of their Lie algebras alone where neither SUSY, nor holography, is necessary.
