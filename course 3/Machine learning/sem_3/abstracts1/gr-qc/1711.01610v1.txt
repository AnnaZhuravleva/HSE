We investigate black holes with toroidal horizons in (d +1)-dimensional space-time. Using the solution phase space method, we calculated conserved charges for these black holes before exploring some features of this metric including its entropy and thermodynamic quantities. Another aspect of the study involves obtaining a general exact static interior solution for uncharged black holes with toroidal horizons in (d+1)-dimensional space-time. Finally, an interior solution for charged black holes is obtained.
