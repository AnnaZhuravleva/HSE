The action of the field theory is a generating functional for the equations of physics. It is introduced axiomatically by the kernel of the evolution equation. Mathematical consistency requires the lower limit of the defining proper time integral have an arbitrary positive value. This limit introduces into the dimensionless field theory the physical scale (the characteristic length), which relates geometrical orders of the action. The action is finite in all orders and nonlocal starting from the second order. Its two lowest (local) orders correspond to the cosmological constant term and the Einstein-Hilbert action of gravitation that confirm the Sakharov-DeWitt mechanism of the induced gravity. No absolute values of physical quantities are special in the field theory, therefore, the Planck scale (the Planck length etc) has no physical significance, as elucidated by the New SI of physical units. It is shown that the dimensional regularization technique is an ill-defined procedure, while regularization and renormalization are not needed for phenomenological physical theories.
