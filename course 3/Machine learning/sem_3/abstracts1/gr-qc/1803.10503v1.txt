Inspired by our recent works on information paradox in black holes, which exploit various foundational intricacies of quantum mechanics, here we propose a novel connection between the spacetime geometry and quantum entanglement of matter fields "living" in that geometry. We highlight, as a natural consequence of those studies, that gravitational field might have a natural tendency of reducing entanglement between two quantum states.
