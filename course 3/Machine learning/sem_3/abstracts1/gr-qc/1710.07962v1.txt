We review (anti)evaporation phenomena within the context of quantum gravity and extended theories of gravity. The (anti)evaporation effect is an instability of the black hole horizon discovered in many different scenarios: quantum dilaton-gravity, $f(R)$-gravity, $f(T)$-gravity, string inspired black holes and brane-world cosmology. Evaporating and antievaporating black holes seem to have completely different thermodynamical features compared to standard semiclassical black holes. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to conceptual and technical aspects of (anti)evaporation effects, while discussing problems that are still open.
