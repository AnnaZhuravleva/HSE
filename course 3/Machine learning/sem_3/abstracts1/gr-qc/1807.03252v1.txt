In this paper we show that any static and spherically symmetric anisotropic solution of the Einstein Field Equations can be thought as a system sourced by certain deformed isotropic system in the context of Minimal Geometric Deformation-decoupling approach. As an example, we implement the method to obtain the sources of a simple static anisotropic and spherically symmetric traversable wormhole.
