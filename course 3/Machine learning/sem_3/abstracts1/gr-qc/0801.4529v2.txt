We perform a study of cosmic evolution with an equation of state parameter $\omega(t)=\omega_0+\omega_1(t\dot H/H)$ by selecting a phenomenological $\Lambda$ model of the form, $\dot\Lambda\sim H^3$. This simple proposition explains both linearly expanding and inflationary Universes with a single set of equations. We notice that the inflation leads to a scaling in the equation of state parameter, $\omega(t)$, and hence in equation of state. In this approach, one of its two parameters have been pin pointed and the other have been delineated. It has been possible to show a connection between dark energy and Higgs-Boson.
