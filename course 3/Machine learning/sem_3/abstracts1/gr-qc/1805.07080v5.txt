Twisted gravitational waves (TGWs) are nonplanar waves with twisted rays that move along a fixed direction in space. We study further the physical characteristics of a recent class of Ricci-flat solutions of general relativity representing TGWs with wave fronts that have negative Gaussian curvature. In particular, we investigate the influence of TGWs on the polarization of test electromagnetic waves and on the motion of classical spinning test particles in such radiation fields. To distinguish the polarization effects of twisted waves from plane waves, we examine the theoretical possibility of existence of spin-twist coupling and show that this interaction is generally consistent with our results.
