In this work we explore under a holographic approach the dark energy - dark matter interaction in a non-flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime, with a cut-off for the dark energy component given in terms of the Hubble scale. Based on results coming from the use of observational data, we consider a positive interaction $Q$-term together with a Chevallier-Polarsky-Linder type parametrization for the coincidence parameter, we realize that the model admits a Type III future singularity, in this singular universe we have that for a null value of the curvature parameter its scale factor is a constant value. With the use of some cosmological parameters constrained with observational data, we obtain that the crossing of the phantom divide is possible. Once the singular nature is obtained for the model, its Statefinder diagnosis reveals a behavior that is {\it far} from the $\Lambda$-CDM model.
