Observation shows that the velocities of stars grow by approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude when the distances from the centers of the galaxies are in the range of $0.5$ kpc to $82.3$ kpc, before they begin to tend to a constant value. Up to know, the reason for this behavior is still a matter for debate. In this work, we propose a model which adequately describes this unusual behavior using a (nearly) cylindrical symmetrical solution in the framework of a scalar-tensor-like (the Brans-Dicke model) theory of gravity.
