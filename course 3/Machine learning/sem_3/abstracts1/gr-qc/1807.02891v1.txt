We discuss an extended Teleparallel gravity models comprising functions of scalar invariants constructed by torsion, torsion Gauss-Bonnet and boundary terms. We adopt the Noether Symmetry Approach to select the functional forms, the first integrals and, eventually, the exact solutions of the dynamics in the context of flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker cosmology. Standard perfect fluid matter, minimally coupled to geometry, is considered. Several physically consistent models are derived with related exact solutions.
