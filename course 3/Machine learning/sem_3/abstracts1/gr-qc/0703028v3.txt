We revisit the problem of the emission of gravitational waves from a test mass orbiting and thus perturbing a Kerr black hole. The source term of the Teukolsky perturbation equation contains a Dirac delta function which represents a point particle. We present a technique to effectively model the delta function and its derivatives using as few as four points on a numerical grid. The source term is then incorporated into a code that evolves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain as a (2+1) dimensional PDE. The waveforms and energy fluxes are extracted far from the black hole. Our comparisons with earlier work show an order of magnitude gain in performance (speed) and numerical errors less than 1% for a large fraction of parameter space. As a first application of this code, we analyze the effect of finite extraction radius on the energy fluxes. This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop adiabatic waveforms describing the inspiral of a small compact body into a massive Kerr black hole.
