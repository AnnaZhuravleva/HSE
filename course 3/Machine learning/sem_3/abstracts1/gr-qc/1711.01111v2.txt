We discuss the physical consequences of making general phase space deformations on the minisuperspace of phantom cosmology. Based on the principle of physically equivalent descriptions in the deformed theory, we investigate for what values of the deformation parameters the arising descriptions are physically equivalent. We also construct and solve the quantum model and derive the semiclassical dynamics.
