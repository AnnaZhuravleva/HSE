Using the data coming from the new 182 Gold type Ia supernova samples, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the H(z) data, we have performed a statistical joint analysis of the DGP brane-world model with a high curvature Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk. Consistent parameters estimations show that the Gauss-Bonnet-Induced Gravity model is a viable candidate to explain the observed acceleration of our universe.
