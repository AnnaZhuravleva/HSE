We consider nonlinear redshift-dependent equation of state parameters as dark energy models in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. To depict the expansion history of the universe in such cosmological scenarios, we take into account the large scale behaviour of such parametric models and fit them using a set of latest observational data with distinct origin that includes cosmic microwave background radiation, Supernove Type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortion, weak gravitational lensing, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers and finally the local Hubble constant from Hubble space telescope. The fitting technique avails the publicly available code Cosmological Monte Carlo (CosmoMC), to extract the cosmological information out of these parametric dark energy models. From our analysis it follows that those models could describe the late time accelerating phase of the universe, while they are distinguished from the $\Lambda-$cosmology.
