We present a novel approach in constructing deviations of the Kerr spacetime whereas the symmetries can be preserved. The method was applied trivially in all known classical black-hole spacetimes tested, while provides the possibility of testing and inventing deformations of Kerr in a quick and innovative way. The methodology is based on earlier work by Benenti and Francaviglia (1979) on separability of geodesic equations while we exploited the elegant properties of Yano tensor in order to provide an additional way of getting the Carter constant.
