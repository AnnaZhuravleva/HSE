It was recently suggested that the cosmological constant problem as viewed in a non-perturbative framework is intimately connected to the choice of time and a physical Hamiltonian. We develop this idea further by calculating the non-perturbative vacuum energy density as a function of the cosmological constant with multiple choices of time. We also include a spatial curvature of the universe and generalize this calculation beyond cosmology at a classical level. We show that vacuum energy density depends on the choice of time, and in almost all time gauges, is a non-linear function of the cosmological constant. This non-linear relation is a calculation for the vacuum energy density given some arbitrary value of the cosmological constant. Hence, in this non-perturbative framework, the cosmological constant problem does not arise. We also discuss why the conventional cosmological constant problem is not well-posed, and formulate and answer the question: "Does vacuum gravitate?" Finally, we give a derivation of reduction to quantum mechanics on a flat background from a non-perturbative gravity-matter theory.
