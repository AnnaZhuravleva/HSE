We investigate cosmological dynamics based on $f(R)$ gravity in the Palatini formulation. In this study we use the dynamical system methods. We show that the evolution of the Friedmann equation reduces to the form of the piece-wise smooth dynamical system. This system is is reduced to a 2D dynamical system of the Newtonian type. We demonstrate how the trajectories can be sewn to guarantee $C^0$ extendibility of the metric similarly as `Milne-like' FLRW spacetimes are $C^0$-extendible. We point out that importance of dynamical system of Newtonian type with non-smooth right-hand sides in the context of Palatini cosmology. In this framework we can investigate singularities which appear in the past and future of the cosmic evolution. We consider cosmological systems in both Einstein and Jordan frames. We show that at each frame the topological structures of phase space are different.
