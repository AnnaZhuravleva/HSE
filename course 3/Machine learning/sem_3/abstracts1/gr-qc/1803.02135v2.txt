Hidden conformal symmetries of scalar field on various black hole backgrounds have been investigated for years, but whether those features holds for other fields are still open questions. Recently, with proper assumptions, Lunin achieves to the separation of variables for Maxwell equations on Kerr background. In this paper, with that equation, we find that hidden conformal symmetry appears at near region under low frequency limit. We also extended those results to vector field on Kerr-(A)dS and Kerr-NUT-(A)dS backgrounds, then hidden conformal symmetry also appears if we focusing on the near-horizon region at low frequency limit.
