An approximate realistic metric representing the spacetime of neutron stars is obtained by perturbing the Kerr metric. This metric has 5 parameters, namely the mass, spin or angular momentum, mass quadrupole, spin octupole and mass hexadecapole. Moreover, a version of the Hartle-Thorne metric containing these parameters is constructed by means of a series transformation between these spacetimes and solving the Einstein field equations.
