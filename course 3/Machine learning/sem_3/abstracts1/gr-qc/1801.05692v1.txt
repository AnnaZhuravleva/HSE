In this paper, we construct the exact solutions of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the presence of quartic quasi-topological gravity. we obtain the thermodynamics and conserved quantities of the solutions and check the first law of thermodynamics. In studying the physical properties of the solutions, we consider asymptotically Ads, dS and flat solutions of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in quartic quasi-topological gravity and compare them with Einstein and third-order quasi-topological gravities. we also investigate the thermal stability of the solutions that we show the thermal stability are just for AdS solutions not for dS and flat ones.
