In this paper, we have studied flat Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) model with modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) having equation of state $p_{m}=A\rho -% \frac{B}{\rho ^{\gamma }}$, where $0\leq A\leq 1$, $0\leq \gamma \leq 1$ and $B$ is any positive constant in }${\footnotesize f(R,T)}${\footnotesize \ gravity with particle creation. We have considered a simple parametrization of the Hubble parameter $H$ in order to solve the field equations and discussed the time evolution of different cosmological parameters for some obtained models showing unique behavior of scale factor. We have also discussed the statefinder diagnostic pair $\{r,s\}$ that characterizes the evolution of obtained models and explore their stability. The physical consequences of the models and their kinematic behaviors have also been scrutinized here in some detail.
