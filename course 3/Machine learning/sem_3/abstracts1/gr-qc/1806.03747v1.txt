In this work we present an analytical proof of cosmic censorship in a Kerr-like phantom wormhole (WH) which contains a singularity that is not protected by an event horizon. We show that this space-time singularity without event horizon is causally disconnected from the universe. To do so, we consider a slowly-rotating limit and by means of the Hamilton-Jacobi theory separate the Hamiltonian of the geodesics into two polynomials. During this process we find a fourth conserved quantity. After examining the properties of these polynomials we conclude that the ring singularity is untouchable by any observer traveling in a geodesic of this space-time. We also derive the conditions on the four constants of motion that are necessary for a traveler to go back and forth both universes connected through the WH.
