It has been rigorously proved in the context of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime that the vacuum state is a thermal state (with nonzero temperature) according to uniformly accelerated observers. This result is known as the Unruh effect. Recent claims, however, have challenged the validity of this result for extended systems. Here we investigate the behavior of a simple uniformly accelerated extended system, locally coupled to quantum fields in the vacuum state. We show that the reduced density matrix which describes the accelerated system evolves to a Gibbs thermal state; in other words, the vacuum state does induce thermalization of an extended accelerated system --- which is all one can expect of a legitimate thermal reservoir. Notwithstanding this, by calculating the decoherence/relaxation time scales as a function of the system's acceleration, we also show that similarities with inertial thermal baths hold beyond equilibrium results.
