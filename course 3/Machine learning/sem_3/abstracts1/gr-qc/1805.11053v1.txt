In this paper, we investigate the Joule Thomson effects for AdS black holes with a global monopole. We study the effect of the global monopole parameter {\eta} on the inversion temperature and isenthalpic curves. The obtained result is compared with Joule Thomson expansion of van der Waals fluid and the equivalence were noted. Phase transition occuring in the extended phase space of this black hole is analogous to van der Waals gas. Our study shows that global monopole parameter {\eta} plays a very important role in Joule Thomson expansion.
