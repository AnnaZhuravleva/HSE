We explore the stress-energy tensor arising from the interaction of $U(1)$ symmetric quantum and gravitational fields. Using scalar-tensor theories of gravity, a conformal factor $\Omega^2$ is defined as the rest mass corrected by the quantum potential. The quantum potential, derived from the Klein-Gordon equation, allows for matter's intrinsic interaction with spacetime. A Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ is used as a constraint to properly couple matter with gravity. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle appears as a natural artifact of $\lambda$. Unlike the classical limit, $\lambda$ in the quantum regime strongly influence the stress-energy tensor and it is therefore suggested that it is characteristic of the quantum vacuum. Additionally, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, defined from the modified Einstein's equation, is formulated for any particle of mass $m$. The mysterious variation in $\Lambda$ is properly evaluated from its cosmological value to that of an electron, from which we obtained a 77 order difference.
