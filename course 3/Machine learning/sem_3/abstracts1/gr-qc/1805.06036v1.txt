We propose a simple solution to the magnetogenesis problem based on cyclic cosmology. It is demonstrated that magnetic fields, of sufficient strengths to account for the present observational bounds, can be created in the contracting phase preceding the beginning of the current cosmological cycle. The basic assumption of this model is that the Universe enters a contraction phase essentially empty, characterized by small seed electric fields. In this framework, there is no need for any new theoretical additions to explain magnetogenesis, such as new scalar fields or non-minimal couplings between curvature, scalar fields and the electromagnetic sector. Moreover, the proposed model is general in the sense that it does not assume any specific modified gravity theory to enable the cosmological bounce. When compared to the inflationary magnetogenesis paradigm, the proposed model also has the advantage of not leading to the backreaction and strong coupling problems.
