Efficient multi-dimensional template placement is crucial in computationally intensive matched-filtering searches for Gravitational Waves (GWs). Here, we implement the Neighboring Cell Algorithm (NCA) to improve the detection volume of an existing Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) template bank. This algorithm has already been successfully applied for a binary millisecond pulsar search in data from the Fermi satellite. It repositions templates from over-dense regions to under-dense regions and reduces the number of templates that would have been required by a stochastic method to achieve the same detection volume. Our method is readily generalizable to other CBC parameter spaces. Here we apply this method to the aligned--single-spin neutron-star--black-hole binary coalescence inspiral-merger-ringdown gravitational wave parameter space. We show that the template nudging algorithm can attain the equivalent effectualness of the stochastic method with 12% fewer templates.
