We present an exact solution of Einstein's equation that describes the gravitational shockwave of a massless particle on the horizon of a Kerr-Newman black hole. The backreacted metric is of the generalized Kerr-Schild form and is Type II in the Petrov classification. We show that if the background tetrad is aligned with shear-free null geodesics, and if the background Ricci tensor satisfies a simple condition, then all nonlinearities in the perturbation will drop out of the curvature scalars. We make heavy use of the method of spin coefficients (the Newman-Penrose formalism) in its compacted form (the Geroch-Held-Penrose formalism).
