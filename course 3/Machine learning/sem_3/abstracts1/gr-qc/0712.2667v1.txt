The hypothesis that dark matter consists of superheavy particles with the mass close to the Grand Unification scale is investigated. These particles were created from vacuum by the gravitation of the expanding Universe and their decay led to the observable baryon charge. Some part of these particles with the lifetime larger than the time of breaking of the Grand Unification symmetry became metastable and survived up to the modern time as dark matter. However in active galactic nuclei due to large energies of dark matter particles swallowed by the black hole the opposite process can occur. Dark matter particles become interacting. Their decay on visible particles at the Grand Unification energies leads to the flow of ultra high energy cosmic rays observed by the Auger group. Numerical estimates of the effect leading to the observable numbers are given.
