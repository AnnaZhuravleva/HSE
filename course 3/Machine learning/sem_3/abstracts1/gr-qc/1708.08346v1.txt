In this paper we investigate how to describe in a unified way a constant-roll inflationary era with a dark energy era, by using the theoretical framework of $F(R)$ gravity. To this end, we introduce some classes of appropriately chosen $F(R)$ gravity models, and we examine in detail how the unification of early and late-time acceleration eras can be achieved. We study in detail the inflationary era, and as we demonstrate it is possible to achieve a viable inflationary era, for which the spectral index of primordial curvature perturbations and the scalar-to-tensor ratio can be compatible with the latest observational data. In addition, the graceful exit issue is briefly discussed for a class of models. Finally, we discuss the dark energy oscillations issue, and we investigate which model from one of the classes we introduced, can produce oscillations with the smallest amplitude.
