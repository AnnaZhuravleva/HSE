We show that the Einstein field equations for a five-dimensional warped spacetime, where only gravity can propagate into the bulk, determine the dynamical evolution of the warp factor of the four-dimensional brane spacetime. This can be explained as a holographic manifestation. The warped 5D model can be reformulated by considering the warp factor as a dilaton field conformally coupled to gravity and embedded in a smooth $M_4 \otimes R$ manifold. On the brane, where the U(1) scalar-gauge fields live, the dilaton field manifests itself as a warp factor which determines the evolution of the metric components and matter fields. We write the Lagrangian of the Einstein-scalar-gauge fields in a conformal invariant setting. However, as expected, the conformal invariance is broken by the appearance of a mass term and a quadratic term in the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar-gauge field arising from the extrinsic curvature terms in the projected Einstein tensor. These terms can be interpreted as a constraint in order to maintain conformal invariance.
