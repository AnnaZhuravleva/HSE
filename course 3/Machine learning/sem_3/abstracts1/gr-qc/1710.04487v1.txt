We discuss an effective theory for the quantum static gravitational potential in spherical symmetry up to the first post-Newtonian correction. We build a suitable Lagrangian from the weak field limit of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to pressureless matter. Classical solutions of the field equation lead to the correct post-Newtonian expansion. Furthermore, we portray the Newtonian results in a quantum framework by means of a coherent quantum state, which is properly corrected to accomodate post-Newtonian corrections. These considerations provide a link between the corpuscular model of Dvali and Gomez and standard post-Newtonian gravity, laying the foundations for future research.
