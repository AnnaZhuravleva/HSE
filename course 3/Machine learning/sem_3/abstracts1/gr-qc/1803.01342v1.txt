In this work we consider a model for gravity in 4-dimensional space-time originally proposed by A. Chamseddine which may be derived by a 5-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. Its topological origin makes it an interesting candidate for an easier quantization, e.g., in loop quantization framework. The present work is dedicated to classical physical consequences and canonical analysis of the model. Cosmological solutions as well as wave-like solutions were obtained and compared with the corresponding Einstein's General Relativity with cosmological constant.
