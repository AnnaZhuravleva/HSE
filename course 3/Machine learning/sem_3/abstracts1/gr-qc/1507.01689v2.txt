A 5-dimensional gravity theory, motivated by the brane world picture, with factorisable metric and with Kaluza scalar $G_{55}(r)$, is shown to give rise to a positive contribution to the Raychaudhuri equation. This inhibits the focusing of geodesics and possibly cause non-focusing of the geodesics. This feature is translated into the situation in which the universe has an infinite age and hence no beginning avoiding the big bang singularity.
