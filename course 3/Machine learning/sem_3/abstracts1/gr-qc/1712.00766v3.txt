Gravitational waves (GWs) from extra dimension, very early universe, and some high-energy astrophysical process, might have at most six polarization states in our four-dimension spacetime: plus- and cross-type polarizations (tensor-mode), x-, y-type polarizations (vector-mode), and b-, l-type polarizations (scalar-mode). The peak regions or partial peak regions (of amplitudes or energy densities) of some of such GWs are just distributed in GHz or higher frequency band, which would be optimal frequency band for the electromagnetic (EM) response. In this paper we investigate EM response to such high-frequency GWs (HFGWs) in galactic-extragalactic background EM fields and in EM three dimensional synchro-resonance system (3DSR system); we found concrete forms of analytic solutions for perturbative EM fields and signal photon fluxes, which are actually EM counterparts of HFGWs, and provide a novel way to simultaneously distinguish and display all possible six polarization states of the HFGWs. It is shown that(i)In the EM response, the pure cross-, pure x- and pure y-type polarizations of the HFGWs can independently generate perturbative photon fluxes (PPFs), while the plus-, b- and l-type polarizations produce the PPFs in different combination states. (ii)All such six polarization states of the HFGWs have separability and detectability. (iii)In the EM response to the HFGWs from the extra-dimension, distinguishing and displaying different polarization states of them would be quite possible due to their very high frequency, large energy densities and special properties of spectrum. The observation and separation of the polarization states of the primordial HFGWs and of the HFGWs in some high-energy astrophysical process will face to big challenge, but this is still possible. (iv)Detection band of PPFs by 3DSR and observation range of PPFs by FAST have a certain overlapping property.
