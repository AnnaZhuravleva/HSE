We carry on a general study on axially symmetric, static fluids admitting a conformal Killing vector (CKV). The physical relevance of this kind of symmetry is emphasized. Next, we investigate all possible consequences derived from the imposition of such a symmetry. Special attention is paid to the problem of symmetry inheritance. Several families of solutions endowed with a CKV are exhibited.
