We present a formalism for analysis of linear Cauchy data on a Kottler metric. Our method removes redundancy due to gauge transformations and constraints. A set of four gauge-invariant, scalar functions on the Cauchy surface is produced and shown to contain full physical information from the initial data. The symplectic form of the theory and equations of motion are reformulated in terms of these invariants and some simple solutions are explored.
