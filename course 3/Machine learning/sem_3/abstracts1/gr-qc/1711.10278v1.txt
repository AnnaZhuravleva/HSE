The new uncertainty relation is derived in the context of the canonical quantum theory with gravity for the case of the maximally symmetric space. This relation establishes a connection between fluctuations of the quantities which determine the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of the spacelike hypersurface in spacetime and introduces the new uncertainty principle for quantum gravitational systems. All known modifications of the uncertainty principle deduced previously from different approaches in the theory of gravity and string theory are obtained as particular cases of the proposed general expression. The generalized time-energy uncertainty relation, which takes into account gravity, is proposed.
