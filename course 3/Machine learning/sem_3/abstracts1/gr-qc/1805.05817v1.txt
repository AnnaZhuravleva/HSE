Joule-Thomson expansion process is studied for charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in AdS space. Firstly, in five dimensional space-time, isenthalpic curve in $T-P$ graph is obtained and the cooling-heating region is determined. Secondly, the explicit expression of Joule-Thomson coefficient is obtained from general formulas of enthalpy and temperature. Our methods also suit to van der Waals system as well as other black hole system. Then the inversion curve $\tilde{T}(\tilde{P})$ which separating the cooling region and heating region is obtained and investigated. Thirdly, an interesting dependence of the inversion curves on the charge $(Q)$ and the Gauss-Bonnet parameter $(\alpha)$ are revealed. In $\tilde{T}-\tilde{P}$ phase, the charge decrease the cooling region, while the Gauss-Bonnet parameter increase the cooling region. Fourthly, applying to our methods, the Joule-Thomson expansion process for $\alpha=0$ case in four dimension is studied, where the Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole degenerate into normal AdS black hole . The inversion curves for van der Waals systems consist of two parts, one has positive slope, the other has negative slope. While for black hole systems, the slope of the inversion curves are always positive, which seems to be an universal feature.
