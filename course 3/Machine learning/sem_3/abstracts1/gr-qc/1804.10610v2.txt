This is an introductory, up-to-date review of the essentials of black hole thermodynamics. The main topics surveyed are: (i) the four laws of thermodynamics as applied to a black hole horizon, and the current status of their proofs; (ii) different definitions of horizons, and their unique properties; (iii) the nature of black hole entropy, its quantum and stringy corrections, and ultimate origin from quantum gravity microstates; (iv) the focusing law for the area/entropy; and finally (v) the holographic principle, and how we can use it to learn about the information inside black holes.
