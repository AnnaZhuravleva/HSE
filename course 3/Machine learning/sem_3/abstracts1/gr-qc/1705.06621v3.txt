This first part of the series treats the Maxwell equations in the exterior of a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. By performing a first-order differential operator on each extreme Newman-Penrose (N-P) scalar in Kinnersley tetrad, the resulting equation and the Teukolsky master equation for the extreme N-P component are both in the form of an inhomogeneous "spin-weighted Fackerell-Ipser equation" (SWFIE), and constitute a weakly-coupled system. We first prove energy estimate and integrated local energy decay (Morawetz) estimate for this type of inhomogeneous SWFIE following the method in [15], and then utilize the estimates to achieve both a uniform bound of a positive definite energy and a Morawetz estimate for the coupled system of each extreme N-P component. The same type of estimates for the regular extreme N-P components defined in the regular Hawking-Hartle tetrad are also proved. The hierarchy here is generalized in our second part [25] of this series to treat the extreme components of linearized gravity.
