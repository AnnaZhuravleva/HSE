We demonstrate that the generic charged rotating regular black hole solutions of general relativity coupled to non-linear electrodynamics, obtained by using the alternate Newman-Janis algorithm, introduces only small (on level $10^{-2}$) inconsistency in the behaviour of the electrodynamics Lagrangian. This approves application of these analytic and simple solutions as astrophysically relevant, sufficiently precise approximate solutions describing rotating regular black holes.
