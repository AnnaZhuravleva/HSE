The recent concept of {\em relativistic positioning system} (RPS) has opened the possibility of making Relativity the {\em general standard frame} in which to state any physical problem, theoretical or experimental.   Because the velocity of propagation of the information is finite, {\em epistemic relativity} proposes to integrate the physicist as a real component of every physical problem, taking into account explicitly {\em what} information, {\em when} and {\em where}, the physicist is able to know. This leads naturally to the concept of {\em relativistic stereometric system} (RSS), allowing to measure the intrinsic properties of physical systems. Together, RPSs and RSSs complete the notion of {\em laboratory} in general relativity, allowing to perform experiments in finite regions of any space-time.   Epistemic relativity incites the development of relativity in new open directions: advanced studies in RPSs and RSSs, intrinsic characterization of gravitational fields, composition laws for them, construction of a finite-differential geometry adapted to RPSs and RSSs, covariant approximation methods, etc. Some of these directions are sketched here, and some open problems are posed. \end{abstract} \noindent I want the organizers of this seminar, Dirk P\"utzfeld and Claus L\"ammerzahl, to know how much I appreciated their inviting me to talk about my ideas on this subject. It is also a pleasure to thanks the Wilhelm und Else Heraeus-Stiftung for their kind hospitality.
