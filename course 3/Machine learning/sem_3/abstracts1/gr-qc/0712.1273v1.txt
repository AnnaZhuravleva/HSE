In this paper we use the ratio of the corrections to the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian secular precessions of the longitudes of perihelia of Jupiter and Saturn, recently estimated by the Russian astronomer E.V. Pitjeva by fitting almost one century of data with the EPM ephemerides, to make an independent, planetary-based test of the hypothesis that the Pioneer anomaly (PA), as it is presently known in the 5-10 AU region, is of gravitational origin. Accounting for the errors in the determined apsidal extra-rates and in the values of the PA acceleration at the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn the answer is negative. If and when the re-analysis of the entire Pioneer 10/11 will be completed more firm conclusions could be reached. Moreover, it would also be important that other teams of astronomers estimate independently their own corrections to the perihelion precessions.
