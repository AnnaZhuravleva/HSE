In this work, both extended phase space and holographic equipartition approaches are employed to develop an exact Van der Waals description of non--rotating $D=4$ SAdS black holes as an ensemble of spacetime atoms. After a possible microscopical interaction model is introduced, statistical mechanics techniques, with certain heuristic gravitational constraints, are used to derive the equation of state and the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. The procedure is generalized to the charged $D=4$ SAdS black hole and to arbitrary $D\ge 3$ dimensions for the uncharged cases.
