The decay widths of the quantum black hole precursors, determined from the poles of the resummed graviton propagator, are matched to the expected lifetime given by the Hawking decay. In this way, we impose a sort of duality between a perturbative description and an essentially non-perturbative description, bearing some similarity with the Bloom-Gilman duality for the strong interactions. General relations are then obtained for the widths and masses of the poles in terms of the number of particle species and the renormalisation scale of gravity.
