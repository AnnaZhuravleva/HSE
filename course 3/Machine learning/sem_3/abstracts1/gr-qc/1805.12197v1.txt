We extend the class of recently formulated scalar-nonmetricity theories by considering a five-parameter quadratic nonmetricity scalar and including a boundary term. The symmetric teleparallel constraint is invoked by Lagrange multipliers or by inertial variation. The equivalents for general relativity and ordinary (curvature based) scalar-tensor theories are obtained as particular cases. We derive the field equations, discuss some technical details, e.g., debraiding, and formulate the Hamilton-like approach.
