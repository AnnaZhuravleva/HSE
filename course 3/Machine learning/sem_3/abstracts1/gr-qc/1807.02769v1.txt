Different routes towards canonical formulation of non-minimally coupled higher-order theory of gravity results in at least two different Hamiltonian, which are not related under canonical transformation. Both the Hamiltonian yield correct classical field equations, but different phase-space structures of the fields/particles. Further, since in the quantum domain also the two are well-behaved but distinct, there is in principle no way to pick up one as the correct and unique Hamiltonian. Thus, non-minimally coupled higher-order theories suffer from the pathology of "Degenerate Hamiltonian". However, in the case of Gauss-Bonnet-Dilatonic coupled action in the presence of higher-order term, Dirac's algorithm is found to fall short in producing a viable quantum description. Here we explore the reason and consequently find the appropriate technique of using Dirac's algorithm. In the process, such degeneracy is removed.
