Numerical evidence is presented that the Poisson-Israel mass inflation instability at the inner horizon of an accreting, rotating black hole is generically followed by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz oscillatory collapse to a spacelike singularity. The computation involves following all 6 degrees of freedom of the gravitational field. To simplify the problem, the computation takes as initial conditions the conformally separable solutions of arXiv:1010.1269, arXiv:1010.1271 just above the inner horizon of a slowly accreting, rotating black hole, and integrates the equations inward along single latitudes.
