Chern-Simons gravities and gravitational Chern-Simons densities are constructed using the non-Abelian Yang-Mills Chern-Simons densities. As such, they are defined only in odd dimensions. We propose instead an analogous construction employing what we term Higgs--Chern-Simons (HCS) densities, which are defined in $all\ dimensions$. This enables the definition of extended versions of Chern-Simons gravities in all dimensions. Employing the same prescription, the definition of gravitational Chern-Simons densities is extended to all even dimensions, but only to $4p-1$ $odd$ dimensions. All our considerations are restricted to $vacuum$ fields.
