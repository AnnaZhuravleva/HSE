The quantum behavior of noncommutative eternal inflation is quite different from the usual knowledge. Unlike the usual eternal inflation, the quantum fluctuation of noncommutative eternal inflation is suppressed by the Hubble parameter. Due to this, we need to reconsider many conceptions of eternal inflation. In this paper we study the Hawking-Moss tunneling in noncommutative eternal inflation using the stochastic approach. We obtain a brand-new form of the tunneling probability for this process and find that the Hawking-Moss tunneling is more unlikely to take place in the noncommutative case than in the usual one. We also conclude that the lifetime of a metastable de-Sitter (dS) vacuum in the noncommutative spacetime is longer than that in the commutative case.
