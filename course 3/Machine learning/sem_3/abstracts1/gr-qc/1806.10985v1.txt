A process for using curvature invariants is applied as new means to evaluate the travers ability of Lorentzian wormholes. This approach was formulated by Henry, Overduin, and Wilcomb for Black Holes in Reference [1]. Curvature Invariants are independent of coordinate basis, so the process is free of coordinate mapping distortions. The fourteen G'eh'eniau and Debever (GD) invariants are calculated and the non-zero, independent curvature invariant functions are plotted. Three example traversable wormhole metrics (i) thin-shell flat-face, (ii) spherically symmetric Morris and Thorne, and (iii) thin-shell Schwarzschild wormholes are investigated and are demonstrated to be traversable.
