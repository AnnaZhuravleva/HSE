We study the motion of bound null geodesics with fixed coordinate radius around a five-dimensional rotating black hole. These spherical photon orbits are not confined to a plane, and can exhibit interesting quasiperiodic behaviour. We provide necessary conditions for the existence of these orbits, and explicitly compute the radii of circular orbits in the equatorial and polar planes. Finally, we plot representative examples of some of the types of possible orbits, commenting on their qualitative features.
