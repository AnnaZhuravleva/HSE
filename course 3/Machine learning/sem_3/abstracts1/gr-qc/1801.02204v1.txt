We will perform a study about gravitational collapse process considering an anisotropic spacetime, and also, we will see the production of the gravitational waves using Petrov classification. A generalized solution for the Einstein field equations, with arbitrary curvature, giving emphasis to initial conditions that characterize the process of gravitational collapse, are determined explicitly.
