We investigate the strong field lensing observables for the Damour-Solodukhin wormhole and examine how small the values of the deviation parameter $\lambda $ need be for reproducing the observables for the Schwarzschild black hole. While the extremely tiny values of $\lambda$ indicated by the matter accretion or Hawking evaporation are not disputed, it turns out that $\lambda $ could actually assume values considerably higher than those tiny values and still reproduce black hole lensing signatures. The lensing observations thus provide a surprising counterexample to the intuitive expectation that all experiments ought to lead to the mimicking of black holes for the same range of values of $\lambda$.
