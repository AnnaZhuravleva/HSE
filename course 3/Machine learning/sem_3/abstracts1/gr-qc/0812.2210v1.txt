It is argued that cosmological models that feature a flow of energy from dark energy to dark matter may solve the coincidence problem of late acceleration (i.e., "why the energy densities of both components are of the same order precisely today?"). However, much refined and abundant observational data of the redshift evolution of the Hubble factor are needed to ascertain whether they can do the job.
