In this work, we introduce a bottom-up $F(R)$ gravity reconstruction technique, in which we fix the observational indices and we seek for the $F(R)$ gravity which may realize them. Particularly, as an exemplification of our method, we shall assume that the scalar-to-tensor ratio has a specific form, and from it we shall reconstruct the $F(R)$ gravity that may realize it, focusing on special values of the parameters in order to obtain analytical results. The observational indices we study are compatible with the latest observational data, and we discuss how the functional form of the observational indices may affect the viability of the model.
