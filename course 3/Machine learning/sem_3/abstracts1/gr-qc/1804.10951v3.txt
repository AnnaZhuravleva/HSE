In this paper we construct new hairy black holes of Lovelock-Born-Infeld-Scalar gravity in diverse dimensions. We study horizon structures of the black holes and find the black holes may possess three horizons, two horizons or one horizon. We give the thermodynamic quantities and check the first laws. We study the thermal phase transition behaviors of the black holes in $T$-$S$ plane, and find for even-dimensional black holes, in some ranges of the parameters Van der Waals-like phase transitions occur, in some ranges of the parameters, reentrant phase transitions (RPTs) appear. For odd-dimensional black holes no such phase transitions are found.
