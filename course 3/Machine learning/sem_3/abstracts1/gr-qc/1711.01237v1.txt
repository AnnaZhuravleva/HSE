We derive exact expressions for the relativistic redshift between an Earth-bound observer, that is meant to model a standard clock on the Earth's surface, and various (geodesic) observers in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We assume that the observers exchange radial light signals to compare the frequencies of standard clocks, which they transport along their respective worldlines. We calculate the redshift between an Earth-bound clock and static observers, observers in radial free fall, on circular geodesics, and on arbitrary bound quasi-elliptical orbits. For the latter case, we consider as examples an almost circular orbit, the Schwarzschild analog of Galileo satellites 5 orbits with a moderate eccentricity, and a highly elliptical orbit as special examples. Furthermore, we also use orbits close to a Schwarzschild black hole to highlight the influence of the relativistic perigee precession on the redshift signal. Calculating a post-Newtonian expansion of our results, the total redshift is decomposed into its special relativistic Doppler parts and the gravitational part due to the theory of General Relativity. To investigate the impact of higher order relativistic multipole moments on the gravitational redshift, we consider static observers in a general Weyl spacetime. We give a general expression for the mutual redshift of their standard clocks and consider in particular the effect of the relativistic quadrupole as a modification of the Schwarzschild result.
