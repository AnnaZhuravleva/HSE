Here we consider the possibility of measuring at 10% or better the moment of inertia I of the J0737-3039A via the gravitomagnetic spin-orbit periastron precession. It turns out that the prospect of measuring the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A at 10% accuracy or better seems unlikely given the limitations to the precision with which the system's basic binary and post-Keplerian parameters can be measured via radio timing.
