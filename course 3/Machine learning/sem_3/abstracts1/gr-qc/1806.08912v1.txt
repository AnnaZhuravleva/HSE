The multi-messenger astronomy starts with the recent observations of gravitational-wave and its electromagnetic counter parts, GW170817, since the first detection of gravitational-wave, GW150914. To understand how the gravitational-waves are detected in the laser interferometer, in this review article, we briefly review the gravitational-wave and the sources generating it. It is then followed by the basic principle of the laser interferometer as a gravitational-wave detector and its noise sources. The search algorithms currently used in the gravitational-wave observatories are summarized and the sensing/vetoing algorithms in the detector characterization are described to see how the high power noises are suppressed and the data quality is monitored.
