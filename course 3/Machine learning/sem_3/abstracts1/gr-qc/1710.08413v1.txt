In this paper, we consider a cosmological model of the flat and homogeneous universe for the Starobinsky model $F(R)=\alpha R + \beta R^{2}$, which is non-minimally coupled with f-essence. For this model we obtained the field equations and considered particular solutions of the coupling and fermionic field functions. It is shown that the fermionic field can describe a nature of the universe.
