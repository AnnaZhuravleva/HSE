Several rare coincidences of scales in standard particle physics are needed to explain (i) why neutrinos have mass, (ii) why the negative pressure of the cosmological dark energy (DE) coincides with the positive pressure of random motion of dark matter (DM) in bright galaxies, (iii) why Dark Matter in galaxies seems to have a finite phase-space density, and to follow the Tully-Fisher-Milgrom relation of galaxy rotation curves. The old idea of self-interacting DM is given a new spin: we propose that the neutrino spin-gravity coupling could lead to a cosmic neutrino dark fluid with a an internal energy density varying as function of the local acceleration of the neutrino fluid with respect the CMB background. We link the Tully-Fisher-Milgrom relation of spiral galaxies (or MOND) with the relativistic pressure of the neutrino dark fluid without modifying Einsteinian gravity.
