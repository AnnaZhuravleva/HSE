In a recent paper we calculated the field equations of spin-3/2 fields in a $D$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime whilst maintaining the gauge symmetry of the Rarita-Schwinger equation. We were also able to determine the quasi-normal modes of the associated gauge invariant variables using the WKB approximation and the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). However, it was found that for higher dimension, and especially for the near extremal cases, the effective potential developed another maximum. The shape of the potential posed difficulties for the WKB approximations, as well as the AIM. As such, in this proceedings we would like to explore the connection between the AIM and the continued fraction method, and determine a possible reason for the difficulty in calculating the quasi-normal modes for spin-3/2 fields in this spacetime.
