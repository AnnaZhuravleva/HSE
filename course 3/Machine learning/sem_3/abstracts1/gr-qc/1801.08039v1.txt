In this work, we consider a vacuum solution of Kaluza-Klein theory with cylindrical symmetry. We investigate the physical properties of the solution as viewed in four dimensional spacetime, which turns out to be a stationary, cylindrical wormhole supported by a scalar field and a magnetic field oriented along the wormhole.We then apply a boost to the five dimensional solution along the extra dimension, and perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction. As a result, we show that the new solution is still a wormhole with a radial electric field and a magnetic field stretched along the wormhole throat.
