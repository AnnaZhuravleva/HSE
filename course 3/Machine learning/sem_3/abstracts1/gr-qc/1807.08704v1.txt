The central equation of quantum gravity is the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We give an argument suggesting that exact solutions of this equation give a surface in the space of coupling constants. This provides a mechanism for determining the cosmological constant as a function of the gravitational and other interaction constants. We demonstrate the idea by computing one such surface in a cosmological model.
