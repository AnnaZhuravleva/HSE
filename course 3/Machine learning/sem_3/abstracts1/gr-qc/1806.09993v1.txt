In this paper, we consider a charged particle moves around a Weakly Magnetized Kerr-Newman black hole. We first study its circular motion with a detailed analysis in the innermost stable circular orbits(ISCO). Then the dynamics of a particle, kicked out from the circular orbit, is also explored. The final states can be characterized into three different types: bound motion, captured by black hole or escape to spatial infinity. The respective trajectories are shown, and are mainly determined by the energy of a particle after a kick and the initial condition, in which we use Basins of attraction to represent the relation between different initial condition and final states.
