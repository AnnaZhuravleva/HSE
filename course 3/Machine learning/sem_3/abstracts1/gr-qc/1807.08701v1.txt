If a set of points is chosen uniformly at random in a Lorentzian manifold by a Poisson process of uniform density, one can obtain from it a locally finite poset using the causal structure of the space to induce a partial order among the points. One may then ask what properties of the Lorentzian manifold are encoded in the structure of the resulting poset. In the case of Minkowski space, this question reduces to how the dimensionality can be recovered. We consider various approaches that have been used in the literature, including one we have recently proposed based on the distribution of maximal chain lengths in the poset, and compare them for accuracy. The possibility of extending these approaches to the study of more general posets, such as those obtained from point sprinklings in curved manifolds, depends on the accuracy of each method for small Minkowski posets; this highlights an interesting feature of the distribution of maximal chains in a poset, to be addressed in Lorentzian statistical geometry.
