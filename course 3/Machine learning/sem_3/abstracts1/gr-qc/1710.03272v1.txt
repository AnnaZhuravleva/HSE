This is an overview article of the mathematics of gravitational waves. We explain the mathematics and physics of these waves in general relativity theory, discuss the gravitational wave experiment aLIGO and their detection of gravitational waves as well as its implications for astrophysics. A version of this article was published in the AMS Notices, Vol. 64, Issue 07, 2017, (August issue 2017).
