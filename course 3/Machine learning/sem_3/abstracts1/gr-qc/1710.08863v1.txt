The recent detections of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors open up new tests of modified gravity theories in the strong-field and dynamical, extreme gravity regime. Such tests rely sensitively on the phase evolution of the gravitational waves, which is controlled by the energy-momentum carried by such waves out of the system. We here study four different methods for finding the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor in gravity theories with any combination of scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom. These methods rely on the second variation of the action under short-wavelength averaging, the second perturbation of the field equations in the short-wavelength approximation, the construction of an energy complex leading to a Landau-Lifshitz tensor, and the use of Noether's theorem in field theories about a flat background. We apply these methods in General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories and Einstein-\AE{}ther theory to find the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor and calculate the rate at which energy and linear momentum is carried away from the system. The stress-energy tensor and the rate of linear momentum loss in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory are presented here for the first time. We find that all methods yield the same rate of energy loss, although the stress-energy pseudo-tensor can be functionally different. We also find that the Noether method yields a stress-energy tensor that is not symmetric or gauge-invariant, and symmetrization via the Belinfante procedure does not fix these problems because this procedure relies on Lorentz invariance, which is spontaneously broken in Einstein-\AE{}ther theory. The methods and results found here will be useful for the calculation of predictions in modified gravity theories that can then be contrasted with observations.
