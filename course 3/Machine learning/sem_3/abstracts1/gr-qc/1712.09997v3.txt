We show that in the presence of the torsion tensor $S^k_{\phantom{k}ij}$, whose existence is required by the consistency of the conservation law for the total angular momentum of a Dirac particle in curved spacetime with relativistic quantum mechanics, the quantum commutation relation for the four-momentum is given by $[p_i,p_j]=2i\hbar S^k_{\phantom{k}ij}p_k$. This relation replaces the integration in the momentum space in Feynman diagrams with the summation over the discrete momentum eigenvalues. We propose a prescription for this summation that agrees with convergent integrals. We show that this prescription regularizes logarithmically divergent integrals in loop diagrams and is equivalent to Pauli-Villars regularization. Torsional regularization, originating from the noncommutativity of the momentum and spin-torsion coupling, therefore provides a realistic, physical mechanism for eliminating infinities in quantum field theory that are currently treated by mathematical techniques such as Pauli-Villars regularization or 't Hooft-Veltman dimensional regularization.
