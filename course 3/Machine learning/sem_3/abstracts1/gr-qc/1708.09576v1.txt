It has been shown that black holes could be used as particle accelerators to create arbitrarily high center-of-mass (CM) energy if certain critical conditions are satisfied. Most studies so far are confined in four-dimensional spacetimes. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis on five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes and find some novel properties compared to four-dimensional Kerr black holes. Firstly, we give a rigorous proof that untrhigh energy collisions cannot occur near a five-dimensional nonextremal black hole. Secondly, For extremal black holes, we find a critical condition on the particles' parameters causing ultraenergetic collisions. Thirdly, when the spacetime contains a naked singularity, we show that the CM energy could diverge at the singularity if one of the particle just bounces back at the singularity. Finally, we explore a special and important case where the naked singularity just begins to form. Surprisingly, the ultraenergetic collisions do not need any fine-turning in that case. However, we find that one of the conserved angular momentums must be nonzero.
