We consider Kaluza-Klein models where internal spaces are compact flat or curved Einstein spaces. This background is perturbed by a compact gravitating body with the dust-like equation of state (EoS) in the external/our space and an arbitrary EoS parameter $\Omega$ in the internal space. Without imposing any restrictions on the form of the perturbed metric and the distribution of the perturbed energy densities, we perform the general analysis of the Einstein and conservation equations in the weak-field limit. All conclusions follow from this analysis. For example, we demonstrate that the perturbed model is static and perturbed metric preserves the block-diagonal form. In a particular case $\Omega=-1/2$, the found solution corresponds to the weak-field limit of the black strings/branes. The black strings/branes are compact gravitating objects which have the topology (four-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime)$\times$ ($d$-dimensional internal space) with $d\geq 1$. We present the arguments in favour of these objects. First, they satisfy the gravitational tests for the parameterized post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ at the same level of accuracy as General Relativity. Second, they are preferable from the thermodynamical point of view. Third, averaging over the Universe, they do not destroy the stabilization of the internal space. These are the astrophysical and cosmological aspects of the black strings/branes.
