We will present main results of our recent investigations on the validity of cosmic no-hair conjecture proposed by Hawking and his colleagues long time ago in the framework of an anisotropic inflationary model proposed by Kanno, Soda, and Watanabe. As a result, we will show that the cosmic no-hair conjecture seems to be generally violated in the Kanno-Soda-Watanabe model for both canonical and non-canonical scalar fields due to the existence of a non-trivial coupling term between scalar and electromagnetic fields. However, we will also show that the validity of the cosmic no-hair conjecture will be ensured once a unusual scalar field called the phantom field, whose kinetic energy term is negative definite, is introduced into the Kanno-Soda-Watanabe model.
