In this work we study the possibility that primordial magnetic fields observed in galaxies could be produced by a dark matter halo made of charged ultra-light bosons. In our model, we assume that ultra-light bosons arise as excitations of an complex scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation with local U(1) symmetry which introduces electromagnetic fields that minimally couple to the complex scalar current. We use classical solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell system to describe the density profile of dark matter and magnetic fields in the galaxies assuming spherical and dipolar spatial symmetries separately. For the particular case of the LSB spherical galaxy F563, we test the sensitivity of the predicted rotation curves in the charged scalar field dark matter (cSFDM) model to variations of the electromagnetic coupling and, by using the Fisher matrix error estimator, we set a constraint over that coupling by requiring that theoretical rotation curves lay inside the 1{\sigma} confidence region of observational data . We find that cSFDM haloes are able to generate magnetic fields of the order of {\mu}G and predict observed rotation curves at the same time if the bosons have couplings lower than $q \sim 10 ^ {-10}$ times the charge of the electron.
