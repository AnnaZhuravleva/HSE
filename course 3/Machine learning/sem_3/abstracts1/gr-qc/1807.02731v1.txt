We show that Einstein gravity emerges as a fixed point of the Einstein-Ricci Flow Equations and derive a renormalization group flow for 4D Lorentzian spacetimes. From the RG flow, we find a well posed action functional, the deformation action, where the metric tensor field is promoted to a dynamical variable. The dynamics of the metric reveal that curvature deformations flow according to a heat equation with the stress-energy tensor acting as a source.
