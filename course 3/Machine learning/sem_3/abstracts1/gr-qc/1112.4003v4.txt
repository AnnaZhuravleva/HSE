The present work aims to search for an implementation of a new symmetry in the space-time by introducing the idea of an invariant minimum speed scale ($V$). Such a lowest limit $V$, being unattainable by the particles, represents a fundamental and preferred reference frame connected to a universal background field (a vacuum energy) that breaks Lorentz symmetry. So there emerges a new principle of symmetry in the space-time at the subatomic level for very low energies close to the background frame ($v\approx V$), providing a fundamental understanding for the uncertainty principle, i.e., the uncertainty relations should emerge from the space-time with an invariant minimum speed.
