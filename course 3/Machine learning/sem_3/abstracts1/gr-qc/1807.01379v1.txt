We analyze a four-parameter class of asymptotically flat magnetized solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations constructed by Manko et al., and show that these represent systems of two co-rotating extreme black holes with equal masses and electric charges, and opposite magnetic and NUT charges, connected by a cosmic string. We discuss several three-parameter subclasses, and determine in each case the parameter domain in which the ring singularity is absent. We find a two-parameter subclass and a one-parameter subclass where the conical singularity is also absent in the horizon co-rotating frame.
