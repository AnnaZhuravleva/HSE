We find a reconstruction algorithm able to generate all the static spherically symmetric interior solutions in the framework of Ho\v{r}ava gravity and Einstein-\ae ther theory in presence of anisotropic fluids. We focus for simplicity on the case of a static \ae ther finding a large class of possible viable interior star solutions which present a very rich phenomenology. We study one illustrative example in more detail.
