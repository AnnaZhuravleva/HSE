After showing the IR dynamics of a light scalar field in de Sitter, obeying Starobinsky's stochastic equation, to be equivalent to Supersymmetric Euclidean Quantum Mechanics, we apply the functional renormalization group to obtain the effective action governing field correlations over long time intervals $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow \infty}\left\langle\phi(0)\phi(t)\right\rangle$. For massless and very light fields with a $\lambda \phi^4$ self-interaction, for which perturbation theory breaks down, we find that a dynamical mass $m^2\sim \sqrt{\lambda}H^2$ develops, corroborating the findings of earlier works in a very simple way. The renormalization group flow in the stochastic framework also shows symmetry restoration for symmetry breaking potentials due to de Sitter IR fluctuations. Hence, extremely light non-conformally coupled fields in de Sitter are unphysical, at least as far as their long time dynamics is concerned.
