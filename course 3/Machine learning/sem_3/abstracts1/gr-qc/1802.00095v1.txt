We present an innovative Galerkin-Collocation domain decomposition algorithm applied to the evolution of cylindrical unpolarized gravitational waves. We display how the domain decomposition effectiveness was successfully implemented for those initial data with localized high gradients. We have characterized the gravitational radiation using the standard Weyl scalar using the Newman-Penrose tetrad. Thus, it was possible to unveil aspects of the interaction between both gravitational polarization wave modes by generating the corresponding templates at the radiation zone.
