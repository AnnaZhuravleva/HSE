Exact solutions of the Dirac general relativistic equation that describe the dynamics of a massive, electrically charged with half integer spin particle in the curved spacetime geometry of an electrically charged, rotating Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter black hole are investigated. We first, derive the Dirac equation in the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter (KNdS) black hole background using a generalised Kinnersley null tetrad in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Subsequently in this frame and in the KNdS black hole spacetime, we prove the separation of the Dirac equation into ordinary differential equations for the radial and angular parts. For the case of a massive fermion in the background of a Kerr-Newman (KN) black hole we first prove that the radial and angular equations that result from the separation of Dirac's equation reduce to the generalised Heun differential equation (GHE). The local solutions of such GHE are derived and can be described by holomorphic functions whose power series coefficients are determined by a four-term recurrence relation. In addition using asymptotic analysis we derive the solutions for the massive fermion far away from the KN black hole and the solutions near the event horizon .
