The evaluation of the energy-momentum distribution for a new four-dimensional, spherically symmetric, static and charged black hole spacetime geometry with constant non-zero topological Euler density is performed by using the energy-momentum complexes of Einstein and M{\o}ller. This black hole solution was recently developed in the context of the coupled Einstein--non-linear electrodynamics of the Born-Infeld type. The energy is found to depend on the mass $M$ and the charge $q$ of the black hole, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the radial coordinate $r$, while in both prescriptions all the momenta vanish. Some limiting and particular cases are analyzed, illustrating the rather extraordinary character of the spacetime geometry considered.
