We consider generalised pp-waves with purely axial torsion, which we previously showed to be new vacuum solutions of quadratic metric-affine gravity. Our analysis shows that classical pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature should not be viewed on their own. They are a particular representation of a wider class of solutions, namely generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature. We compare our pp-waves with purely axial torsion to solutions of Einstein-Weyl theory, the classical model describing the interaction of gravitational and massless neutrino fields.
