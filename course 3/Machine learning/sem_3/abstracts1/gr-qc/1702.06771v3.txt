Astrophysical compact binary systems consisting of neutron stars and blackholes are an important class of gravitational wave (GW) sources for advanced LIGO detectors. Accurate theoretical waveform models from the inspiral, merger and ringdown phases of such systems, are used to filter detector data under the template based matched filtering paradigm. An efficient grid over the parameter space at a fixed minimal match has a direct impact on the overall time taken by these searches. We present a new hybrid geometric-random template placement algorithm for signals described by two masses and one spin magnitude parameters. Such template banks could potentially be used in GW searches from binary neutron stars and neutron star-blackhole systems. The template placement is robust and is able to automatically accommodate curvature and boundary effects with no fine tuning. We also compare these banks against vanilla-stochastic template banks and show that while both are equally efficient in the fitting-factor sense, the bank sizes are $\sim 25 \%$ larger in the stochastic method. Further, we show that the generation of the proposed hybrid banks can be sped-up by nearly an order of magnitude over the stochastic bank. Generic issues related to optimal implementation are discussed in detail. These improvements are expected to directly reduce the computational cost of gravitational wave searches.
