We investigate the stability analysis of AdS black holes in the higher dimensional sixth-order gravity. This gravity is composed of Ricci cubic gravity and Lee-Wick term. It indicates that the Ricci tensor perturbations exhibit unstable modes for small AdS black holes in Ricci cubic gravity by solving the Lichnerowicz-type linearized equation. We show that the correlated stability conjecture holds for the AdS black hole by computing all thermodynamic quantities in Ricci cubic gravity. Furthermore, we find a newly non-AdS black hole in Ricci cubic gravity by making use of a static eigenfunction of the Lichnerowicz operator.
