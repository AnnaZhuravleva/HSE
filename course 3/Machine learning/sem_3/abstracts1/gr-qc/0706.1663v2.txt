We analyze the stability of the Einstein static universe by considering homogeneous scalar perturbations in the context of f(R) modified theories of gravity. By considering specific forms of f(R), the stability regions of the solutions are parameterized by a linear equation of state parameter w=p/rho. Contrary to classical general relativity, it is found that in f(R) gravity a stable Einstein cosmos with a positive cosmological constant does indeed exist. Thus, we are lead to conclude that, in principle, modifications in f(R) gravity stabilize solutions which are unstable in general relativity.
