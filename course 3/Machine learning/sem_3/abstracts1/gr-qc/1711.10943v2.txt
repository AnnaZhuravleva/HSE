For the Bianchi type I space-time (vacuum or with a massless scalar field), the loop quantum cosmology bounce can be viewed as a rapid transition between two classical solutions, with a simple transformation rule relating the Kasner exponents of the two epochs. This transformation rule can be extended to other Bianchi space-times under the assumption that during the loop quantum cosmology bounce the contribution of the spatial curvature to the Hamiltonian constraint is negligible compared to the kinetic terms. For the vacuum Bianchi type IX space-time there are transformation rules for how each of the parameters characterizing the Kasner epochs change during the bounce. This provides a quantum gravity extension to the Mixmaster dynamics of general relativity, and may have interesting implications for the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz conjecture.
