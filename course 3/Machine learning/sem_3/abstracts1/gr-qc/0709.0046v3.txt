We consider the behavior of the tangential velocity of test particles moving in stable circular orbits in f(R) modified theories of gravity. A large number of observations at the galactic scale have shown that the rotational velocities of massive test particles (hydrogen clouds) tend towards constant values at large distances from the galactic center. We analyze the vacuum gravitational field equations in f(R) models in the constant velocity region, and the general form of the metric tensor is derived in a closed form. The resulting modification of the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is of the form R^{1+n}, with the parameter n expressed in terms of the tangential velocity. Therefore we find that to explain the motion of test particles around galaxies requires only very mild deviations from classical general relativity, and that modified gravity can explain the galactic dynamics without the need of introducing dark matter.
