In the present work we investigate evolving wormhole configurations described by a constant redshift function in Einstein-Cartan theory ({{\sf ECT}}). The matter content consists of a Weyssenhoff fluid along with an anisotropic matter which together generalize the anisotropic energy momentum tensor in general relativity ({{\sf GR}}) in order to include the effects of intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of particles. Using a generalized Friedmann-Robertson-Walker ({\sf FRW}) spacetime, we derive analytical evolving wormhole geometries by assuming a particular equation of state ({{\sf EoS}}) for energy density and pressure profiles. We introduce exact asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter spacetimes that admit traversable wormholes and respect energy conditions throughout the spacetime. The rate of expansion of these evolving wormholes is determined only by the Friedmann equation in the presence of spin effects.
