One of the most relevant solutions in any cosmological model concerning the evolution of the universe is the power-law solution. For the scalar-tensor model of dark energy with kinetic and Gauss Bonnet couplings, it is shown that we can conserve the power-law solution and at the same time meet the recent observational bound on the speed of gravitational waves. In the FRW background the anomalous contribution to the speed of gravitational waves, coming from the kinetic and Gauss-Bonnet couplings, cancel each other for power-law solutions without requiring fine tuning. It is shown that by simple restriction on the model parameters we can achieve a non-time-dependent cancellation of the anomaly. The model can realize the cosmic expansion with contributions from the kinetic and Gauss-Bonnet couplings of the order of ${\cal O}(1)$ to the dark energy density parameter. The results are valid on the homogeneous FRW background and the limitations of the approach are discussed.
