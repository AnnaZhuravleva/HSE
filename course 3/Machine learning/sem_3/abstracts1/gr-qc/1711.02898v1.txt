We study the shadow of rotating charge black holes in the presence of quintessence. The shadow of a rotating black hole is a distorted circle and in our study, we find that the shape and size of the black hole shadow depend upon four parameters, i.e., charge $q$, spin parameter $a$, quintessential field parameter $\omega_q$ and normalization factor $c$. The parameter $\omega_q$ can take the value between $-1<\omega_q<-1/3$ and related with pressure $p$ and density $\rho_q$ by the equation of state $p=\omega_q \rho_q$. We derive the complete geodesic structure of photon near black hole using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Carter constant separable method. We relate celestial coordinate to geodesics equation and plot the contour of the black hole shadow for the case $\omega_q=-2/3$. We compare our results with the standard Kerr-Newman black hole and find that for a fix value of $a$ and $q$, the black hole shadow decreases and get distorted with $c$. The area of the photon sphere is equal to the high-energy absorption cross section due to the optical properties of the black hole. On the basis of this assumption we calculate the energy emission rate of the black hole.
