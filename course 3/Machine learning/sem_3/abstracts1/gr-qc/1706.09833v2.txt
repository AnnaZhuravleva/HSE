The concept of effective dynamics has proven successful in LQC, the cosmological sector of LQG. We apply the same idea in the full theory, by computing the expectation value of the scalar constraint with respect to some coherent states peaked on the phase-space variables of flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. We comment on the relation with effective LQC and find a deviation stemming from the Lorentzian part of the Hamiltonian.
