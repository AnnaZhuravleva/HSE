We study trapped surfaces from the point of view of local isometric embedding into three-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. When a two-surface is embedded into three-dimensional Euclidean space, the problem of finding all surfaces applicable upon it gives rise to a non-linear partial differential equation of Monge-Ampere type, first discovered by Darboux, and later reformulated by Weingarten. Even today, this problem remains very difficult, despite some remarkable results. We find an original way of generalizing the Darboux technique, which leads to a coupled set of 6 non-linear partial differential equations. For the 3-manifolds occurring in Friedmann-(Lemaitre)-Robertson-Walker cosmologies, we show that the local isometric embedding of trapped surfaces into them can be proved by solving just one non-linear equation. Such an equation is here solved for the three kinds of Friedmann model associated with positive, zero, negative curvature of spatial sections, respectively.
