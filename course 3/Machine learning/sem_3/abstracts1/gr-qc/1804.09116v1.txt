We consider inflationary models with the inflaton coupled to Gauss-Bonnet term assuming a special relation $\delta_1=2\lambda\epsilon_1$ between the two slow-roll parameters $\delta_1$ and $\epsilon_1$. For the slow-roll inflation, the assumed relation leads to the reciprocal relation between the Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ and the potential $V(\phi)$, and it leads to the consistency relation $r=16(1-\lambda)\epsilon_1$ that reduces the tensor to scalar ratio $r$ by a factor of $1-\lambda$. For the constant-roll inflation, we derive the analytical expressions for the scalar and tensor power spectra, the scalar and tensor spectral tilts and the tensor to scalar ratio to the first order of $\epsilon_1$ by using the method of Bessel function approximation. Comparing the derived $n_s$-$r$ with the observations, we obtain the constraints on the model parameters $\eta$ and $\lambda$.
