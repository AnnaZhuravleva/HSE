This article presents a possible inflation scenario as a consequence of non-minimal gravitational couplings in the Conformal Standard Model. The model consists, in comparison to the SM, of additional right-chiral neutrinos and complex scalars coupled to the right-chiral neutrinos but not to the SM particles. The inflation is driven by two non-minimally coupled fields one being the usual Higgs and the other one of the sterile scalars. It turns out that in this model the tensor to scalar ratio and spectral index can match the current data for a wide range of parameters.
