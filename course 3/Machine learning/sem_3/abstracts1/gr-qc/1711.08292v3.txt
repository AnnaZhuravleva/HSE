A new class of black hole solutions of the five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity is presented. They are characterized by the mass, the electric charge, two equal magnitude angular momenta and the magnitude of the magnetic potential at infinity. These black holes possess a horizon of spherical topology; however, both the horizon and the sphere at infinity can be arbitrarily squashed, with nonextremal solutions interpolating between black strings and black branes. A particular set of extremal configurations corresponds to a new one-parameter family of supersymmetric black holes. While their conserved charges are determined by the squashing of the sphere at infinity, these supersymmetric solutions possess the same horizon geometry.
