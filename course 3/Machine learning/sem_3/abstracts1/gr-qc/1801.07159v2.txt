Dual structures on causal sets called timelets are introduced, being discrete analogs of global time coordinates. Algebraic and geometrical features of the set of timelets on a causal set are studied. A characterization of timelets in terms of incidence matrix of causal set is given. The connection between timelets and preclusive coevents is established, it is shown that any timelet has a unique decomposition over preclusive coevents. The equivalence classes of timelets with respect to reascaling are shown to form a simplicial complex.
