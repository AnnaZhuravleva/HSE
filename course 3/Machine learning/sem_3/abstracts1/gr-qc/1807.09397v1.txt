Similar to the Schwarzschild coordinates for spherical black holes, the Baldwin, Jeffery and Rosen coordinates for plane gravitational waves are often singular, and extensions beyond such singularities are necessary, before studying asymptotic properties of such spacetimes. In this paper, we study the nature of the singularities and find that some of them actually represent real spacetime singularities, so they already represent the boundaries of such spacetimes and extensions beyond them are not needed. As a result, such spacetimes cannot be used to study their asymptotical properties, such as memory effects and soft graviton theorems.
