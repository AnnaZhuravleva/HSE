In this paper we consider the flat FRW cosmology with a scalar field coupled with the metric along with generalized Chaplygin gas and perfect fluid comprising the matter sector. We use the Schutz's formalism to deal with the generalized Chaplygin gas sector. The full theory is then quantized canonically using the Wheeler-DeWitt Hamiltonian formalism. We then solve the WD equation with appropriate boundary conditions. Then by defining a proper completeness relation for the self-adjointness of the WD equation we arrive at the wave packet for the universe. It is observed that the peak in the probability density gets affected due to both fluids in the matter sector, namely, the Chaplygin gas and perfect fluid.
