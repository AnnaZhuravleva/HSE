We investigate the cosmological solutions of the $f(T)$ gravity theory using the method of dynamical systems. For this purpose a general form of the $f(T)$ function is considered and four conditions are defined that they have to satisfy in order to describe the standard cosmological history. We examine the power law, and another form of $f(T)$ against these conditions. For a power law function $f(T)= B(-T)^\beta$, $\beta$ must be less than one and unequal to $\frac{1}{2}$ to obtain a consistent cosmological model. We also investigate a model of inflation in this theory.
