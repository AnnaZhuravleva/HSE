Asymptotically safe quantum gravity predicts running gravitational and cosmological constants, while it remains a meaningful quantum field theory because of the existence of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points. Here we have investigated the effect of such running couplings on the cosmological perturbations. We have obtained the improved Mukhanov-Sassaki equation and solved it for two models. The effect of asymptotically safe quantum gravity on the cosmological power spectrum is also studied.
