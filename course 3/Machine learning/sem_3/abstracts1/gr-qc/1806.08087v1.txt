Gravity gradiometry within the framework of the general theory of relativity involves the measurement of the elements of the relativistic tidal matrix, which is theoretically obtained via the projection of the spacetime curvature tensor upon the nonrotating orthonormal tetrad frame of a geodesic observer. The behavior of the measured components of the curvature tensor under Lorentz boosts is briefly described in connection with the existence of certain special tidal directions. Relativistic gravity gradiometry in the exterior gravitational field of a rotating mass is discussed and a gravitomagnetic beat effect along an inclined spherical geodesic orbit is elucidated.
