The teleparallel formulation of gravity theories reveals close structural analogies to electrodynamics, which are more hidden in their usual formulation in terms of the curvature of spacetime. We show how every locally Lorentz invariant teleparallel theory of gravity with second order field equations can be understood as built from a gravitational field strength and excitation tensor which are related to each other by a constitutive relation, analogous to the axiomatic construction of theories of electrodynamics. We demonstrate how the previously studied models of $f(\mathbb{T})$ and $f(T_\text{ax},T_\text{ten},T_\text{vec})$ gravity as well as teleparallel dark energy can be formulated in this language. The advantage of this approach to gravity is that the field equations for different models all take the same compact form and general results can be obtained. An important new such result we find is a constraint which relates the field equations of the tetrad and the spin connection.
