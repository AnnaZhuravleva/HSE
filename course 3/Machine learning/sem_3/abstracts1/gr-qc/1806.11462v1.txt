In this paper the scattering of fermions by a class of Bardeen black holes is investigated. After obtaining the scattering modes by solving the Dirac equation in this geometry, we use the partial wave method to derive an analytical expression for the phase shifts that enter into the definitions of partial amplitudes that define the scattering cross sections and the induced polarization. It is then showed that, like in the case of Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om, the phenomena of glory and spiral scattering are present.
