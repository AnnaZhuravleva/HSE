We investigate the stability of the horizon in a warped anti-de Sitter black hole based on the three-dimensional new massive gravity by particle absorption. If a particle moving towards the black hole enters its outer horizon, the black hole changes because it absorbs conserved quantities of the particle. This variation is constrained by the equations of motion for the particle. We prove both the irreducibility of the entropy and stability of the horizon for the black hole through this process. However, the instability of the horizon is found in a near-extremal black hole by considering its second-order expansion. We resolve this instability by applying an adiabatic process for the absorption. Further, we show that the stability has the physical counterpart to the energy spectrum of the Virasoro generator via the warped anti-de Sitter/warped conformal field theory correspondence.
