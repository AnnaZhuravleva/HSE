Two important problems in studying the quantum black hole, namely the construction of the Hilbert space and the definition of the time evolution operator on such Hilbert space, are discussed using the de Sitter background field method for an observer far from the black hole. This is achieved through the ambient space formalism. Remarkably, in this approximation (distant observer), the theory preserves unitarity and analyticity, it is free from any infrared divergence, and it renders a quantum black hole entropy that turns out to be finite.
