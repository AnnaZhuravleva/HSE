Black holes in Lorentz-violating theories have been claimed to violate the second law of thermodynamics by perpetual motion energy extraction. We revisit this question for a Penrose splitting process in a spherically symmetric setting with two species of particles that move on radial geodesics that extend to infinity. We show that energy extraction by this process cannot happen in any theory in which gravity is attractive, in the sense of a geometric inequality that we describe. This inequality is satisfied by all known Einstein-\ae{}ther and Ho\v{r}ava black hole solutions.
