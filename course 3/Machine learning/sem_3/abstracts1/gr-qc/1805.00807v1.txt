The measurability notion introduced previously in a quantum theory on the basis of a minimal length in this paper is defined in thermodynamics on the basis of a minimal inverse temperature. Based on this notion, some inferences are made for gravitational thermodynamics of horizon spaces and, specifically, for black holes with the Schwarzschild metric.
