We investigate strong lensing by a spherically symmetric mass distribution in the framework of the Einstein-Straus solution with positive cosmological constant and concentrate on the case of a spatially closed Universe ($k=+1$). We develop a method based on integration of differential equations in order to make possible the computation of light deflection and time delay. By applying our results to the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we find that the bending of light and time delay depend on wether the present value of the scale factor $a_0$ is or is not much smaller than a value close to $9.1 \cdot 10^{26} \mbox{m}$. Beyond this value, the results are almost the same as for the spatially flat Universe. Moreover, it turns out that a positive cosmological constant attenuate the light bending in agreament with Rindler and Ishak's finding.
