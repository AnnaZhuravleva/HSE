In the first part of the paper we construct the metric of a tidally deformed, nonrotating black hole. The metric is presented as an expansion in powers of r/b << 1, in which r is the distance to the black hole and b the characteristic length scale of the tidal field --- the typical distance to the remote bodies responsible for the tidal environment. The metric is expanded through order (r/b)^4 and written in terms of a number of tidal multipole moments, the gravitoelectric moments E_{ab}, E_{abc}, E_{abcd} and the gravitomagnetic moments B_{ab}, B_{abc}, B_{abcd}. It differs from the similar construction of Poisson and Vlasov in that the tidal perturbation is presented in Regge-Wheeler gauge instead of the light-cone gauge employed previously. In the second part of the paper we determine the tidal moments by matching the black-hole metric to a post-Newtonian metric that describes a system of bodies with weak mutual gravity. This extends the previous work of Taylor and Poisson (paper I in this sequence), which computed only the leading-order tidal moments, E_{ab} and B_{ab}. The matching is greatly facilitated by the Regge-Wheeler form of the black-hole metric, and this motivates the work carried out in the first part of the paper. The tidal moments are calculated accurately through the first post-Newtonian approximation, and at this order they are independent of the precise nature of the compact body. The moments therefore apply equally well to a rotating black hole, or to a (rotating or nonrotating) neutron star. As an application of this formalism, we examine the intrinsic geometry of a tidally deformed event horizon, and describe it in terms of a deformation function that represents a quadrupolar and octupolar tidal bulge.
