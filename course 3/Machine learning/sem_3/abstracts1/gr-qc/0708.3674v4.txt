We investigate non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger-type formulation of cosmology of which our cosmological system is a general relativistic FRLW universe containing canonical scalar field under arbitrary potential and a barotropic fluid with arbitrary spatial curvatures. We extend the formulation to include phantom field case and we have found that Schr\"{o}dinger wave function in this formulation is generally non-normalizable. Assuming power-law expansion, $a \sim t^q$, we obtain scalar field potential as function of time. The corresponding quantities in Schr\"{o}dinger-type formulation such as Schr\"{o}dinger total energy, Schr\"{o}dinger potential and wave function are also presented.
