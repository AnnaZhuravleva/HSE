We analyze the pair production induced by homogenous, time-dependent electric fields in an expanding space-time background. We point out that, in obtaining the semiclassical Maxwell equations, two distinct notions of adiabatic renormalization are possible. In Minkowski space the two recipes turn out to be equivalent. However, in the presence of gravity only the recipe requiring an adiabatic hierarchy between the gravitational and the gauge field is consistent with the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor.
