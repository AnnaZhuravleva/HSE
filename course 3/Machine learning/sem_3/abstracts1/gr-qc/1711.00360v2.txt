$\tilde{\delta}$ Gravity is a gravitational field model, where the geometry is governed by two symmetric tensors, $g_{\mu \nu}$ and $\tilde{g}_{\mu \nu}$, and new matter fields ($\tilde{\delta}$ Matter fields) are added to the original matter fields. These new components appear motivated by a new symmetry, called $\tilde{\delta}$ symmetry. In previous works, the model is used to explain the expansion of the Universe without Dark Energy and use $\tilde{\delta}$ Matter as a source of Dark Matter. In this paper, we will developed an initial study of Schwarzschild geometry in $\tilde{\delta}$ Gravity to complement the Dark Matter analysis and introduce other phenomena. We will get a modified deflection of light produced by the sun, the perihelion precession and black hole solution.
