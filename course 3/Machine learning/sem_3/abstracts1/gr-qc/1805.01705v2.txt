The accelerated expansion of the universe can be interpreted as a quest for satisfying holographic equipartition. It can be expressed by a simple law, $\Delta V = \Delta t\left(N_{surf}- N_{bulk}\right)$ which leads to the standard Friedmann equation. This novel idea suggested by Padmanabhan in the context of general relativity has been generalized by Sheykhi to Gauss Bonnet and Lovelock gravity for a universe with any spacial curvature. We have proved the consistency of this generalized holographic equipartition law with the maximum entropy principle. In particular, when the degrees of freedom in the bulk $( N_{bulk})$ becomes equal to the degrees of freedom on the boundary surface $(N_{surf}),$ the universe attains a state of maximum entropy. Thus, the validity of the holographic equipartition law ensures the validity of the maximum entropy principle.
