We show that in the vacuum inflation model, the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism will produce the baryon asymmetry. We analyze the evolution of entropy and baryon number in the vacuum inflation model. The comparison between dilution speed and the chemical potential may give a natural interpretation for decouple temperature of the gravitational baryogenesis interaction. From the result, the mechanism can give acceptable baryon-to-entropy ratio in the vacuum inflation model.
