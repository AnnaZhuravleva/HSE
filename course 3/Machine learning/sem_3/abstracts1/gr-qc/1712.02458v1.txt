We demonstrate the existence of static, spherically symmetric globally regular, i.e. solitonic solutions of a shift-symmetric scalar-tensor gravity model with negative cosmological constant. The norm of the Noether current associated to the shift symmetry is finite in the full space-time. We also discuss the corresponding black hole solutions and demonstrate that the interplay between the scalar-tensor coupling and the cosmological constant leads to the existence of new branches of solutions. To linear order in the scalar-tensor coupling, the asymptotic space-time corresponds to an Anti-de Sitter space-time with a non-trivial scalar field on its conformal boundary. This allows the interpretation of our solutions in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, we demonstrate that - for physically relevant, small values of the scalar-tensor coupling - solutions with positive cosmological constant do not exist in our model.
