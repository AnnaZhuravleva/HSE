We investigate how a spherically symmetric fluid modifies the Schwarzschild vacuum solution when there is no exchange of energy-momentum between the fluid and the central source of the Schwarzschild metric. This system is described by means of the gravitational decoupling realised via the minimal geometric deformation approach, which allows us to prove that the fluid must be anisotropic. Several cases are then explicitly shown
