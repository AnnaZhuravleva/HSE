Scalar field vacuum energy and particle creation in a 3D Casimir apparatus, freely falling in the Schwarzschild spacetime, are considered in the reference frame of a comoving observer. Following Schwinger's proper time approach, Casimir energy is evaluated from the effective action, resulting in a small correction to the flat spacetime case. Besides, a tiny amount of quanta excited out from the vacuum is found. Both effects are discussed, drawing attention to the role of the underlying spacetime dimensionality.
