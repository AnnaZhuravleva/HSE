We show the existence of some bouncing cosmological solutions in the braneworld scenario. More specifically, we consider a dynamical three-brane in the background of Born-Infeld and electrically charged Gauss-Bonnet black hole. We find that, in certain range of parameter space, the brane universe, at least classically, never shrinks to a zero size, resulting in a singularity-free cosmology within the classical domain.
