In the present work, we attempt to find a new class of solution for the spherically symmetric perfect fluid sphere by employing the Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM), a new tool using which the mass polynomial function facilitates of field equations. A set of interior solutions found on the basis of the simplest MIT Bag model equation of state (EOS) in the form $p=\frac{1}{3}(\rho-4\,B)$ where $B$ is the Bag constant. The proposed interior metric for the stellar system is consistent with the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime on the boundary. In addition, we also study the different tests, viz. energy conditions, TOV equation, adiabatic index, Buchdahl limit, etc. to verify the physical validity of the proposed model, in detail. The numerical value of the used parameters is predicted for the different stars, for the choices of the bag constant. In a nutshell, our model predicts a singularity free, stable and ultra dense strange (quark) star.
