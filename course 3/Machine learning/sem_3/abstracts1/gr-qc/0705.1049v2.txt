We consider the question of properly defining energy and momenta for non asymptotic Minkowskian spaces in general relativity. Only spaces of this type, whose energy, linear 3-momentum, and intrinsic angular momentum vanish, would be candidates for creatable universes, that is, for universes which could have arisen from a vacuum quantum fluctuation. Given a universe, we completely characterize the family of coordinate systems for which one could sensibly say that this universe is a creatable universe.
