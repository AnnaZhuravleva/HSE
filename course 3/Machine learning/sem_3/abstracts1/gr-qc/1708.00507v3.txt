It is presented an exact solution of straight spinning cosmic strings in Brans-Dicke theory of gravitation. The possibility of the existence of closed timelike curves around these cosmic strings is analyzed. Furthermore, the stability about the formation of the topological defect discussed here is checked. It is shown the existence of a suitable choice for the integration constants in which closed timelike curves are not allowed. We also verify if it is possible that the obtained spacetime can be the source that describes the observed rotational curves in some galaxies.
