We extend a new finite element code, Einstein PHG (iPHG), to solve the evolution part of Einstein equations in first-order GH formalism. This paper is the third one of a systematic investigation of applying adaptive finite element method to the Einstein equations, especially binary compact objects simulations. The main motivation of this work is to evolve black holes for the first time by means of a continuous Galerkin finite element method on unstructured (tetrahedral) mesh. We test our code by evolving a nonlinear scalar wave equation. It works well and runs stably with both reflect and radiative boundary conditions. Then we use iPHG to simulate the full three-dimensional spacetime of a single black hole. We find that the filter used to dealt with aliasing error is a crucial ingredient for numerical stability. For simplicity, we impose the "freezing" ingoing characteristic fields condition in weak form at the outer boundary. Our simulations show both the convergence and stability.
