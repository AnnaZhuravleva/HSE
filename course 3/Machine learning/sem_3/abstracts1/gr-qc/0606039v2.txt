Bekenstein's theory of relativistic gravity is conventionally written as a bi-metric theory. The two metrics are related by a disformal transformation defined by a dynamical vector field and a scalar field. In this comment we show that the theory can be re-written as Vector-Tensor theory akin to Einstein-Aether theories with non-canonical kinetic terms. We discuss some of the implications of this equivalence.
