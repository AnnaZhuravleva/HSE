A new kind of quantum indeterminacy of transverse position is shown to arise from quantum degrees of freedom of spacetime, based on the assumption that classical trajectories can be defined no better than the diffraction limit of Planck scale waves. Indeterminacy of the angular orientation of particle trajectories due to wave/particle duality at the Planck scale leads to indeterminacy of a nearly-flat spacetime metric, described as a small nonvanishing quantum commutation relation between transverse position operators at different events along a null trajectory. An independent derivation of the same effect is presented based on the requirement of unitarity in black hole evaporation. The indeterminacy is interpreted as a universal holographic quantum spacetime noise, with a frequency-independent spectrum of metric perturbation amplitude, h_H^2^{1/2} \simeq \sqrt{l_P}=2.3 \times 10^{-22} /\sqrt{Hz}, where l_P denotes the Planck length. The effect is estimated to be directly measurable using current interferometer technology similar to LIGO and LISA.
