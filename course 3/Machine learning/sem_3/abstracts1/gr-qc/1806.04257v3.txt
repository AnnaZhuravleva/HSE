Deviation from standard dispersion relations for electrons and photons in the form of an extra term proportional to an arbitrarily high power of momentum is studied. It is shown that observational constraints lead to a region in the parametric space that is similar in shape to the region obtained earlier in a theory in which the extra term was proportional to third power of momentum.
