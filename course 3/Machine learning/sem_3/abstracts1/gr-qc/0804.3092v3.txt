The staid subject of exact static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations has been reinvigorated in the last decade. We now have several solution generating techniques which give rise to new exact solutions. Here the Einstein static Universe is transformed into a physically acceptable solution the properties of which are examined in detail. The emphasis here is on the importance of the integration constants that these generating techniques introduce.
