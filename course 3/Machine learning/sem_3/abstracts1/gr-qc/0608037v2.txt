During inflation quantum effects from massless, minimally coupled scalars and gravitons can be strengthened so much that perturbation theory breaks down. To follow the subsequent evolution one must employ a nonperturbative resummation.

To follow the subsequent evolution one must employ a nonperturbative resummation. Starobinski\u{\i} has developed such a technique for simple scalar theories. I discuss recent progress in applying this technique to more complicated models.
