We numerically investigate limits of a two-parameter family of stationary solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system. The solutions are toroidal and have non-vanishing angular momentum. As one tunes to more relativistic solutions (measured for example by an increasing redshift) there exists a sequence of solutions which approaches the extreme Kerr black hole family. Solutions with angular momentum larger than the square of the mass are also investigated, and in the relativistic limit the near-field geometry of such solutions is observed to become conical in the sense that there is a deficit angle. Such solutions may provide self-consistent models for rotating circular cosmic strings.
