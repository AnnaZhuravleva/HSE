Criteria for thermal stability of charged rotating black holes of any dimension are derived, for horizon areas that are large relative to the Planck area (in these dimensions). The derivation is based on generic assumptions of quantum geometry based on some results of loop quantum gravity, and equilibrium statistical mechanics of the Grand Canonical ensemble. There is no explicit use of classical spacetime geometry in this analysis. The only assumption is that the mass of the black hole is a function of its horizon area, charge and angular momentum. Our stability criteria are then tested in detail against specific classical black holes in spacetime dimensions 4 and 5, whose metrics provide us with explicit relations for the dependence of the mass on the charge and angular momentum of the black holes. This enables us to predict which of these black holes are expected to be thermally unstable under Hawking radiation.
