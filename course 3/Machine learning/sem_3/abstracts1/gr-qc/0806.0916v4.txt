We describe spherically symmetric steady-state accretion of perfect fluid in the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. We present analytic solutions for accretion of a fluid with the linear equations of state and of the Chaplygin gas. It is also shown that, under reasonable physical conditions, there is no steady-state accretion of a perfect fluid onto a Reissner-Nordstrom naked singularity. Instead, a static atmosphere of fluid is formed. We discuss a possibility of violation of the third law of black hole thermodynamics for a phantom fluid accretion.
