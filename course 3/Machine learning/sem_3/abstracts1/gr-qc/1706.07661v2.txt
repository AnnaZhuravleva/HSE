In this paper, aniostropic dark energy cosmological models have been constructed in a Bianchi-V space-time with the energy momentum tensor consisting of two non-interacting fluids namely bulk viscous fluid and dark energy fluid. Two different models are constructed based on the power law cosmology and de Sitter universe. The constructed model also embedded with different pressure gradients along different spatial directions. The variable equation of state (EoS) parameter, skewness parameters for both the models are obtained and analyzed. The physical properties of the models obtained with the use of scale factors of power law and de Sitter law are also presented.
