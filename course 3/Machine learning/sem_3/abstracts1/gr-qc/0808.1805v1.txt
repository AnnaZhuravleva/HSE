The brick wall method in calculations of the entropy of black holes can be applied to the FRW cosmology in order to study the statistical entropy. An appropriate cutoff satisfying the covariant entropy bound can be chosen so that the entropy has a definite bound. Among the entropy for each of cosmological eras, the vacuum energy-dominated era turns out to give the maximal entropy which is in fact compatible with assumptions from the brick wall method.
