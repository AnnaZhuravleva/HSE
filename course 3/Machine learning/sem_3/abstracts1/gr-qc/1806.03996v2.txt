Tsallis and Cirto have shown that thermodynamical entropy of a gravitational system such as a black hole should be generalized to the non-additive entropy, which is given by $S_h=\gamma A^{\beta}$, where $A$ is the horizon area \cite{Tsa}. Combining the Tsallis entropy with the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_hdS_h+WdV$, on the apparent horizon of FRW Universe, we successfully derive the modified Friedmann equations. Then, we check the evolution of the total entropy of the Universe and show that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds for the volume enclosed by the apparent horizon. Finally, using the modified version of the emergence proposal of gravity proposed by Padmanabhan and calculating the difference between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom, we reproduce the modified Friedmann equation of the FRW Universe which coincides with the result obtained from the first law of thermodynamics.
