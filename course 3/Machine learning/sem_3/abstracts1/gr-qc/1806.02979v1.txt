In this short paper we discuss the possibility of testing the nature of astrophysical black holes using the recently observed black hole mergers. We investigate the possibility that a secondary black hole is created in the merger of two astrophysical black holes and discuss potential astrophysical signatures. We point out that black hole mergers are a possible astrophysical mechanism for the creation of quantum black holes with masses close to the Planck mass.
