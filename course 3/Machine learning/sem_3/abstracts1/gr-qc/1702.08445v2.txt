We suggest using Einstein's static universe metric for the metastable state after reheating, instead of the Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. In this case strong static gravitational potential leads to the effective reduction of the Higgs vacuum expectation value, which is found to be compatible with the Standard Model first order electroweak phase transition conditions. Gravity could also increase the CP-violating effects for particles that cross the new phase bubble walls and thus is able to lead to the successful electroweak baryogenesis scenario.
