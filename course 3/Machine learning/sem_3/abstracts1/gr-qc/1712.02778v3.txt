We present a complete list of general relativistic shear-free solutions in a class of anisotropic, spatially homogeneous and orthogonal cosmological models containing a collection of $n$ independent $p$-form gauge fields, where $p\in\{0,1,2,3\}$, in addition to standard $\Lambda$CDM matter fields modelled as perfect fluids. Here a (collection of) gauge field(s) balances anisotropic spatial curvature on the right-hand side of the shear propagation equation. The result is a class of solutions dynamically equivalent to standard FLRW cosmologies, with an effective curvature constant $K_{\rm{eff}}$ that depends both on spatial curvature and the energy density of the gauge field(s). In the case of a single gauge field ($n=1$) we show that the only spacetimes that admit such solutions are the LRS Bianchi type III, Bianchi type VI$_0$ and Kantowski-Sachs metric, which are dynamically equivalent to open ($K_{\rm{eff}}<0$), flat ($K_{\rm{eff}}=0$) and closed ($K_{\rm{eff}}>0$) FLRW models, respectively. With a collection of gauge fields ($n>1$) also Bianchi type II admits a shear-free solution ($K_{\rm{eff}}>0$). We identify the LRS Bianchi type III solution to be the unique shear-free solution with a gauge field Hamiltonian bounded from below in the entire class of models.
