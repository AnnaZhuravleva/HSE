We consider the problem of stability of anti-de Sitter spacetime in five dimensions under small purely gravitational perturbations satisfying the cohomogeneity-two biaxial Bianchi IX ansatz. In analogy to spherically symmetric scalar perturbations, we observe numerically a black hole formation on the time-scale $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the size of the perturbation.
