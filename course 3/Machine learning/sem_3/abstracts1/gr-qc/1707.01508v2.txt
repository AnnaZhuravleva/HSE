The static spherically symmetric traversable wormholes are analysed in the Einstein- Cartan theory of gravitation. In particular, we computed the torsion tensor for matter fields with different spin S = 0; 1/2; 1; 3/2. Interestingly, only for certain values of the spin the torsion contribution to Einstein-Cartan field equation allows one to satisfy both faring-out condition and Null Energy Condition. In this scenario traversable wormholes can be produced by using usual (non-exotic) spinning matter.
