The article is addressing a possibility of implementation of spin network states on adiabatic quantum computer. The discussion is focused on application of currently available technologies and analyzes a concrete example of D-Wave machine. A class of simple spin network states which can be implemented on the Chimera graph architecture of the D-Wave quantum processor is introduced. However, extension beyond the currently available quantum processor topologies is required to simulate more sophisticated spin network states, which may inspire development of new generations of adiabatic quantum computers. A possibility of simulating Loop Quantum Gravity is discussed and a method of solving a graph non-changing scalar (Hamiltonian) constraint with the use of adiabatic quantum computations is proposed.
