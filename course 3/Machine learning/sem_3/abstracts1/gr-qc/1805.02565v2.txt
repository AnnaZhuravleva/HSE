We explore a cosmological model in which the time scale is variable with the expansion of the universe and the effective spacetime is driven by the inflaton field. An example is considered and their predictions are contrasted between $WMAP9$, and $WMAP9+N_{eff}$ data, where $N_{eff}$ are the number of relativistic species. We calculate the spectrum indices and the slow-rolling parameters of the effective potential. The results are in very good agreement with observations.
