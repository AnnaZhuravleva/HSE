We derive the complete set of geodesic equations for massive and massless, charged test particles of a five-dimensional, rotating and charged solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons field equations in five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity and present their analytical solutions. We study the polar and radial motion, depending on the spacetime and test particle parameters, and characterize the test particle motion qualitatively by the means of parametric plots and effective potentials. We use the analytical solutions in order to visualize the test particle motion by three-dimensional plots.
