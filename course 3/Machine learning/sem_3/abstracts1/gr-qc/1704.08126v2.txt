Using the synchronous coordinates, the creation of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a de Sitter spacetime can be viewed as a coherent creation of a collection of timelike geodesics. The previously supposed conical singularities do not exist at the horizons of the constrained instan- ton. Instead, the unavoidable irregularity is presented as a non-vanishing second fundamental form elsewhere at the quantum transition 3-surface. The same arguments can be applied to charged, topological or higher dimensional black hole cases.
