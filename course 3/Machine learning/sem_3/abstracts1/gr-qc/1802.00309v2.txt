In this paper, we investigate a class of $5$-dimensional black holes in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity with dyonic charges. At first step, thermodynamical quantities of the black holes and their behaviors are explored for different limits. Thermal stability and the possibility of the van der Waals like phase transition are addressed and the effects of different parameters on them are investigated. The second part is devoted to simulation of the trajectory of particles around these black holes and investigation of the angular frequency of particles' motion. The main goal is understanding the effects of higher curvature gravity (Gauss-Bonnet gravity) and magnetic charge on the structure of black holes and the geodesic paths of particles moving around these black holes.
