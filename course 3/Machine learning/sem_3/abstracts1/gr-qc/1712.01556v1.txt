A specific class of singularity free cosmological model has recently been considered in light of different observational data like Observed Hubble Data, BAO data from Luminous Red Galaxy survey by Slowan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and CMB data from WMAP. However it is observed that only $12-14$ data points are used to study the viability of the model in late time . In this paper we discuss the viability of all the models belonging to the same class of EU in light of Union Compilation data (SnIa) which consists over a hundred data points, thus getting a more robust test for viability. More importantly it is crucial that we can distinguish between the various models proposed in the class of solution obtained. We discuss here why with present observational data it is difficult to distinguish between all of them. We show that the late time behaviour of the model is typical to any asymptotically de-Sitter model.
