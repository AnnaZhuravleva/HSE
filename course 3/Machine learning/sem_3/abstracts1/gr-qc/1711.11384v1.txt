In this work, the dynamic of isolated systems in general relativity is described when gravitational radiation and electromagnetic fields are present. In this construction, the asymptotic fields received at null infinity together with the regularized null cone cuts equation, and the center of mass of an asymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell spacetime are used. A set of equations are derived in the low speed regime, linking their time evolution to the emitted gravitational radiation and to the Maxwell fields received at infinity. These equations should be useful when describing the dynamic of compact sources, such as the final moments of binary coalescence and the evolution of the final black hole. Additionally, we compare our equations with those coming from a similar approach given by Newman, finding some differences in the motion of the center of mass and spin of the gravitational system.
