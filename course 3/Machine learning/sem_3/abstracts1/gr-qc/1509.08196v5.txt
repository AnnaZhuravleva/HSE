We propose to formulate a theory for Classical Stochastic Gravity for certain applications in Astrophysics and Cosmology.This involves the Langevin approach in curved spacetime, which is introduced here, in the form of a classical Einstein-Langevin equation.The domain of applications of such an approach and possible outcomes of this formulation which are quite different than its semiclassical counterpart (which is an active area of research), are discussed.This field of study can be seen to emerge out of well established ideas and results in Brownian motion theory as well as the Stochastic Semiclassical Gravity and related issues in Thermodynamics. A brief calculation, to demonstrate the contribution of stochasticty and induce fluctuations to the background spacetime via heuristic solution of the Einstein Langevin equation is given .The applicability of the proposed theme can have a wider expanse than is mentioned in this article.
