We investigate anisotropic compact stars in the non-minimal $Y(R)F^2$ model of gravity which couples an arbitrary function of curvature scalar $Y(R)$ to the electromagnetic field invariant $F^2$. After we obtain exact anisotropic solutions to the field equations of the model, we apply the continuity conditions to the solutions at the boundary of the star. Then we find the mass, electric charge, and surface gravitational redshift by the parameters of the model and radius of the star.
