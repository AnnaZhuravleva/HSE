In this paper, we analyse the well-posedness of the initial value formulation for particular kinds of geometric scalar-tensor theories of gravity, which are based on a Weyl integrable space-time. We will show that, within a frame-invariant interpretation for the theory, the Cauchy problem in vacuum is well-posed. We will analyse the global in space problem, and, furthermore, we will show that geometric uniqueness holds for the solutions. We make contact with Brans-Dicke theory, and by analysing the similarities with such models, we highlight how some of our results can be translated to this well-known context, where not all of these problems have been previously addressed.
