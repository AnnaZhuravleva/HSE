We consider null geodesics in the domain of outer communication of a sub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show, that most fundamental properties of null geodesics can be represented in one plot. In particular one can see immediately that the ergoregion and trapping are separated in phase space. Furthermore we show that from the point of view of any timelike observer outside of a black hole, trapping can be understood as a smooth set of spacelike directions on the observers' celestial sphere.
