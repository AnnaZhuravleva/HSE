The dynamics of Einstein--conformally coupled Higgs field (EccH) system is investigated near the initial singularities in the presence of Friedman--Robertson--Walker symmetries. We solve the field equations asymptotically up to fourth order near the singularities analytically, and determine the solutions numerically as well. We found all the asymptotic, power series singular solutions, which are (1) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity but the Higgs field is bounded (`Small Bang'), or (2) solutions with a Milne type singularity with bounded spacetime curvature and Higgs field, or (3) solutions with a scalar polynomial curvature singularity and diverging Higgs field (`Big Bang'). Thus, in the present EccH model there is a new kind of physical spacetime singularity (`Small Bang'). The large scale behaviour of the solutions is investigated numerically as well. In particular, the numerical calculations indicate that there are singular solutions that cannot be approximated by power series.
