We present an exact solution in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity describing a spacetime with an anisotropic Kasner-type singularity and Lifshitz asymptotics. This configuration can also be supported by a phantom scalar while still satisfying the Null Energy Condition. For certain parameters of this solution, null geodesics can have an infinitely deep effective potential, thus trapping photons in a finite region along the radial direction. Some examples of periodic null geodesics are obtained. A particularly interesting special case of this solution is a regular, soliton-type metric that retains its Lifshitz scaling in the time coordinate.
