Lattice refinement in LQC, its meaning and its necessity are discussed. The r\^ole of lattice refinement for the realisation of a successful inflationary model is explicitly shown. A simple and effective numerical technique to solve the constraint equation for any choice of lattice refinement model is briefly illustrated. Phenomenological and consistency requirements leading to a particular choice of lattice refinement model are presented, while it is subsequently proved that only this choice of lattice refinement leads to a unique factor ordering in the Wheeler-De Witt equation, which is the continuum limit of LQC.
