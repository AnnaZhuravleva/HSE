We compute the axial quasi-normal modes of static neutron stars in scalar tensor theory. In particular, we employ various realistic equations of state including nuclear, hyperonic and hybrid matter. We investigate the fundamental curvature mode and compare the results with those of General Relativity. We find that the frequency of the modes and the damping time are reduced for the scalarized neutron stars. In addition, we confirm and extend the universal relations for quasi-normal modes known in General Relativity to this wide range of realistic equations of state for scalarized neutron stars and confirm the universality of the scaled frequency and damping time in terms of the scaled moment of inertia as well as compactness for neutron stars with and without scalarization.
