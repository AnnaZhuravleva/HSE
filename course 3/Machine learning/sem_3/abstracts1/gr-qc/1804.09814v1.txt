We present a general analytical treatment of cosmological models commanded by three interactive fluids with arbitrary barotropic indexes. The variable equations of state case are applicable to universes with quintessences, k essences and holographic fluids and we pay some attention to the holographic case. We also propose the need to extend the functional forms of the holographic energy densities that are usual in the literature in the face of the incompatibility presented by them when special interactions are used.
