Simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics often need both high accuracy and robust shock-handling properties. The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method combines these features --- a high order of convergence in regions where the solution is smooth, and shock-capturing properties for regions where it is not --- with geometric flexibility, and is therefore well-suited to solve the PDEs describing astrophysical scenarios. We present here evolutions of a general-relativistic neutron star with the DG method. In these simulations, we simultaneously evolve the spacetime geometry and the matter on the same computational grid, which we conform to the spherical geometry of the problem. To verify the correctness of our implementation, we perform standard convergence and shock tests. We then show results for evolving, in 3D, a Kerr black hole, a neutron star in the Cowling approximation (holding the spacetime metric fixed), and, finally, a neutron star where the spacetime and matter are both dynamical. These results mark the first application of the DG method to simultaneous evolution of the spacetime geometry and matter. The evolutions show long-term stability, good accuracy, and improved rate of convergence versus a comparable-resolution finite volume method.
