We present a new model of gravastar in the higher dimensional Einsteinian spacetime including Einstein's cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Following Mazur and Mottola (2001,~2004) we obtain a set of solutions for gravastar. This gravastar is described by three different regions, namely, (I) Interior region, (II) Intermediate thin spherical shell and (III) Exterior region. The pressure within the interior region is equal to the negative matter density which provides a repulsive force over the shell. This thin shell is formed by ultra relativistic plasma, where the pressure is directly proportional to the matter-energy density which does counter balance the repulsive force from the interior whereas the exterior region is completely vacuum assumed to be de Sitter spacetime which can be described by the generalized Schwarzschild solution. With this specification we find out a set of exact and non-singular solutions of the gravastar which seems physically very interesting and reasonable.
