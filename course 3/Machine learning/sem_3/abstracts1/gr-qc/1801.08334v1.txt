In this letter we study the spherically symmetric space-time for a diffusive two measures theory. It is demonstrated that by imposing an asymmetric wormhole geometry, one gets a metric coefficient which for galactic distances has a linear term and from the analysis of Mannheim and collaborators, can be used to describe the galactic rotation curves and for cosmological distances one can obtain a de-Sitter space-time. Center of gravity coordinates for the wormhole are introduced and it is argued that these coordinates are the most suitable for the collective motion of a wormhole. The metric coefficients depend on the asymmetric wormhole parameters, The coefficient of the linear potential is proportional to both the mass of the wormhole and the cosmological constant. Similar results are also expected in other theories like $k$-essence theories, etc. that may support wormholes.
