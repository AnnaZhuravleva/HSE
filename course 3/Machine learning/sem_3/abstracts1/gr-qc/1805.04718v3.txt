Here we shall show how to reconstruct the shape function of a spherically symmetric traversable Lorenzian wormhole near its throat if one knows high frequency quasinormal modes of the wormhole. The wormhole spacetime is given by the Morris-Thorne ansatz. The solution to the inverse problem via fitting of the parameters within the WKB approach is unique for arbitrary tideless wormholes and some wormholes with non-zero tidal effects, but this is not so for arbitrary wormholes. As examples, we reproduce the near throat geometries of the Bronnikov-Ellis and tideless Morris-Thorne metrics by their quasinormal modes at high multipole numbers $\ell$.
