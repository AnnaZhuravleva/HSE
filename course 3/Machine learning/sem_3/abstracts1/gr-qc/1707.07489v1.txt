We follow the prevailing view that black holes do not destroy but rather process and release information in the form of Hawking radiation. By making certain conservative assumptions regarding the interior dynamics of the quantum system we suggest an outside observer could, in principle, recover the initial quantum state $\left|\psi\right\rangle $ before the black hole has evaporated half of its entropy. In the current framework the retention time is associated with the time scale for a local perturbation to become effectively undetectable (scrambling time). Also, we provide a scenario for storing the information about an infalling matter in the near-horizon region in a layered fashion. Later we present a generic phenomena which provides a set of boundary conditions for breaking the trans-horizon vacuum entanglement between in- and out-modes, and thus preserve the effective field theory after Page time $\mathcal{O}(R^{3})$. The scenario follows from black hole perturbation theory. We further argue the proposed Planckian-amplitude horizon oscillations can account for the physical membrane which an observer at future null infinity $\mathcal{L}^{+}$ measures in the complementarity conjecture.
