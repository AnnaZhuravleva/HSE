We discuss the solution to Einstein's equations for a metric describing a slowly rotating black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. A family of solutions is found, each one describing a different scheme of rotation for the black hole; the Kerr-Newman solution is recovered as a particular case that emphasizes the special rol played by Maxwell's electrodynamics. We also discuss the existence of ergospheres and circular photon orbits.
