Photon circular orbits, an extreme case of light deflection, are among the hallmarks of black holes and are known to play a central role in a variety of phenomena related to these extreme objects. The very existence of these orbits when motion is not confined in the equatorial plane is indeed a special property of the separable Kerr metric and may not occur, for instance, in the spacetime of other more speculative ultracompact objects. In this paper we consider a general stationary-axisymmetric spacetime which already possesses an equatorial photon circular orbit and examine under what circumstances spherical or more general, variable-radius, `spheroidal' non-equatorial photon orbits may exist. In addressing this question, we first derive a necessary circularity condition for the existence of such orbits and then go on to show that the presence of spherical orbits is really connected to the separability of the metric (that is, to the existence of a third integral of motion). Specifically, a spacetime that does not admit spherical orbits is necessarily non-separable. In addition, this kind of spacetime may not even admit the more general spheroidal orbits. As concrete examples of this connection between separability and circularity we study null orbits in a variety of known non-Kerr metrics (Johanssen-Psaltis, Johannsen and Hartle-Thorne). The implications of these results for the electromagnetic and gravitational wave signature of non-Kerr objects are briefly discussed.
