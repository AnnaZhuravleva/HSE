We studied the gravitational collapse of a shell of dust in shape dynamics. We found out static and oscillatory solutions. In the large momentum limit we found out that the shell never reaches the singularity when the momentum of the shell is much larger than the mass of the shell in magnitude. The shell does not reach to the origin in a finite amount of time however when the momentum of the shell becomes comparable to minus the mass of shell, the large momentum approximation breaks down. Therefore more detailed future works hopefully may be able to answer the question of singularity formation in this setup.
