Emission relativistic coordinates are a class of spacetime coordinates defined and generated by four emitters (satellites, pulsars) broadcasting their proper time by radio signals. They are the main ingredient of the simplest conceivable relativistic positioning system. The emission coordinates are independent of any observer. Receiving directly the proper time at emission of four satellites, any user or observer can measure the values of the emission coordinates, from which he/she can obtain his trajectory and hence, in particular, his position. Moreover, if and only if the four satellites also broadcast to the users the proper times they are receiving by cross-link autonavigation from the other emitters, the positioning system is called autolocated or autonomous. In an autolocated positioning system the trajectories of the satellites of the constellation can also be known by the users and they can also obtain the metric of the spacetime (the gravitational field) on the constellation.   The study of autolocated relativistic positioning systems has been initiated by Coll and coll. several years ago and it has been aimed for developing an exact fully relativistic theory of positioning systems and gravimetry, based on the framework and concepts of General Relativity. This exact relativistic framework is the alternative to considering post-newtonian relativistic corrections in a classical Newtonian framework, which is the customary approach yet now used in GPS and GLONASS.
