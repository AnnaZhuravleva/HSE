Based on the analogy with non-minimal SU(2) symmetric Wu-Yang monopole with regular metric, the solution describing a non-minimal U(1) symmetric Dirac monopole is obtained. In order to take into account the curvature coupling of gravitational and electromagnetic fields, we reconstruct the effective metrics of two types: the so-called associated and optical metrics. The optical metrics display explicitly that the effect of birefringence induced by curvature takes place in the vicinity of the non-minimal Dirac monopole; these optical metrics are studied analytically and numerically.
