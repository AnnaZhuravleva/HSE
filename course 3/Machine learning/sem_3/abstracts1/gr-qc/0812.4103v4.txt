This paper deals with two aspects of relativistic cosmologies with closed (compact and boundless) spatial sections. These spacetimes are based on the theory of General Relativity, and admit a foliation into space sections S(t), which are spacelike hypersurfaces satisfying the postulate of the closure of space: each S(t) is a 3-dimensional, closed Riemannian manifold. The discussed topics are: (1) A comparison, previously obtained, between Thurston's geometries and Bianchi-Kantowski-Sachs metrics for such 3-manifolds is here clarified and developed. (2) Some implications of global inhomogeneity for locally homogeneous 3-spaces of constant curvature are analyzed from an observational viewpoint.
