The quasinormal resonant modes of massless neutral fields in near-extremal Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black-hole spacetimes are calculated in the eikonal regime. It is explicitly proved that, in the angular momentum regime ${\bar a}> \sqrt{{{1-2{\bar\Lambda}}\over{4+{\bar\Lambda}/3}}}$, the black-hole spacetimes are characterized by slowly decaying resonant modes which are described by the compact formula $\Im\omega(n)=\kappa_+\cdot(n+{1\over2})$ [here the physical parameters $\{{\bar a},\kappa_+,{\bar\Lambda},n\}$ are respectively the dimensionless angular momentum of the black hole, its characteristic surface gravity, the dimensionless cosmological constant of the spacetime, and the integer resonance parameter]. Our results support the validity of the Penrose strong cosmic censorship conjecture in these black-hole spacetimes.
