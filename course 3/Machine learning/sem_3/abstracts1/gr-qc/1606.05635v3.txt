We study a curvature singularity resolution via relativistic quantum mechanics on a fixed background based on the Klein--Gordon and the Dirac equations for a static spacetime with a scalar field producing a timelike naked singularity. We show that both the Klein--Gordon and the Dirac particles see this singularity. For comparison with previous method we study the Canonical Quantization via conditional symmetries. Subsequently we check the results by applying a maximal acceleration existence in the Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity described recently and obtain a resolution of singularity. In the process we study radial geodesics and their congruences in the spacetime.
