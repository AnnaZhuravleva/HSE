The black hole information paradox is related to the area of event horizon, and potentially to the volume and singularity behind it. One example is the complexity/volume duality conjectured by Stanford and Susskind. Accepting the proposal of Christodoulou and Rovelli, we calculate the maximal volume inside regular black holes, which are free of curvature singularity, in asymptotically flat and anti-de Sitter spacetimes respectively. The complexity/volume duality is then applied to anti-de Sitter regular black holes. We also present an analytical expression for the maximal volume outside the de Sitter horizon.
