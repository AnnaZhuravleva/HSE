The implications of an Evolutionary Quantum Gravity are addressed in view of formulating a new dark matter candidate. We consider a Schr\"odinger dynamics for the gravitational field associated to a generic cosmological model and then we solve the corresponding eigenvalues problem, inferring its phenomenological issue for the actual Universe. The spectrum of the super-Hamiltonian is determined including a free inflaton field, the ultrarelativistic thermal bath and a perfect gas into the dynamics. We show that, when a Planckian cut-off is imposed in the theory and the classical limit of the ground state is taken, then a dark matter contribution can not arise because its critical parameter $\Omega_{dm}$ is negligible today when the appropriate cosmological implementation of the model is provided. Thus, we show that, from a phenomenological point of view, an Evolutionary Quantum Cosmology overlaps the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and therefore it can be inferred as appropriate to describe early stages of the Universe without significant traces on the later evolution. Finally, we provide indications that the horizon paradox can be solved in the Planck era by the morphology of the Universe wave function.
