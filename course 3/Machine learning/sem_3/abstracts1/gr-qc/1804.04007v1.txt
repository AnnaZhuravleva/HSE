The Barboza-Alcaniz EoS parametrization has been considered and its $q$-parametrization has been investigated in search for a thermodynamic motivation. For this, we have studied the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics as well as the thermodynamic equilibrium considering the cosmological apparent horizon as the boundary. Also, an expression for the particle creation rate has been obtained in terms of $q$ assuming an adiabatic particle creation scenario and its behavior has been studied for consistency during various phases of evolution of the Universe as suggested by various thermodynamic arguments found in the literature.
