A set of novel derivative terms for spin-2 fields are proposed. They are the wedge products of curvature two-forms and vielbeins. In this work, we investigate the properties of novel two-derivative terms in the context of bi-gravity. Based on a minisuperspace analysis, we identify a large class of bi-gravity models where the Boulware-Deser ghost could be absent. We give a new perspective that Weyl Gravity and New Massive Gravity belong to this class of bi-gravity models involving novel derivative terms. In addition, we discuss the UV cut-off scales, dynamical symmetric conditions and novel higher-derivative terms.
