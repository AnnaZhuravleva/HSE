We extend the concept of accelerated horizons to the framework of deformed relativistic kinematics at the Planck scale. We show that the non-trivial effects due to symmetry deformation manifest in a finite blueshift for field modes as measured by a Rindler observer approaching the horizon. We investigate whether, at a field theoretic level, this effect could manifest in the possibility of a finite horizon contribution to the entropy, a sort of covariant brick-wall. In the specific model of symmetry deformation considered it will turn out that a non-diverging density of modes close to the horizon can be achieved only by introducing a momentum space measure which violates Lorentz invariance.
