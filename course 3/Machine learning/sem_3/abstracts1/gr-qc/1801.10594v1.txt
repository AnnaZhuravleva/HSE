We present model of an asisotropic fluid sphere under Einstein's general theory of relativity. For this we employ the Tolman-Kuchowicz~\cite{Tolman1939,Kuchowicz1968} metric which provides a class of singularity free solutions. The set of solutions satisfies all the physical requirements of the realistic stars and eventually indicates the possibility to describe compact objects. To make the model consistent with the compact stars, bounds on the model parameters have been obtained under two specific case studies which provide theoretical supports in favour of neutron stars as well as strange stars. Consequences of mathematical modeling of compact stars, through several physical parameters involving in the stars, have been analyzed.
