We study the conformal structure of exotic (non-big-bang) singularity universes using the hybrid big-bang/exotic singularity/big-bang and big-rip/exotic singularity/big-rip models by investigating their appropriate Penrose diagrams. We show that the diagrams have the standard structure for the big-bang and big-rip and that exotic singularities appear just as the constant time hypersurfaces for the time of a singularity and because of their geodesic completeness are potentially transversable.
