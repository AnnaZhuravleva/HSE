Building on earlier work, we discuss a general framework for exploring the cosmological dynamics of Higher Order Theories of Gravity. We show that once the theory of gravity has been specified, the cosmological equations can be written as a first-order autonomous system and we give several examples which illustrate the utility of our method. We also discuss a number of results which have appeared recently in the literature.
