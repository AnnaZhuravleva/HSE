The Eisenhart lift of a Paul Trap used to store ions in molecular physics is a linearly polarized periodic gravitational wave. A modified version of Dehmelt's Penning Trap is in turn related to circularly polarized periodic gravitational waves, sought for in inflationary models. Similar equations rule also the Lagrange points in Celestial Mechanics. The explanation is provided by anisotropic oscillators.
