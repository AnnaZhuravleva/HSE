By considering the generalized uncertainty principle, the degrees of freedom near the apparent horizon of Vaidya black hole are calculated with thin film model. The result shows that a cut-off can be introduced naturally rather than taking by hand. Furthermore, if the minimal length is chosen to be a specific value, the statistical entropy will satisfy the conventional area law at the horizon, which might reveal some deep things of the minimal length.
