We give an overview on the status and on the perspectives of Finsler gravity, beginning with a discussion of various motivations for considering a Finslerian modification of General Relativity. The subjects covered include Finslerian versions of Maxwell's equations, of the Klein-Gordon equation and of the Dirac equation, and several experimental tests of Finsler gravity.
