A scale-dependent cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the Newton constant G emerge naturally in quantum field theory in a curved space-time background leading to renormalization group running cosmologies. A scale-setting procedure is discussed in these cosmological models and the interpretation of the scale is emphasized. This setup introduces dark energy without invoking quintessence-like fields and can be applied to a variety of problems. The scale-dependent $\Lambda$ and G are also naturally incorporated into the generalized holographic dark energy model, and applied to different aspects of cosmology.
