In this short review, we discuss the approach of the commutator algebra of covariant derivative to analyse the gravitational theories, starting from the standard Einstein's general theory of relativity and focusing on the Rastall theory. After that, we discuss the important role of the torsion in this mathematical framework. In the Appendix of the paper we analyse the importance of the nascent gravitational wave astronomy as a tool to discriminate among the general theory of relativity and alternative theories of gravity.
