By neglecting the effects of self-force and radiation, we investigate the possibility of destroying the Kerr-MOG black hole through the point particle absorption process. Using the instability of the event horizon and the condition that Bekenstein-Hawking entropy never decreases, we get the upper and lower energy bounds allowed for a matter particle to produce the naked singularity. We find that the upper and lower energy bounds always coincide with each other for the extremal black hole case, which means that the extremal Kerr-MOG black hole cannot be overspun. While it is indeed possible for the near-extremal black hole to be destroyed, which leads to the violation of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. Furthermore, when considering the effect of the adiabatic process, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture will be restored.
