In this paper we add a compact dimension to Schwarzschild-(anti-) de sitter and Kerr-(anti-) de sitter spacetimes, which describes (rotating) black string-(anti-) de sitter spacetime. We study the geodesic motion of test particles and light rays in this spacetime. We present the analytical solutions of the geodesic equations in terms of Weierstrass elliptic and Kleinian sigma hyperelliptical functions. We also discuss the possible orbits and classify them according to particle's energy and angular momentum. Moreover, the obtained results, are compared to Schwarzschild-(anti-) de sitter and Kerr-(anti-) de sitter spacetimes.
