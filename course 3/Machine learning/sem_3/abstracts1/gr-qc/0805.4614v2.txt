As a compelling pattern for the holographic principle, our covariant entropy bound conjecture is proposed for more general dynamical horizons. Then we apply our conjecture to $\Lambda$CDM cosmological models, where we find it imposes a novel upper bound $10^{-90}$ on the cosmological constant for our own universe by taking into account the dominant entropy contribution from super-massive black holes, which thus provides an alternative macroscopic perspective to understand the longstanding cosmological constant problem. As an intriguing implication of this conjecture, we also discuss the possible profound relation between the present cosmological constant, the origin of mass, and the anthropic principle.
