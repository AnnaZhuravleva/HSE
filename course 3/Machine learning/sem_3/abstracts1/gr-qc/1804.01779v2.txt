This paper aims to explore a class of static stellar equilibrium configurations of charged spheres composed by a isotropic fluid and fixed the constraints with some known compact star candidates. The study is performed by considering a particularized metric potential, Buchdahl ansatz [H. A. Buchdahl Phys. Rev.116, 1027 (1959)] and then by a simple transformation. The study is developed by matching the interior region with Riessner- Nordstrom metric as an exterior solution. The matter content the charge sphere satisfies all the energy conditions and hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation for the charged case is maintained. In addition to this, we also discuss some important properties of the charged sphere such as total electric charge, mass- radius relation, surface redshift, and the speed of sound are analyzed. Obtained solutions are presented by graphical representation that provide strong evidences for more realistic and viable stellar model. Our results are compared with observational stellar mass data, namely, SAX J1808.4- 3658, 4U 1538-52, PSR J1903+327, Vela X-1 and 4U1608-52. These results are also quite important both from theoretical and astrophysical scale to analyze other compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, boson stars and quark stars.
