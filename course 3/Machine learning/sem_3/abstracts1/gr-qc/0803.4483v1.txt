To avoid instabilities in the continuum semi-classical limit of loop quantum cosmology models, refinement of the underlying lattice is necessary. The lattice refinement leads to new dynamical difference equations which, in general, do not have a uniform step-size, implying complications in their analysis and solutions. We propose a numerical method based on Taylor expansions, which can give us the necessary information to calculate the wave-function at any given lattice point. The method we propose can be applied in any lattice-refined model, while in addition the accuracy of the method can be estimated. Moreover, we confirm numerically the stability criterion which was earlier found following a von Neumann analysis. Finally, the `motion' of the wave-function due to the underlying discreteness of the space-time is investigated, for both a constant lattice, as well as lattice refinement models.
