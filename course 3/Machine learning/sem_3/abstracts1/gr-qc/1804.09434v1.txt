We obtain the deflection angle for a boosted Kerr black hole in the weak field approximation. We also study the behavior of light in the presence of plasma by considering different distributions: singular isothermal sphere, non-singular isothermal gas sphere, and plasma in a galaxy cluster. We find that the dragging of the inertial system along with the boosted parameter $\Lambda$ affect the value of the deflection angle. Nevertheless, we find no significant differences between different plasma models.
