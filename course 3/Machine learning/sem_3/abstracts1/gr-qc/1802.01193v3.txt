We use data from the GW170814 gravitational wave event detected by the three LIGO-VIRGO observatories to study the polarization properties of the gravitational waves. We find that within the LIGO-VIRGO 90% credible region of source sky locations, there is a range in which pure vector polarization is consistent with the observed amplitude ratios. Confirmation of a vector polarization component of gravitational waves would be a sign of post-general relativity physics.
