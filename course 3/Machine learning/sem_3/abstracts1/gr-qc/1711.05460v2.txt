We provide a simple derivation of the corrections for Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole entropy without knowing the details of quantum gravity. We will follow Bekenstein, Wheeler and Jaynes ideas, using summations techniques without calculus approximations, to directly find logarithmic corrections to well-known entropy formula for black holes. Our approach is free from pathological behaviour giving negative entropy for small values of black hole mass $M$. With the aid of Universality principle we will argue that this purely classical approach could open a window for exploring properties of quantum gravity.
