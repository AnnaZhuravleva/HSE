While it is possible to build causal sets that approximate spacetime manifolds, most causal sets are not at all manifold-like. We show that a Lorentzian path integral with the Einstein-Hilbert action has a phase in which one large class of non-manifold-like causal sets is strongly suppressed, and suggest a direction for generalization to other classes. While we cannot yet show our argument holds for all non-manifold-like sets, our results make it plausible that the path integral might lead to emergent manifold-like behavior with no need for further conditions.
