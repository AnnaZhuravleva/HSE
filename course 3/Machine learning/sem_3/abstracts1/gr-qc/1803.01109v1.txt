In this work, we have first obtained the hydrostatic equilibrium equation in dilaton gravity. Then we have examined some of the structural characteristics of strange quark star in dilaton gravity with a background of Einstein gravity. We have shown that the variations of dilaton parameter do not affect the maximum mass of quark star, while the variations of the cosmological constant lead to change in the structural characteristics of the quark star. We have investigated the stability of strange quark stars that studied by MIT Bag model, in dilaton gravity. We have also provided limiting values for the dilaton field parameter and the cosmological constant.We have also studied the effects of dilaton gravity on the other properties of quark star such as the mean density and gravitational redshift. We have concluded that the last reported value for cosmological constant does not affect on maximum mass of strange quark star.
