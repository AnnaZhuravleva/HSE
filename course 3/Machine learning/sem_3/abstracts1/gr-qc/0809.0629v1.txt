Non-axisymmetric oscillations of rapidly rotating relativistic stars are studied using the Cowling approximation. The oscillation spectra have been estimated by Fourier transforming the evolution equations describing the perturbations. This is the first study of its kind and provides information on the effect of fast rotation on the oscillation spectra while it offers the possibility in studying the complete problem by including spacetime perturbations. Our study includes both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations and provides limits for the onset of the secular bar mode rotational instability. We also present approximate formulae for the dependence of the oscillation spectrum from rotation. The results suggest that it is possible to extract the relativistic star's parameters from the observed gravitational wave spectrum.
