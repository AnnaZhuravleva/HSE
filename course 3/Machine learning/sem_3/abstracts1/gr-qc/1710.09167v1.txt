We present here the new INPOP lunar ephemeris, INPOP17a. This ephemeris is obtained through the numerical integration of the equations of motion and of rotation of the Moon, fitted over 48 years of Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data. We also include the 2 years of infrared (IR) LLR data acquired at the Grasse station between 2015 and 2017. Tests of the universality of free fall are performed. We find no violation of the principle of equivalence at the 10-14 level. A new interpretation in the frame of dilaton theories is also proposed.
