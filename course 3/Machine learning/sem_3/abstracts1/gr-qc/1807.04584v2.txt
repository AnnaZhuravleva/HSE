Ultracold fermionic atoms in an optical lattice, with a sudden quench in the effective dispersion relation, have been proposed as an analogue spacetime test of the Unruh effect. We provide support for this analogue by considering a $(1+1)$-dimensional continuum spacetime where a sudden quench joins a pre-quench Minkowski region to a static post-quench region in which right and left asymptotically Rindler domains are connected by a smooth negative curvature bridge. For a massless scalar field, prepared in the pre-quench Minkowski vacuum, the post-quench Wightman function is found in closed form. The quench is energetically mild, and late time static observers, modelled as a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt detector, see thermality, in a temperature that equals the Unruh temperature for observers in the asymptotic Rindler domains.
