Based on the studies of confinement of quarks, we introduce a linear scalar potential into the relativistic quantum dynamics of a scalar particle. Then, we analyse the linear confinement of a relativistic scalar particle in a G\"odel-type spacetime in the presence of a topological defect. We consider a G\"odel-type spacetime associated with null curvature, i.e., the Som-Raychaudhuri spacetime, which is characterized by the presence of vorticity in the spacetime. Then, we search for analytical solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation and analyse the influence of the topology of the cosmic string and the vorticity on the relativistic energy levels.
