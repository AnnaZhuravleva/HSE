A recent article [J. Steinhauer, Nat. Phys. 12, 959 (2016)] has reported the observation of quantum Hawking radiation and its entanglement in an analogue black hole. This paper analyses the published evidence, its consistency with theoretical bounds and the statistical significance of the results. The analysis raises severe doubts on the observation of Hawking radiation.
