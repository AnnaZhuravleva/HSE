Using systematically isothermal coordinates we show that there exist three different maximal extensions of the original Einstein-Rosen bridge. One of them, the hyperbolic Einstein-Rosen bridge, is completely free of singularities; with two dimensional sections diffeomorphic to the covering space of an hyperboloid of revolution. The bridge is generated by light-like geodesics, traversable by time like curves, but only in one direction. The collapse process that might produce this object is a promising open problem.
