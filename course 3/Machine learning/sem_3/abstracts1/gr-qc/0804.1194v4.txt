By considering the product of the usual four dimensional spacetime with two dimensional space of constant curvature, an interesting black hole solution has recently been found for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. It turns out that this as well as all others could easily be made to radiate Vaidya null dust. However there exists no Kerr analogue in this setting. To get the physical feel of the four dimensional black hole spacetimes, we study asymptotic behavior of stresses at the two ends, $r\to0$ and $r\to\infty$.
