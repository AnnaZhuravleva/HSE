According to the third law of Thermodynamics, it takes an infinite number of steps for any object, including black-holes, to reach zero temperature. For any physical system, the process of cooling to absolute zero corresponds to erasing information or generating pure states. In contrast with the ordinary matter, the black-hole temperature can be lowered only by adding matter-energy into it. However, it is impossible to remove the statistical fluctuations of the infalling matter-energy. The fluctuations lead to the fact the black-holes have a finite lower temperature and, hence, an upper bound on the horizon radius. We make an estimate of the upper bound for the horizon radius which is curiosly comparable to Hubble horizon. We compare this bound with known results and discuss its implications.
