In this paper, we consider AdS black hole in $d$-dimensional space-time and calculate the logarithmic corrected thermodynamics quantities. We find that, due to the thermal fluctuations, a logarithmic correction in entropy appears which corrects the thermodynamics of higher dimensional AdS black hole. We exploit such logarithmic corrected quantities to construct Van der Walls black holes solution and study the effects of logarithmic correction on the Van der Waals black holes. We also investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on the equation of state. We find that the Van der Waals black hole is completely stable in the presence of the logarithmic correction.
