In this paper we review the EiBI gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant and its tensor perturbations analysis. We show the existence of gravitational waves in the past-time, seeing as a result the smooth transition between high-energy densities (where the EBI dynamics plays its role) and low-energy densities (GR). We obtain the fluctuation spectrum for the graviton in this theory, where for small values of k the fluctuations are strongly suppressed and for large values of k these fluctuations vanish during the De Sitter expansion.
