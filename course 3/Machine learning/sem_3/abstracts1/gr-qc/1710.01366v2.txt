We derive the conditions whereby null rays `defocus' within Infinite Derivative Gravity for perturbations around an (A)dS background, and show that it is therefore possible to avoid singularities within this framework. This is in contrast to Einstein's theory of General Relativity. We further extend this to an (A)dS-Bianchi I background metric, and also give an example of a specific perturbation where defocusing is possible given certain conditions.
