In this paper we critically analyze the so far performed and proposed tests for measuring the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the Earth with some of the existing accurately tracked artificial satellites. The impact of the 2nd generation GRACE-only EIGEN-GRACE02S Earth gravity model and of the 1st CHAMP+GRACE+terrestrial gravity combined EIGEN-CG01C Earth gravity model is discussed. The role of the proposed LARES is discussed as well.
