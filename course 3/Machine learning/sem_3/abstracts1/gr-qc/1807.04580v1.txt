We investigate propagation of gravitational waves in the most general teleparallel gravity model with second order field equations around the Minkowski background. We argue that in this case the most general Lagrangian at the first order of perturbations is given by the linear combination of quadratic invariants and hence coincide with the well-known new general relativity model. We derive the linearized field equations and analyze them using the principal polynomial and the Newman-Penrose formalism. We demonstrate that all gravitational waves modes propagate at the speed of light and there are up to six possible polarizations. We show that two tensorial modes of general relativity are always present and the number of extra polarizations depends on the free parameters of the new general relativity model.
