Wormholes are a solution for General Relativity field equations which characterize a passage or a tunnel that connects two different regions of space-time and is filled by some sort of exotic matter, that does not satisfy the energy conditions. On the other hand, it is known that in extended theories of gravity, the extra degrees of freedom once provided may allow the energy conditions to be obeyed and, consequently, the matter content of the wormhole to be non-exotic. In this work, we obtain, as a novelty in the literature, solutions for charged wormholes in the $f(R,T)$ extended theory of gravity. We show that the presence of charge in these objects may be a possibility to respect some stability conditions for their metric. Also, remarkably, the energy conditions are respected in the present approach.
