In this work, we investigate the $n$-dimensional charged static black hole solutions in the Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. By taking the metric parameter $k$ to be 1, 0, and -1, we study the spherical, planar, and hyperbolic spacetimes respectively. Three choices of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda>0$, $\Lambda=0$ and $\Lambda<0$, are investigated, which correspond to asymptotically de Sitter, flat and anti-de Sitter spacetimes. The obtained results demonstrate the existence of the universal horizon which traps any particle with arbitrarily large velocity. We analyze the horizon and the surface gravity of 4- and 5-dimensional black holes, and the relations between the above quantities and the electrical charge. It is shown that when the aether coefficient $c_{13}$ or the charge $Q$ increases, the outer Killing horizon shrinks and approaches the universal horizon. Furthermore, the surface gravity decreases and approaches zero in the limit $c_{13}\rightarrow\infty$ or $Q\rightarrow Q_e$, where $Q_e$ is the extreme charge.
