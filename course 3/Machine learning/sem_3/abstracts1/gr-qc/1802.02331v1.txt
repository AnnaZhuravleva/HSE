The second-order post-Newtonian solution for the light propagation in the field of Kerr-Newman black hole is achieved via an iterative method. Based on this result, we further obtain the second-order post-Newtonian light deflection in Kerr-Newman spacetime, which is formulated in an united form for any arbitrarily incident directions. All results are exhibited in the coordinate system constituted by the initial light-direction vector, the impact vector, and their cross-product.
