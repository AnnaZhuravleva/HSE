We present an interacting model with a phenomenological interaction, $\bar{Q}$, between a cold dark matter (DM) fluid and a dark energy (DE) fluid, which takes a time-varying equation of state (EoS) parameter, $\mathrm{\omega_{DE}}$. Here, both $\bar{Q}$ and $\mathrm{\omega_{DE}}$ are modeled in terms of the Chebyschev polynomials. In a Newtonian gauge and on sub-horizon scales, a set of perturbed equations is obtained when the momentum transfer potential becomes null in the DM rest-frame. This leads to different cases of the interacting model. Then, via a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we constrain such cases by using a combined analysis of geometric and dynamical data. Our results show that in such cases the evolution curves of the structure growth of the matter deviate strongly from the standard model. In addition, we also found that the matter power spectrum is sensitive to $\bar{Q}$. In this way, the coupling modifies the matter scale and generates a slight variation of the turnover point to smaller scales. Likewise, the amplitude of the CMB temperature power spectrum is sensitive the values of $\bar{Q}$ and $\mathrm{\omega_{DE}}$ at low and high multipoles $\it l$, respectively. Here, $\bar{Q}$ can cross twice the line $\bar{Q}=0$ during its background evolution.
