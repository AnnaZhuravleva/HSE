If some energy conditions on the stress-energy tensor are violated, is possible construct regular black holes in General Relativity and in alternative theories of gravity. This type of solution has horizons but does not present singularities. The first regular black hole was presented by Bardeen and can be obtained from Einstein equations in the presence of an electromagnetic field. E. Ayon-Beato and A. Garcia reinterpreted the Bardeen metric as a magnetic solution of General Relativity coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. In this work show that the Bardeen model may also be interpreted as a solutions of Einstein equations in the presence of a electric source, whose electric field does not behaves as a Coulomb field. We analyzed the asymptotic forms of the Lagrangian for the electric case and also analyzed the energy conditions.
