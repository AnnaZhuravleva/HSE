Light carries energy, and therefore, it is the source of a gravitational field. The gravitational field of a beam of light in the short wavelength approximation has been studied by several authors. In this article, we consider light of finite wavelengths by describing a laser beam as a solution of Maxwell's equations and taking diffraction into account. Then, novel features of the gravitational field of a laser beam become apparent, such as frame-dragging due to its intrinsic angular momentum and the deflection of parallel co-propagating test beams that overlap with the source beam.
