Linear perturbations for one parameter family of stationary, closed Nambu-Goto strings winding around a flat torus in the five-dimensional Schwarzschild spacetime have been studied. It has been shown that this problem is solvable in the sense that frequency spectra and perturbation modes can be expressed only with arithmetic operations and radicals. It has been proven that the Nambu-Goto strings belonging to this family are always unstable, no matter how they are located at almost flat region distant from the event horizon.
