Asymmetric thin-shell wormholes from two traversable Morris-Thorne wormhole spacetimes, with identical shape but different redshift functions, are constructed. Energy density of the thin-shell wormhole derives its power from a Morris-Thorne wormhole which is already exotic. By choice, the weak energy condition for the thin-shell wormhole is satisfied. A linear barotropic equation of state is assumed to hold after the radial perturbations. The fate of our thin-shell wormhole, after the perturbation, is striking: the asymmetric thin-shell wormhole is destined either to collapse to the original Morris-Thorne wormhole or expand indefinitely along with the radius of the throat. In case it collapses to the original wormhole, the result is an asymmetric Morris-Thorne wormhole. Although this asymmetry does not reflect into the embedding diagram of the wormhole, passing across the throat, the wormhole adventurer feels a different redshift function.
