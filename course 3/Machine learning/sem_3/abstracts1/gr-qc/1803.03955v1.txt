Recently, it was shown that modified mimetic gravity, with a $f(\square\phi)$ term, results in a singularity-free model of gravity, for both cosmological and black hole spacetimes [1, 2]. In this work, we analyze this model further and show that, since the function $f$ was tuned to vanish rapidly for small values of the argument, the non-singular bounce relies heavily on a subtle branch changing mechanism for the multi-valued function $f$. Furthermore, this mechanism has interesting implications for the proposed link between this model and loop quantum cosmology.
