In this article we extend the test of Hamiltonian Renormalisation proposed in this series of articles to the D-dimensional case using a massive free scalar field. The concepts we introduce are explicitly computed for the D=2 case but transfer immediately to higher dimensions. In this article we define and verify a criterion that monitors, at finite resolution defined by a cubic lattice, whether the flow approaches a rotationally invariant fixed point.
