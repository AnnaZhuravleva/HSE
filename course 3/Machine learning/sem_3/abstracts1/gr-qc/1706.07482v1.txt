Most of the literature on general relativity over the last century assumes that the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is zero. However, by now independent observations have led to a consensus that the dynamics of the universe is best described by Einstein's equations with a small but positive $\Lambda$. Interestingly, this requires a drastic revision of conceptual frameworks commonly used in general relativity, \emph{no matter how small $\Lambda$ is.} We first explain why, and then summarize the current status of generalizations of these frameworks to include a positive $\Lambda$, focusing on gravitational waves.
