We consider the mass-radius bounds for spherically symmetric static compact objects in Massive Gravity theories free of ghosts. In this type of gravitational theories the graviton, the quantum of gravity, may have a small, but non-vanishing mass. We derive the hydrostatic equilibrium and mass continuity equations in Massive gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant and for a non-zero graviton mass. The case of the constant density stars is also investigated by numerically solving the equilibrium equations. The influence of the graviton mass on the global parameters (mass and radius) of these stellar configurations is also considered. The generalized Buchdahl relations, giving the upper and lower bounds of the mass-radius ratio are obtained, and discussed in detail. As an application of our results we obtain gravitational red shift bounds for compact stellar type objects in Massive Gravity, which may (at least in principle) be used for observationally testing Massive Gravity theory in an astrophysical context.
