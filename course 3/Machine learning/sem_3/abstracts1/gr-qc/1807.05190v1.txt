Interaction / collision of two concentric spherical thin-shells of linear fluid resulting in collapse has been considered recently. We show that addition of finely tuned electric charges on the shells apart from the cosmological constant serves to delay the collapse indefinitely, yielding an ever colliding system of two concentric fluid shells. Given the finely tuned charges this provides an example of a perpetual two-body motion in general relativity.
