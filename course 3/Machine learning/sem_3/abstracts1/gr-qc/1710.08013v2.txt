We construct a classification of dispersion relations for the electromagnetic waves non-minimally coupled to the space-time curvature, based on the analysis of the susceptibility tensor, which appears in the non-minimal Einstein-Maxwell theory. We classify solutions to the Fresnel equation for the model with a trace-free non-minimal susceptibility tensor according to the Petrov scheme. For all Petrov types we discuss specific features of the dispersion relations and plot the corresponding wave surfaces.
