Memory effects of gravitational waves from astronomical events or primordial universe might have the information of new physics. It is intriguing to observe that the memory effect exists in electrodynamics as a net momentum kick, while the memory effect in gravity appears as a net relatively displacement. In particular, Winicour has shown that the B-mode memory, which characterizes parity odd global distribution of memory, does not exist. We study the memory effect in axion electrodynamics and find that the B-mode memory effect can exist provided the existence of coherently oscillating axion background field. Moreover, we examine the detectability of the axion dark matter using this effect. We also argue the existence of the B-mode gravitational memory effect in the presence of the axion dark matter.
