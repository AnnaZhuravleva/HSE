We obtain static multi-polytropic wormhole solutions in the framework of GR gravity. The resulting metric is asymptotically Minkowskian, and locally that of a wormhole. We also examine gravitational lensing by the wormhole, and calculate the deflection angle for weak and strong field limits. We investigate microlensing in the weak field limit and obtain corresponding light curves for both galactic and extragalactic situations. We discuss the multi-polytropic equation of state for the energy-momentum tensor which supports this geometry and finally, we check for the satisfaction of the weak energy condition.
