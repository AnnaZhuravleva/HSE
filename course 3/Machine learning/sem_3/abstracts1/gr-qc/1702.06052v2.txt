A successful experiment combining emission and reception of gravitational waves (GWs) would constitute a premiere of gravity control. This paper revisits this question by proposing new designs and principles for electromagnetic (EM) generators and detectors of GWs. We introduce new improved generators based on the resonant amplification of GWs that occurs when EM standing waves couples to an external static magnetic field. The interplay between the EM polarizations, the orientation of the boosting magnetic field and the emitted GW polarizations is studied, as well as the gravitational radiation patterns of the different generators. We also propose a new GW detection principle, based on magnetic energy storage, that we apply to the reception of the GWs generated by our newly introduced devices. Estimations of the energy loss in the generators due to GW emission as well as of the variation of the energy stored in a distant magnetic field when a GW is passing through show that such GW emission-reception experiments are in principle feasible with present technology.
