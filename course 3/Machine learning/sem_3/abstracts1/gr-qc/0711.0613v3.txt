We present a Maple11+GRTensorII based symbolic calculator for instanton metrics using Newman-Penrose formalism. Gravitational instantons are exact solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations with Euclidean signature. The Newman-Penrose formalism, which supplies a toolbox for studying the exact solutions of Einstein's field equations, was adopted to the instanton case and our code translates it for the computational use.
