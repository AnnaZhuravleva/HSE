In this paper, we consider higher order corrections of the entropy, which coming from thermal fluctuations, and find their effect on the thermodynamics of higher dimensional charged black holes. Leading order thermal fluctuation is logarithmic term in the entropy while higher order correction is proportional to the inverse of original entropy. We calculate some thermodynamics quantities and obtain the effect of logarithmic and higher order corrections of entropy on them. Validity of the first law of thermodynamics investigated and Van der Waals equation of state of dual picture studied. We find that five-dimensional black hole behaves as Van der Waals, but higher dimensional case have not such behavior. We find that thermal fluctuations are important in stability of black hole hence affect unstable/stable black hole phase transition.
