Explicit tests are presented of the conjectured entropic origin of the gravitational force. The gravitational force on a test particle in the vicinity of the horizon of a large Schwarzschild black hole in arbitrary spacetime dimensions is obtained as entropic force. The same conclusion can be reached for the cases of a large electrically charged black hole and a large slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The generalization along the same lines to a test mass in the field of an arbitrary spherical star is also studied and found not to be possible. Our results thus reinforce the argument that the entropic gravity proposal cannot account for the gravitational force in generic situations.
