We revisit the scattering of quantum test particles on the conical $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime and find the scatteting amplitude as a function of the boundary conditions imposed at the appex of the cone. We show that the boundary condition is responsible for a purely analytical term in the scattering amplitude, in addition to those coming from purely topological effects. Since it is possible to have non-equivalent physical evolutions for the wave packet (each one corresponding to a different boundary condition), it seems crucial to have an observable quantity specifying which evolution has been prescribed.
