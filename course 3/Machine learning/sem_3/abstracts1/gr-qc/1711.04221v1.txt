In this work, we present a phase space analysis of a spatially flat Friedmann $-$Robertson$-$Walker (FRW) model in which the dark matter fluid is modeled as an imperfect fluid having bulk viscosity. The bulk viscosity is governed by the Maxwell$-$Cattaneo approach. The rest of the components of the model: radiation and dark energy are treated as perfect fluids. Imposing a complete cosmological dynamics and taking into account a recent constraint on the dark matter equation of state (EOS), we obtain bound on the bulk viscosity. The results point towards the possibility of describing not only the current speed up of the Universe but also the previous matter and radiation dominated eras.
