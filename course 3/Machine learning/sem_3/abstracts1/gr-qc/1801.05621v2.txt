We start investigating the extension of the Horizon Quantum Mechanics to the case of spheroidal sources. We first study the location of trapping surfaces in space-times resulting from an axial deformation of static isotropic systems, and show that the Misner-Sharp mass evaluated on the corresponding undeformed spherically symmetric space provides the correct gravitational radius to locate the horizon. We finally propose a way to determine the deformation parameter in the quantum theory.
