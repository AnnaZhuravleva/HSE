We investigate the strong gravitational lensing for black hole with scalar charge in massive gravity. We find that the scalar charge and the type of the black hole significantly affect the radius of the photon sphere, deflection angle, angular image position, angular image separation, relative magnifications and time delay in strong gravitational lensing. Our results can be reduced to that of the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes in some special cases.
