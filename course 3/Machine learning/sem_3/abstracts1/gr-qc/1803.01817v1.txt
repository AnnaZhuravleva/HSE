We studied the superradiance effect of a charge black hole immersed in an expanding Universe. We considered a test massive charged scalar field scattered off the horizon of the charge McVittie black hole. We carried out a detailed analysis of the electric energy extracted from the horizon of McVittie black hole in two different epochs of the expansion of the Universe, the dust dominated and radiation dominated epochs. We found that we have the superradiance effect in both epochs of the expansion of the Universe. Our study also provides evidence that we have extraction of energy from the horizon of the neutral McVittie black hole.
