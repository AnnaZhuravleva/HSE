According to Kerr/CFT correspondence, some aspects of extremal and non-extremal Kerr black holes could be explained by using a 2D CFT. This paper is devoted to show how Kerr/CFT correspondence can work for the slowly accelerating Kerr black holes, in both extremal and non-extremal cases. The equation of motion for low frequency scalar probes in the near region possesses the "hidden" conformal symmetry, similar to that of the non-accelerating version. Assuming a particular value of associated central charge, Cardy formula in 2D CFT can recover the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the black hole under consideration. Moreover, agreements in the scattering process between gravitational and 2D CFT dual suggest the existence of slowly accelerating Kerr/CFT duality.
