We present a noncommutative extension of Quantum Cosmology and study the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) cosmological model requiring that the two scale factors of the KS metric, the coordinates of the system, and their conjugate canonical momenta do not commute. Through the ADM formalism, we obtain the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation for the noncommutative system. The Seiberg-Witten map is used to transform the noncommutative equation into a commutative one, i.e. into an equation with commutative variables, which depend on the noncommutative parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. Numerical solutions are found both for the classical and the quantum formulations of the system. These solutions are used to characterize the dynamics and the state of the universe. From the classical solutions we obtain the behavior of quantities such as the volume expansion, the shear and the characteristic volume. However the analysis of these quantities does not lead to any restriction on the value of the noncommutative parameters, $\theta$ and $\eta$. On the other hand, for the quantum system, one can obtain, via the numerical solution of the WDW equation, the wave function of the universe both for commutative as well as for the noncommutative models. Interestingly, we find that the existence of suitable solutions of the WDW equation imposes bounds on the values of the noncommutative parameters. Moreover, the noncommutativity in the momenta leads to damping of the wave function implying that this noncommutativity can be of relevance for the selection of possible initial states of the early universe.
