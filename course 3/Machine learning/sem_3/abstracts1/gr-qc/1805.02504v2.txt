Though very popular, Bose-Einstein condensate models of dark matter have some difficulties. Here we propose the so-called $\mu$-Bose gas model ($\mu$-BGM) as a model of dark matter, able to treat weak points. Within $\mu$-BGM, the $\mu$-dependence of thermodynamics arises through the respective $\mu$-calculus (it generalizes usual differential calculus) and enters the partition function, total number of particles, internal energy, etc. We study thermodynamic geometry of the $\mu$-BGM and find singular behavior of (scalar) curvature, confirming Bose-like condensation. The critical temperature of condensation $T^{(\mu)}_c$ for $\mu\neq 0$ is higher than the boson $T_c$. We find other important virtues of $\mu$-thermodynamics versus usual bosons and conclude: the condensate of $\mu$-Bose gas can serve as (an effective) model of galactic-halos dark matter.
