Einstein's General theory of relativity is plagued by cosmological and blackhole type singularities Recently, it has been shown that infinite derivative, ghost free, gravity can yield non-singular cosmological and mini-blackhole solutions. In particular, the theory possesses a {\it mass-gap} determined by the scale of new physics. We will use this property to argue that it is possible to form a non-singular super-massive compact objects without having any event horizon in this class of theories.
