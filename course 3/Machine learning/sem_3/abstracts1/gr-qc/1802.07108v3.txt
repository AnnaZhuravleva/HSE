To understand the underlying degrees of freedom, near horizon symmetry analysis of a black has gain significant interest in the recent past. In this paper we generalized those analysis first by taking into account a generic null surface carrying $U(1)$ electromagnetic charge. With the appropriate boundary conditions near the surface under study, we identified the symmetry algebra among the subset of diffeomporphism and gauge generators which preserve the metric of the null surface and the form of the gauge field configuration. With the knowledge of those symmetries we further derived the algebra among the associated charges considering general Lanczos-Lovelock gravity theory and gauge theory. Importantly while computing the charges we not only considered general theory, but also used off-shell formalism which is believed to play crucial role in understanding quantum gravity. Both the non-extremal and extremal cases are addressed here.
