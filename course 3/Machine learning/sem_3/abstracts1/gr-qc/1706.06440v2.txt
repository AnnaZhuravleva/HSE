We show how the concurrent implementation of the exact solutions of the Einstein equations, of the equations of motion of the test particles, and of the relativistic estimate of the emission of gravitational waves from test particles, can establish a priori constraints on the possible phenomena occurring in Nature. Two examples of test particles starting at infinite distance or from finite distance in a circular orbit around a Kerr black hole are considered: the first leads to a well defined gravitational wave burst the second to a smooth merging into the black hole. This analysis is necessary for the study of the waveforms in merging binary systems.
