We solve, numerically, the massless spin-2 equations, written in terms of a gauge based on the properties of conformal geodesics, in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity using spectral methods in both space and time. This strategy allows us to compute the solutions to these equations up to the critical sets where null infinity intersects with spatial infinity. Moreover, we use the convergence rates of the numerical solutions to read-off their regularity properties.
