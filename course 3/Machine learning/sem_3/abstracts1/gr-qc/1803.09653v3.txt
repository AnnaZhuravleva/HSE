Considering as usual that the underlying geometry of our universe is well described by the spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker line element, we show that the background of holonomy corrected Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) is equivalent to a simple modified version of the mimetic gravity. We also analyze the scalar and tensor perturbations of this modified mimetic model from which we find that, at the level of scalar perturbations, the modified mimetic model exhibits similar properties to LQC in the so-called deformed algebra approach, while at the level of tensor perturbations the modified mimetic gravity is indistinguishable from General Relativity.
