We study the superradiance effect in a class of scalar-tensor Horndeski theory. We first study the dynamics of a massive charged scalar wave scattered off the horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole which except its canonical coupling to gravity it is also coupled kinetically to curvature. We find that a trapping potential is formed outside the horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, due to this coupling, and as the strength of the new coupling is increased, the scattered wave is superradiantly amplified, resulting to the instability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. We then considered the backreacting effect of the scalar field coupled to curvature interacting with the background metric and we study the superradiant effect and find the superradiance conditions of a massive charged wave scattered off the horizon of a Horndeski black hole.
