We study the effect of the magnetic field geometry on the oscillation spectra of strongly magnetized stars. The magnetic field distributions include both toroidal and poloidal contributions. We observe that the toroidal contribution does not influence significantly the torsional oscillations of the crust. Moreover, in the case that the core is a type I supercontactor and the magnetic fields are confined in the crust, the torsional oscillation spectrum is drastically affected by the presence of the strong magnetic fields. Comparison with results and estimations for the magnetic field strength, from observations, exclude the possibility that magnetars will have a magnetic field solely confined in the crust i.e. our results suggest that the magnetic field in whatever geometry has to permeate the whole star.
