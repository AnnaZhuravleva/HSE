In this work, a general class of wormhole geometries in conformal Weyl gravity is analyzed. A wide variety of exact solutions of asymptotically flat spacetimes is found, in which the stress energy tensor profile differs radically from its general relativistic counterpart. In particular, a class of geometries is constructed that satisfies the energy conditions in the throat neighborhood, which is in clear contrast to the general relativistic solutions.
