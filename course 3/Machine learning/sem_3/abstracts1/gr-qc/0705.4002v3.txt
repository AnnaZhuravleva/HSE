In the present work, we investigate the universe dominated by quintom or hessence energies in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). Interestingly enough, we find that there are some stable attractors in these two cases. In the case of quintom, all stable attractors have the feature of decelerated expansion. In the case of hessence, most of stable attractors have the feature of decelerated expansion while one stable attractor can have decelerated or accelerated expansion depend on the model parameter. In all cases, the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of all stable attractors are larger than -1 and there is no singularity in the finite future. These results are different from the dynamics of phantom in LQC, or the ones of phantom, quintom and hessence in classical Einstein gravity.
