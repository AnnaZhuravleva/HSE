As opposed to Wald's cosmic no-hair theorem in general relativity, it is shown that the Horndeski theory (and its generalization) admits anisotropic inflationary attractors if the Lagrangian depends cubically on the second derivatives of the scalar field. We dub such a solution as a self-anisotropizing inflationary universe because anisotropic inflation can occur without introducing any anisotropic matter fields such as a vector field. As a concrete example of self-anisotropization we present the dynamics of a Bianchi type-I universe in the Horndeski theory.
