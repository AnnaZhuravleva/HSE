In this paper, we will deform the usual energy-momentum dispersion relation of a photon gas at an intermediate scale between the Planck and electroweak scales. We will demonstrate that such a deformation can have non-trivial effects on the physics of dumb holes. So, motivated by the physics of dumb holes, we will first analyse the effect of such a deformation on thermodynamics. Then we observe that the velocity of sound also gets modified due to such a modification of the thermodynamics. This changes the position of the horizon of a dumb hole, and the analogous Hawking radiation from a dumb hole. Therefore, dumb holes can be used to measure the deformation of the usual energy-momentum dispersion relation.
