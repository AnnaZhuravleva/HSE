In this paper we study the behaviour of gravitational wave background (GWB) generated during inflation in the environment of the noncommutative field approach. From this approach we derive out one additive term, and then we find that the dispersion relation of the gravitational wave would be modified and the primordial gravitational wave would obtain an effective mass. Therefore it breaks lorentz symmetry in local. Moreover, this additive term would a little raise up the energy spectrum of GWB in low frequency and then greatly suppress the spectrum at even lower energy scale of which the wave length may be near the current horizon. Therefore, a sharp peak is formed on the energy spectrum in the range of low frequencies. This peak should be a key criterion to detect the possible existence of noncommutativity of space-time in the background of our universe and a critical test for breaking lorentz symmetry in local field theory. Adding all possible effects on the evolution of GWB, we give some new information of the tensor power spectrum and its energy spectrum which may be probed in the future cosmological observations.
