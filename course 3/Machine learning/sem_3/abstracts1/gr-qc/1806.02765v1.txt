The Yang-Mills theory associated with the restricted Lorentz group is considered as a candidate for a theory of gravity. This is a most natural idea because the principle of equivalence of gravitation and inertia allows one to introduce locally inertial coordinate systems with the gauge freedom of Lorentz transformations. Once the proper variables of the gauge theory are identified in terms of the metric, one can verify that, in the limit of weak gravitational self-interactions, all the classical predictions of general relativity are reproduced. For the resulting third-order field equations for the metric, the nature of the singularity associated with black holes changes. The quantum version of the proposed theory of gravity already exists in textbooks.
