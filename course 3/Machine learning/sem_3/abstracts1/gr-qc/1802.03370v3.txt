A cosmological extension of the Eisenhart-Duval metric is constructed by incorporating a cosmic scale factor and the energy-momentum tensor into the scheme. The dynamics of the spacetime is governed the Ermakov-Milne-Pinney equation. Killing isometries include spatial translations and rotations, Newton--Hooke boosts and translation in the null direction. Geodesic motion in Ermakov-Milne-Pinney cosmoi is analyzed. The derivation of the Ermakov-Lewis invariant, the Friedmann equations and the Dmitriev-Zel'dovich equations within the Eisenhart--Duval framework is presented.
