In this work, we consider the so-called $\Lambda(\alpha)$CDM cosmology with $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ while the fine-structure "constant" $\alpha$ is varying. In this scenario, the accelerated expansion of the universe is driven by the cosmological "constant" $\Lambda$ (equivalently the vacuum energy), and the varying $\alpha$ is driven by a subdominant scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the electromagnetic field. The observational constraints on the varying $\alpha$ and $\Lambda\propto\alpha^{-6}$ models with various couplings $B_F(\phi)$ between the subdominant scalar field $\phi$ and the electromagnetic field are considered.
