Due to gravitational lensing effect, a black hole casts a shadow larger than its horizon over a bright background and the shape and size can be calculated. We discuss rotating black holes surrounded by a perfect fluid, namely rotating Rastall black hole, which is characterized by mass $M$, spin $a$, field structure parameter $N_s$ and the Rastall parameter $\psi$. Based on a detailed discussion of the photon regions in these space-times, we derive an analytical formula for the shadow of a rotating Rastall black hole. We go on to visualize the shadow of black holes for various values of the parameters. For a given value of parameters, the presence of a positive Rastall parameter $\psi$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its deformation with respect to the one in the Kerr spacetime, while for a negative Rastall parameter $\psi$, the effect is opposite. Interestingly, for a given value of parameters $a$ and $N_s$, shadows of the black hole, deformed concentric circles with right border becoming significantly more oblate with increase in the parameter $\psi$ and similar effect is seen while increasing $N_s$ with a given $a$ and $\psi.$ Further, the deformed circles become larger in these both cases. The shadow of a black hole surrounded by a quintessence matter ($\psi=0$) is also included for a comparison. We use the absorption cross section to study the energy emission rate of the black hole in Rastall gravity.
