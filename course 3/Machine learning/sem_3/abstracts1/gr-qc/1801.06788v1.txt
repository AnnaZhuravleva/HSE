This paper purports to have: Introduced a new formulation of Quantum Mechanics, explained the apparent disconnect between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, explained the observed far field expansion of the Universe (Dark Energy), supplied an argument which goes towards explaining away Dark Matter (there are modelling difficulties) and not explained, on the basis of gravitational theory, the Voyager Anomaly.
