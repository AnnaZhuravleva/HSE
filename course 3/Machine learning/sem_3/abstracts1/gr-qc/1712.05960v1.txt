The equations of Hamiltonian gravity are often considered ugly cousins of the elegant and manifestly covariant versions found in the Lagrangian theory. However, both formulations are fundamental in their own rights because they make different statements about the nature of space-time and its symmetries. These implications, along with the history of their derivation and an introduction of recent mathematical support, are discussed here.
