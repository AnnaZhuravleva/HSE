Owing to the existence of an invariant length at the Planck scale, Einstein special relativity breaks down at that scale. A possible solution to this problem is arguably to replace the Poincar\'e-invariant Einstein special relativity by a de Sitter invariant special relativity. Such replacement produces concomitant changes in all relativistic theories, including general relativity, which changes to what we have called "de Sitter modified general relativity". In this paper, the Newtonian limit of this theory is used to study the circular velocity of stars around the galactic center. It is shown that the de Sitter modified Newtonian force---part of which becomes effective only in the Keplerian region of the galaxy---could possibly explain the flat rotation curve of galaxies without necessity of supposing the existence of dark matter.
