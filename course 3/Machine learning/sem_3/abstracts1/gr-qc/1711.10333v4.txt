The generic form of spacetime dynamics as a gauge theory has recently been derived, based on only the action principle and on the general principle of relativity. In the present paper, the spacetime coupling terms obtained for different classical fields are discussed. Our analysis shows that the metric (Hilbert) energy-momentum tensor of Einstein's theory is the appropriate source of gravitation for classical scalar representing structureless (spin zero) particles, and aggregations of them. Furthermore, the gauge formalism reveals that the metric energy-momentum tensor also constitutes the correct source of gravitation for coupled scalar-vector systems with U(1) symmetry. Also in this case, the vector fields do not generate a torsion of spacetime. For "standalone" systems of vector fields, however, the proper source term for the spacetime dynamics is shown to be given by the canonical energy-momentum tensor---which embraces also the energy density furnished by the internal spin. Then, the vector fields are shown to generate a torsion of spacetime. The respective sources of gravitation apply for all particular models employed to describe the dynamics of the "free" gravitational field---which do not follow from the gauge formalism but must be specified based on separate physical reasoning.
