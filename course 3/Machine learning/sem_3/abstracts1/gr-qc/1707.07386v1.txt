In this paper, we have considered flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric in the framework of perfect fluid models and modified $f(G)$ gravity (where $G$ is the Gauss Bonnet invariant). Particularly, we have considered particular realistic $f(G)$ configurations that could be used to cure finite-time future singularities arising in the late-time cosmic accelerating epochs. We have then developed the viability bounds of these models induced by weak and null energy conditions, by using the recent estimated numerical figures of the deceleration, Hubble, snap and jerk parameters.
