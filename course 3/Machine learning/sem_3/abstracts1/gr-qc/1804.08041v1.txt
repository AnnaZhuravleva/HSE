This paper is focused on apply the semi-classical approximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a noncommutative frame. We start our study with two traditional scenarios in literature: a) The Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology coupled with a scalar field and a positive cosmological constant and b) a Kantowski-Sachs (KS) Universe, introducing a deformation on the commutation relation for the minisuperspace variables (NCCM). In this vein, we find an explicit semiclassical expression in an adequate interval with the aid of asymptotically equal functions and the theory of \emph{Ultrafilters}, offering an suggestive alternative to sketch the solution for the dynamical system involved without the need to solve it numerically. Our results are promising to board the quantum cosmology with an alternative approach.
