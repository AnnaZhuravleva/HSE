Quite exotic relativistic objects known as wormholes are hypothetical candidates for central machine of active galactic nuclei as well as black holes. We find the magnitude of the perihelion precession and the deflection of light in gravitational field of a wormhole and compare them with those for a black hole. The impact parameter is taken to be much larger than the wormhole throat size. We show that the relative difference between results for a black hole and a wormhole may be significant and amount to tens of percent.
