In this work, we study the implications of nonlinearity in general relativistic spherically symmetric inviscid irrotational accretion flow in a stationary non-rotating spacetime. It has been found that the perturbation scheme leads to a differential equation of the form of general Li{\'e}nard's equation. We discuss the equilibrium conditions of this system and its implications for globally subsonic accretion flows in the spherically symmetric stationary background. It is found that the stable solution predicted by linear stability analysis may become unstable under inclusion of lowest order nonlinearity.
