Within this work, we propose a new generalised quintom dark energy model in the teleparallel alternative of general relativity theory, by considering a non-minimal coupling between the scalar fields of a quintom model with the scalar torsion component $T$ and the boundary term $B$. In the teleparallel alternative of general relativity theory, the boundary term represents the divergence of the torsion vector, $B=2\nabla_{\mu}T^{\mu}$, and is related to the Ricci scalar $R$ and the torsion scalar $T$, by the fundamental relation: $R=-T+B$. We have investigated the dynamical properties of the present quintom scenario in the teleparallel alternative of general relativity theory by performing a dynamical system analysis in the case of decomposable exponential potentials. The study analysed the structure of the phase space, revealing the fundamental dynamical effects of the scalar torsion and boundary couplings in the case of a more general quintom scenario. Additionally, a numerical approach to the model is presented to analyse the cosmological evolution of the system.
