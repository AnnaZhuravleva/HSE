In order to be traversable, the static Lorentzian wormhole must be made out of some exotic matter that violates the weak energy condition. The quantized fields are the natural candidates as their stress-energy tensor, in many cases, possesses desired properties. In this paper we construct and examine the stress-energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in six static wormhole spacetimes. We find that in all considered cases the quantum fields violate the Morris-Thorne conditions and do not have the form necessary to support the wormhole throat. This is in concord with the previous results and indicates that the massive quantum fields make the wormholes less operable.
