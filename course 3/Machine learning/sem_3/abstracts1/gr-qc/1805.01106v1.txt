We study small perturbations of the $1+3$-dimensional Milne model for the Einstein-Klein-Gordon (EKG) system. We prove the nonlinear future stability, and show that the perturbed spacetimes are future causally geodesically complete. For the proof, we work within the constant mean curvature (CMC) gauge and focus on the $1+3$ splitting of Bianchi-Klein-Gordon (BKG) equations. Moreover, we treat the BKG equations as evolution equations and establish a partial energy scheme in the sense that we only commute the BKG equations with spatially covariant derivatives while scaling (or normal derivative) is not allowed.
