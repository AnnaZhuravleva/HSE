When the universe was about 10 $\mu $seconds old, a first order cosmological quark - hadron phase transition occurred at a critical temperature of around 200 MeV. In this work, we study the quark-hadron phase transition in the context of brane-world cosmologies, in which our Universe is a three-brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk, and within an effective model of QCD. We analyze the evolution of the physical quantities, relevant for the physical description of the early universe, namely, the energy density, temperature and scale factor, before, during, and after the phase transition. To study the cosmological dynamics and evolution we use both analytical and numerical methods. In particular, due to the high energy density in the early Universe, we consider in detail the specific brane world model case of neglecting the terms linearly proportional to the energy density with respect to the quadratic terms. A small brane tension and a high value of the dark radiation term tend to decrease the effective temperature of the quark-gluon plasma and of the hadronic fluid, respectively, and to significantly accelerate the transition to a pure hadronic phase. By assuming that the phase transition may be described by an effective nucleation theory, we also consider the case where the Universe evolved through a mixed phase with a small initial supercooling and monotonically growing hadronic bubbles.
