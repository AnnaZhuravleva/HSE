Quantum-mechanical motion of a half-spin particle was examined in the axially symmetric field of static naked singularities formed by mass distribution with quadrupole moment (q-metric). The analysis was performed by means of the method of effective potentials of the Dirac equation generalized for the case when radial and angular variables are not separated. As $-1<q<q_{lim}, |q_{lim}|<<1 $ the naked singularities do not except the existence of stationary bound states of Dirac particles for a prolate mass distribution in the q-metric along the axial axis. For the oblate mass distribution, the naked singularities of the q-metric are separated from the Dirac particle by infinitely large repulsive barriers with the subsequent potential well deepening while moving along the angle from the equator (or from $\theta=\theta_{min}, \theta=\pi-\theta_{min}$) towards poles. The exception are the poles and, as $0<q<q*$, some points $\theta_{i}$ for the states of the particle with j>=3/2.
