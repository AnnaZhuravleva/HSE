The BMS symmetry and related near horizon symmetry play important role in holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. They may also be crucial for the solution of information paradox. We still don't fully understand those infinite-dimensional symmetry. On the other hand, $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetry is the quantum version of area-preserving diffeomorphism of the plane. It can be used to classify the quantum Hall effect universality classes. In this paper, we will show that the form symmetries can be obtained form the $W_{1+\infty}$ symmetry. With the help of $W_{1+\infty}$, the black holes in three dimensional spacerime can be classified just like the quantum hall effect. This gives another evidence to support our claim that "black hole as topological insulator".
