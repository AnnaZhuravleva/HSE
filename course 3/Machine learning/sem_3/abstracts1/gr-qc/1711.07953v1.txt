Momentum can be regarded as a mass current that can be used as the source of the gravitoelectromagnetic field, which is the weak-field gravitational analogue of the classical electromagnetic field. Typically, gravitoelectromagnetic research considers only mass currents of convective type, which are collinear with the velocity vector field, but when one looks at charged fluids that interact with a background electromagnetic field or charged, spinning point-like matter, such as the Frenkel electron, or extended spinning mass distributions, such as the Dirac electron and the Weyssenhoff fluid, one will also encounter transverse momentum. The effects of that transverse momentum on the gravitoelectromagnetic field are investigated.
