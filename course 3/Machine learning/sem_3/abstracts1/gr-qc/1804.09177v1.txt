A way to encode acceleration directly into fields has recently being proposed, thus establishing a new kind of fields, the accelerated fields. The definition of accelerated fields points to the quantization of space and time, analogously to the way quantities like energy and momentum are quantized in usual quantum field theories. Unruh effect has been studied in connection with quantum field theory in curved spacetime and it is described by recruiting a uniformly accelerated observer. In this work, as a first attempt to demonstrate the utility of accelerated fields, we present an alternative way to derive Unruh effect. We show, by studying quantum field theory on quantum spacetime, that Unruh effect can be obtained without changing the reference frame. Thus, in the framework of accelerated fields, the observational confirmation of Unruh effect could be assigned to the existence of quantum properties of spacetime.
