In this paper, we show that the global monopole spacetime is one of the exact solutions of Einstein equations by means of the method treating the matter field as a non-linear sigma model, without the weak field approximation applied in the original derivation by Barriola and Vilenkin in 1989. Furthermore, we find the physical origin of the topological charge in the global monopole spacetime. Finally, we generalize the proposal which generates spacetime from thermodynamical laws to the case that spacetime with global monopole charge.
