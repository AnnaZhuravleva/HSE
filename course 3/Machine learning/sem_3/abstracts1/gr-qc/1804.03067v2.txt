We construct a family of models with negative gravitational mass in the context of Newtonian gravity. We focus in particular on a model that reproduces the features of the so-called Dirac-Milne universe, a matter-antimatter symmetric universe that was recently proposed as an alternative cosmological scenario [A. Benoit-Levy and G. Chardin, A&A 537, A78 (2012)]. We perform one-dimensional N-body simulations of these negative-mass models for an expanding universe and study the associated formation of gravitational structures. The similarities and differences with the standard cosmological model are highlighted and discussed.
