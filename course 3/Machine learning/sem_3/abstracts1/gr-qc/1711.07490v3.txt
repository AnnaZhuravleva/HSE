Stealth field configurations by definition have a vanishing energy-momentum tensor, thus do not contribute to the gravitational field equations. While only trivial fields can be stealth in Maxwell's electrodynamics, nontrivial stealth fields appear in some nonlinear models of electromagnetism. We find the necessary and sufficient conditions for the electromagnetic fields to be stealth and analyse which models admit such configurations. Furthermore, we present some concrete exact solutions, featuring a class of black holes dressed with the stealth electromagnetic hair, closely related to force-free solutions. Stealth hair does not alter the generalized Smarr formula, but may contribute to the Komar charges.
