Exciting peculiarities of Planck-scale physics have immediate effects on the Bekenstein-Hawking radiation emitted from black holes (BHs). In this paper, using the tunneling formalism, we determine the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature for the vector particles from a backreacted black hole (BBH) constructed from a conformal scalar field surrounded by a BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) BH. Then, under the effect of the generalized uncertainty principle, we extend our calculations for scalar particles to understand the effects of quantum gravity. Then, we calculate an evaporation time for the BBH, the total number of Bekenstein-Hawking particles, and the quantum corrections of the number. We observe that remnants of the BH evaporation occur and that they affect the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature of the BBH as well as the total number of Bekenstein-Hawking particles.
