We study the gravitational field of static p-branes in D-dimensional Minkowski space in the framework of linearized ghost-free (GF) gravity. The concrete models of GF gravity we consider are parametrized by the non-local form factors $\exp(-\Box/\mu^2)$ and $\exp(\Box^2/\mu^4)$, where $\mu^{-1}$ is the scale of non-locality. We show that the singular behavior of the gravitational field of p-branes in General Relativity is cured by short-range modifications introduced by the non-localities, and we derive exact expressions of the regularized gravitational fields, whose geometry can be written as a warped metric. For large distances compared to the scale of non-locality, $\mu r\rightarrow\infty$, our solutions approach those found in linearized General Relativity.
