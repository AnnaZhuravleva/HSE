We study the quasinormal modes for scalar, axial and radial perturbations of massive static spherically symmetric wormholes supported by a phantom scalar field, calculating the modes directly and employing the WKB approximation. The spectrum of the quasinormal modes is compared with the spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes. For fixed multipole number $l$ and large mass $M$ the wormhole modes approach their black hole counterparts as $1/M$.
