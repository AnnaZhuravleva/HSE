In this paper we study the thermodynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS black holes minimally coupled to a cloud of strings in an extended phase space where the cosmological constant is treated as pressure of the black holes and its conjugate variable is the thermodynamical volume of the black holes. To investigate the analogy between Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings and liquid-gas system we derive the analytical solutions of the critical points and probe the effects of a cloud of strings on $P-V$ criticality. The effects of a cloud of strings on the critical phenomena of the black hole are studied in detail. It is shown that the resemblance of "small black hole/large black hole" (SBH/LBH) phase transition with the liquid-gas phase transition. Also It is shown that in the absence of the Gauss-Bonnet term (or the Schwarzschild black hole), the impact of a cloud of strings can bring Van der Waals-like behavior. In the other words, in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole with $\alpha \to 0$ and when it is surrounded by a cloud of strings the Hawking-Page phase transition would be disappeared and "small black hole/large black hole" phase transition recovers.
