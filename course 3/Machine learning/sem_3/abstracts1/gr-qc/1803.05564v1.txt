Gravitational radiation plays an important role in astrophysics. Based on the fact that our universe is expanding, the gravitational radiation when a positive cosmological constant is presented has been studied along with two different ways recently, one is the Bondi-Sachs (BS) framework in which the result is shown by BS quantities in the asymptotic null structure, the other is the perturbation approach in which the result is presented by the quadrupoles of source. Therefore, it is worth to interpret the quantities in asymptotic null structure in terms of the information of the source. In this paper, we investigate this problem and find the explicit expressions of BS quantities in terms of the quadrupoles of source in asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. We also estimate how far away the source is, the cosmological constant may affect the detection of the gravitational wave.
