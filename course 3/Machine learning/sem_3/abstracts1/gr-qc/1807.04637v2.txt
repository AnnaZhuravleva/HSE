Using the Tsallis generalized entropy, holographic hypothesis and also considering the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff, we build a holographic model for dark energy and study its cosmological consequences in the Brans-Dicke framework. We only focus on flat FRW universe, and the results of taking a sing-changeable interaction between the cosmos sectors are also addressed. Our study shows that, even in the absence of an interaction between the dark sectors of cosmos, the Tsallis holographic dark energy model with the Hubble radius as IR cutoff can explain the present accelerated phase of the universe expansion in the Brans-Dicke theory. Also, it has been found that the obtained models can provide stable descriptions for the universe history, and thus, the current accelerated universe.
