We extend the analysis of the Hamiltonian formalism of the d-dimensional tetrad-connection gravity to the fermionic field by fixing the non-dynamic part of the spatial connection to zero. Although the reduced phase space is equipped with complicated Dirac brackets, the first-class constraints which generate the diffeomorphisms and the Lorentz transformations satisfy a closed algebra with structural constants analogous to that of the pure gravity. We also show the existence of a canonical transformation leading to a new reduced phase space equipped with Dirac brackets having a canonical form leading to the same algebra of the first-class constraints.
