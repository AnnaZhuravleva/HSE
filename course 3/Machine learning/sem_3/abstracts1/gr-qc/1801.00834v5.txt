General Relativity is known to produce singularities in the potential generated by a point source. Our universe can be modelled as a de Sitter (dS) metric and we show that ghost-free Infinite Derivative Gravity (IDG) produces a non-singular potential around a dS background, while returning to the GR prediction at large distances. We also show that although there are an apparently infinite number of coefficients in the theory, only a finite number actually affect the predictions.   By writing the linearised equations of motion in a simplified form, we find that at distances below the Hubble length scale, the difference between the IDG potential around a flat background and around a de Sitter background is negligible.
