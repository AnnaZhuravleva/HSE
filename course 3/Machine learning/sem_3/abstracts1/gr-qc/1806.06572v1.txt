The ongoing improvements of the advanced gravitational wave (GW) detectors are setting challenging requirements on instrument calibration. We report tests of a calibration technique, based on the well-known gravitation force, which has been applied for the first time on a large interferometer. The results obtained with Advanced Virgo are in good agreement with the predictions and with the usual calibration method. This technique is expected to lead to accurate absolute calibration at the sub-percent level in the coming years, matching the needs of the blooming GW science.
