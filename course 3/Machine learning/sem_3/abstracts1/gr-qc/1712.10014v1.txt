It is shown that the cosmological constant links the roots both of General Relativity and Newtonian gravity via the general function satisfying the Newton's theorem that the gravitating sphere acts as a point mass situated in its center. The quantitative evidence for this link is given via the correspondence of the current value of the cosmological constant with the value of the cosmological term in the modified Newtonian gravity to explain the dark matter in the galaxies. This approach reveals: (a) the nature of the dark matter as gravity's signature, (b) the common nature of the dark matter and of the cosmological constant (dark energy), (c) the dark matter as repulsive gravity and increasing with the squared distance ensures the observed higher mass-to-luminosity M/L ratio while moving from the scales of galaxies to galaxy clusters. The galactic halos via non-force-free interaction of the repulsive dark matter determine the galactic disks and the flat rotation curves. Among the consequences of such modified General Relativity is the natural link to AdS/CFT correspondence.
