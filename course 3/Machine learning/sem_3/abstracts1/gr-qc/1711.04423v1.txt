General relativity characterizes gravity as a geometric property exhibited on spacetime by massive objects while teleparallel gravity achieves the same results, at the level of equations, by taking a torsional perspective of gravity. Similar to f (R) theory, teleparallel gravity can also be generalized to f (T ), with the resulting field equations being inherently distinct from f (R) gravity in that they are second order, while in the former case they turn out to be fourth order. In the present case, a minimally coupled scalar field is investigated in the f (T ) gravity context for several forms of the scalar field potential. A number of new f (T ) solutions are found for these potentials, with their respective state parameters also being examined.
