Using non-extensive statistical mechanics, the Bekenstein-Hawking area law is obtained from microstates of black holes in loop quantum gravity, for arbitrary real positive values of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter$(\gamma)$. The arbitrariness of $\gamma$ is encoded in the strength of the "bias" created in the horizon microstates through the coupling with the quantum geometric fields exterior to the horizon. An experimental determination of $\gamma$ will fix this coupling, leaving out the macroscopic area of the black hole to be the only free quantity of the theory.
