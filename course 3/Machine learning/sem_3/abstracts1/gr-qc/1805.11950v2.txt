Electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle plunging from slightly below the innermost stable circular orbit into a Schwarzschild black hole is examined. Both even- and odd-parity electromagnetic perturbations are considered. They are described by using gauge invariant master functions and the regularized multipolar waveforms as well as their unregularized counterparts constructed from the quasinormal-mode spectrum are obtained for arbitrary directions of observation and, in particular, outside the orbital plane of the plunging particle. They are in excellent agreement and the results especially emphasize the impact of higher harmonics on the distortion of the waveforms.
