We consider a Kaluza-Klein vacuum solution which is closely related to the Gross-Perry-Sorkin (GPS) magnetic monopole. The solution can be obtained from the Euclidean Taub-NUT solution with an extra compact fifth spatial dimension within the formalism of Kaluza-Klein reduction. We study its physical properties as appearing in $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions, which turns out to be a static magnetic monopole. We then boost the GPS magnetic monopole along the extra dimension, and perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction. The resulting four-dimensional spacetime is a rotating stationary system, with both electric and magnetic fields. In fact, after the boost the magnetic monopole turns into a string connected to a dyon.
