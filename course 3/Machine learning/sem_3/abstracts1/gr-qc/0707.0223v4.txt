In this article, we develop a formalism which is different from the standard lensing scenario and is necessary for understanding lensing by gravitational fields which arise as solutions of the effective Einstein equations on the brane. We obtain general expressions for measurable quantities such as time delay, deflection angle, Einstein ring and magnification. Subsequently, we estimate the deviations (relative to the standard lensing scenario) in the abovementioned quantities by considering the line elements for clusters and spiral galaxies obtained by solving the effective Einstein equations on the brane. Our analysis reveals that gravitational lensing can be a useful tool for testing braneworld gravity as well as the existence of extra dimensions.
