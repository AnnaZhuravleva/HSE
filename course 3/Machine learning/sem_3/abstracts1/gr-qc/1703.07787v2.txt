We study general properties of static and spherically symmetric bidiagonal black holes in Hassan-Rosen bimetric theory. In particular, we explore the behaviour of the black hole solutions both at the common Killing horizon and at the large radii. The former study leads to a new classification for black holes within the bidiagonal ansatz. The latter study shows that, among the great variety of the black hole solutions, the only solutions converging to Minkowski, Anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes at large radii are those of General Relativity, i.e., the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter and Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions.
