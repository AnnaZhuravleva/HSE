In this paper I examine cosmological models that contain a stochastic background of nonlinear electromagnetic radiation. I show that for Born-Infeld electrodynamics the equation of state parameter, $w=P/\rho$, remains close to 1/3 throughout the evolution of the universe if $E^2=B^2$ in the late universe to a high degree of accuracy.   Theories with electromagnetic Lagrangians of the form $L=-{1/4}F^2+\alpha F^4$ have recently been studied in magnetic universes, where the electric field vanishes. It was shown that the $F^4$ term can produce a bounce in the early universe, avoiding an initial singularity. Here I show that the inclusion of an electric field, with $E^2\simeq B^2$ in the late universe, eliminates the bounce and the universe "begins" in an initial singularity.   I also examine theories with Lagrangians of the form $L=-{1/4}F^2-\mu^8/F^2$, which have been shown to produce a period of late time accelerated expansion in magnetic universes. I show that, if an electric field is introduced, the accelerated phase will only occur if $E^2<3B^2$.
