We investigate intermediate inflation in the framework of Galileon scalar field. To this aim, we first obtain the inflationary observables including the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the scalar spectral index as well as the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter. Then, we examine the observational viability of the intermediate inflation within the framework of Galileon scenario. Our results show that although the prediction of intermediate inflation in the standard framework is completely ruled out by the Planck 2015 observations, it can be lied inside the allowed regions of the Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data in the Galileon setting. Moreover, we determine the parameter space of the Galileon intermediate inflation for which the model is consistent with the Planck 2015 data. Besides, we derive the consistency relation in the Galileon scenario and find that it differs from the standard inflation. Finally, we estimate the running of the scalar spectral index and the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter which are in well agreement with the Planck 2015 results.
