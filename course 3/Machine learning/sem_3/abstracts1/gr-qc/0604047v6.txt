It is seen that issues of unitarity raised by the evolution of the wave function in curved spacetime can be resolved by describing the evolution of quantum states in Minkowski tangent space. The treatment adheres closely to the orthodox interpretation that the wave function is not physical but is part of a mathematical method for the calculation of probabilities of measurement results. Minkowski tangent space refers to a non-physical configuration space used to describe quantum mechanics. The teleconnection is defined between Hilbert spaces at different points in spacetime motivated by arguments from the probability interpretation. The teleconnection is analogous to a connection between vector spaces and reduces to the Levi-Civita connection in the limit of near initial and final measurements. Predictions for quantum theory in curved spacetime agree with those of classical general relativity.
