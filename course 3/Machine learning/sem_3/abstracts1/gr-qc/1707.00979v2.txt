In this paper, we have studied homogeneous and anisotropic, locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I universe model with magnetized strange quark matter (MSQM) distribution and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in $f(R,T)$ gravity. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained under bilinear and special form of time varying deceleration parameter (DP). Firstly we have considered two specific form of bilinear DP with a single parameter of the form: $q=\frac{\alpha(1-t)}{1+t}$ and $q=-\frac{\alpha t}{1+t}$, which leads to a function with constant or linear nature with respect to the choice of constant $\alpha$. Second one is the special form of the DP as $q=-1+\frac{\beta}{1+a^{\beta}}$. From obtained results, we could say that in the early universe the magnetic flux has more effects and it gradually reducing its effects in later. For $t\rightarrow \infty$, we get $p\rightarrow -B_c$ and $\rho\rightarrow B_c$. So the strange quark matter along with magnetic epoch gives an idea of accelerated expansion of the universe as per the observations of the type Ia Supernovae.
