In the present work, rotation of the polarization vector of an electromagnetic wave is extensively calculated for a rotating observer, who can also be considered as a non-inertial accelerated observer. The rotation of the polarization vector calculated here is only due to the effect of the non-inertial frame, considering that the light source is at a distance and it is emitting a plane polarized light. Earth has been taken as an example of rotating frame and the amount of rotation of polarization vector is calculated where it is found that the amount of rotation of polarization vector depends on the azimuthal as well as a polar co-ordinate of the rotating frame. Present work also discusses the redshift caused by any rotating frame and the value of the redshift is calculated taking earth as an example of a rotating frame. The possibilities of experimentally verifying the predictions of present work are also discussed.
