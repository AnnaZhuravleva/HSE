This paper revisits the controversy concerning whether gravitational lensing effects make a significant difference to estimation of distance to the Cosmic Microwave Background last scattering surface in cosmology. A recent paper by Kaiser and Peacock supports a previous paper by Weinberg stating that such affects average to zero because of energy conservation. In this note, problems are pointed out in the Kaiser and Peacock analysis related to their choice of endpoint of integration, and to the `wrinkly surface' argument.
