We obtain the general vacuum metric solution to a cylindrical translating source. We show that its metric is geometrically related to the vacuum field produced by a stationary cylindrical source. However, this result is not trivial, as for instance, in the stationary rotating case the source can be rigidly rotating, while in the translating case the source has to be necessarily non rigidly translating.
