Probabilistic Spacetime is a simple generalization of the classical model of spacetime in General Relativity, such that it allows to consider multiple metric field realizations endowed with probabilities. The motivation for such a generalization is a possible application in the context of some quantum gravity approaches, particularly those using the path integral. It is argued that this model might be used to describe simplified geometry, resulting e.g. from discretization, while keeping the continuous manifold; or it may be used as an effective description of a probabilistic geometry resulting from a full-fledged quantum gravity computation.
