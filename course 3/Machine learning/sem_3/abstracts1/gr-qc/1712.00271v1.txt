We introduce a dark energy-modified minimum length uncertainty relation (DE-MLUR) or dark energy uncertainty principle (DE-UP) for short. The new relation is structurally similar to the MLUR introduced by K{\' a}rolyh{\' a}zy (1968), and reproduced by Ng and van Dam (1994) using alternative arguments, but with a number of important differences. These include a dependence on the de Sitter horizon, which may be expressed in terms of the cosmological constant as $l_{\rm dS} \sim 1/\sqrt{\Lambda}$. Applying the DE-UP to both charged and neutral particles, we obtain estimates of two limiting mass scales, expressed in terms of the fundamental constants $\left\{G,c,\hbar,\Lambda, e\right\}$. Evaluated numerically, the charged particle limit corresponds to the order of magnitude value of the electron mass ($m_e$), while the neutral particle limit is consistent with current experimental bounds on the mass of the electron neutrino ($m_{\nu_e}$). Possible cosmological consequences of the DE-UP are briefly discussed and we note that these lead naturally to a holographic relation between the bulk and the boundary of the Universe, which strongly implies {\it time-variation} of the ratio $e^2/m_e$. Low and high energy regimes in which dark energy effects may dominate canonical quantum behaviour at the present epoch are identified and the possibility of testing the model using table-top measurements of partial decoherence is briefly discussed.
