The existence of a minimal length, predicted by different theories of quantum gravity, can be phenomenologically described in terms of a generalized uncertainty principle. We consider the impact of this quantum gravity motivated effect onto the information budget of a black hole and the sparsity of Hawking radiation during the black hole evaporation process. We show that the information is not transmitted at the same rate during the final stages of the evaporation and that the Hawking radiation is not sparse anymore when the black hole approaches the Planck mass.
