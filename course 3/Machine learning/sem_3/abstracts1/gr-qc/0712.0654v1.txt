This paper is devoted to investigate the cold plasma wave properties outside the event horizon of the Schwarzschild planar analogue. The dispersion relations are obtained from the corresponding Fourier analyzed equations for non-rotating and rotating, non-magnetized and magnetized backgrounds. These dispersion relations provide complex wave numbers. The wave numbers are shown in graphs to discuss the nature and behavior of waves and the properties of plasma lying in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild event horizon.
