We provide an algorithm to estimate the divergence degree of the Lorentzian EPRL-FK spin foam amplitudes for arbitrary 2-complexes. We focus on the "self-energy" and "vertex renormalization" diagrams and find an upper bound estimate. We argue that our upper bound must be close to the actual value, and explain what numerical improvements are needed to verify this numerically. For the self-energy, this turns out to be significantly more divergent than the lower bound estimate present in the literature. We support the validity of our algorithm using 3-stranded versions of the amplitudes (corresponding to a toy 3d model) for which our estimates are confirmed numerically. We also apply our methods to the simplified EPRLs model, finding a completely convergent behavior, and to BF theory, independently recovering the divergent estimates present in the literature.
