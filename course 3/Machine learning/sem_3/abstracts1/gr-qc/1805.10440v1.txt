It is widely believed that as one of the candidates for dark energy, the cosmological constant should relate directly with the quantum vacuum. Despite decades of theoretical effects, however, there is still no quantitative interpretation of the observed cosmological constant. In this work, we consider the quantum state of the whole universe including the quantum vacuum. Everett's relative-state formulation, vacuum quantum fluctuations and the validity of Einstein's field equation at macroscopic scales imply that our universe wave function might be a superposition of states with different cosmological constants. In the density matrix formulation of this quantum universe, the quasi-thermal equilibrium state is described by a specific cosmological constant with the maximum probability. Without any fitting parameter, the ratio between the vacuum energy density due to the cosmological constant (dark energy) and the critical density of the universe is 68.85% based on simple equations in our theoretic model, which agrees very well with the best current astronomical observations of 68.5%.
