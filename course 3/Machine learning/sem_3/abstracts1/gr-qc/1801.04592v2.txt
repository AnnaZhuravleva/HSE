We study the shadows of disformal black holes in vector-tensor Galileons modified gravity. Our analysis shows that the apparent image of the black hole in the observer's sky is non-spherical and cuspy, which is in contrast to the Kerr and Kerr-Newman cases. The non-trivial silhouette of the apparent image of the black hole provides novel templates for the current astrophysical observations. Moreover, due to the non-minimal coupling of the vector field to gravity the disformal black hole supports regular horizons for spin parameter exceeding the ADM mass. Finally, the shadows of the massless limit, supported only by the charge of the dark vector field, are also studied. When relevant the results are compared with the Kerr black hole.
