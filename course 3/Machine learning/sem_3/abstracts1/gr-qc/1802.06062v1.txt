In the context of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity the concept of gravitational pressure and gravitational energy-momentum arisen in a natural way. In the case of a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space FLRW we obtain the total energy contained inside the apparent horizon and the radial pressure over the apparent horizon area. We use these definitions to written a thermodynamics relation $T_{A}dS_{A} = dE_{A}+P_{A}dV_{A}$ at the apparent horizon, where $E_{A}$ is the total energy inside the apparent horizon, $V_{A}$ is the areal volume of the apparent horizon, $P_{A}$ is the radial pressure over the apparent horizon area, $S_{A}$ is the entropy which can be assumed as one quarter of the apparent horizon area only for a non stationary apparent horizon. We identify $T_{A}$ as the temperature at the surface of the apparent horizon. We shown that for all expanding accelerated FLRW model of universe the radial pressure is positive.
