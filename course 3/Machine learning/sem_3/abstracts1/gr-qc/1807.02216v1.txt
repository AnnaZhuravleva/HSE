In this work we have presented a special class of Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole, having its horizon located precisely at $r=2M$, for $Q^{2}=l^{2}-a^{2}$, where $M$, $l$, $a$ and $Q$ are mass, NUT charge, rotation parameter and electric charge of the black hole respectively. Unlike any other black hole in this family, the one under consideration has spacelike singularity and hence it is in conformity with the cosmic censorship conjecture. The separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations further facilitates to write down the radial and angular geodesics using the Carter constant. Study of null and timelike geodesics in both equatorial and off-equatorial planes has been performed with several distinct features in comparison to the other members of the Kerr-Newman-NUT family. Similar discerning features are also present in the energy extraction mechanisms, e.g., the black hole under study radiates less energy through the super-radiant modes and Penrose process than other black holes in this family. Thermodynamical features of this special class of black holes are also discussed.
