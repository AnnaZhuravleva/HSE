In this work we derive a generalized Newtonian gravitational force and show that it can account for the anomalous galactic rotation curves. We derive the entropy-area relationship applying the Feynman-Hibbs procedure to the supersymmetric Wheeler-DeWitt equation of the Schwarzschild black hole. We obtain the modifications to the Newtonian gravitational force from the entropic formulation of gravity.
