Wormholes are tunnels connecting two different points in space-time. In Einstein's General Relativity theory, wormholes are expected to be filled by exotic matter, i.e., matter that does not satisfy the energy conditions and may have negative density. We propose, in this paper, the achievement of wormhole solutions with no need for exotic matter. In order to achieve so, we consider quadratic terms in the trace of the energy-momentum tensor as corrections to the effective energy-momentum tensor of the underlined theory of gravity. We show that by following this formalism, it is possible, indeed, to obtain non-exotic matter wormhole solutions.
