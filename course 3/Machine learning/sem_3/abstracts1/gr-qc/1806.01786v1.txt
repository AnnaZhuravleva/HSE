We study variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio by incorporating standard model of particle physics into the $\Lambda$CDM model. We will show how the Higgs VEV varies with cosmic time. According to the Higgs mechanism, this leads to a variation of the electron mass. However, the proton mass is completely determined by gluons and quarks interacting together. Ignoring the quark masses and electromagnetic effects, the proton mass is only dependent on the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) energy scale, i.e., $ \Lambda_{QCD} $. Therefore, variation of the Higgs VEV changes the electron mass, while the proton mass remains constant. This leads to a variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio with cosmic time. This study is important in understanding the recent claims of the detection of a variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio in quasar absorption spectra. Finally, we plot variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio against redshift and compare it with different observations.
