The homogeneous and isotropic radiation dominated universe, following the inflationary stage, is expressed as a spherically symmetric and inhomogeneous spacetime upon a power law type conformal transformation of the null (cosmological) coordinates. This new spacetime metric has many interesting properties. While the static observers, at a fixed position in this new spacetime, do not see any horizon, some non-static observers encounter a horizon due to their motion which is analogous to the situation of Rindler observers in Minkowski spacetime. The symmetry of the new metric offers a unitarily inequivalent quantization of the massless scalar field and provides a new example of particle creation. We calculate the particle content of the cosmological vacuum state with respect to the static observer in this new spacetime who, with respect to cosmological time, is freely falling in asymptotic past and future but accelerated in between.
