We look into the general aspects of space-time symmetries in presence of torsion, and how the latter is affected by such symmetries. Focusing in particular to space-times which either exhibit maximal symmetry on their own, or could be decomposed to maximally symmetric subspaces, we work out the constraints on torsion in two different theoretical schemes. We show that at least for a completely antisymmetric torsion tensor (for e.g. the one motivated from string theory), an equivalence is set between these two schemes, as the non-vanishing independent torsion tensor components turn out to be the same.
