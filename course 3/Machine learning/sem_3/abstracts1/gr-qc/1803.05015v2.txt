We study the natural extension of spacetime across Schwarzschild's central singularity and the behavior of the geodesics crossing it. Locality implies that this extension is independent from the future fate of black holes. We argue that this extension is the natural $\hbar\!\to\!0$ limit of the effective quantum geometry inside a black hole, and show that the central region contains causal diamonds with area satisfying Bousso's bound for an entropy that can be as large as Hawking's radiation entropy. This result sheds light on the possibility that Hawking radiation is purified by information crossing the internal singularity.
