We discuss a class of exact solutions of a three-parameter non-minimally extended Einstein-Maxwell model, which are attributed to non-minimal magnetic monopoles of the Dirac type. We focus on the investigation of the gravitational field of Dirac monopoles for those models, for which the singularity at the central point is hidden inside of an event horizon independently on the mass and charge of the object. We obtained the relationships between the non-minimal coupling constants, for which this requirement is satisfied. As explicit examples, we consider in detail two one-parameter models: first, non-minimally extended Reissner-Nordstr\"om model (for the magnetically charged monopole), second, the Drummond-Hathrell model.
