We revisit the concept of turnaround radius in cosmology, in the context of modified gravity. While preliminary analyses were limited to scalar-tensor/$F(R)$ gravity, we extend the definition and the study of this quantity to a much broader class of theories including also quantum $R^2$ gravity. The turnaround radius is computed in terms of the parameters of the theory and it is shown that a deviation not larger than 10\% of this quantity from its value in Einstein's theory could constrain the model parameters and even rule out some current theories.
