Recently, spacetimes described by metrics with three parameters (mass, rotation and small quadrupole moment) was found, and in this paper, null geodesics for these metrics are calculated and visualized. Light scattering, as well as the role that the quadrupole moment plays in deforming these kinds of spacetimes are studied. This is a new application of a symbolic--numeric program that we previously used to study the Bonnor metric.
