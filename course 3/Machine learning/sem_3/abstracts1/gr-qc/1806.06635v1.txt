We study tidal effects induced by a particle moving along a slightly eccentric equatorial orbits in a Schwarzschild spacetime within the gravitational self-force framework. We compute the first order (conservative) corrections in the mass-ratio to the eigenvalues of the electric-type and magnetic-type tidal tensors up to the second order in eccentricity and through the 9.5 post-Newtonian order. Previous results on circular orbits are thus generalized and recovered in a proper limit.
