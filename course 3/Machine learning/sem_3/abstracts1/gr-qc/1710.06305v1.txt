In this work, we consider rotating BTZ black hole in three dimensions which is dual of one dimensional holographic superconductors. We applied higher order corrections of the entropy, which interpreted as quantum corrections, to the thermodynamics quantities and study modified thermodynamics. We investigate stability of rotating BTZ black hole under effects of higher order quantum corrections, and find that they affect stability of black hole. So, the small black hole has some instabilities and critical points due to the quantum effects. We also study effect of correction terms on the dual picture of rotating BTZ black hole.
