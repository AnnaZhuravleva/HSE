In a spacetime divided into two regions $U_1$ and $U_2$ by a hypersurface $\Sigma$, a perturbation of the field in $U_1$ is coupled to perturbations in $U_2$ by means of the first-order holographic imprint that it leaves on $\Sigma$. The linearized glueing field equation constrains perturbations on the two sides of a dividing hypersurface. This linear operator may have a nontrivial null space; a nontrivial perturbation of the field leaving a holographic imprint on a dividing hypersurface which does not affect perturbations on the other side should be considered physically irrelevant.   This condition, together with a locality requirement, leads to the notion of gauge equivalence in first-order Lagrangian field theory.
