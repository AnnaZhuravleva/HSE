We present a new class of solutions for static spherically symmetric wormhole spacetimes in conformal gravity and outline a detailed method for their construction. As an explicit example, we construct a class of traversable and non-traversable wormholes that are locally conformal to Schwarzschild-(anti) de Sitter spacetimes. These wormhole spacetimes are exact vacuum solutions in, but not being limited to, Weyl gravity and conformal scalar-tensor theories. Importantly, the method implies that every conformal gravity theory with local field equations will trivially contain wormholes without the need for exotic matter. Applying those results on gravitational theories that possess conformal symmetry in the ultraviolet regime, the central singularities of black holes can be replaced with wormhole throats. We speculate on possible phenomenological consequences.
