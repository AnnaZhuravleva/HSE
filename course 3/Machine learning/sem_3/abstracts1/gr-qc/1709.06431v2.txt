In this study, we reach the equations of motion of Morris-Thorne wormhole geometry by means of the Einstein Field Equations and Klein-Gordon Equation of Scalar-Tensor theory by direct calculation. We discuss the anisotropic matter energy distribution. We determine a relation between the radial and the transverse pressures. Hence, we express the anisotropic energy momentum tensor in terms of one pressure class, by means of that relation. Besides that, we check the isotropic case and show that there is no traversable wormhole, in the zero redshift function situation, if the space is fulfilled with an isotropic energy momentum distribution. In addition, we represent the conditions in order that the Null Energy Condition (NEC) is satisfied in the presence of a dilaton like field, in the zero tidal force case. We also propose a special type of shape function and express those conditions for it. We will be calling the wormhole corresponding to that shape function as the Yukawa Type. Furthermore, we determine the radial and the transverse pressures in the zero redshift function situation.
