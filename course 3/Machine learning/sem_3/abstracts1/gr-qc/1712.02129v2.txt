Unification of dark matter and dark energy as short- and long-range manifestations of a single cosmological substance is possible in models described by the generalized Chaplygin gas equation of state. We show it admits halo-like structures and discuss their density profiles, the resulting space-time geometry and the rotational velocity profiles expected in these models.
