In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the equatorial motion of the charged test particles in Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT spacetime. By working out the orbit equation in the radial direction, we investigate possible orbit types. Concentrating particularly on the circular orbits, we discuss and determine the conditions for the existence of equatorial circular orbits. We study their stability as well. Next, we provide some sample plots of possible orbit configurations and give a detailed discussion of the orbit types.
