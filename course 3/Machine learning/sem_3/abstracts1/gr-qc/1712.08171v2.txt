WKB approximation methods are applied to the case of a massive scalar field around a 5-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The divergences are explicitly isolated and the cancellation against the Schwinger-De Witt counter-terms proven. The resulting finite quantity is evaluated for different values of the free parameters, namely the black hole mass and charge, and the scalar field mass. We thus extend our previous results on quantum vacuum polarization effects for uncharged asymptotically flat higher dimensional black holes to electrically charged black holes.
