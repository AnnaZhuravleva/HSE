We consider a dynamical system of phantom scalar field under exponential potential in background of loop quantum cosmology. In our analysis, there is neither stable node nor repeller unstable node but only two saddle points, hence no Big Rip singularity. Physical solutions always possess potential energy greater than magnitude of the negative kinetic energy. We found that the universe bounces after accelerating even in the domination of the phantom field. After bouncing, the universe finally enters oscillatory regime.
