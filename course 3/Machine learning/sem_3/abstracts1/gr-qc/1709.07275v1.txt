The investigation about the volume of a black hole is closely related to the quantum nature of the black hole. The entropy is a significant concept for this. A recent work by Majhi and Samanta [Phys. Lett. B 770 (2017) 314] after us presented a similar conclusion that the entropy associated with the volume is proportional to the surface area of the black hole, but the proportionality coefficient is different from our earlier result. In this paper, we clarify the difference and show that their calculation is unrelated to the interior of the black hole.
