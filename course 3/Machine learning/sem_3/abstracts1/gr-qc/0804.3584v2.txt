The Misner and Sharp approach to the study of gravitational collapse is extended to the viscous dissipative case in, both, the streaming out and the diffusion approximations. The dynamical equation is then coupled to causal transport equations for the heat flux, the shear and the bulk viscosity, in the context of Israel--Stewart theory, without excluding the thermodynamics viscous/heat coupling coefficients. The result is compared with previous works where these later coefficients were neglected and viscosity variables were not assumed to satisfy causal transport equations. Prospective applications of this result to some astrophysical scenarios are discussed.
