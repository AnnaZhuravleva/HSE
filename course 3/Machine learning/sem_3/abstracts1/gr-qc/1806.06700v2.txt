Spinning black holes in dynamical Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity are constructed by directly solving the field equations, without resorting to any perturbative expansion. This model is obtained by adding to the Einstein-Hilbert action a particular higher-curvature correction: the Pontryagin density, linearly coupled to a scalar field. The spinning black holes are stationary, axi-symmetric, asymptotically flat generalisations of the Kerr solution of Einstein's gravity, but they possess a non-trivial (odd-parity) scalar field. They are regular on and outside the horizon and satisfy a generalized Smarr relation. We discuss the deviations from Kerr at the level of the spin and mass distribution, the horizon angular velocity, the ergo-region and some basic properties of geodesic motion. For sufficiently small values of the Chern-Simons coupling our results match those previously obtained using a perturbative approach.
