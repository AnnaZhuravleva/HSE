The first fully integrated explicit exact solution of the Einstein field equations corresponding to the superposition of a counterrotating dust disk with a central black hole is presented. The obtained solution represents an infinite annular thin disk (a disk with an inner edge) around the Schwarszchild black hole. The mass of the disk is finite and the energy-momentum tensor agrees with all the energy conditions. Furthermore, the total mass of the disk when the black hole is present is less than the total mass of the disk alone. The solution can also be interpreted as describing a thin disk made of two counterrotanting dust fluids that are also in agreement with all the energy conditions. Additionally, as we will show shortly in a subsequent paper, the above solution is the first one of an infinite family of solutions.
