To reduce general relativity (GR) to the canonical Hamiltonian formalism and construct the path (functional) integral in a simpler and, especially in the discrete case, less singular way, one extends the configuration superspace, as in the connection representation. The result of the functional integration over connection can be written in the form of expansions: the phase of the result arises in the leading order of the stationary phase method where it is equal to the Regge action, the module of the result arises in the leading order of the expansion over a scale of discrete lapse-shift functions and has maxima at finite (Planck scale) areas/lengths and rapidly decreases at large areas/lengths. This means the appearance of a kind of lattice with spacings dynamically fixed (loosely). We consider a typical propagator for this system using an example of a simplified pseudo-mini-superspace structure - a cubic lattice.
