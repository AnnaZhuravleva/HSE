An intermediate inflationary universe model within the context of non-minimally coupled to the scalar curvature is analyzed. We will conduct our analysis under the slow roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics and the cosmological perturbations considering a coupling of the form $F(\varphi)=\kappa+\xi_n\varphi^n$. Considering the trajectories in the $r-n_s$ plane from Planck data, we find the constraints on the parameter-space in our model.
