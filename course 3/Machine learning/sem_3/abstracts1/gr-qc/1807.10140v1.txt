We consider a `Scalar-Maxwell-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet' theory in four dimension, where the scalar field couples non-minimally with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term. This coupling with the scalar field ensures the non topological character of the GB term. In such higher curvature scenario, we explore the effect of electromagnetic field on scalar field collapse. Our results reveal that the presence of a time dependent electromagnetic field requires an anisotropy in the background spacetime geometry and such anisotropic spacetime allows a collapsing solution for the scalar field. The singularity formed as a result of the collapse is found to be a curvature singularity which may be point like or line like depending on the strength of the anisotropy. We also show that the singularity is always hidden from exterior by an apparent horizon.
