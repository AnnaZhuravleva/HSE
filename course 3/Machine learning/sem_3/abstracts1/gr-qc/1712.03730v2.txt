We present a review on Lagrangian models admitting spherically symmetric regular black holes, and cosmological bounce solutions. Non-linear electrodynamics, non-polynomial gravity, and fluid approaches are explained in details. They consist respectively in a gauge invariant generalization of the Maxwell Lagrangian, in modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert action via non-polynomial curvature invariants, and finally in the reconstruction of density profiles able to cure the central singularity of black holes. The non-polynomial gravity curvature invariants have the special property to be second order and polynomial in the metric field, in spherically symmetric spacetimes. Along the way, other models and results are discussed, and some general properties that regular black holes should satisfy are mentioned. A covariant Sakharov criterion for the absence of singularities in dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes is also proposed and checked for some examples of such regular metric fields.
