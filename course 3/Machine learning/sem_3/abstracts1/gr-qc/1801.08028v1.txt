Thermodynamical properties of charged AdS black holes with a global monopole still remain obscure. In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics and phase transition of the black holes in the extended phase space. It is shown that thermodynamical quantities of the black holes exhibit an interesting dependence on the internal global monopole, and they perfectly satisfy both the first law of thermodynamics and Smarr relation. Furthermore, analysis of the local and the global thermodynamical stability manifests that the charged AdS black hole undergoes an elegant phase transition at critical point. Of special interest, critical behaviors of the black holes resemble a Van der Waals liquid-gas system. Our results not only reveal the effect of a global monopole on thermodynamics of AdS black holes, but also further support that Van der Waals-like behavior of the black holes is a universal phenomenon.
