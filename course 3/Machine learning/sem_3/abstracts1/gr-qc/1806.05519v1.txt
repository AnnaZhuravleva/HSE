We obtain the conserved Abbott-Deser-Tekin (ADT)-{\it like} current for the Lanczos-Lovelock gravity for arbitrary diffeomorphism vector. As the original ADT current is defined only for the presence of a background Killing vector, one cannot use it extensively for the thermodynamic description of the wide classes of non-Killing horizons which appear in gravity. On the other hand, this general approach can be utilized for any arbitrary horizons. Here, the conserved current can be written as the derivative of the two-rank anti-symmetric potential, the connection of which is apparent with the conserved Noether potential from our analysis. For the assumption of the arbitrary diffeomorphism vector as the Killing one, the results match to the ADT case, whereas non-trivial result comes for the conformal Killing vectors and other arbitrary vectors. The whole analysis is off-shell and, therefore, applicable to any null surface.
