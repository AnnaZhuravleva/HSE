In this paper, we study inflation with {\alpha}-attractor potential in the RS braneworlds where high energy corrections to the Friedmann equation facilitate slow roll. In this scenario, we numerically investigate the inflationary parameters and show that the high energy brane cor- rections have significant effect on the parameter {\alpha}, namely, the lower values of the parameter are preferred by observation in this limit. We find that the sub-Planckian values of the field displacement can be achieved by suitably constraining the brane tension.
