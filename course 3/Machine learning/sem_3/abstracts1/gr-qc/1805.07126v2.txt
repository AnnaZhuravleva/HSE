Maximal accelerations are related to the existence of a minimal time for a given physical system. Such a minimal time can be either an intrinsic time scale of the system or connected to a quantum gravity induced ultraviolet cut off. In this paper we pedagogically introduce the four major formulations for kinematics accounting for a maximal acceleration. Some phenomenological repercussion are offered as hints for future investigations.
