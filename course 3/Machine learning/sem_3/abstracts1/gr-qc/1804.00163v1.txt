Detection of gravitational waves(GW) involves using the network of GW telescopes to observe a large sky region. However, owing to the arrangement of the GW telescopes, even with aLIGO- aVirgo-KAGRA network,parameter estimation accuracy deteriorates depending on the sky region of the GW source due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse operator. A regularization-based method is proposed herein to improve parameter estimation accuracy. Although conventional regularization methods cannot optimize all regulator parameters completely, the proposed method archives full optimization by applying an a-posteriori parameter choice rule to determine regulator parameters. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shrink the credible regions of inclination vs lumi- nosity distance and polarization vs initial phase significantly in the sky wherein the accuracy of the amplitude parameters of a GW has been deteriorated. The proposed method suppresses the systematic error of a GW depending on the sky region and allows us investigating the cosmological information more precisely.
