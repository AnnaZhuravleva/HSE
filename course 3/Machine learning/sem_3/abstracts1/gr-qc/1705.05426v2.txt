We study quantum tunneling of a composite object, which has internal degrees of freedom coupled with the quantized radiation field, through a $\delta$ potential barrier. Although the center of mass degrees of freedom of the object is not coupled with the radiation field directly, we show that dissipation caused by the radiation field can suppress its quantum tunneling rate in the center of mass degrees of freedom. In addition, when the initial energy of the center of mass motion is similar to that of the excited states of the internal degrees of freedom, the spatial superposition state of the object prepared by the barrier can decohere due to the entanglement (created by the interaction with the barrier) between the center of mass and the internal degrees of freedom which is entangled with the radiation field. The main purpose of this article is to investigate how two different interplays (i) among the center of mass, the internal degrees of freedom and the potential barrier, and (ii) between the internal degrees of freedom and the radiation field, can affect the quantum tunneling and the creation of a spatial superposition state of the composite object. Most parts of this article deal with the photon radiation field, however due to the increasing interest in gravitational decoherence, we also discuss problems which can arise when the photon field is replaced by gravity.
