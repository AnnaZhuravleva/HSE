Using effective field theory techniques we compute the next to leading order Spin(1)Spin(1) terms in the potential of spinning compact objects at third Post-Newtonian order, including sub-leading self-induced finite size effects. This result represents the last ingredient to complete the relevant spin potentials to 3PN order from which the equations of motion follow via a canonical formalism. As an example we include the precession equation.
