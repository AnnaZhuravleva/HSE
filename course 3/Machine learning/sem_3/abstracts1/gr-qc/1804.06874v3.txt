The aim of this work is to obtain new analitical solutions for Einstein equations in the anisotropical domain. This will be done via the minimal geometric deformation (MGD) approach, which is a simple and systematical method that allow us to decouple the Einstein equations. It requires a perfect fluid known solution that we will choose to be Finch-Skeas(FS) solution. Two different constraints were applied, and in each case we found an interval of values for the free parameters, where necesarly other physical solutions shall live.
