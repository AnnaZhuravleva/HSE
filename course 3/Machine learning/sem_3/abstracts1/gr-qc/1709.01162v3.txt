We obtain the equation that describe the conditions of quantization for neutral massless bosons on an arbitrary curved space-time, obtained using a particular theoretical formalism developed in a previous work\cite{MM}. In particular, we study the emission of neutral massless $(1, 2)\hbar$-spin bosons during pre-inflation using the recently introduced unified spinor field theory. We conclude that during pre-inflation (which is governed by an vacuum equation of state), is emitted gravitational radiation, which could be detected in the future, as primordial gravitational radiation.
