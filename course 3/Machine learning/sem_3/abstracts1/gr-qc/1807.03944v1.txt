It is well-known that the exact solution of non-linear $\sigma$ model coupled to gravity can be perceived as an exterior gravitational field of a global monopole. Here we study Einstein's equations coupled to a non-linear $\sigma$ model with Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic term in $D$ dimensions. The solution describes a metric around a DBI global defects. When the core is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius it can be interpreted as a black hole having DBI scalar hair with deficit conical angle. The solutions exist for all $D$, but they can be expressed as polynomial functions in $r$ only when $D$ is even. We give conditions for the mass $M$ and the scalar charge $\eta$ in the extremal case. We also investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes in canonical ensemble. The monopole alter the stability differently in each dimensions. As the charge increases the black hole radiates more, in contrast to its counterpart with ordinary global defects where the Hawking temperature is minimum for critical $\eta$. This behavior can also be observed for variation of DBI coupling, $\beta$. As it gets stronger ($\beta\ll1$) the temperature increases. By studying the heat capacity we can infer that there is no phase transition in asymptotically-flat spacetime. The AdS black holes, on the other hand, undergo a first-ordered phase transition in the Hawking-Page type. The increase of the DBI coupling renders the phase transition happen for larger radius.
