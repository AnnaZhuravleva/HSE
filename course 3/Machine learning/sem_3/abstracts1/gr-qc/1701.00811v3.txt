We discuss the linear perturbation equations with the synchronous gauge in a minimal scenario of the bimetric massive gravity theory. We find that the matter density perturbation and matter power spectrum are suppressed. We also examine the ghost and stability problems and show that the allowed deviation of this gravitational theory from the cosmological constant is constrained to be smaller than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ by the large scale structure observational data.
