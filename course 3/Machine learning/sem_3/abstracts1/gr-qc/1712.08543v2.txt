We perform the canonical quantization of a general scalar-tensor theory and derive the first quantum gravitational corrections following from a semi-classical expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The non-minimal coupling of the scalar field to gravity induces a derivative coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational degrees of freedom, which prevents a direct application of the expansion scheme. We address this technical difficulty by transforming the theory from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. We find that a large non-minimal coupling can have strong effects on the quantum gravitational correction terms. We briefly discuss these effects in the context of the specific model of Higgs inflation.
