In the present letter, we consider the DeBroglie-Bohm interpretation of a Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz quantum cosmology model in the presence of a radiation perfect fluid. We compute the Bohm's trajectories for the scale factor and show that it never goes to zero. That result gives a strong indication that this model is free from singularities, at the quantum level. We also compute the quantum potential. That quantity helps understanding why the scale factor never vanishes.
