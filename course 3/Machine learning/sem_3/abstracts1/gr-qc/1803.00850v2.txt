We present a new computational framework for the Galerkin-collocation method for double domain in the context of ADM 3+1 approach in numerical relativity. This work enables us to perform high resolution calculations for initial sets of two arbitrary black holes. We use the Bowen-York method for binary systems and the puncture method to solve the Hamiltonian constraint. The nonlinear numerical code solves the set of equations for the spectral modes using the standard Newton-Raphson method, LU decomposition and Gaussian quadratures. We show convergence of our code for the conformal factor and the ADM mass. Thus, we display features of the conformal factor for different masses, spins and linear momenta.
