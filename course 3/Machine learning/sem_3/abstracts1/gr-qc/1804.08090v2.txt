In this paper, we show the detail of our recent paper Effects of cosmic-string framework on the thermodynamical properties of an anharmonic oscillator using the ordinary statistics and the q-deformed superstatistics approaches published in the Eur. Phys. J. C. Actually, we prepare this comment against the comment prepared by Francisco A. Cruz Neto and Luis B. Castro [arXiv:1804.03012].
