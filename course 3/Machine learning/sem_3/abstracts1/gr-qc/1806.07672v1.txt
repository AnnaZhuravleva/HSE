Scaler and tensor perturbations couple nonlinearly with each other in the Einstein-Hilbert action. We show that such interaction naturally leads to the quantum decoherence of the primordial perturbations during inflation at horizon crossing. The dominant interaction Hamiltonian contributing to decoherence is identified and the master equation responsible for the decohering process is derived.
