The cosmological constant problem arises because the magnitude of vacuum energy density predicted by quantum mechanics is $\sim 120$ orders of magnitude larger than the value implied by cosmological observations of accelerating cosmic expansion. Recently some of the current authors proposed that the stochastic nature of the quantum vacuum can resolve this tension [1]. By treating the fluctuations in the vacuum seriously, and applying a high-energy cutoff at which Quantum Field Theory is believed to break down, a parametric resonance occurs that predicts a slow expansion and acceleration. In this work we more thoroughly examine the implications of this proposal by investigating the resulting dynamics. Firstly, we improve upon the numerical calculations and show that convergence issues with the original code had overshadowed some important effects. Some of the conclusions are thus reversed, however, the premise that parametric resonance can explain a very slowly accelerating expansion remains sound. After improving the resolution and efficiency of the numerical tests, we explore a wider range of cutoff energies, and examine the effects of multiple particle fields. We introduce a simple model using Mathieu's equation, a prototypical example of parametric resonance, and find that it closely matches numerical results in regimes where its assumptions are valid. Using this model, we extrapolate to find that in a universe with $28$ bosonic fields and a high-energy cutoff $40$ times higher than the Planck energy, the acceleration would be comparable to what is observed.
