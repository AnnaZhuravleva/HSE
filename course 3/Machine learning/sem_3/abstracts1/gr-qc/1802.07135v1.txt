In this work we investigate the dynamics of cosmological models with spherical topology containing up to 600 Schwarzschild black holes arranged in an irregular manner. We solve the field equations by tessellating the 3-sphere into eight identical cells, each having a single edge which is shared by all the cells. The shared edge is enforced to be locally rotationally symmetric (LRS), thereby allowing for solving the dynamics to high accuracy along this edge. Each cell will then carry an identical (up to parity) configuration which can however have an arbitrarily random distribution. The dynamics of such models is compared to that of previous works on regularly distributed black holes as well as with the standard isotropic dust models of the FLRW type. The irregular models are shown to have a richer dynamics than that of the regular models. The randomization of the distribution of the black holes is done both without bias and also with a certain clustering bias. The geometry of the initial configuration of our models is shown to be qualitatively different from the regular case in the way it approaches the isotropic model.
