In this paper, we construct a new exact analytic solution for Anti-de Sitter-Nonlinear electrodynamics (AdS-NED) black hole in four dimensions. We study tunneling of vector particles from novel AdS-NED black hole to find Hawking temperature as well as its thermodynamical properties in usual and extended phase space. Then we explore the properties of pressure-volume criticality by analyzing the phase diagram and its free energy. Finally, we investigate the Joule-Thomson coefficient, in which the inversion curve of warming and cooling are studied, and the ratio between the inverse temperature and critical temperature are computed in our black hole solution.
