The extremely high precision of current astronomical observations demands a much better theoretical treatment of relativistic effects in the propagation of electromagnetic signals through variable gravitational fields of isolated astronomical systems emitting gravitational waves. This paper presents a consistent approach giving a complete and exhaustive solution of this problem in the first post-Minkowskian approximation of general relativity.
