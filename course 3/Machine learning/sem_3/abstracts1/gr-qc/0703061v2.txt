We present a simple formula for the radiated angular momentum based on a spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of the Weyl scalar psi_4 representing outgoing radiation in the Kinnersley tetrad. We test our formula by measuring the radiated angular momentum from three simulations of non-spinning equal-mass black-hole binary with orbital angular momentum aligned along the x, y, and z axes respectively. We find that the radiated angular momentum agrees with the differences in the remnant horizon spins and the initial angular momentum for each system.
