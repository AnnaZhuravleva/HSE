This Oberwolfach report describes published work with Carlos Vega introducing the null distance on a spacetime, and announces unpublished applications of this work jointly with Carlos Vega and with Anna Sakovich applying the null distance to define a spacetime intrinsic flat convergence (SF convergence). The announced work with Vega concerns convergence of sequences of big bang spacetimes and the announced work with Anna Sakovich concerns convergence of future maximal developments of initial data sets. Both were originally announced at the 2018 JMM. This report lists some open questions that will be discussed at the Oberwolfach meeting this coming August.
