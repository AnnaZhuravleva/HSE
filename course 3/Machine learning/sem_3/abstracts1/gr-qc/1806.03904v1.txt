We obtain an approximate global stationary and axisymmetric solution of Einstein's equations which can be thought as a simple two layers star model: a self-gravitating ball built up by two layers of perfect fluid having different linear equation of state moving in a rigid motion pattern. Using the post-Min\-kows\-kian formalism (weak-field approximation) and considering rotation as a perturbation (slow-rotation approximation), we find approximate interior and exterior (asymptotically flat) solutions to this problem in harmonic coordinates. Interior and exterior solutions are matched, in the sense described by Lichnerowicz, on the surfaces of constant pressure, to obtain a global solution.
