Gravitational memory (a residual change) arises after a finite gravitational wave pulse interacts with free masses. We calculate the memory effect for particle scattering in massive gravity as a function of graviton mass $(m_g)$ and show that it is discretely different from the result of general relativity: the memory is reduced not just via the usual expected Yukawa decay but by a numerical factor which survives even in the massless limit. For $m_g \le 10^{-29} eV$, the memory is significantly reduced for distances beyond $1 Mpc$ as in the first observation of two black hole mergers which was at a distance of more than 200 Mpc. Hence careful observations of the gravitational wave memory effect can rule out the graviton mass. We also show that adding higher curvature terms reduces the memory effect.
