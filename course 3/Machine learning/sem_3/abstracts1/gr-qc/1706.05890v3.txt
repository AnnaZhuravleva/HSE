In this paper, we investigate the Unruh radiation in the Bohmian field theory on a shape dynamics background setting. Since metric and metric momentum are real quantities, the integral kernel to invert the Lichnerowicz-York equation for first order deviations due to existence of matter terms turns out to be real. This fact makes the interaction Hamiltonian real. On the other hand, the only contribution to guarantee the existence of Unruh radiation has to come from the imaginary part of the temporal part of the wave functional. We have proved the existence of Unruh radiation in this setting. It is also important that we have found the Unruh radiation via an Unruh-DeWitt detector in a theory where there is no Lorentz symmetry and no conventional space-time structure.
