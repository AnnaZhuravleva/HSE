We consider the effects of Gravity's Rainbow on the computation of black hole entropy using a dynamical brick wall model. An explicit dependence of the radial coordinate approaching the horizon is proposed to analyze the behavior of the divergence. We find that, due to the modification of the density of states, the brick wall can be eliminated. The calculation is extended to include rotations and in particular to a Kerr black hole in a comoving frame.
