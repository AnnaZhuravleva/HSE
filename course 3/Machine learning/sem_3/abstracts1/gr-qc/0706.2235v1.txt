The observations of supernova 1987A in underground detectors are revisited. It is shown that, while the LSD detector in the Mont Blanc Laboratory observed only one burst at 2h 52min 36.8sec U.T., the Kamiokande data show a possible second burst, in addition to the well known one at 7h 35min 33.7sec U.T. This second burst consists of a cluster of seven pulses, well above the energy threshold of the detector, observed during 6.2 seconds starting at 7h 54min 22.2sec U.T. Do these observations imply a long duration of the collapse?
