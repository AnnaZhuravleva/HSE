A non-linear equation obtained by adding self-interaction terms to the Poisson equation for Newtonian gravity is here analysed for the spherical vacuum and a static homogeneous compact source of given proper mass and radius. The main feature of this picture is that, although the freedom of shifting the potential by an arbitrary constant is lost, the solutions remain qualitatively very close to the Newtonian behaviour. We also notice that the negative gravitational potential energy is smaller than the proper mass for sources with small compactness, but for sources that should form black holes according to General Relativity, the gravitational potential energy becomes of the same order of magnitude of the proper mass, or even much larger.
