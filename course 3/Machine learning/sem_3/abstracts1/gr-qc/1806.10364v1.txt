We analyse the semi-classical and quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the framework of the Polymer Quantum mechanics, in order to implement a cut-off physics on the nature of the singularity. We first identify in the Universe cubed scale factor (i.e. the spatial volume) the only suitable configuration variable which implies the emergence of a Bounce dynamics as an intrinsic geometrical feature. We then investigate some feature of the obtained semi-classical Bounce dynamics for the primordial Universe, like the validity of the standard continuity equation and the divergent character of the cosmological horizon, when the semi-classical evolution is extended (in the spirit of the Ehrenfest theorem) to the collapsing pre-Bounce Universe. Finally, we validate the interpretation of the semi-classical dynamics as the behaviour of the mean values of a sufficiently peaked packet, by the quantization of inflationary paradigm, including in the evolution a massless scalar field and a positive cosmological constant. The present analysis has the merit to enforce the idea that the polymer quantization paradigm is, in the Minisuperspace, significantly isomorphic to the Loop quantum Cosmology approach. In fact, our study allows to define a precise correspondence between the Polymer cut-off scale and the Immirzi parameter.
