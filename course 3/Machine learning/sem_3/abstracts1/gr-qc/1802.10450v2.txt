We investigate the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics of a physical system comprising of newly proposed dark energy model called Ricci Gauss-Bonnet and cold dark matter enveloped by apparent horizon and event horizon in flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. For this purpose, Bekenstein entropy, Renyi, logarithmic and power law entropic corrections are used. It is found that this law exhibits the validity on both apparent and event horizons except for the case of logarithmic entropic correction at apparent horizon. Also, we check the thermodynamical equilibrium condition for all cases of entropy and found its vitality in all cases of entropy.
