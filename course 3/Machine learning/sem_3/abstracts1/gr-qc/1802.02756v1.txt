We adopt the double field natural inflation model motivated by the non-perturbative effects of supergravity and superstring theory to do the slow roll analysis. We show that when the amplitudes of two trigonometric functions are nearly equal, and decay constants of the field other than inflaton are small, there exist large ranges of initial values of fields that can satisfy the constraints of e-fold number and Planck observations. This means that some specially chosen parameters can allow less fine tuning of field values, which become more physical for field fluctuation in quantum era. We also plot the correlation power spectrum and the fraction of entropic power spectrum and the whole power spectrum (so-called ${\beta}_{\text{iso}}$) based on those chosen parameter sets.
