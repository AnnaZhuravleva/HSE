We examine the consequences of a universe with a non-constant cosmological term in Einstein's equations and find that the Bianchi identities reduce to the first law of thermodynamics when cosmological term is identified as being proportional to the entropy density of the universe. This means that gravitating dark energy can be viewed as entropy, but more, the holographic principle along with the known expansion of the universe indicates that the entropy of the universe is growing with time and this leads to a cosmic repulsion that also grows with time. Direct implications of this result are calculated and shown to be in good accord with recent observational data.
