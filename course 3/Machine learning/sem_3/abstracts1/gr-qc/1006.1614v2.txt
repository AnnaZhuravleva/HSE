First a review is given of Riemann-Cartan space-time and Einstein-Cartan gravity. This gives us the necessary tools to handle the SO(2,3) Yang-Mills gauge theory for gravity. New here is the derivation of the conservation laws. Finally possible solutions of the field equations are discussed. They depend on the scale of the de Sitter length. Solutions to the anti-de Sitter field equations are given in the case of a Schwarzschild and FRW-geometry.
