Finsler geometry is just riemannian geometry without the quadratic restriction[1]. In this paper, we study the motion of massive(non-zero rest mass) and massless particles for schwarzschild metric in finsler spacetime in the case of two dimensional Randers-Finsler space with unit positive flag curvature instead of two dimensional riemann sphere. We provide qualitative study of potential energy of particles at various distances near schwarzschild black hole and the results are then compared with schwarzschild metric in riemannian geometry. We will also describe the scattering of particles near schwarzschild black hole in finsler spacetime by finding capture cross section of absorption by the black hole.
