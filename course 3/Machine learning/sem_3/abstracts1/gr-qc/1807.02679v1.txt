Near Horizon Geometries with multiply degenerate Killing horizons $\mathcal{H}$ are considered, and their degenerate Killing vector fields identified. We prove that they all arise from hypersurface-orthogonal Killing vectors of any cut of $\mathcal{H}$ with the inherited metric -- cuts are spacelike co-dimension two submanifolds contained in $\mathcal{H}$. For each of these Killing vectors on a given cut, there are three different possibilities for the Near Horizon metric which are presented explicitly. The structure of the metric for Near Horizon Geometries with multiple Killing horizons of order $m\geq 3$ is thereby completely determined, and in particular we prove that the cuts on $\mathcal{H}$ must be warped products with maximally symmetric fibers (ergo of constant curvature). The question whether multiple degenerate Killing horizons may lead to inequivalent Near Horizon Geometries by using different degenerate Killings is addressed, and answered on the negative: all Near Horizon geometries built from a given multiple degenerate Killing horizon (using different degenerate Killings) are isometric.
