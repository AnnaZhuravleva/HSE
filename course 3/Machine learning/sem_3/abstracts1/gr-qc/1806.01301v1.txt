In order to apply holography and entropy relations to the whole universe, which is a gravitational and thus nonextensive system, for consistency one should use the generalized definition for the universe horizon entropy, namely Tsallis nonextensive entropy. We formulate Tsallis holographic dark energy, which is a generalization of standard holographic dark energy quantified by a new dimensionless parameter $\delta$, possessing the latter as a particular sub-case. We provide a simple differential equation for the dark energy density parameter, as well as an analytical expression for its equation-of-state parameter. In this scenario the universe exhibits the usual thermal history, namely the successive sequence of matter and dark-energy epochs, before resulting in a complete dark energy domination in the far future. Additionally, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior and, according to the value of $\delta$, it can be quintessence-like, phantom-like, or experience the phantom-divide crossing before or after the present time. Finally, we confront the scenario with Supernovae type Ia observational data, and we show that the agreement is excellent.
