We analyzed static spherically symmetric solutions of the five dimensional (5D) Lovelock gravity in the first order formulation. In the Riemannian sector, when torsion vanishes, Boulware-Deser black hole represents a unique static spherically symmetric black hole solution for the generic choice of the Lagrangian parameters. We showed that the special choice of the Lagrangian parameters, different from the Lovelock Chern-Simons gravity, leads to the existence of the static black hole solution with torsion, which metric is asymptotically AdS. We calculate conserved charges and thermodynamical quantities of the black hole solution.
