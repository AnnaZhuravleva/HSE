The modified gravity with F(R,G) Lagrangian, G is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, is considered. It is shown that the phantom-divide-line crossing and the deceleration to acceleration transition generally occur in these models. Our results coincide with the known results of f(R)-gravity and f(G)-gravity models. The contribution of quantum effects to these transitions is calculated, and it is shown that in some special cases where there are no transitions in classical level, quantum contributions can induce transitions. The quantum effects are described via the account of conformal anomaly.
