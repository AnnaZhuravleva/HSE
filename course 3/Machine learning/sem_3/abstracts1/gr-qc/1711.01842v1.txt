In this paper we define and construct advanced and retarded Green operators for the wave operator on spacetimes with low regularity. In order to do so we require that the spacetime satisfies the condition of generalised hyperbolicity which is equivalent to well- posedness of the classical inhomogeneous problem with zero initial data where weak solutions are properly supported. Moreover, we provide an explicit formula for the kernel of the Green operators in terms of an arbitrary eigenbasis of H 1 and a suitable Green matrix that solves a system of second order ODEs.
