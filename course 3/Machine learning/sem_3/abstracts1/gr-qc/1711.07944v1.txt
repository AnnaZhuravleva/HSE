We prove boundedness and polynomial decay statements for solutions of the spin $\pm2$ Teukolsky equation on a Kerr exterior background with parameters satisfying $|a|\ll M$. The bounds are obtained by introducing generalisations of the higher order quantities $P$ and $\underline{P}$ used in our previous work on the linear stability of Schwarzschild. The existence of these quantities in the Schwarzschild case is related to the transformation theory of Chandrasekhar. In a followup paper, we shall extend this result to the general sub-extremal range of parameters $|a|<M$. As in the Schwarzschild case, these bounds provide the first step in proving the full linear stability of the Kerr metric to gravitational perturbations.
