The impact of particle production during inflation on the primordial curvature perturbation spectrum is investigated both analytically and numerically. We obtain an oscillatory behavior on small scales, while on large scales the spectrum is unaffected. The amplitude of the oscillations is proportional to the number of coupled fields, their mass, and the square of the coupling constant. The oscillations are due a discontinuity in the second time derivative of the inflaton, arising from a temporary violation of the slow-roll conditions. A similar effect on the power spectrum should be produced also in other inflationary models where the slow-roll conditions are temporarily violated.
