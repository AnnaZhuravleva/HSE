From the viewpoint of holography, we study the behaviors of the entanglement entropy in insulator/superconductor transition with exponential nonlinear electrodynamics (ENE). We find that the entanglement entropy is a good probe to the properties of the holographic phase transition. Both in the half space and the belt space, the non-monotonic behavior of the entanglement entropy in superconducting phase versus the chemical potential is general in this model. Furthermore, the behavior of the entanglement entropy for the strip geometry shows that the confinement/deconfinement phase transition appears in both insulator and superconductor phases. And the critical width of the the confinement/deconfinement phase transition depends on the chemical potential and the exponential coupling term. More interestingly, the behaviors of the entanglement entropy in their corresponding insulator phases are independent of the exponential coupling factor but depends on the the width of the subsystem $\mathcal{A}$.
