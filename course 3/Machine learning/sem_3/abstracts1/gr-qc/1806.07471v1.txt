In a previous work and in terms of an exact quantum-mechanical framework, $\hbar$-independent causal and retarded expectation values of the second-quantized electro-magnetic fields in the Coulomb gauge were derived in the presence of a conserved classical electric current. The classical $\hbar$-independent Maxwell's equations then naturally emerged. In the present work, we extend these considerations to linear gravitational quantum deviations around a flat Minkowski space-time in a Coulomb-like gauge. The emergence of the classical causal and properly retarded linearized classical theory of general relativity with a conserved classical energy-momentum tensor is then outlined. The quantum-mechanical framework also provides for a simple approach to classical quadrupole gravitational radiation of Einstein and microscopic spontaneous graviton emission and/or absorption processes.
