Compact stars such as neutron stars and black holes are gravitationally bound many body systems. We investigate the importance of short and long range part of gravity for such systems. From our analysis, we conclude that the true essence of gravity lies with the long range nature of the interaction. At the end we show how these arguments in the manybody theory consistently leads to Dvali-Gomez picture of a black holes as a collective bound state of long wavelength gravitons.
