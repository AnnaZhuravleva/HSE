In this article we investigate dependency of the adiabatic and entropy spectral indices of the cosmological perturbations on the geometry and topology of the background universe. Our discussion includes the post-inflationary universe i.e. radiation-dust mixture era. For this purpose, we first extract an explicit equation describing evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation in the FLRW universe with arbitrary spatial sectional curvature. We may percept when $K\neq 0$, curvature scale would be as significant as the perturbations scales to recognize the behavior of the spectral indices. We also focus on the entropy perturbation in order to extract behavior of the isocurvature spectral index in terms of the curvature index and time. Our analysis shows that spectra of curvature and entropy perturbations in sub-horizon scales could be function of topology. Moreover, an accurate analysis makes clear that time-average of isocurvature index in case $K=0$ is about zero,so that imprint of entropy perturbation in time duration may be negligible. We also consider evolution of the cosmological indices for super-curvature modes in the case $K=-1$. In the most results dependency to curvature, initial conditions and scale modes are thoroughly vivid.
