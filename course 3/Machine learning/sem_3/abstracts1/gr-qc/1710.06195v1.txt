We propose a quantum version of the quadratic volume simplicity constraint for the EPRL spin foam model. It relies on a formula for the volume of 4-dimensional polyhedra, depending on its bivectors and the knotting class of its boundary graph. While this leads to no further condition for the 4-simplex, the constraint becomes non-trivial for more complicated boundary graphs. We show that, in the semi-classical limit of the hypercuboidal graph, the constraint turns into the geometricity condition observed recently by several authors.
