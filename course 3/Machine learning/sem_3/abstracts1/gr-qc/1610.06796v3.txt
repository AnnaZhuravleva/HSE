The unification of quantum mechanics and gravity remains as one of the primary challenges of present-day physics. Quantum-gravity-inspired phenomenological models offer a window to explore potential aspects of quantum gravity including qualitatively new behaviour that can be experimentally tested. One such phenomenological model is the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), which predicts a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation and a deformed canonical commutator. It was recently shown that optomechanical systems offer significant promise to put stringent experimental bounds on such models. In this paper, we introduce a scheme to increase the sensitivity of these experiments with an extended sequence of pulsed optomechanical interactions. We also analyze the effects of optical phase noise and optical loss and present a strategy to mitigate such deleterious effects.
