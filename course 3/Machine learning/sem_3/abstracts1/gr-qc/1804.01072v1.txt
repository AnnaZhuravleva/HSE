We investigate the braneworld gravity starting from the non-conservative gravitational field equations in a five-dimensional bulk. The approach is based on the Gauss-Codazzi formalism along with the study of the braneworld consistency conditions. The effective gravitational equations on the brane are obtained and the constraint leading to a brane energy-momentum conservation is analyzed.
