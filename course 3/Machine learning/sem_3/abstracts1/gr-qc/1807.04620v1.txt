In this article, we mainly discuss the dynamics of the preinflationary Universe for the potential $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$ with $n=5/3$ in the context of loop quantum cosmology, in which the big bang singularity is resolved by a non-singular quantum bounce. In case of the kinetic energy dominated initial conditions of the scalar field at the bounce, the numerical evolution of the Universe can be split up into three regimes: bouncing, transition and the slow-roll inflation. In the bouncing regime, the numerical evolution of the scale factor does not depend on a wide range of initial values, and also the inflationary potentials. We calculate the number of $e$-folds in the slow-roll regime, by which observationally identified initial conditions are obtained. Additionally, we display the phase portrait for the model under consideration.
