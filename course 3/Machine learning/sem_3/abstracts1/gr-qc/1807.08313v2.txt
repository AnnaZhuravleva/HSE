We present an original approach to compute the electromagnetic self force acting on a static charge in Kerr spacetime. Our approach is based on an improved version of the Janis-Newman algorithm and extends its range of applicability. It leads to a closed expression which generalizes the existing one and, since it does not involve the electromagnetic potential, it simplifies the calculation of the self force.
