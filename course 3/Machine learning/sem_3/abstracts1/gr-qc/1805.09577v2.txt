In this work we have studied the non-geodesical behaviour of particles with spin 1/2 in Poincar\'e gauge theories of gravity, via the WKB method and the Mathisson-Papapetrou equation. We have analysed the relation between the two approaches and we have argued the different advantages associated with the WKB approximation. Within this approach, we have calculated the trajectories in a particular Poincar\'e gauge theory, discussing the viability of measuring such a motion.
