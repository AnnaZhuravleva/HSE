The polytropic hydrodynamic vortex describes an effective $(2+1)$-dimensional acoustic spacetime with an inner reflecting boundary at $r=r_{\text{c}}$. This physical system, like the spinning Kerr black hole, possesses an ergoregion of radius $r_{\text{e}}$ and an inner non-pointlike curvature singularity of radius $r_{\text{s}}$. Interestingly, the fundamental ratio $r_{\text{e}}/r_{\text{s}}$ which characterizes the effective geometry is determined solely by the dimensionless polytropic index $N_{\text{p}}$ of the circulating fluid. It has recently been proved that, in the $N_{\text{p}}=0$ case, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized by an {\it infinite} countable set of reflecting surface radii, $\{r_{\text{c}}(N_{\text{p}};n)\}^{n=\infty}_{n=1}$, that can support static (marginally-stable) sound modes. In the present paper we use {\it analytical} techniques in order to explore the physical properties of the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex in the $N_{\text{p}}>0$ regime. In particular, we prove that in this physical regime, the effective acoustic spacetime is characterized by a {\it finite} discrete set of reflecting surface radii, $\{r_{\text{c}}(N_{\text{p}},m;n)\}^{n=N_{\text{max}}}_{n=1}$, that can support the marginally-stable static sound modes (here $m$ is the azimuthal harmonic index of the acoustic perturbation field). Interestingly, it is proved analytically that the dimensionless outermost supporting radius $r^{\text{max}}_{\text{c}}/r_{\text{e}}$, which marks the onset of superradiant instabilities in the polytropic hydrodynamic vortex, increases monotonically with increasing values of the integer harmonic index $m$ and decreasing values of the dimensionless polytropic index $N_{\text{p}}$.
