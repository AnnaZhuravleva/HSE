A Lorentz invariant framework is developed to model the cross spectrum of two interferometers in a space-time that emerges from a Planck scale quantum system with exact causal symmetry and holographic spacelike rotational correlations. Space-time relationships between world lines are generated by entanglement of geometrical states on causal diamonds. The entanglement is tied to a unique observable signature: an exotic imaginary broad band cross spectrum, with a frequency structure determined by the layout of the interferometers. The models will be used to interpret data from the reconfigured Fermilab Holometer, and for conceptual design of future experiments.
