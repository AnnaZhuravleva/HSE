For various reasons a number of authors have mooted an "exponential form" for the spacetime metric: \[ ds^2 = - e^{-2m/r} dt^2 + e^{+2m/r}\{dr^2 + r^2(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2)\}. \] While the weak-field behaviour matches nicely with weak-field general relativity, and so also automatically matches nicely with the Newtonian gravity limit, the strong-field behaviour is markedly different. Proponents of these exponential metrics have very much focussed on the absence of horizons --- it is certainly clear that this geometry does not represent a black hole. However, the proponents of these exponential metrics have failed to note that instead one is dealing with a traversable wormhole --- with all of the interesting and potentially problematic features that such an observation raises. If one wishes to replace all the black hole candidates astronomers have identified with traversable wormholes, then certainly a careful phenomenological analysis of this quite radical proposal should be carried out.
