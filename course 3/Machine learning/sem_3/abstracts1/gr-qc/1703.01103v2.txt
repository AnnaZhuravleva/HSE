We study a spherically symmetric spacetime made of anisotropic fluid of which radial equation of state is given by $p_1 = -\rho$. This provides analytic solutions and a good opportunity to study the static configuration of black hole plus matter. For a given equation-of-state parameter $w_2 = p_2/\rho$ for angular directions, we find exact solutions of the Einstein's equation described by two parameters. We classify the solution into six types based on the behavior of the metric function. Depending on the parameters, the solution can have event and cosmological horizons. Out of these, one type corresponds to a generalization of the Reissiner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, for which the thermodynamic properties are obtained in simple forms. The solutions are stable under radial perturbations.
