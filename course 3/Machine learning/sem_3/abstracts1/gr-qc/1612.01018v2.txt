In previous work we discussed the quantization of paths in spacetime. Building on these ideas we have developed a mathematically coherent theory addressing a number of open questions concerning Loop Quantum Gravity. Our approach develops a discrete spacetime and shows that macroscopic spacetime is a renormalization limiting form. Weaving together a number of our previous results we then prove that quantum states invariant under either an external group of local diffeomorphisms of spacetime or by contrast quantum states invariant under the internal action of a compact Lie group are common in a well-defined sense. These form the building blocks of invariant fields and Lagrangians. A form of supersymmetry and noncommutative spacetime naturally emerges, which predicts a massless graviton and its companion gravitino.
