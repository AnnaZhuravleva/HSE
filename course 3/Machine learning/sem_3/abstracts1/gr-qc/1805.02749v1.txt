An analogue model for the $\text{AdS}_2$ spacetime has been recently introduced by Mosna, Pitelli and Richartz [Phys. Rev. D 94, 104065 (2016)] by considering sound waves propagating on a fluid with an ill-defined velocity profile at its source/sink. The wave propagation is then uniquely defined only when one imposes an extra boundary condition at the source/sink (which corresponds to the spatial infinity of $\text{AdS}_2$). Here we show that, once this velocity profile is smoothed out at the source/sink, the need for extra boundary conditions disappears. This, in turn, corresponds to deformations of the $\text{AdS}_2$ spacetime near its spatial infinity. We also examine how this regularization of the velocity profile picks up a specific boundary condition for the idealized system, so that both models agree in the long wavelength limit.
