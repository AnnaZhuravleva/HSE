The self-conjugate Dirac Hamiltonian is obtained in the Kerr-Newman field. A transition is implemented to a Schr\"odinger-type relativistic equation. For the case where the angular and radial variables are not separated, the method of obtaining effective potentials is generalized. Effective potentials have isolated singularities on the event horizons as well as at certain parameters of the Kerr-Newman field and of the fermion in the neighborhoods of some values of the radial coordinate. For the extreme Kerr-Newman field, the impossibility of existence of stationary bound states of half-spin particles is proved.
