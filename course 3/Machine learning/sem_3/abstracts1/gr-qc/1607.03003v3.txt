Dark energy models and modified gravity theories have been actively studied and the behaviors in the solar system have been also carefully investigated in a part of the models. However, the isotropic solutions of the field equations in the simple models of dark energy, e.g. quintessence model without matter coupling, have not been well investigated. One of the reason would be the nonlinearity of the field equations. In this paper, a method to evaluate the solution of the field equations is constructed, and it is shown that there is a model that can easily pass the solar system tests, whereas, there is also a model that is constrained from the solar system tests.
