We discuss a special type of Skyrmion spacetime-defect solution, which has a positive energy density of the matter fields but a vanishing asymptotic gravitational mass. With a mass term for the matter field added to the action (corresponding to massive "pions" in the Skyrme model), this particular soliton-type solution has no long-range fields and can appropriately be called a "stealth defect."
