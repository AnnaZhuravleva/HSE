The possible emergence of compact stars has been investigated in the recently introduced modified Gauss-Bonnet $f(\mathcal{G},T)$ gravity, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet term and ${T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Specifically, for this modified $f(\mathcal{G}, T)$ theory, the analytic solutions of Krori and Barua have been applied to anisotropic matter distribution. To determine the unknown constants appearing in Krori and Barua metric, the well-known three models of the compact stars namely 4U1820-30, Her X-I, and SAX J 1808.4-3658 have been used. The analysis of the physical behavior of the compact stars has been presented and the physical features like energy density and pressure, energy conditions, static equilibrium, stability, measure of anisotropy, and regularity of the compact stars, have been discussed.
