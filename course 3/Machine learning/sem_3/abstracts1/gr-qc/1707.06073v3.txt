We present a new insight into the interpretation of the primordial spectrum of scalar particles density perturbations. On the assumption of spectrum universality, i.e., that the mean energy density and the typical value of inhomogeneity can be chosen arbitrarily in the framework of the model considered, the form of the spectrum becomes completely defined. It is close to the flat Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, but with the suppressed low-frequency modes.
