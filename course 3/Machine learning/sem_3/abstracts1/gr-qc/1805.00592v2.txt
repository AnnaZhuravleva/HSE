In the present article, we have constructed a static charged anisotropic compact star model of Einstein field equations for a spherically symmetric space-time geometry. Specifically, we have extended the charged isotropic Heintzmann solution to an anisotropic domain. To address this work, we have employed the gravitational decoupling through the so called minimal geometric deformation approach. The charged anisotropic model is representing the realistic compact objects such as $RXJ1856-37$ and $SAX J1808.4-3658(SS2)$. We have reported our results in details for the compact star $RXJ1856-37$ on the ground of physical properties such as pressure, density, velocity of sound, energy conditions, stability conditions, Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and redshift etc.
