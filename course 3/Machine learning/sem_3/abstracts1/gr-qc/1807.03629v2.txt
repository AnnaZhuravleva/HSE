In this paper, we consider a model of quintessential inflation based upon inverse hyperbolic potential. We employ curvaton mechanism for reheating which is more efficient than gravitational particle production; the mechanism complies with nucleosynthesis constraint due to relic gravity waves. We obtain a lower bound on the coupling constant $g$ that governs the interaction of curvaton with matter fields. We study curvaton decay before domination and decay after domination and plot the allowed region in the parameter space in both cases.
