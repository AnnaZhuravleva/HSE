The standard spinor connection in curved space-time is represented in a compact form. In this form the calculation is complicated, and its physical effects are concealed. In this paper, we split spinor connection into two vectors $\Upsilon_\mu$ and $\Omega_\mu$, where $\Upsilon_\mu$ is only related to geometrical calculations, but $\Omega_\mu$ leads to dynamical effects, which couples with the spin of a spinor. The representation depends only on metric but is independent of Dirac matrices, so it is valid for both Weyl spinors and Dirac spinor. In the new form, we can clearly define classical concepts for a spinor and then derive its complete classical dynamics. By detailed calculation we find the classical approximation is just Newtonian second law. The dynamical connection $\Omega_\mu$ couples with the spin of a particle with a tiny energy in weak field, which provides location and navigation functions for a spinor. This term may be also important to form magnetic field of a celestial star. From the results, we find the spinor has marvelous structure and wonderful property, and the interaction between spinor and gravity is subtle. This study may be also helpful to clarify the relations between relativity, quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.
