We consider the variational principle in the covariant formulation of modified teleparallel theories with second order field equations. We vary the action with respect to the spin connection and obtain a consistency condition relating the spin connection with the tetrad. We argue that since the spin connection can be calculated using an additional reference tetrad, modified teleparallel theories can be interpreted as effectively bigravity theories. We conclude with discussion about the relation of our results and those obtained in the usual, non-covariant, formulation of teleparallel theories and present the solution to the problem of choosing the tetrad in $f(T)$ gravity theories.
