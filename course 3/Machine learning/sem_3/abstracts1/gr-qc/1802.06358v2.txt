The authors of Ref. \cite{1-2}, investigated cosmic evolution in an external interacting model of scalar tensor gravity namely Brans Dicke chameleon scenario. The procedure of this work contains novelties but, it shall be observed from this comment, their report faces three fundamental drawbacks. One of them concerns the energy conservation equation, and the other two flaws are about mathematical mistakes. In the scalar tensor gravity models, a well-known method, in order to obtain conservation equation one must combine Friedmann equations with modified Klein-Gordon equation. But in Ref. \cite{1-2}, by virtue of the mentioned approach one would not be able to achieve a correct result for conservation equation. In addition, one can readily realize that their mathematical mistakes lead to different results compared to the present report.
