We present the quantum model of the asymptotic dynamics underlying the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario. The symmetry of the physical phase space enables making use of the affine coherent states quantization. Our results show that quantum dynamics is regular in the sense that during quantum evolution the expectation values of all considered observables are finite. The classical singularity of the BKL scenario is replaced by the quantum bounce that presents a unitary evolution of considered gravitational system. Our results suggest that quantum general relativity is free from singularities.
