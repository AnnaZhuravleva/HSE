In the de Sitter ambient space formalism the massless fields, which include the linear gravity and massless minimally coupled scalar field, can be written in terms of two separate parts: a massless conformally coupled scalar field and a polarization tensor(-spinor) part. Therefore due to the massless conformally coupled scalar field, there exist an unique Bunch-Davies vacuum state for quantum field theory in the de Sitter space time. In the de Sitter ambient space formalism one can show that the massless fields with spin $s\geq 1$ are gauge invariant. By coupling the massless gauge spin-$2$ and the massless gauge spin-$3/2$ fields and using the super-symmetry algebra in de Sitter ambient space formalism, one can naturally construct a unitary de Sitter super-gravity on Bunch-Davies vacuum state.
