In this paper, new solutions for locally rotational symmetric (LRS) space-times are obtained, by means of a specific twofold procedure and within a particular setting. More concretely, at the one hand the background geometry is realized as an extended version of either the Kantowski-Sachs (KS), LRS Bianchi type I (BT1) and Bianchi type III (BT3). New exact solutions are retrieved, associated to Brans-Dicke (BD) field equations, in the absence of ordinary matter, in a five-dimensional ($5D$) space-time. These $5D$ solutions are thoroughly analysed, in particular depicting the behavior of the BD coupling parameter. This constitutes a central step, through which relevant quantities are computed, necessary for the herein employed innovative procedure, as elaborated in the following. In more detail, at the other hand the modified Brans-Dicke theory (MBDT) framework~\cite{RFM14} is applied to construct the corresponding dynamics onto a suitable $4D$ hypersurface. More concretely, by employing the MBDT setting, the components of the effective energy-momentum tensor (EMT), the induced scalar potential and other physical quantities are obtained. For the BT1 case, there are two interesting classes, the power-law and exponential-law solutions, respectively.Concerning the former, only the specific solutions which have not yet been studied elsewhere in the context of the MBDT framework are investigated. However, since the latter is completely new, these solutions are therefore studied in greater detail. Interesting particular behaviours associated to specific values of the equation of state (EoS) parameter as well as the BD coupling parameter, are mentioned and discussed. Moreover, the herewith novel results are contrasted with those obtained in conventional theories and also discussed concerning current observational consequences.
