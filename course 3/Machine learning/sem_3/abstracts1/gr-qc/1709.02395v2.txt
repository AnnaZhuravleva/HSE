For asymptotically flat spacetimes the Penrose inequality gives an initial data test for the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis. We give a formulation of this inequality for asymptotically anti-deSitter (AAdS) spacetimes, and show that the inequality holds for time asymmetric data in spherical symmetry. Our analysis is motivated by the constant-negative-spatial-curvature form of the AdS black hole metric.
