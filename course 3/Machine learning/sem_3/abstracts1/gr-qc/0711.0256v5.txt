We consider the recently estimated corrections \Delta\dot\varpi to the Newtonian/Einsteinian secular precessions of the longitudes of perihelia \varpi of several planets of the Solar System in order to evaluate whether they are compatible with the predicted precessions due to models of long-range modified gravity put forth to account for certain features of the rotation curves of galaxies without resorting to dark matter. In particular, we consider a logarithmic-type correction and a f(R) inspired power-law modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential. The results obtained by taking the ratio of the apsidal rates for different pairs of planets show that the modifications of the Newtonian potentials examined in this paper are not compatible with the secular extra-precessions of the perihelia of the Solar System's planets estimated by E.V. Pitjeva as solve-for parameters processing almost one century of data with the latest EPM ephemerides.
