A model of phantom scalar field dark energy under exponential potential coupling to barotropic dark matter fluid in loop quantum cosmology is addressed here. We derive a closed-autonomous system for cosmological dynamics in this scenario. The expansion in loop quantum universe has a bounce even in presence of the phantom field. The greater decaying from dark matter to dark phantom energy results in greater energy storing in the phantom field. This results in further turning point of the field. Greater coupling also delays bouncing time. In the case of phantom decaying, oscillation in phantom density makes small oscillation in the increasing matter density.
