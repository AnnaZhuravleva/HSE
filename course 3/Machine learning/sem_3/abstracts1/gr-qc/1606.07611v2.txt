We show how the equations for the scalar field (including the massive, massless, minimally and conformally coupled cases) on de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spaces can be obtained from both the SO$(2,4)$-invariant equation $\square \phi = 0$ in $\mathbb{R}^6$ and two geometrical constraints defining the (A)dS space. Apart from the equation in $\mathbb{R}^6$, the results only follow from the geometry. We also show how an interaction term in (A)dS space can be taken into account from $\mathbb{R}^6$.
