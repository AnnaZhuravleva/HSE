We study 4-dimensional non-charged and charged spherically symmetric spacetimes in conformal teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. We apply the gravitational field equations in non-charged and charged spacetimes to the diagonal and non-diagonal vierbeins and derive their sets of the non-linear differential equations. It is demonstrated that the Schwarzschild, for the non-charged case, and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om, for the charged case, are the only black hole solutions for the spherically symmetric case in the framework of the conformal teleparallel equivalent of general relativity theory. As a result, it is found that in the conformal teleparallel equivalent of general relativity theory, the scalar field cannot have any effect for the spherically symmetric manifold.
