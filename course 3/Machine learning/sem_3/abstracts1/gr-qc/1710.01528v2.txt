The global time is defined in covariant form under the condition of a constant mean curvature slicing of spacetime. The background static metric is taken in the tangent space. The global intrinsic time is identified with the logarithmic function of the mean value of the ratio of the square root of the metric determinants. The procedures of the Hamiltonian reduction and deparametrization of dynamical systems are implemented. The Hamiltonian system appears to be non-conservative. The Hamiltonian equations of motion of gravitational field in the global time are written.
