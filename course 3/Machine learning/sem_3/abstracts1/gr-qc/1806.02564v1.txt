In this talk, we discuss the polarization contents of Einstein-\ae ther theory and the generalized tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) theory. There are five polarizations in Einstein-\ae ther theory and six polarizations in the generalized TeVeS theory. In particular, the transverse breathing mode is mixed with the pure longitudinal mode. We also discuss the experimental tests of the extra polarizations in Einstein-\ae ther theory using pulsar timing arrays. It turns out that it might be difficult to use pulsar timing arrays to distinguish different polarizations in Einstein-\ae ther theory. The gravitational wave speed bound from GW170817 also forces one of the propagating modes in the generalized TeVeS theory to travel much faster than the speed of light. Since the strong coupling problem does not exist in some parameter subspaces, the generalized TeVeS theory is excluded in these parameter subspaces.
