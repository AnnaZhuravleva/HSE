It is well known that the viscous Bianchi type-I metric of the Kasner form is not able to describe an anisotropic universe, which satisfies the second law of thermodynamics and the dominant energy condition in Einstein's theory of gravity. We investigate this problem in Brans-Dicke theory of gravity using the Bianchi type-I metric with the perfect fluid. We show that it is possible to have the dominant energy condition and the growth of entropy in this model. Also we apply this model to explain the anomaly concerning the low quadrupole amplitude of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy observed in WMAP data.
