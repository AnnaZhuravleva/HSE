We explore the homogeneous background dynamics and the evolution of generated perturbations of cosmological inflation that is driven by multiple scalar fields interacting with a perfect fluid.Then we apply the method to warm inflation driven by two scalar fields and a radiation fluid, and present general results about the evolution of the inflaton and radiation. After decomposing the perturbations into adiabatic and entropy modes, we give the equation of motion of adiabatic and entropy perturbations on large scales. Then, we give numerical results of background and perturbation equations in a concrete model (the dissipative coefficient $\Gamma \propto H$). At last, we use the most recent observational data to constrain our models and give the observationally allowed regions of parameters. This work is a natural extension of warm inflation to multi-field cases.
