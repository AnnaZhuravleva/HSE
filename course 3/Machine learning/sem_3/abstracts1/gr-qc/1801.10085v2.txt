In the context of extended Teleparallel gravity theories with a 3+1 dimensions Gauss-Bonnet analog term, we address the possibility of these theories reproducing several well-known cosmological bouncing scenarios in a four-dimensional Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker geometry. We shall study which types of gravitational Lagrangians are capable of reconstructing bouncing solutions provided by analytical expressions for symmetric, oscillatory, superbounce, the matter bounce and singular bounce. Some of the Lagrangians discovered are both analytical at the origin having Minkowski and Schwarzschild as vacuum solutions. All these results open the possibility up for such theories to be competitive candidates of extended theories of gravity in cosmological scales.
