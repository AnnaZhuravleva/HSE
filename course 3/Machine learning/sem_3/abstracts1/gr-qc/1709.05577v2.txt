In this paper we construct new solutions of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet field equations in an isotropic Shiromizu-Maeda-Sasaki brane-world setting which represent a couple of $Z_2$-symmetric vacuum thin shells splitting from the central brane, and explore the main properties of the dynamics of the system. The matching of the separating vacuum shells with the brane-world is as smooth as possible and all matter fields are restricted to the brane. We prove the existence of these solutions, derive the criteria for their existence, analyse some fundamental aspects or their evolution and demonstrate the possibility of constructing cosmological examples that exhibit this feature at early times. We also comment on the possible implications for cosmology and the relation of this system with the thermodynamic instability of highly symmetric vacuum solutions of Lovelock theory.
