In a recent work, we have demonstrated that the two-measures model in which one modifies gravity so that a scalar field is coupled to both standard Riemannian metric and to another non-Riemannian volume form is compatible with observational data from Supernovae type Ia.   As a continuation of this work, in current article we numerically investigate the influence of an additional inflaton scalar field with a step like effective potential. We succeeded to reproduce the Universe inflation epoch, matter dominated epoch and present accelerating expansion in a seamless way. An interesting feature is that during the evolution the inflaton field undergoes a finite change.
