A canonical quantization \`a la Wheeler-DeWitt is performed for a model of three-form fields in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. We start by carrying out the Hamiltonian formalism of this cosmological model. We then apply this formalism to a Little Sibling of the Big Rip (LSBR), an abrupt event milder than a Big Rip and that is known to be generic to several minimally coupled three-form fields for a variety of potentials. We obtain a set of analytical solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation using different analytical approximations and explore the physical consequences of them. It turns out that there are quantum states where the wave function of the universe vanishes, i.e. the DeWitt condition is fulfilled for them. Given that this happens only for some subset of solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, this points out that the matter inducing the LSBR is equally important in the process as, it has been previously shown, a minimally coupled phantom scalar field feeding classically a LSBR is smoothed at the quantum level, i.e. all the quantum states lead to a vanishing wave function.
