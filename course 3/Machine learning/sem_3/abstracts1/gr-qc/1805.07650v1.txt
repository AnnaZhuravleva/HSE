We consider a particle moving towards a rotating black hole. The number of revolution $n$ is studied using the coordinate frame regular near the horizon. It turns out that $n$ coincides with that obtained in our previous work by the subtraction procedure $n_{1}-n_{2}$ where 1 is an original particle and 2 is some reference one. Meanwhile, the present results for $n$ can differ from those obtained with the help of other subtraction procedures (such as measurements with respect to the horizon of a rotating black hole or motion of a non-geodesic particle). For a nonextremal black hole, regularity of a coordinate frame leads to finiteness of a number of revolutions around a black hole. The regular frames we use can be considered as generalization of the Kerr coordinates known for the Kerr metric. The transformation under discussion ensure simultaneously the regularity of the metric and finiteness of $n$ for particles (apart from some exceptional cases).
