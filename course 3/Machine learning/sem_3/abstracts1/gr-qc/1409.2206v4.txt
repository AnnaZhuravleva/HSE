We make comparison of the dynamics of the diagonal and nondiagonal Bianchi IX models in the evolution towards the cosmological singularity. Apart from the original variables, we use the Hubble normalized ones commonly applied in the examination of the dynamics of homogeneous models. Applying the dynamical systems method leads to the result that in both cases the continuous space of critical points is higher dimensional and they are of the nonhyperbolic type. This is a generic feature of the dynamics of both cases and seems to be independent on the choice of phase space variables. The topologies of the corresponding critical spaces are quite different. We conjecture that the nondiagonal case may carry a new type of chaos different from the one specific to the usually examined diagonal one.
