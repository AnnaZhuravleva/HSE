We prove the renormalizability of a gauge-invariant, four-dimensional GFT model on SU(2), whose defining interactions correspond to necklace bubbles (found also in the context of new large-N expansions of tensor models), rather than melonic ones, which are not renormalizable in this case. The respective scaling of different interactions in the vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point is determined by the renormalization group itself. This is possible because the appropriate notion of canonical dimension of the GFT coupling constants takes into account the detailed combinatorial structure of the individual interaction terms. This is one more instance of the peculiarity (and greater mathematical richness) of GFTs with respect to ordinary local quantum field theories. We also explore the renormalization group flow of the model at the non-perturbative level, using functional renormalization group methods, and identify a non-trivial fixed point in various truncations. This model is expected to have a similar structure of divergences as the GFT models of 4d quantum gravity, thus paving the way to more detailed investigations on them.
