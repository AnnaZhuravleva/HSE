Proca stars, $\textit{aka}$ vector boson stars, are self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates obtained as numerical stationary solutions of the Einstein-(complex)-Proca system. These solitonic objects can achieve a compactness comparable to that of black holes, thus yielding an example of a black hole mimicker, which, moreover, can be both stable and form dynamically from generic initial data by the mechanism of gravitational cooling. In this paper we further explore the dynamical properties of these solitonic objects by performing head-on collisions of equal mass Proca stars, using fully non-linear numerical evolutions. We show that the end point and the gravitational waveform from these collisions depends on the compactness of the Proca star. Proca stars with sufficiently small compactness collide emitting gravitational radiation and leaving a stable Proca star remnant. But more compact Proca stars collide to form a transient ${\it hypermassive}$ Proca star, which ends up decaying into a black hole, albeit temporarily surrounded by Proca quasi-bound states. The unstable intermediate stage can leave an imprint in the waveform, making it distinct from that of a head-on collision of black holes. The final quasi-normal ringing matches that of Schwarzschild black hole, even though small deviations may occur, as a signature of sufficiently non-linear and long-lived Proca quasi-bound states.
