We study a class of limits of the higher-dimensional Kerr-NUT-(A)dS spacetimes where particular roots of metric functions degenerate. Namely, we obtain the Taub-NUT-(A)dS and the extreme near-horizon geometries as two examples of our limiting procedure. The symmetries of the resulting spacetimes are enhanced which is manifested by the presence of supplementary Killing vectors and decomposition of Killing tensors into Killing vectors.
