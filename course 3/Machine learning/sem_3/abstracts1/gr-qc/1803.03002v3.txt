We study the hydrodynamics of bubble expansion in cosmological first-order phase transition in the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background with probe limit. Different from previous studies for fast first-order phase transition in flat background, we find that, for slow first-order phase transition in FLRW background with a given peculiar velocity of the bubble wall, the efficiency factor of energy transfer into bulk motion of thermal fluid is significantly reduced, thus decreasing the previously-thought dominated contribution from sound wave to the stochastic gravitational-wave background.
