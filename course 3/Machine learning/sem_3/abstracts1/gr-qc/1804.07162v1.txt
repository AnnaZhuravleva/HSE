The value of the cosmological constant is explained in terms of a noisy diffusion of energy from the low energy particle physics degrees of freedom to the fundamental Planckian granularity which is expected from general arguments in quantum gravity. The quantitative success of our phenomenological model is encouraging and provides possibly useful insights about physics at the scale of quantum gravity.
