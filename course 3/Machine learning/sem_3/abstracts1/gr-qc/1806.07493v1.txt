The possibility that the vacuum energy density, described by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in standard model of cosmology, is, indeed, varying in time, has been deeply investigated lately within the so-called running vacuum models. Motivated by such models, in the present letter, we relate the decaying vacuum energy $\rho_\Lambda(t)$ with a quintessence-like scalar field $\phi$. We derive the equations of motion from such a premise and implement the first-order formalism in order to obtain analytical solutions to the cosmological parameters. We show that those are in agreement with recent Planck observational data on the cosmic microwave background radiation. We carefully discuss the physical consequences of having the decaying vacuum energy related to quintessence.
