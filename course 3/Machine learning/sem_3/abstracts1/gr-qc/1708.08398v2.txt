We derive the solution for a spherically symmetric string cloud configuration in a d-dimensional spacetime in the framework of f(R) theories of gravity. We also analyze some thermodynamic properties of the joint black hole - cloud of strings solution. For its Hawking temperature, we found that the dependence of the mass with the horizon is significantly different in both theories. For the interaction of a black hole with thermal radiation, we found that the shapes of the curves are similar, but shifted. Our analysis generalizes some known results in the literature.
