We study static massive scalar field condensations in the regular asymptotically flat reflecting star background. We impose Neuman reflecting surface boundary conditions for the scalar field. We show that the no hair theorem holds in the neutral reflecting star background. For charged reflecting stars, we provide bounds for radii of hairy reflecting stars. Below the bottom bound, there is no regular compact reflecting star and a black hole will form. Above the upper bound, the scalar field cannot condense around the reflecting star or no hair theorems exist. And among the bounds, we obtain scalar configurations supported by Neuman reflecting stars.
