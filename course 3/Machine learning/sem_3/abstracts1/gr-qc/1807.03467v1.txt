We extend the definition of the entangled partner mode of an arbitrary mode of a scalar quantum field in a general state. Even in the case of a free field in a Gaussian state, this provides a new class of partner named spatially overlapped partner. A general formula of spatially overlapped partners is given for a free field in a $(d+1)$-dimensional curved spacetime. We analyze memory effects of the spatially entangled partner systems of a quantum field as quantum information storage for an expanding universe.
