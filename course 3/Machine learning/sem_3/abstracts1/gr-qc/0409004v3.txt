Astrophysical bounds on the cosmological constant are examined for spherically symmetric bodies. Similar limits emerge from hydrostatical and gravitational equilibrium and the validity of the Newtonian limit. It is argued that the bound coming from the analysis of exact solutions is not a feature of the relativistic theory since it also emerges from the Newtonian theory.   The methods in use seem to be disjoint from the basic principles, however they have the same implication regarding the upper bounds. Therefore we will compare different inequalities and comment on the possible relationship between them.
