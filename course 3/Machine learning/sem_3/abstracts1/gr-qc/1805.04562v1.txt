The notion of black-hole entropy was introduced by Jacob Bekenstein in 1972. During past 45 years this subject was in the center of interests of the modern theoretical physics. In this paper we briefly discuss "puzzles" of the black-hole physics, connected with their entropy. We also demonstrate that when the standard energy conditions are violated entropy associated with the event horizon can have quite unexpected behavior.
