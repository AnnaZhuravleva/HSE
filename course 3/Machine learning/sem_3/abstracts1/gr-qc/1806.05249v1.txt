We study the shadows cast by near-extremal Kerr-MOG black holes for different values of the parameter in modified gravity (MOG). In particular, we consider an isotropic emitter orbiting near such black holes and analytically compute the positions, fluxes and redshift factors of their images. The size of the shadow decreases when the modified parameter is increased. For each shadow, the images of the emitter appear on a special part of the shadow which has a rich structure. The primary image and secondary images are similar to those produced for the near-extremal (high spin) Kerr black hole, but the near-extremal Kerr-MOG black hole can have a spin ($\hat{J}/M^2_{\alpha}$) which is finitely lower than 1. When the modified parameter is varied, the typical positions of the corresponding images do not change, nor does the typical redshift factor associated with the primary image. However, another typical redshift factor associated with the secondary image increases when the modified parameter is increased. We also find that the fluxes increase in that case. These images appear periodically with period greater than that of Kerr. This provides an alternative signature away from the Kerr case which may be tested by the Event Horizon Telescope.
