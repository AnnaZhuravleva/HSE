The deflection angle of Kerr-MOG black holes for different values of the parameter in modified gravity (MOG) is studied. To do so, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, first studied by Gibbons and Werner and then extended by Ono, Ishihara and Asada, who use a generalized optical metric where the deflection of light for an observer and source at finite distance. By using this method, we study the weak gravitational lensing by Kerr-MOG black hole. These studies show that deflection angle significantly greater than that of Kerr with the increasing the parameter of MOG $\alpha$, that provides a possible difference in lensing experiments.
