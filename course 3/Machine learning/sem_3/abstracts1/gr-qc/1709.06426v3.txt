In this paper, we study Joule-Thomson expansion for Kerr-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. Joule-Thomson expansion formula of Kerr-AdS black holes is derived. We investigate both isenthalpic and numerical inversion curves in the T-P plane and demonstrate the cooling-heating regions for Kerr-AdS black holes. We also calculate the ratio between minimum inversion and critical temperatures for Kerr-AdS black holes.
