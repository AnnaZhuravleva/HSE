A duality transformation that interrelates expanding and contracting cosmological models is shown to single out a duality invariant, interacting two-component description of any irrotational, geodesic and shearfree cosmic medium with vanishing three curvature scalar. We apply this feature to a system of matter and radiation, to a mixture of dark matter and dark energy, to minimal and conformal scalar fields, and to an enlarged Chaplygin gas model of the cosmic substratum. We extend the concept of duality transformations to cosmological perturbations and demonstrate the invariance of adiabatic pressure perturbations under these transformations.
