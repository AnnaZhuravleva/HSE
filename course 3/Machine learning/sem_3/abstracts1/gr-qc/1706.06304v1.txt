In the multiverse, the universes can be created in entangled pairs with spacetimes that are both expanding in terms of the time variables experienced by internal observers in their particle physics experiments. The time variables of the two universes are related by an antipodal-like symmetry that might explain why there is no antimatter in our universe: at the origin, antimatter is created, by definition and for any observer, in the observer's partner universe. The Euclidean region of the spacetime that separates the two universes acts as a quantum barrier that prevents matter-antimatter from collapse.
