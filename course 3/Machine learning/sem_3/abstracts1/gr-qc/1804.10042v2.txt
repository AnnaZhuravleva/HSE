In this paper, we study Joule-Thomson effects for charged AdS black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain the inversion temperatures as well as inversion curves, and investigate similarities and differences between van der Waals fluids and charged AdS black holes in $f(R)$ gravity for this expansion. In addition, we determine the position of the inversion point versus different values of the mass $M$, the charge $Q$ and the parameter $b$ for such black hole. At this point, the Joule-Thomson coefficient $\mu$ vanishes, an import feature that we used to obtain the cooling-heating regions by scrutinizing the sign of the $\mu$ quantity.
