We consider the kinematics of specific fluid spacetimes admitting timelike congruences of Ricci Solitons. These fluids includes string cloud, string fluid, perfect fluid, radially symmetric fluid, anisotropic fluid and relativistic magneto-fluid. Results are obtained and important physical aspects are discussed.
