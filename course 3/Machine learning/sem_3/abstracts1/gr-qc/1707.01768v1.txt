We argue certain nonviolent local quantum field theory (LQFT) modification considered at the global horizon ($r=2M$) of a static spherically-symmetric black hole can lead to adiabatic leakage of quantum information in the form of Hawking particles. The source of the modification is (i) smooth at $r=2M$ and (ii) rapidly vanishing at $r\gg2M$. Furthermore, we restore the unitary evolution by introducing extra quanta which departs slightly from the generic Hawking emission without changing the experience of an infalling observer (no drama). Also, we suggest that a possible interpretation of the Bekenstein-Hawking bound as entanglement entropy may yield a nonsingular dynamical horizon behavior described by black hole thermodynamics. Hence by treating gravity as a field theory, and considering its coupling to the matter fields in the Minkowski vacuum, we derive the conjectured fluctuations of the background geometry of a black hole.
