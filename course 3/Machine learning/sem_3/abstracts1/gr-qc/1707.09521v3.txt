Higher dimensional theories admit astrophysical objects like supermassive black holes, which are rather different from standard ones, and their gravitational lensing features deviate from general relativity. It is well known that a black hole shadow is a dark region due to the falling geodesics of photons into the black hole and, if detected, a black hole shadow could be used to determine which theory of gravity is consistent with observations. Measurements of the shadow sizes around the black holes can help to evaluate various parameters of the black hole metric. We study the shapes of the shadow cast by the rotating five-dimensional charged Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons (EMCS) black holes, which is characterized by the four parameters, i.e., mass, two spins, and charge, in which the spin parameters are set equal. We integrate the null geodesic equations and derive an analytical formula for the shadow of the five-dimensional EMCS black hole, in turn, to show that size of black hole shadow is affected due to charge as well as spin. The shadow is a dark zone covered by a deformed circle, and the size of the shadow decreases with an increase in the charge $q$ when compared with the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. Interestingly, the distortion increases with charge $q$. The effect of these parameters on the shape and size of the naked singularity shadow of five-dimensional EMCS black hole is also discussed.
