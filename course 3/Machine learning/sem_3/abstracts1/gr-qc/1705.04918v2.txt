We linearly perturb advective isothermal transonic accretion onto rotating astrophysical black holes to study the emergence of the relativistic acoustic spacetime and to investigate how the salient features of such spacetime get influenced by the spin angular momentum of the black hole. We have perturbed three different quantities - the velocity potential, the mass accretion rate and the relativistic Bernoulli's constant to show that the acoustic metric obtained for these three cases are same up to a conformal factor. By constructing the required causal structures, it has been demonstrated that the acoustic black holes are formed at the transonic points of the flow and acoustic white holes are formed at the shock location. The corresponding acoustic surface gravity has been computed in terms of the relevant accretion variables and the background metric elements. The linear stability analysis of the background stationary flow has been performed.
