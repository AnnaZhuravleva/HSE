Stochastic gravitational waves generated from early universe are placed in the squeezed vacuum state. The quantum effect on the stochastic gravitational waves leads to enhancement of its spectral amplitude in the long wavelength regime and oscillatory behaviour at higher frequency side of the spectrum in the accelerating universe. The results of the present study may be found useful to test whether the stochastic gravitational waves generated in early universe exist in the squeezed vacuum state
