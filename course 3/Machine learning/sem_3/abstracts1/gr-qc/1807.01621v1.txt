We investigate particle collisions in non-extremal black hole that can probably induced to extremely high center of mass energy $E_{cm}$. We consider the collision of two particles where first particle comes from far to the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole horizon and second particle emanates from the white hole region. It is exhibited that unbounded $E_{\text{cm}}$ require that second particle lapse near the bifurcation point. We discuss the collision of particles close to the horizon in detail.
