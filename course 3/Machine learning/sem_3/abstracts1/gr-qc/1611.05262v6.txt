We present the analyses of the asymptotic evolution of the general Bianchi IX spacetime using Hamiltonian formulation. The dynamics reveals the existence of special structures, which we call wiggles, in the physical phase space. The wiggles are different from the spikes known in the context of evolution of some spacetime models towards gravitational singularities. Our results may be used as starting point in the examination of wiggles at the quantum level.
