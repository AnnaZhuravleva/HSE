We introduce a dynamical mechanism which works with expansion of the Universe during inflation to reduce a large cosmological constant to a sufficiently small value consistent with the observational upper limit. The basic ingredient in this mechanism is that the two metrics characterizing the gravitational coupling of the inflaton and the background geometry are not the same but conformally related. In this analysis the Universe experiences a power-law inflation at early times when a power-law potential is attributed to the inflaton. We argue that there is no the graceful exit problem in this scenario and that it is not in tension with observations. In particular, we show that the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the primordial tilt are in complete agreement with recent observations of the Planck satellite.
