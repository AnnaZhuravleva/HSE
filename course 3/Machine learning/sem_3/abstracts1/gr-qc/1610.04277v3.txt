Rainbow metrics are a widely used approach to metric formalism for theories with Modified Dispersion Relations. They have had a huge success in the Quantum Gravity Phenomenology literature, since they allow to introduce momentum-dependent spacetime metrics into the description of systems with Modified Dispersion Relation. In this paper, we introduce the reader to some realizations of this general idea: the original Rainbow metrics proposal, the momentum-space-inspired metric, the standard Finsler geometry approach and our alternative definition of a four-velocity-dependent metric with a massless limit. This paper aims to highlight some of their properties and how to properly describe their relativistic realizations.
