We study the system of static scalar fields coupled to charged compact reflecting stars through both analytical and numerical methods. We enclose the star in a box and our solutions are related to cases without box boundaries when putting the box far away from the star. We provide bottom and upper bounds for the radius of the scalar hairy compact reflecting star. We obtain numerical scalar hairy star solutions satisfying boundary conditions and find that the radius of the hairy star in a box is continuous in a range, which is very different from cases without box boundaries where the radius is discrete in the range. We also examine effects of the star charge and mass on the largest radius.
