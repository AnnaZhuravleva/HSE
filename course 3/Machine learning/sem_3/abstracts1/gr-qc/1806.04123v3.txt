In this article we study the hydrostatic equilibrium configuration of neutron stars (NSs) and strange stars (SSs), whose fluid pressure is computed from the equations of state $p=\omega\rho^{5/3}$ and $p=0.28(\rho-4{\cal B})$, respectively, with $\omega$ and ${\cal B}$ being constants and $\rho$ the energy density of the fluid. We also study white dwarfs (WDs) equilibrium configurations. We start by deriving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, with $R$ and $T$ standing for the Ricci scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. Such an equation is a generalization of the one obtained from general relativity, and the latter can be retrieved for a certain limit of the theory. For the $f(R,T)=R+2\lambda T$ functional form, with $\lambda$ being a constant, we find that some physical properties of the stars, such as pressure, energy density, mass and radius, are affected when $\lambda$ is changed. We show that for some particular values of the constant $\lambda$, some observed objects that are not predicted by General Relativity theory of gravity can be attained. Moreover, since gravitational fields are smaller for WDs than for NSs or SSs, the scale parameter $\lambda$ used for WDs is small when compared to the values used for NSs and SSs.
