The physical properties of static analytic solutions which describe black brane geometries are discussed. In particular we study the similarities and differences of analytic black brane/string solutions in the Einstein and Jordan frames. The comparison is made between vacuum power law $f(R)$ gravity solutions and their conformal equivalents in the Einstein frame. In our analysis we examine how the geometrical and physical properties of these analytic axisymmetric solutions - such as singularities, the temperature and the entropy - are affected as we pass from one frame to the other.
