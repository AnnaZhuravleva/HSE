In the current work we investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the field of gravitational waves. Starting with simple case of an electromagnetic wave travelling in the field of a plane monochromatic gravitational wave we introduce the concept of surfing effect and analyze its physical consequences. We then generalize these results to an arbitrary gravitational wave field. We show that, due to the transverse nature of gravitational waves, the surfing effect leads to significant observable consequences only if the velocity of gravitational waves deviates from speed of light. This fact can help to place an upper limit on the deviation of gravitational wave velocity from speed of light. The micro-arcsecond resolution promised by the upcoming precision interferometry experiments allow to place stringent upper limits on $\epsilon = (v_{gw}-c)/c$ as a function of the energy density parameter for gravitational waves $\Omega_{gw}$. For $\Omega_{gw} \approx 10^{-10}$ this limit amounts to $\epsilon\lesssim 2\cdot 10^{-2}$.
