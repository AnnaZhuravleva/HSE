With laser interferometers, LIGO-Virgo collaboration has recently realized the direct detections of the intermediate-frequency (i.e., from dozens to hundreds of Hertz) gravitational waves (GWs) by probing their mechanically-tidal responses. Alternatively, in this letter we propose a feasible approach to actively search for the high-frequency GWs by probing their electromagnetic responses (EMRs) in a high alternating magnetic field.   Differing from the original Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich configuration (in which the EMRs are proportional to the square of the amplitudes of the GWs, and consequently are too weak to be detected experimentally), the EMRs of the GWs passing through the present configuration are linearly related to the amplitudes of the GWs and thus the relevant signals are detectable with the current weak-light detection technique.   As the wave impedances of the GWs-induced electromagnetic signals (EMSs) are very different from those the EM radiations in flat space-time, i.e, ($\cong 377 \Omega$), the stronger background noises (without any GWs information) could be effectively filtered out by using wave-matching technique.   Given the frequency of the applied alternating magnetic field is conveniently adjustable, the configuration proposed here could be utilized to actively search for the GWs (if they really exist) in a sufficiently-wide frequency band (e.g., could be $10^7-10^{12}$Hz), once the scale of the cavity and the sweeping frequency of the applied alternating magnetic field are experimentally achievable.
