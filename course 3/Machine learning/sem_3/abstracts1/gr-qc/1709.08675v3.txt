We introduce a new regularization scheme for Quantum Cosmology in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) using the tools of Quantum Reduced Loop Gravity (QRLG). It is obtained considering density matrices for superposition of graphs based on statistical countings of microstates compatible with macroscopic configurations. We call this procedure statistical regularization scheme. In particular, we show how the $\mu_0$ and $\bar{\mu}$ schemes introduced in Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) emerge with specific choices of density matrices. Within this new scheme we compute effective Hamiltonians suitable to describe quantum corrected Friedmann and Bianchi I universes and their leading orders coincide with the corresponding effective LQC Hamiltonians in the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme. We compute the next to the leading orders corrections and numerical investigation of the resulting dynamics shows evidence for the emergent-bouncing universe scenario to be a general property of the isotropic sector of QRLG.
