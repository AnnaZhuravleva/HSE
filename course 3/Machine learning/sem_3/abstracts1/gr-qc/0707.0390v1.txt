The role of non-inertial frames in a class of models of general relativity is clarified by means of Dirac's theory of constraints. The identification of a York canonical basis allows to give the interpretation of the gauge variables as generalized inertial effects and to identify the Dirac observables of the gravitational field with generalized tidal effects. York time is the gauge variable controlling the clock synchronization convention. Differently from special relativity, the instantaneous 3-spaces are dynamically determined.
