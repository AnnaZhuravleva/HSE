The Bronnikov model of nonlinear electrodynamics is investigated in general relativity. The magnetic black hole is considered and we obtain a solution giving corrections to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solution. In this model spacetime at $r\rightarrow\infty$ becomes Minkowski's spacetime. We calculate the magnetic mass of the black hole and the metric function. At some parameters of the model there can be one, two or no horizons. The Hawking temperature and the heat capacity of black holes are calculated. We show that a second-order phase transition takes place and black holes are thermodynamically stable at some range of parameters.
