We study the motion of massless test particles in a five dimensional (5D) Myers-Perry black hole spacetime with two spin parameters. The behaviour of the effective potential in view of different values of black hole parameters is discussed in the equatorial plane. The frequency shift of photons is calculated which is found to depend on the spin parameter of black hole and the observed redshift is discussed accordingly. The deflection angle and the strong deflection limit coefficients are also calculated and their behaviour with the spin parameters is analysed in detail. It is observed that the behaviour of both deflection angle and strong field coefficient differs from Kerr black hole spacetime in four dimensions (4D) in General Relativity (GR) which is mainly due to the presence of two spin parameters in higher dimension.
