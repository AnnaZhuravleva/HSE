The paper deals with a non--minimally coupled scalar field in the background of homogeneous but anisotropic Kantowski--Sachs space--time model. The form of the coupling function of the scalar field with gravity and the potential function of the scalar field are not assumed phenomenologically, rather they are evaluated by imposing Noether symmetry to the Lagrangian of the present physical system. The physical system gets considerable mathematical simplification by a suitable transformation of the augmented variables $(a, b, \phi)\rightarrow (u, v, w)$ and by the use of the conserved quantities due to the geometrical symmetry. Finally, cosmological solutions are evaluated and analyzed from the point of view of the present evolution of the Universe.
