We construct a new class of black hole solutions in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a negative cosmological constant. These configurations are cohomogeneity-1, with two equal-magnitude angular momenta. In the generic case, they possess a non-vanishing magnetic potential at infinity with a boundary metric which is the product of time and a squashed three-dimensional sphere. Both extremal and non-extremal black holes are studied. The non-extremal black holes satisfying a certain relation between electric charge, angular momenta and magnitude of the magnetic potential at infinity do not trivialize in the limit of vanishing event horizon size, becoming particle-like (non-topological) solitonic configurations. Among the extremal black holes, we show the existence of a new one-parameter family of supersymmetric solutions, which bifurcate from a critical Gutowski-Reall configuration.
