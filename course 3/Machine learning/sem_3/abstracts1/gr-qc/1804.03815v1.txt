Recently superfluid black holes are reported in Lovelock gravity with conformally coupled scalar field [Robie A. Hennigar, Robert B. Mann, Erickson Tjoa, Phys.Rev.Lett. 118 (2017) no.2, 021301]. In this paper, we present another example of black holes containing $\lambda$ phase transition in Horava gravity. After studying the extended thermodynamics of general dimensional Horava-Lifshitz AdS black holes, it is found that only the one with spherical horizon in four and five dimensions have a $\lambda$ phase transition, which is a line of (continuous) second order phase transitions and was famous in the discussion of superfluidity of liquid ${}^4$He. The "superfluid" black hole phase and "normal" black hole phase are also distinguished. Especially, six dimensional Horava-Lifshitz AdS black holes exhibit infinitely many critical points in $P-\nu$ plane and the divergent points for specific heat, for which they only contain the "normal" black hole phase and the "superfluid" black hole phase disappears due to the physical temperature constraint; therefore there is no similar phase transition. In more than six dimensions, there is no $P-\nu$ critical behavior. After choosing the appropriate ordering field, we study the critical phenomena in different planes of thermodynamical phase space. We also calculate the critical exponents, which are the same with the van der Waals fluid.
