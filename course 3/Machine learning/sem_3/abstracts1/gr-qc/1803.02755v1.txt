Non-perturbative quantum gravity prevents the formation of curvature singularities and may allow black holes to decay with a lifetime shorter than evaporation time. This, in connection with the existence of primordial black holes, could open a new window for quantum-gravity phenomenology. I discuss the possibility of observing astrophysical emissions from the explosion of old black holes in the radio and in the gamma wavelengths. These emissions can be discriminated from other astrophysical sources because of a peculiar way the emitted wavelength scales with the distance. The spectrum of the diffuse radiation produced by those objects presents a peculiar distortion due to this scaling.
