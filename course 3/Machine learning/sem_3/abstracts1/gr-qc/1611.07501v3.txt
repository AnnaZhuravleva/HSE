Considerable attention has been devoted to the wormhole physics in the past 30 years by exploring the possibilities of finding traversable wormholes without the need of exotic matter. In particular the thin-shell wormhole formalism has been widely investigated by exploiting the cut-and-paste technique to merge two space-time regions and, to research the stability of these wormholes developed by Visser. This method helps us to minimize the amount of the exotic matter. In this paper we construct a four dimensional, spherically symmetric, dyonic thin-shell wormhole with electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $P$, and dilaton charge $\Sigma$, in the context of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We have applied Darmois-Israel formalism and the cut-and-paste method by joining together two identical spacetime solutions. We carry out the dyonic thin-shell wormhole stability analyses by using a linear barotropic gas, Chaplygin gas, and logarithmic gas for the exotic matter. It is shown that by choosing suitable parameter values as well as equation of state parameter, under specific conditions we obtain a stable dyonic thin-shell wormhole solution. Finally we argue that, the stability domain of the dyonic thin-shell wormhole can be increased in terms of electric charge, magnetic charge, and dilaton charge.
