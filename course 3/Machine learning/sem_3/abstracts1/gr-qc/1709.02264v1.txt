Without exceeding the limits of the conventional $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, we argue for Yukawa law of interparticle interaction as the law of gravitation in the real expanding inhomogeneous Universe. It covers the whole space and comes up to take place of Newtonian gravity, which is restricted exclusively to sub-horizon distances. The large-scale screening of gravitational interaction between every two nonrelativistic massive particles is ensured by the homogeneous cosmological background (specifically, by the nonzero average rest mass density of nonrelativistic matter). We take advantage of the uniform matter distribution case (i.e. the homogeneous Universe limit) to demonstrate superiority of Yukawa gravity. Attention is also devoted to the concrete particular case of inhomogeneity.
