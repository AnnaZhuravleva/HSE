We analyze the structural and thermodynamic properties of $D$-dimensional ($D \geq 4$), asymptotically flat or Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) electrically charged black holes (BH), resulting from the minimal coupling of general nonlinear electrodynamics (NEDs) to General Relativity. This analysis deals with static spherically symmetric (elementary) configurations with spherical horizons. Our methods are based on the study of the behaviour (in vacuum and on the boundary of their domain of definition) of the Lagrangian density functions characterizing the NED models in flat spacetime. These functions are constrained by some admissibility conditions endorsing the physical consistency of the corresponding theories, which are classified in several families, some of them supporting elementary solutions in flat space which are nontopological solitons. This classification induces a similar one for the elementary BH solutions of the associated gravitating NEDs, whose geometrical structures are thoroughly explored. A consistent thermodynamic analysis can be developed for the subclass of families whose associated BH solutions behave asymptotically (in absence of a cosmological term) as the Schwarzschild metric. In these cases we obtain the behaviour of the main thermodynamic functions, as well as important finite relations among them. In particular, we find the general equation determining the set of extreme BHs for every model, and a general Smarr formula, valid for the set of elementary BH solutions of such models. We also consider the one-parameter group of scale transformations, which are symmetries of the field equations of any NED in flat spacetime. These symmetries are respected by the minimal coupling to gravitation and induce representations of the group in the spaces of BH solutions of the different models, characterized by their thermodynamic functions.
