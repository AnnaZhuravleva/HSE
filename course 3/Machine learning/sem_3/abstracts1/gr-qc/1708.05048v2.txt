Mapping of fundamental branes to their worldsheet (ws) multiplets originating from spontaneous breaking of the Poincare symmetry is studied. The interaction Lagrangian for fields of the Nambu-Goldstone multiplet is shown to encode $R^2$ gravity on the ws. The power law $k_{p}\sim T_{p}^{\frac{3-p}{2(p+1)}}$ for the SO(D-p-1) gauge coupling $k_{p}$ as the function of the p-brane tension $T_{p}$ is assumed. It points to the presence of asymptotic freedom and confinement phases in brane matter. Their connection with collapse and inflation of the branes is discussed.
