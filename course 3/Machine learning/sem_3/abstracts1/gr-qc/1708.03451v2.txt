There is a conjecture that renormalizable higher-derivative gravity has a finite classical potential at the origin. In this work we show clearly that the scale-invariant gravity (SIG) satisfies the conjecture. This gravity produces the better-behaved $1/k^4$ UV behavior as needed for renormalizability. It turns out that the SIG has the linear classical potential of $V\propto r$ and it is a UV complete theory.
