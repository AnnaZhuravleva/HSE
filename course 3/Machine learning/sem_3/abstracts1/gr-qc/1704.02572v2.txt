We investigate the compatibility of the Symmetron with dark energy by introducing a non-minimal kinetic term associated with the Symmetron. In this new model, the effect of the friction term appearing in the equation of motion of the Symmetron field becomes more pronounced due to the non-minimal kinetic term appearing in the action and, under specific conditions after symmetry breaking, the universe experiences an accelerating phase which, in spite of the large effective mass of the scalar field, lasts as long as the Hubble time $H_{0}$.
