Galactic rotation curves have proven to be the testing ground for dark matter bounds in spiral galaxies of all morphologies. Dwarf galaxies serve as an increasingly interesting case of rotation curve dynamics due to their typically rising rotation curve as opposed to the flattening curve of large spirals. These galaxies usually vary in galactic structure and mostly terminate at small radial distances. This, coupled with the fact that Cold Dark Matter theories struggle with the universality of galactic rotation curves, allow for exclusive features of alternative gravitational models to be analyzed. Recently, the THINGS (The HI Nearby Galactic Survey) has been extended to include a sample of 25 dwarf galaxies now known as the LITTLE THINGS Survey. Here, we present a thorough application of alternative gravitational models to the LITTLE THINGS survey, specifically focusing on conformal gravity and Modified Newtonian Dynamics. An analysis and discussion of the results of the fitting procedure of the two alternative gravitational models are explored, as well as the resulting rotation curve predictions of each. Further, we show how these two alternative gravitational models account for the recently observed universal trends in centripetal accelerations in spiral galaxies. We posit here that both conformal gravity and MOND can provide an accurate description of the galactic dynamics without the need for dark matter.
