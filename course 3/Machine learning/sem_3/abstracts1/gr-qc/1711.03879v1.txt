In the present work, we study the consequences of considering a recently proposed polynomial inflationary potential in the context of the generalized, modified, and generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas models. In addition, we consider dissipative effects by coupling the inflation field to radiation, i.e., the inflationary dynamics is studied in the warm inflation scenario. We take into account a general parametrization of the dissipative coefficient $\Gamma$ for describing the decay of the inflaton field into radiation. By studying the background and perturbative dynamics in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of warm inflation separately for the positive and negative quadratic and quartic potentials, we obtain expressions for the most relevant inflationary observables as the scalar power spectrum, the scalar spectral, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We construct the trajectories in the $n_s-r$ plane for several expressions of the dissipative coefficient and compare with the two-dimensional marginalized contours for ($n_s,r$) from the latest Planck data. We find that our results are in agreement with WMAP9 and Planck 2015 data.
