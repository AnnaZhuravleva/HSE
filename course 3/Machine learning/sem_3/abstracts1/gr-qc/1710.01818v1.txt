The paper at hand presents a novel class of dyonic black holes in higher dimensions through a new proposal for the electromagnetic field tensor. The black hole solutions are extracted analytically and their geometrical/physical properties are studied. In addition, the details regarding thermodynamical structure and phase transition behavior of the solutions for $4$ different cases are investigated: i) general case, ii) constant electric field, iii) constant magnetic field, and iv) constant electric and magnetic fields. It will be shown that depending on the picture under consideration, the thermodynamical properties are modified. To have better picture regarding the phase transitions, the concept of the extended phase space is employed. It will be shown that in the absence of the electric field, magnetic black holes present van der Waals like phase transition. Furthermore, it will be highlighted that for super magnetized black holes, no phase transition exists.
