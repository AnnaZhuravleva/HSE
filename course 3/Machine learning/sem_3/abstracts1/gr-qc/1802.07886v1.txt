We study the "anti-Unruh effect" for an entangled quantum state in reference to the counterintuitive cooling previously pointed out for an accelerated detector coupled to the vacuum. We show that quantum entanglement for an initially entangled (spacelike separated) bipartite state can be increased when either a detector attached to one particle is accelerated or both detectors attached to the two particles are in simultaneous accelerations. However, if the two particles (e.g., detectors for the bipartite system) are not initially entangled, entanglement cannot be created by the anti-Unruh effect. Thus, within certain parameter regime, this work shows that the anti-Unruh effect can be viewed as an amplification mechanism for quantum entanglement.
