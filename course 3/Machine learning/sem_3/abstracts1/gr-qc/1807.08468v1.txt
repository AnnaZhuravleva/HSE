I argue that the bare cosmological constant of the Einstein equations is actually measured now from the effective cosmological constant observed according to LambdaCDM Precision Cosmology and from the vacuum contribution of particles, evaluated using well established physics. Such a bare cosmological constant in classic General Relativity, GR, is eternal and unchanging. Therefore I argue that we have available the value of the Einstein bare cosmological constant, which is there ever since GR emerged.
