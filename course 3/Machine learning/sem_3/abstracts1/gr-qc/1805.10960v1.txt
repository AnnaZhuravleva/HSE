Embedding theorems have continued to be a topic of interest in the general theory of relativity since these help connect the classical theory to higher-dimensional manifolds. This paper deals with spacetimes of embedding class one, i.e., spacetimes that can be embedded in a five-dimensional flat spacetime. These ideas are applied to two diverse models, a complete solution for a charged wormhole admitting a one-parameter group of conformal motions and a new model to explain the flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies without the need for dark matter.
