Standard thermodynamical results of ideal Bose gases are used to study the possible formation of a cosmological Bose-Einstein condensate in Scalar Field Dark Matter models; the main hypothesis is that the boson particles were in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. It is then shown that the only relevant case needs the presence of both particles and anti-particles, and that it corresponds to models in which the bosonic particle is very light. Contrary to common wisdom, the condensate should be a relativistic phenomenon. Some cosmological implications are discussed in turn.
