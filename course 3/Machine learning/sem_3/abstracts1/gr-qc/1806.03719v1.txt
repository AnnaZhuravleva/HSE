In this paper, we study the deflection of light by a class of phantom black hole and wormhole solutions in the weak limit approximation. More specifically, in the first part of this work we study the deflection of light by Garfinkle-Horowitz-Str\"{o}minger black hole and Einstein-Maxwell anti-dilaton black hole using the optical geometry and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Our calculation show that gravitational lensing is affected by the phantom scalar field (phantom dilaton). In the second part of this work, we explore the deflection of light by a class of asymptotically flat phantom wormholes. In particular we have used three types of wormholes: wormhole with a bounded/unbounded mass function, and a wormhole with a vanishing redshift function. We show that the particular chose of the shape function and mass function plays a crucial role in the final expression for the deflection angle of light. Finally, in the third part of this paper we verify our findings with the help of standard geodesics equations.
