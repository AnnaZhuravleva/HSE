We study the emission of neutral massless $(1, 2)\hbar$-spin bosons during power-law inflation using unified spinor field theory. We shows that during inflation gravitons and photons were emitted with wavelengths (on physical coordinates) that increase as the Hubble radius: $\lambda_{Ph} \sim a/H$. The quantised action related to these bosons is calculated and results to be a fraction of the Planck constant.
