Brane inflationary universe model in the context of a Chaplygin gas equation of state is studied. General conditions for this model to be realizable are discussed. In the high-energy limit and by using a chaotic potential we describe in great details the characteristic of this model. The parameters of the model are restricted by using recent astronomical observations.
