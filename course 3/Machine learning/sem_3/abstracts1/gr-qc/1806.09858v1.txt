We investigate whether the new horizon first law proposed recently still work in $f(R)$ theory. We identify the entropy and the energy of black hole as quantities proportional to the corresponding value of integration, supported by the fact that the new horizon first law holds true as a consequence of equations of motion in $f(R)$ theories. The formulas for the entropy and energy of black hole found here are in agreement with the results obtained in literatures. For applications, some nontrivial black hole solutions in $f(R)$ theories have been considered, the entropies and the energies of black holes in these models are firstly computed, which may be useful for future researches.
