The Particle Physics and Cosmological motivations of Bianchi I universes are illustrated using Quantum Field Theory in curved space-time. We show that in a non-isotropically expanding universe fermionic and scalar fields acquire mass-like terms which, in the former case, preserve chiral symmetry. We also prove that these do not arise in an isotropic and homogeneous universe and, more generally, any conformally flat manifold. The creation of massless particles in Bianchi I universes is presented as a simple explanation, requiring nothing more than a massless $U\left(1\right)$ gauge theory, for the primordial origins of extra-galactic magnetic fields.
