We have studied the locally rotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I cosmological model in $f(R,T)$ gravity ($R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the stress energy tensor) with Bulk viscous fluid as matter content. The model is constructed for the linear form $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$. The exact solution of field equations is obtained by using a time varying deceleration parameter $q$ for a suitable choice of the function $f(T)$. In this work, the bulk viscous pressure $\bar{p}$ is found to be negative and energy density $\rho$ is found to be positive. The obtained model is anisotropic, accelerating and compatible with the results of astronomical observations. Also, some important features of physical parameters of this model have been discussed.
