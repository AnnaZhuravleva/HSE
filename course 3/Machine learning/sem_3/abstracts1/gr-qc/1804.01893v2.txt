A new theorem describing singularities and chronology violation in the context of black holes is formulated. The theorem's premise involves a number semi-global geometric conditions that capture features usually associated with black hole interiors, eg., a region containing future trapped surfaces that is bounded by a future achronal boundary generated by future complete null geodesics. Under the null energy condition, it is shown that if every future inextendible null geodesic in the interior meets a future trapped surface in the interior or if there is a trapped surface in the interior along with a sufficiently strong convergence condition, then the interior is future null incomplete even in cases where chronology is violated. Notable features of the theorem include the ability to bypass the generic conditions - timelike or null - and the ability to locate future incomplete null geodesics within a region corresponding to the black hole interior.
