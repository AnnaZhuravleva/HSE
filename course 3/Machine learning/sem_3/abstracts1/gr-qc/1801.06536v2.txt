We consider Lorentz invariant scalar-tensor teleparallel gravity theories with a Lagrangian built from the torsion scalar, a scalar field, its kinetic term and a derivative coupling between the torsion and the scalar field. The field equations of the theory are derived and the relation between the spin connection and the antisymmetric part of the tetrad field equations is found explicitly, which is an important consistency result for Lorentz invariant teleparallel theories of gravity. Afterwards we study the behaviour of this class of theories under conformal transformations and find that such transformations map different theories in this class onto each other.
