We searched for a resolution of the flat galactic rotation curve problem from geometry instead of assuming the existence of dark matter. We observed that the scale independence of the rotational velocity in the outer region of galaxies could point out to a possible existence of local scale symmetry and therefore the gravitational phenomena inside such regions should be described by the unique local scale symmetric theory, namely Weyl's theory of gravity. We solved field equations of Weyl gravity and determined the special geometry in the outer region of galaxies. In order to understand the scale dependent description of gravitational phenomena, we compared individual terms of so called Einstein-Weyl theory and concluded that while the outer region of galaxies are described by the Weyl term, the inner region of galaxies are described by the Einstein-Hilbert term.
