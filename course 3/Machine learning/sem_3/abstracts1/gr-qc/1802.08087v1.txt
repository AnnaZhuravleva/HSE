A quantum cosmology in teleparallel gravity is presented in this article. Teleparallel gravity is used to perform such an analysis once in General Relativity (GR) the concept of gravitational energy is misleading preventing the establishment of a concise quantum cosmology. The Wheeler-DeWitt like equation is obtained using the Weyl quantization and the teleparallel expression of energy.
