In a previous paper it was shown that a minimally coupled scalar field of mass $M \sim H_0$ can describe both components of the dark sector in a unified way. In the solution found, the dark energy component decays linearly with the Hubble parameter, with a homogeneous creation of dark matter. In the present note we show that a $\Lambda$CDM dark sector can also be modeled by such a single field. More generally, we show that the system of Klein-Gordon and Einstein equations admits a uniparametric family of solutions that is equivalent to a non-adiabatic (with zero sound speed) generalised Chaplygin gas.
