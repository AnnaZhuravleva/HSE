We study the gravitational collapse of an axion field in null coordinates, assuming spherical symmetry. Compared with previous studies, we use a simpler numerical scheme which can run, for relevant parameters, in a few minutes or less on a desktop computer. We use it to accurately determine the domains of parameter space in which the axion field forms a black hole, an axion star or a relativistic Bosenova.
