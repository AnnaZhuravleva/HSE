For distances large relative to the electron Compton wavelength, the Maxwell and gravitational fields from a bound electron in its groundstate are essentially those from a rotating, charged, massive point particle. For distances small relative to the electron Compton wavelength, the corresponding Maxwell fields and General Relativity metric, Riemann and Einstein tensors become bounded, showing that, for this example, quantum effects remove the corresponding classical singularities in electromagnetism and General Relativity. The asymptotic magnetic dipole field from the bound electron produces a constant magnetic field of several Tesla, aligned along the spin axis of the electron, at the singularity position. The corresponding apparent mass density from the gravitational field from the bound electron is about 2kgm$^{-3}$, at the singularity position.
