We have obtained an exact vacuum solution from a gravity sector contained in the minimal standard-model extension. The theoretical model assumes a Riemann spacetime coupled to the bumblebee field which is responsible for the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The solution achieved in a static and spherically symmetric scenario establishes a Schwarzschild-like black hole. In order to study the effects of the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking, we have investigated some classics tests including the advance of the perihelion, bending of light and Shapiro's time-delay. Furthermore, we have computed some upper-bounds from which the most stringent one attains a sensitivity at the $10^{-13}$ level.
