Amongst a number of modified theories of gravity, the Rastall theory has been propounded to address some shortcomings of the standard theory of general relativity. Our purpose is to investigate this framework's capacity to analyse stellar structure in the context of elementary requirements for physical plausibility such as positive definite functions for the energy density and pressure, conformity to the causality criterion and the existence of an equation of state. We consider the analogue of the Saslaw \textit{et al} \cite{saslaw} isothermal model of general relativity and show that the Rastall version satisfies the basic requirements unlike its counterpart. Then we examine in turn the consequences of suppressing one of the inverse square law fall off of the energy density or the linear equation of state. In addition, the case of a constant spatial gravitational potential is studied on account of this prescription being a necessary and sufficient condition for isothermal behaviour in Einstein theory and its most general tensor extension Lovelock gravity.
