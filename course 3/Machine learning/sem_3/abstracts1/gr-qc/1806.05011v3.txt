We study the information-geometric properties of two black hole solutions in higher derivative theories of gravity, namely the Deser-Sarioglu-Tekin solution and the Clifton-Barrow black hole. Our investigation is focused on deriving the relevant information metrics and their scalar curvatures on the space of equilibrium states for the corresponding gravitational backgrounds. The analysis is conducted within the framework of Geometrothermodynamics and shows highly non-trivial statistical behavior for both solutions.
