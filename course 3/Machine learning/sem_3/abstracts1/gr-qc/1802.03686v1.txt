We considered a new renormalization condition for the vacuum expectation values of the scalar and spinor currents induced by a homogeneous and constant electric field background in de Sitter spacetime. Following a semiclassical argument, the condition named maximal subtraction imposes the exponential suppression on the massive charged particle limit of the renormalized currents. The maximal subtraction changes the behaviors of the induced currents previously obtained by the conventional minimal subtraction scheme. The maximal subtraction is favored for a couple of physically decent predictions including the identical asymptotic behavior of the scalar and spinor currents, the removal of the infrared (IR) hyperconductivity from the scalar current, and the finite current for the massless fermion.
