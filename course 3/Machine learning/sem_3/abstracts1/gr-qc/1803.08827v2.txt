We prove the unitarity of the Euclidean nonlocal scalar field theory to all perturbative orders in the loop expansion. The amplitudes in the Euclidean space are calcuated assuming that all the particles have purely imaginary energies, and afterwards they are analytically continued to real energies. We show that such amplitudes satisfy the Cutkowsky rules, and only the cut diagrams corresponding to normal thresholds contribute to their imaginary part, indeed the unitarity is guaranteed. This analysis is then exported to nonlocal gauge and gravity theories by means of BRST or diffeomorfism invariance, and Ward identities.
