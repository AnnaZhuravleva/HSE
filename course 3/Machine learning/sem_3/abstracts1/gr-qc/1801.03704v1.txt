The (first-order) gravitational self-force correction to the spin-orbit precession of a spinning compact body along a slightly eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole is computed through the ninth post-Newtonian order, improving recent results by Kavanagh et al. [Phys.\ Rev.\ D {\bf 96}, 064012 (2017).] This information is then converted into its corresponding Effective-One-Body counterpart, thereby determining several new post-Newtonian terms in the gyrogravitomagnetic ratio $g_{S*}$.
