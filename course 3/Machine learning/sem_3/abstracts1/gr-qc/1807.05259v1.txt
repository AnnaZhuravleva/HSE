In this paper, we study the effects of modification of gravity on the problem of dynamical instability of the spherical relativistic anisotropic interiors. We have considered non-zero influence of expansion scalar throughout during the evolutionary phases of spherical geometry that led to the use of fluid stiffness parameter. The modified hydrostatic equation for the stellar anisotropic matter distributions is constructed and then solved by using radial perturbation scheme. Such a differential equation can be further used to obtain instability constraints at both weak field and post-Newtonian approximations after considering a particular Harrison-Wheeler equation of state. This approach allows us to deal with the effects of usual and effective matter variables on the stability exotic stellar of self-gravitating structures.
