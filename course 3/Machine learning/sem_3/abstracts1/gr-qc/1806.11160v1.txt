Generic coalescing binary black holes can emit anisotropic gravitational radiation. This causes a net emission of linear momentum that produces a gradual acceleration of the source. As a result, the final remnant black hole acquires a characteristic velocity known as recoil velocity or gravitational kick. The symmetries of gravitational wave emission are reflected in the interactions of the gravitational wave modes emitted by the binary. In particular, a kick is imparted to the source whenever modes of odd parity are not zero. We make use of the rich information encoded in the higher-order modes of the gravitational wave emission to infer the component of the kick along the line-of-sight (or \textit{radial kick}). We do this by performing parameter inference on simulated signals given by injected numerical relativity waveforms for non-spinning binaries and numerical relativity templates of aligned-spin binary black holes. We find that for even a modest radial kick of $120km/s$, the posterior probabilities can exclude a zero kick at a signal-to-noise ratio of $15$ using a single Advanced LIGO detector working at its early sensitivity. The measurement of a non-zero radial kick component would provide the first proof that gravitational waves carry linear momentum.
