We study the cosmology on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background in scalar-vector-tensor theories with a broken $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. For parity-invariant interactions arising in scalar-vector-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion, we derive conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities associated with tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations at linear order. This general result is applied to the computation of the primordial tensor power spectrum generated during inflation as well as to the speed of gravity relevant to dark energy. We also construct a concrete inflationary model in which a temporal vector component $A_0$ contributes to the dynamics of cosmic acceleration besides a scalar field $\phi$ through their kinetic mixings. In this model, we show that all the stability conditions of perturbations can be consistently satisfied during inflation and subsequent reheating.
