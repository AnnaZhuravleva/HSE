Using the Newman-Penrose formalism we calculate the positive energy momentum eigenstates of the Dirac equation for a plane polarized grav- itational wave pulse. We then consider Dirac particles whose spins are polarized in each orthonormal coordinate direction prior to the arrival of the gravitational wave pulse, and determine how the spins are changed by the pulse after its departure.
