The behavior of black holes horizon and wormholes under the Weyl conformal transformation is investigated. First, a shorter, but more general, derivation of the Weyl transformation of the simple prescription for detecting horizons and wormholes given recently in the literature for spherically symmetric spacetimes is provided. The derivation allows for a simple and intuitive way to understand why and when horizons and wormholes might arise in the conformal frame even if they were absent in the original frame. Then, the conformal behavior of black holes horizon and wormholes in more general spacetimes, based on more "sophisticated" definitions, is provided. The study shows that black holes and wormholes might always arise in the new frame even if they were absent in the original frame. Moreover, it is shown that some of the definitions found in the literature might be transformed into one another under such transformations. Worked-out examples are given.
