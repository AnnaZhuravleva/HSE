We review and relate two recent complementary constructions of linear local gauge-invariant observables for cosmological perturbations in generic spatially flat single-field inflationary cosmologies. We give explicit, covariant and mutually invertible transformations between the two sets of observables, thus resolving any doubts about their equivalence. In this way, we get a geometric interpretation and show the completeness of both sets of observables, while previously each of these properties was available only for one of them.
