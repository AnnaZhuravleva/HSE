This paper describes an application of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations in analytic perturbation form to the case of circular motion around a radially accreting or radiating black hole described by the Vaidya metric. Based on the formalism presented earlier, this paper explores the effects of mass accretion or loss of the central body on the overall dynamics of the orbiting spinning particle. This includes changes to its squared mass and spin magnitude due to the classical analog of radiative corrections from spin-curvature coupling. Various quantitative consequences are explored when considering orbital motion near the black hole's event horizon. An analysis on the orbital stability properties due to spin-curvature interactions is examined briefly, with conclusions in general agreement with previous work performed for the case of circular motion around a Kerr black hole.
