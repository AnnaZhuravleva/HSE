We consider scattering of electromagnetic waves from a distant point source by the gravitational field of the sun, taking the field oblateness due to the quadrupole moment of the sun into account. It turns out that effects of the field oblateness can play an important role in formation of images by the solar gravitational lens in sub-micrometer wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum.
