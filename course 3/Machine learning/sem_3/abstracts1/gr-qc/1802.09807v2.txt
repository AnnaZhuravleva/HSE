Physically reasonable stationary axisymmetric spacetimes can (under very mild technical conditions) be put into Boyer-Lindquist form. Unfortunately a metric presented in Boyer-Lindquist form is not well-adapted to the "quasi-Cartesian" meta-material analysis we developed in our previous article on "bespoke analogue spacetimes" (arXiv:1801.05549 [gr-qc]). In the current article we first focus specifically on spacetime metrics presented in Boyer-Lindquist form, and determine the equivalent meta-material susceptibility tensors in a laboratory setting. We then turn to analyzing generic stationary spacetimes, again determining the equivalent meta-material susceptibility tensors. While the background laboratory metric is always taken to be Riemann-flat, we now allow for arbitrary curvilinear coordinate systems. Finally, we reconsider static spherically symmetric spacetimes, but now in general spherical polar rather than quasi-Cartesian coordinates. The article provides a set of general tools for mimicking various interesting spacetimes by using non-trivial susceptibility tensors in general laboratory settings.
