We show that the correction to the gravitational binding energy for binary black holes due to the tail effect resembles the Lamb shift in the Hydrogen atom. In both cases a 'conservative' effect arises from interactions with 'radiation' modes, and moreover an explicit cancelation between near and far zone divergences is at work. In addition, regularization scheme-dependence may introduce ambiguity parameters. This is remediated, within an effective field theory approach, by the implementation of the zero-bin subtraction. We illustrate the procedure explicitly for the Lamb shift, by performing an ambiguity-free derivation within the framework of non-relativistic electrodynamics. We also derive the renormalization group equations from which we reproduce Bethe logarithm (at order $\alpha_e^5 \log \alpha_e$), and likewise the contribution to the gravitational potential from the tail effect (proportional to $v^8 \log v$).
