In this paper, we study the gravitational wave polarization modes for some particular $f(R)$ models using Newman-Penrose formalism. We find two extra scalar modes of gravitational wave (longitudinal and transversal modes) in addition to two tensor modes of general relativity. We conclude that gravitational waves correspond to class $II_{6}$ under the Lorentz-invariant E(2) classification of plane null waves for these $f(R)$ models.
