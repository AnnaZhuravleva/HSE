We consider the massive Dirac equation in the non-extreme Kerr geometry in horizon-penetrating Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates and derive a functional analytic integral representation of the propagator using the spectral theorem and the solutions of the ODEs arising in Chandrasekhar's separation of variables. This integral representation describes the dynamics of Dirac particles outside and across the event horizon, up to the Cauchy horizon. In the derivation, we first write the Dirac equation in Hamiltonian form. We then construct a unique self-adjoint extension of the Hamiltonian. To this end, as the Dirac Hamiltonian fails to be elliptic at the horizons, we combine results from the theory of symmetric hyperbolic systems with elliptic methods. Moreover, since the time evolution is not unitary because the particles may impinge on the singularity, we impose a suitable Dirichlet-type boundary condition inside the Cauchy horizon, having no effect on the outside dynamics. Finally, we obtain an explicit expression for the spectral decomposition of the propagator by applying Stone's formula to the spectral measure of the Hamiltonian and expressing the resolvent in terms of the solutions of the separated radial and angular ODE systems.
