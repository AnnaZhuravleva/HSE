We can survey an Ellis wormhole which is the simplest Morris-Thorne wormhole in our galaxy with microlensing. The light curve of a point source microlensed by the Ellis wormhole shows approximately $4\%$ demagnification while the total magnification of images lensed by a Schwarzschild lens is always larger than unity. We investigate an extended source effect on the light curves microlensed by the Ellis wormhole. We show that the depth of the gutter of the light curves of an extended source is smaller than the one of a point source since the magnified part of the extended source cancels the demagnified part out. We can, however, distinguish between the light curves of the extended source microlensed by the Ellis wormhole and the ones by the Schwarzschild lens in their shapes even if the size of the source is a few times larger than the size of an Einstein ring on a source plane. If the relative velocity of a star with the radius of $10^6$ km at $8$ kpc in the bulge of our galaxy against an observer-lens system is smaller than $10$ km/s on a source plane, we can detect microlensing of the star lensed by the Ellis wormhole with the throat radius of $1$ km at $4$ kpc.
