We study the cosmological evolution and singularity crossing in the Bianchi-I universe filled with a conformally coupled scalar field and compare them with those of the Bianchi-I universe filled with a minimally coupled scalar field.   We also write down the solution for the Bianchi-I Universe in the induced gravity cosmology.
