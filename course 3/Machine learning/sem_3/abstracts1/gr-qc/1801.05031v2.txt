The properties of dark matter admixed strange quark stars are investigated in the Starobinsky model of modified gravity. For quark matter we assume the MIT bag model, while self-interacting dark matter inside the star is modelled as a Bose-Einstein condensate with a polytropic equation of state. We numerically integrate the structure equations in the Einstein frame adopting the two-fluid formalism treating the curvature correction term non-perturbatively. Our findings show that strange quark stars (in agreement with current observational constraints) with the highest masses are equally affected by dark matter and modified gravity.
