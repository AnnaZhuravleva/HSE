In this paper we exploit dynamics of a $k-$essence scalar field to realise interactions between dark components of universe resulting a evolution consistent with observed features of late time phase of cosmic evolution. Stress energy tensor corresponding to a $k-$essence Lagrangian $L=V(\phi)F(X)$ (where $X=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi$) is shown to be equivalent to an ideal fluid with two components having same equation of state. Stress energy tensor of one of the components may be generated from a constant potential $k-$essence Lagrangian of form $L_1=V_0F(X)$ ($V_0$ constant) and that of other from another Lagrangian of form $L_2=V_1(\phi)F(X)$ with $V=V_0 + V_1(\phi)$. By identifying stress energy tensor of dark sector of universe with that corresponding to a $k-$essence Lagrangian $L=V(\phi)F(X)$ we have shown that cosmic evolution corresponds to a diffusive interaction between two fluid components represented by Lagrangians $L_1$ and $L_2$ with an energy transfer between fluid components determined by functions $V(\phi)$, $F(X)$ and their derivatives. We have described a methodology to obtain constraints on temporal behaviour of $k-$essence potentials from Supernova Ia data for which dynamics of $k-$essence scalar field may be used to realise dark matter and dark energy interactions in terms of diffusive interaction between two ideal fluids represented by Lagrangians $L_1$ and $L_2$.
