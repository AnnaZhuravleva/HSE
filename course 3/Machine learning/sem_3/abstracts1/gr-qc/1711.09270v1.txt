In this work we investigate which Loop Quantum Cosmology corrected Gauss-Bonnet $F(\mathcal{G})$ gravity can realize two singular cosmological scenarios, the intermediate inflation and the singular bounce scenarios. The intermediate inflation scenario has a Type III sudden singularity at $t=0$, while the singular bounce has a soft Type IV singularity. By using perturbative techniques, we find the holonomy corrected $F(\mathcal{G})$ gravities that generate at leading order the aforementioned cosmologies and we also argue that the effect of the holonomy corrections is minor to the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations of the classical theory.
