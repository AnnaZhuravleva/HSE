In a five-dimensional formalism we study the evolutionary behavior as well as the ultimate fate of the universe, in the course of which the contribution of dark energy in these phases are investigated. At one stage we get a situation (a condition) where the dark energy contained may contribute in maintaining the ecological balance of the universe. In the model universes we obtain here the dark energy is found to be of $\wedge$CDM and quintessence types-which bear testimony to being real universes. In one of the cases where the equation of state between the fluid pressure and density is of the type of the Van der waals equation, it is found that our universe may end in dust. And, also, it is seen that the behavior of the deceleration parameter is almost compatible with the recent observation.
