We study the thermodynamic properties of the black hole derived in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity without the detailed-balance condition. The parameter $\Xi=\epsilon^2$ in the HL black hole plays the same role as that of the electric charge in the RN-AdS black hole. By analogy, we treat the parameter $\Xi$ as the thermodynamic variable and obtain the first law of thermodynamics for the HL black hole. Although the HL black hole and the RN-AdS black hole have the similar mass and temperature, due to their very different entropy the two black holes have very different thermodynamic properties. By calculating the heat capacity and the free energy we analyze the thermodynamic stability of the HL black hole.
