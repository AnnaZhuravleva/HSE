In this letter we investigate some consequences of considering our 4D observable universe as locally and isometrically embeded into a 5D spacetime, where gravity is described by a Brans-Dicke theory in vacuum. Once we impose the embeding conditions we obtain that gravity on the 4D spacetime is governed by the Einstein field equations modified by an extra term that can play the role of a dynamical cosmological constant. Two examples were studied. In the first we derive a cosmological model of a universe filled only with a cosmological constant. In the second we obtain a cosmological solution describing a universe filled with matter, radiation and a dynamical cosmological constant, in agree with observational data. Due to the 5D geometrical origin for the dynamical cosmological constant we interpret that the acceleration in the expansion is explained without the introduction of a dark energy component. Moreover, all 4D matter sources are geometrically induced in the same manner as it is usually done in the Wesson's induced matter theory.
