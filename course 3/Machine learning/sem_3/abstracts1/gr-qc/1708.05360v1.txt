We establish the gravitational detectability of a Dirac monopole using a weak-field limit of general relativity, which can be developed from the Newtonian gravitational potential by including energy as a source. The resulting potential matches (by construction) the weak-field limit of two different solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity: one associated with the magnetically monopolar spray of field lines emerging from the half-infinite solenoid that makes up the Dirac monopole, the other associated with the field-energetic source of the solenoid itself (the Dirac string). The string's gravitational effect dominates, and we suggest that the primary strong-field contribution of the Dirac configuration is that of a half-infinite line of energy, whose GR solution is known.
