We present a portable and highly-scalable algorithm and framework that targets problems in the astrophysics and numerical relativity communities. This framework combines together a parallel octree-refined adaptive mesh with wavelet adaptive multiresolution and a physics module to solve the Einstein equations of general relativity in the BSSN formulation. The goal of this work is to perform advanced, massively parallel numerical simulations of Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios on the order of 100:1. These studies will be used to generate waveforms for use in LIGO data analysis and to calibrate semi-analytical approximate methods. This advanced framework is designed to easily accommodate many existing algorithms in astrophysics for plasma dynamics and radiation hydrodynamics. We have designed novel algorithms to enable efficient simulations for such experiments and demonstrate excellent weak scalability up to 131K cores on ORNL's Titan for binary mergers for mass ratios up to 100.
