We classify all warped product space-times in three categories as i) generalized twisted product structures, ii) base conformal warped product structures and iii) generalized static space-times and then we obtain the Einstein equations with the corresponding cosmological constant by which we can determine uniquely the warp functions in these warped product space-times.
