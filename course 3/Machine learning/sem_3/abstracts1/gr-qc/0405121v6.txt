We put forward a multi-time theory, in frame of which the cosmic acceleration is a natural phenomenon without cosmological constant or anything like that. The main point of this theory is that each of the gravity interaction and electromagnetic interaction has its own time, respectively. Also we give a concrete model of this theory which can exactly simulate $\Lambda$CDM. Further we discuss the possible observations which may improve this theory in the future.
