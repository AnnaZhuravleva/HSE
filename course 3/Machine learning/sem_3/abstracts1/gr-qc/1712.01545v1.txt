Using the quasinormal modes of a massless scalar perturbation, we investigate the small/large black hole phase transition in the Lorentz symmetry breaking massive gravity. The result shows that, at low temperature or pressure, the phase transition can be probed by the change of the slope of the quasinormal mode frequencies in the complex-$\omega$ diagram. While increasing the temperature or pressure to some certain values near the critical point, there will appear the deflection point, which indicates that such method may not be appropriate to test the phase transition. At the critical point, the quasinormal mode frequencies for the small and large black holes will have the similar behavior. Moreover, we examine the behaviors of the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequencies along the isobaric and isothermal processes. It is shown that the oscillatory behavior is observed only when the small/large black hole phase transition occurs. Therefore, this property can provide us an additional method to probe the phase transition through the quasinormal modes.
