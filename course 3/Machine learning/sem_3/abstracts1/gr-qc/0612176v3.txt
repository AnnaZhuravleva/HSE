In this paper we establish a generally and globally valid coordinate system in curved space-time with the simultaneous hypersurface orthogonal to the time coordinate. The time coordinate can be preseted according to practical evolving process and keep synchronous with the evolution of the realistic world. In this coordinate system, it is convenient to express the physical laws and to calculate physical variables with clear geometrical meaning. We call it "natural coordinate system". The constructing method for the natural coordinate system is concretely provided, and its physical and geometrical meanings are discussed in detail. In NCS we make classical approximation of spinor equation to get Newtonian mechanics, and then make weak field approximation of Einstein's equation and low speed approximation of particles moving in the space-time. From the analysis and examples we find it is a nice coordinate system to describe the realistic curved space-time, and is helpful to understand the nature of space-time.
