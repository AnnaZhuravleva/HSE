Based on the consideration that the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon of Kerr-de Sitter black hole are not independent each other, we conjecture the total entropy of the system should have an extra term contributed from the correlations between the two horizons, except for the sum of the two horizon entropies. By employing globally effective first law and effective thermodynamic quantities, we obtain the corrected total entropy and find that the region of stable state for kerr-de Sitter is related to the angular velocity parameter $a$, i.e., the region of stable state becomes bigger as the rotating parameters $a$ is increases.
