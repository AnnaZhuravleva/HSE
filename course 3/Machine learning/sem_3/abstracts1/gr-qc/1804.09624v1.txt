In this paper we will construct a linearized metric solution for an electrically charged system in a ghost free infinite derivative theory of gravity, and show that the gravitational potential for a point charge with mass $m$ is non-singular, the Kretschmann scalar is finite, and the metric approaches conformal-flatness in the ultraviolet regime where the non-local gravitational interaction becomes important. We will also show that the cosmic censorship conjecture is not required in this class of singularity-free theories. Unlike in the case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in general relativity, where $|Q|\leq m/M_p$ has to be always satisfied, in ghost-free infinite derivative gravity the opposite scenario $|Q|>m/M_p,$ is also allowed, such as for an electron.
