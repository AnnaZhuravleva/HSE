This article is devoted to the study of scalar perturbations in loop quantum cosmology. It aims at clarifying the situation with respect to the way initial conditions are set and to the specific choice of an inflaton potential. Several monomial potentials are studied. Both the dressed metric and deformed algebra approaches are considered. We show that the calculation of the ultra-violet part of the spectrum, which is the physically relevant region for most background trajectories, is reliable whereas the infra-red and intermediate parts do depend on some specific choices that are made explicit.
