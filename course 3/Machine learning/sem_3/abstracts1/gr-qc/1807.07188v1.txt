We set observational constraints on the second clock effect, predicted by Weyl unified field theory, by investigating recent data on the dilated lifetime of muons accelerated by a magnetic field. These data were obtained in an experiment carried out in CERN aiming at measuring the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In our analysis we employ the definition of invariant proper time proposed by V. Perlick, which seems to be the appropriate notion to be worked out in the context of Weyl space-time.
