The energy of a particle moving on a spacetime, in principle, can affect the background metric. The modifications to it depend on the ratio of energy of the particle and the Planck energy, known as rainbow gravity. Here we find the explicit expressions for the coordinate transformations from rainbow Minkowski spacetime to accelerated frame. The corresponding metric is also obtained which we call as rainbow-Rindler metric. So far we are aware of, no body has done it in a concrete manner. Here this is found from the first principle and hence all the parameters are properly identified. The advantage of this is that the calculated Unruh temperature is compatible with the Hawking temperature of the rainbow black hole horizon, obtained earlier. Since the accelerated frame has several importance in revealing various properties of gravity, we believe that the present result will not only fill that gap, but also help to explore different aspects of rainbow gravity paradigm.
