Bekenstein and Mayo proposed a generalised bound for the entropy, which implies some inequalities between the charge, energy, angular momentum, and the size of the macroscopic system. Dain has shown that Maxwell's electrodynamics satisfies all three inequalities. We investigate the validity of these relations in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics and show that Born-Infeld electrodynamics satisfies all of them. However, contrary to the linear theory, there is no rigidity statement in Born-Infeld. We study the physical meaning and the relationship between these inequalities and, in particular, we analyse the connection between the energy-angular momentum inequality and causality.
