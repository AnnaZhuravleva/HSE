The goal of the recently approved space-based LARES mission is to measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the spinning Earth at a repeatedly claimed 1% accuracy by combining its node Omega with those of the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II laser-ranged satellites. In this paper we show that, in view of the lower altitude of LARES (h=1450 km) with respect to LAGEOS and LAGEOS II (h\approx 6000 km), the cross-coupling between the effect of the atmospheric drag, both neutral and charged, on the inclination of LARES and its classical node precession due to the Earth's oblateness may induce a 3-9% year^-1 systematic bias on the total relativistic precession. Since its extraction from the data will take about 5-10 years, such a perturbing effect may degrade the total accuracy of the test, especially in view of the large uncertainties in modeling the drag force.
