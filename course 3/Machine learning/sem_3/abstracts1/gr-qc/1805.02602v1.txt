We consider the wormhole of Ellis, Bronnikov, Morris and Thorne (EBMT), arising from Einstein's equations in presence of a phantom scalar field. The linear instability of this system has been proved by Gonzalez, Guzman and Sarbach; Bronnikov, Fabris and Zhidenko have given tools to extend the linear stability analysis to a wide class of scalar field solutions of the Einstein equations. In this paper we propose a simplified derivation of the linear instability in the EBMT case. Like the cited authors, we reduce the linearized Einstein equations to a master equation; however, differently from them, we meet no singularity at the wormhole throat and, consequently, we do not need to regularize the master equation.
