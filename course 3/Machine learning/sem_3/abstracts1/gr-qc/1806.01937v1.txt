We investigate the impact of the post-inflationary thermal histories on the cosmic graviton spectrum caused by the inflationary variation of their refractive index. Depending on the frequency band, the spectral energy distribution can be mildly red, blue or even violet. Wide portions of the parameter space lead to potentially relevant signals both in the audio range (probed by the advanced generation of terrestrial interferometers) and in the mHz band (where space-borne detectors could be operational within the incoming score year). The description of the refractive index in conformally related frames is clarified.
