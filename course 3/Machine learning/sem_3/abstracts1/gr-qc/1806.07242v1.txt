We study the effects of a matter described by a non-abelian gauge field in the holographic characteristics like the evolution of computational complexity. For this reason we choose the Yang-Mills field in a Maxwell-power-Yang-Mills theory in AdS spacetime. We seek the impact of this new charge of YM field on the complexity growth rate by using "CA" conjecture. We also investigate the spreading of perturbations near the horizon and the complexity growth rate in local shock wave geometry and try to find the effects of the new charge on it.
