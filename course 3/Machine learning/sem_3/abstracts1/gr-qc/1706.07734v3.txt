The differential scattering cross section of the massless scalar field localized on the 3-brane of charged static black holes in the ADD model is analyzed. While results valid in the entire range of scattering angle can be obtained only via a numerical approach, analytical results can be obtained via the geodesic and glory approximations. The comparisons between numerical and analytical results lead to excellent agreements. The increase of the charge intensity has the consequence of increasing the width of the interference fringes in the scattering cross section. Its influence on the intensity of the scattered flux, however, depends on the dimensionality of the spacetime. Analyzes for the special cases of uncharged and extremely charged black holes are included.
