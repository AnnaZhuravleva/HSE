We present the reconstruction method of $f(R)$ gravity for the homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi-I spacetime, which was previously formulated only for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime. We argue in this paper that for anisotropic spacetimes, the total anisotropy behaves as an independent metric degree of freedom on top of the average scale factor in $f(R)$ gravity. This is not like $GR$, where specifying the form of the average scale factor as a function of time also specify the total anisotropy as a function of time uniqely. We link this peculiar fact to an interesting intertwining between the definition of Ricci scalar for anisotropic metric and anisotropy evolution equation in $f(R)$ gravity. Consequently, specifying an anisotropic solution of $f(R)$ gravity implies specifying both the average scale factor and the total anisotropy as functions of time. The reconstruction method hence formulated is applied to two scenarios where anisotropy suppression is important, namely, a quasi de-Sitter expansion as required in inflation, and a power law contraction as required in ekpyrotic bounce models.
