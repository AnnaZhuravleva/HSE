In this paper, we will present a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati stable model in order to perform an observational test using $H(z)$ data and radial BAO scale in the galaxy distribution. In this vein, we study the tension between constraints on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the crossover scale $r_c$, which is associated with the DGP model. Our results show that observations do not favor the DGP stable model as a possible candidate to fit the observations of the late cosmic acceleration.
