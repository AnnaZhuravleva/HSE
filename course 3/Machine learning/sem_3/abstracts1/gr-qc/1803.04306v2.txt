We discuss the role of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions (BCs) and the corresponding Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms in general relativity (GR) and f (R)-gravity in arbitrary dimensions. We do our calculations in GR both covariantly by using the holographic property of the Einstein-Hilbert action and by foliating the space-time in the framework of ADM formalism. For f (R)-gravity, using the equivalent scalar-tensor formulation, the holographic relation does not hold completely, showing that f(R)-gravity does not belong to the class of Lanczos-Lovelock Lagrangians. This turns out to be the origin of BCs problem of f (R)-gravity, where we need to impose boundary conditions on coordinate and momentum variables simultaneously. We show that, in contrast to the case of GR, it is not possible to avoid this problem by any kind of GHY terms.
