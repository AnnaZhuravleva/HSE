Tachyon-Brane inflationary universe model in the context of a Chaplygin gas equation of state is studied. General conditions for this model to be realizable are discussed. In the high-energy limit and by using an exponential potential we describe in great details the characteristic of this model. Recent observational data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe experiment are employed to restrict the parameters of the model.
