We study the dynamics of interacting holographic dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology for the future event horizon and the Hubble horizon cut-offs. We determine the system of first-order differential equations for the future event horizon and Hubble horizon cut-offs, and obtain the corresponding fixed points, attractors, repellers and saddle points. Finally, we investigate the cosmic coincidence problem in this model for the future event horizon and Hubble horizon cut-offs and find that for both cut-offs and for a variety of Brans-Dicke parameters the coincidence problem is almost resolved.
