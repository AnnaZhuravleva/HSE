In this paper we have investigated the gravitational lensing phenomenon in the strong field regime for a regular, charged, static, non-linear black hole having a electrodynamics source. We have obtained the angle of deflection and compared it to a Schwarzschild black hole and Reissner Nordstrom black hole with similar properties. We have also done a graphical study of the relativistic image positions and magnifications. We hope that this method may be useful in the detection of non-luminous bodies like this current black hole.
