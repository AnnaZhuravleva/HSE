We claim that the physical parameters of the constructed black hole solutions in general relativity (GR) coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) by Zhong-Ying Fan and Xiaobao Wang in the Paper [Phys. Rev. D 94, 124027 (2016)] are misinterpreted, despite the formalism being correct. We argue that because of these misinterpretations, the derived black hole solutions and the Lagrangian densities presented in that paper are slightly inconsistent. In this comment, we present complete black hole solutions of the given Lagrangian densities which correct the interpretation of the physical parameters of the constructed black hole solutions and lead to the correct treatment and weak field limits of the physical parameters of the constructed solutions.
