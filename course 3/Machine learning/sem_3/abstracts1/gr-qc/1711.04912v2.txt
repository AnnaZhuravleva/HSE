In this work we consider the Higgs inflation scenario, but in contrast with past works, the present analysis is done in the context of a spontaneous collapse theory for the quantum state of the inflaton field. In particular, we will rely on a previously studied adaptation of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization model for the treatment of inflationary cosmology. We will show that with the introduction of the dynamical collapse hypothesis, some of the most serious problems of the Higgs inflation proposal can be resolved in a natural way.
