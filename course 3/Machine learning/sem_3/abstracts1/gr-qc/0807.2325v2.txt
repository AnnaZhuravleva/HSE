In this work, exact solutions of static and spherically symmetric space-times are analyzed in f(R) modified theories of gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics. Firstly, we restrict the metric fields to one degree of freedom, considering the specific case of g_tt\g_rr = -1. Using the dual P formalism of nonlinear electrodynamics an exact general solution is deduced in terms of the structural function H_P. In particular, specific exact solutions to the gravitational field equations are found, confirming previous results and new pure electric field solutions are found. Secondly, motivated by the existence of regular electric fields at the center, and allowing for the case of g_tt\g_rr \= -1, new specific solutions are found. Finally, we outline alternative approaches by considering the specific case of constant curvature, followed by the analysis of a specific form for f(R).
