An experimental detection of graviton is extremely hard problem, however, there are different ways to evaluate a graviton mass if it is non-vanishing. Theories of massive gravity or theories with non-vanishing graviton mass initially have a number of pathologies such as discontinuities, ghosts etc. In last years theorists found ways to overcome weaknesses of such theories meanwhile observational features are also discussed. In the first publication reporting about the discovery of gravitational waves from the binary black hole system the LIGO-Virgo collaboration obtained the graviton mass constraint around $1.2 \times 10^{-22}$ eV (later the estimate was improved with new data). A comparable and consistent graviton mass constraint around $2.9 \times 10^{-21}$ eV has been obtained from analysis of the bright star S2 trajectory near the Galactic Center.
