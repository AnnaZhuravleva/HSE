In this paper, we systematically study spacetimes of plane-fronted gravitational waves with parallel rays (pp-waves) in Einstein-aether theory. In contrast to General Relativity (GR), now the problem in general becomes overdetermined. In particular, for the linearly polarized pp-waves, there are five independent vacuum Einstein-aether field equations for three unknown functions. Therefore, solutions exist only for particular choices of the four free parameters $c_{i}$'s of the theory. We find that there exist eight cases, in two of which any form of pp-waves can exist, similar to that in GR, while in the other six of which, pp-waves exist only in particular forms. Beyond these eight cases, solutions either do not exist or are trivial (simply representing a Minkowski spacetime with a constant or dynamical aether field.).
