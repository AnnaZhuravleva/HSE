This work proposes a stellar model under Gauss-Bonnet $f(\mathcal{G}, T)$ gravity with the conjecture theorised by Mazur and Mottola, well known as the gravitational vacuum stars (gravastars). By taking into account the $f(\mathcal{G},T)$ stellar model, the structure of the gravastar with its exclusive division of three different regions namely, (i) the core interior region (ii) the junction region (shell), and (iii) the exterior region, has been investigated with reference to the existence of energy density, pressure, ultra-relativistic plasma, and repulsive forces. The different physical features like, the equation of the state parameter, length of the shell, entropy, energy-thickness relation of the gravastar shell model have been discussed. Also, some other physically valid aspects have been presented with the connection to non-singular and event-horizon free gravastar solutions, which in contrast to a black hole solution, might be stable without containing any information paradox.
