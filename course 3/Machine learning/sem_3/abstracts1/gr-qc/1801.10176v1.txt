Press and Teukolsky famously introduced the concept of a black hole bomb system: a scalar field scattering a Kerr black hole confined inside a mirror undergoes superradiant amplification that keeps repeating due to the reflecting boundary conditions at the mirror. A similar charged black hole bomb system exists if we have a charged scalar field propagating in a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole confined inside a box. We point out that scalar fields propagating in such a background are unstable not only to superradiance but also to a mechanism known as the near-horizon scalar condensation instability. The two instabilities are typically entangled but we identify regimes in the phase space where one of them is suppressed but the other is present, and vice-versa (we do this explicitly for the charged but non-rotating black hole bomb). These `corners' in the phase space, together with a numerical study of the instabilities allow us to identify accurately the onset of the instabilities. Our results should thus be useful to make educated choices of initial data for the Cauchy problem that follows the time evolution and endpoint of the instabilities. Finally, we use a simple thermodynamic model (that makes no use of the equations of motion) to find the leading order thermodynamic properties of hairy black holes and solitons that should exist as a consequence (and that should be the endpoint) of these instabilities. In a companion publication, we explicitly solve the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar equations of motion to find the properties of these hairy solutions at higher order in perturbation theory.
