Chargeless massive scalar fields are studied in the spacetime of Born-Infeld dilaton black holes (BIDBHs). We first separate the massive covariant Klein-Gordon equation into radial and angular parts and obtain the exact solution of the radial equation in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Using the obtained radial solution, we show how one gets the exact quasinormal modes for some particular cases. We also solve the Klein-Gordon equation solution in the spacetime of a BIDBHs with a cosmic string in which we point out the effect of the conical deficit on the BIDBHs. The analytical solutions of the radial and angular parts are obtained in terms of the confluent Heun functions. Furthermore, we analyze the Hawking radiation in the frameworks of the analytical extension and quantum tunneling methods. Finally, we discuss a possible correspondence between quasinormal modes and Hawking radiation in terms of the effective temperature of the black hole.
