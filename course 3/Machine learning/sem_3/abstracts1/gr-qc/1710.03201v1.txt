The conformal formulation of the Einstein constraint equations has been studied intensively since the modern version of the conformal method was first published in the early 1970's. Proofs of existence and uniqueness of solutions were limited to the decoupled constant mean curvature (CMC) case through 1995, with analogous satisfying results for the near-CMC case beginning to appear in 1996 and after. The first far-from-CMC results appear in 2008-2009, with various extensions appearing since that first set of papers. It was initially hoped that the new results that began to appear in 2008 would lead to a solution theory for the non-CMC case that would mirror the CMC and near-CMC cases; however, the story has become much more complicated. The new existence results in 2008 did not come with uniqueness, and there had already been growing numerical evidence that multiple solutions were possible in the non-CMC case. A careful analysis by Maxwell in 2011 confirmed this feature of the conformal method in the non-CMC case; this was shown more generally very recently by Nguyen. In this article, we apply analytic and numerical continuation techniques to the study of the conformal method, in an attempt to give some insight into what the solution behavior is in the far-from-CMC case in various scenarios. We try to draw some conclusions and make conjectures for the direction of further analytical study of the system.
