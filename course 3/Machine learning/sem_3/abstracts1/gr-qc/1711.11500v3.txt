Rastall gravity, originally developed in 1972, is currently undergoing a significant surge in popularity. Rastall gravity purports to be a modified theory of gravity, with a non-conserved stress-energy tensor, and an unusual non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry, the Rastall stress-energy satisfying nabla_b [T_R]^{ab} = {\lambda/4} g^{ab} nabla_b R. Unfortunately, a deeper look shows that Rastall gravity is completely equivalent to Einstein gravity --- usual general relativity. The gravity sector is completely standard, based as usual on the Einstein tensor, while in the matter sector Rastall's stress-energy tensor corresponds to an artificially isolated part of the physical conserved stress-energy.
