Hao Wei et.al. has claimed in $\mathrm{Phys. Lett. \textbf{B707}, 298 (2012)}$ that Noether symmetry in the context of teleparallel $f(T)$ theory of gravity admits $f(T)\propto T^{n}$, (where $n$ is an arbitrary) in matter domain era in Friedmann- Robertson universe. But, it has been shown that the conserved current obtained under the process does not satisfy the field equations in general. Here, it is shown that Noether Symmetry admits $f(T)\propto T^\frac{3}{2}$ along with a conserved current $ a \dot a T^\frac{1}{2}$ in teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity. Thus, their claim is not correct.
