The problem of classifying boundary points of space-time, for example singularities, regular points and points at infinity, is an unexpectedly subtle one. Due to the fact that whether or not two boundary points are identified or even "nearby" is dependant on the way the space-time is embedded, difficulties occur when singularities are thought of as an inherently local aspect of a space-time, as an analogy with electromagnetism would imply. The completion of a manifold with respect to a pseudo-Riemannian metric can be defined intrinsically, [SS94]. This is done via an equivalence relation, formalising which boundary sets cover other sets. This paper works through the possibilities, providing examples to show that all covering relations not immediately ruled out by the definitions are possible.
