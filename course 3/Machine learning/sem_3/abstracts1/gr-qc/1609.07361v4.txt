In this paper, the top-down approach for the 6-dimensional space has been elaborated. The connection between the cosmological constant and the extra space metric has been obtained. The metric can be found with the necessary accuracy. It is shown that descent from high energies to the low ones leads to the quantum corrections which influence weakly the metric of extra space.
