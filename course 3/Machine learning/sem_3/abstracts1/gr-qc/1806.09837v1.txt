We analyze rigidly rotating Nambu--Goto strings in the Kerr spacetime, particularly focusing on the strings sticking in the horizon. From the regularity on the horizon, we find the condition for sticking in the horizon, which is consistent with the second law of the black hole thermodynamics. Energy extraction through the sticking string from a Kerr black hole occurs. We obtain the maximum value of the luminosity of the energy extraction.
