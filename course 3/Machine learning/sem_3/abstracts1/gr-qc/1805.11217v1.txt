Observations of gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron-star mergers, like GW170817, can be used to constrain the neutron-star equation of state (EoS). One method involves modeling the EoS and measuring the model parameters through Bayesian inference. A previous study \cite{RecoveringNSEOS} demonstrated the effectiveness of using a phenomenologically parameterized piecewise polytrope to extract constraining information from a simulated population of binary neutron-star mergers. Despite its advantages compared to more traditional methods of measuring the tidal deformability of neutron stars, notable deficiencies arise when using this EoS model, including increased posterior width near the stitching densities. In this work, we compare the constraining potential of a piecewise polytropic representation to a model built from a spectral decomposition of the adiabatic index. We find that both models recover consistent tidal information from the simulate signals with tightest constraints on the equation of state around twice nuclear saturation density. Yet, the statistical error that arises in the piecewise polytropic representation near the joining densities is greatly reduced by using the smoother spectral model. These findings suggest that the spectral model can more effectively map tidal information onto EoS constraints. In addition, we find that our choice of prior can have a dominant effect on equation of state constraints.
