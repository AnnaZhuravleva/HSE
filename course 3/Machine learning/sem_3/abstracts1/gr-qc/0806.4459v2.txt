Using the cut-and-paste procedure, we construct static and dynamic plane symmetric wormholes by surgically grafting together two spacetimes of plane symmetric vacuum solutions with a negative cosmological constant. These plane symmetric wormholes may be viewed as domain walls connecting different universes, having planar topology, and upon compactification of one or two coordinates, cylindrical topology or toroidal topology, respectively. A stability analysis is carried out for the dynamic case by taking into account specific equations of state, and a linearized stability analysis around static solutions is also explored. It is found that thin shell wormholes made of a dark energy fluid or of a cosmological constant fluid are stable, while thin shell wormholes made of phantom energy are unstable.
