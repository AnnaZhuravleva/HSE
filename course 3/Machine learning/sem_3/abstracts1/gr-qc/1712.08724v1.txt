We describe a thermal atmosphere around a black hole as vacuum excitations near to gravitational radius of a contracting thin black shell, i.e., in terms of properties of the physical vacuum of fields around a thin shell of mass $M$ collapsing from infinity to the Schwarzschild radius according to an external stationary observer. A natural explanation is introduced for the necessary cutoff using the equations of motion of the shells. We make a thermodynamic description of a fermionic field near the gravitational radius. Then a solution to the species problem for two fields, scalar one and spinor one, is proposed. Finally we get the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as entanglement entropy of a thermal atmosphere, independent from number of fields.
