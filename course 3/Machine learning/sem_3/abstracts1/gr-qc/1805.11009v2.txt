The present paper is aimed to study thermodynamical properties of phase transition for regular charged black holes. In this context, we have considered two different forms of black hole metrics supplemented with exponential and logistic distribution functions and investigated the recent expansion of phase transition through grand canonical ensemble. After exploring the corresponding Ehrenfest's equation, we found the second order background of phase transition at critical points. In order to check the critical behavior of regular black holes, we have evaluated some corresponding explicit relations for the critical temperature, pressure and volume and draw certain graphs with constant values of Smarr's mass. We found that for the BH metric with exponential configuration function, the phase transition curves are divergent near the critical points, while glassy phase transition has been observed for the Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a-Bronnikov BH in $n=5$ dimensions.
