Rotating black hole solutions in theories of modified gravity are important as they offer an arena to test these theories through astrophysical observation. The non-rotating black hole can be hardly tested since the black hole spin is very important in any astrophysical process. We present rotating counterpart of a recently obtained spherically symmetric exact black hole solution surrounded by perfect fluid in the context of Rastall theory, viz, rotating Rastall black hole that generalize the Kerr-Newman black hole solution. In turn, we analyze the specific cases of the Kerr-Newman black holes surrounded by matter like dust and quintessence fields. Interestingly, for a set of parameters and a chosen surrounding field, there exists a critical rotation parameter ($a=a_{E}$), which corresponds to an extremal black hole with degenerate horizons, while for $a<a_{E}$, it describes a non-extremal black hole with Cauchy and event horizons, and no black hole for $a>a_{E}$ with value $a_E$ is also influenced by these parameters. We also discuss the thermodynamical quantities associated with rotating Rastall black holes, and analyze the particle motion with behavior of effective potential.
