We determine the full post-Newtonian limit of theories of gravity that extend general relativity by replacing the Ricci scalar, R, in the generating Lagrangian by some analytic function, f(R). We restrict ourselves to theories that admit Minkowski space as a suitable background, and perform a perturbative expansion in the manner prescribed by the parameterised post-Newtonian formalism. Extra potentials are found to be present that are not accounted for in the usual treatment, and a discussion is provided on how they may be used to observationally distinguished these theories from general relativity at the post-Newtonian level.
