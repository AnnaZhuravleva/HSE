In this paper, we discuss the dynamics of two- scalar-field cosmological models. Unlike in the situation of exponential potential, we find that there are late-time attractors in which one scalar field dominates the energy density of universe and the other one decay. We also discuss the possibility of multiple attractors model which is useful to realize the evolution of the universe from a scaling era to recent acceleration era. We also give the conditions of the existence of multiple attractors.
