Continued observation of PSR J0737-3039, the double pulsar, is expected to yield a precise determination of its primary component's moment of inertia in the near future. Since the moment of inertia depends sensitively on the neutron star's internal structure, such a measurement will constrain the equation of state of ultra-dense matter, which is believed to be universal. Independent equation-of-state constraints have already been established by the gravitational-wave measurement of the neutron-star tidal deformability in GW170817. Here, using a model-independent procedure based on well-known universal relations among neutron star observables, we translate the reported 90%-credible bounds on tidal deformability into a direct constraint, $I_{\star} = 1.15^{+0.38}_{-0.24} \times 10^{45} \text{ g cm}^2$, on the moment of inertia of PSR J0737-3039A. Should a future astrophysical measurement of $I_{\star}$ disagree with this prediction, it could indicate a breakdown in the universality of the neutron-star equation of state.
