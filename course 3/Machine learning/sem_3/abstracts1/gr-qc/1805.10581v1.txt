We study the shadow cast by a large gravitating sphere. For this, we consider the gravitational field produced by a static mass monopole within the first post-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We consider propagation of a monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) wave in the vicinity of the sphere and develop a wave-optical treatment of its shadow. Based on this treatment, we demonstrate that the shadow has a rotational hyperboloid boundary determined by the physical size of the body and its Schwarzschild radius. We show that there is no light within that boundary. However, the shadow boundaries are bent inward by the diffractive effects of spacetime curvature. We provide a wave-optical treatment of this phenomenon.
