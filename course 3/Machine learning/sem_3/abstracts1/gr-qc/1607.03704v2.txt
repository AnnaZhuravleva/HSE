We calculate the maximum interior volume, enclosed by the event horizon, of a ($1+D$)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. Taking into account the mass change due to Hawking radiation, we show that the volume increases towards the end of the evaporation. This fact is not new as it has been observed earlier for four dimensional case. The interesting point we observe is that this increase rate decreases towards the higher value of space dimensions $D$; i.e. it is a decelerated expansion of volume with the increase of spacial dimensions. This implies that for a sufficiently large $D$, the maximum interior volume does not change. The possible implications of these results are also discussed.
