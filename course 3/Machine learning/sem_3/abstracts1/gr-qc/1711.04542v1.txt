Rastall gravity is the modify Einstein general relativity, in which the energy-momentum conservation is assumed to be unsatisfied and generalized to $T^{\mu\nu}_{~~;\mu}=\lambda R^{,\nu}$. In this paper we investigate the Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole solutions surrounded by the scalar field matter of the Einstein-Maxwell equation in Rastall gravity using Newman-Jains method and complex computations. Through analyzing the root numbers of the horizon equation for two situations, we obtain the relations of $\alpha, M$ and $\kappa\lambda$. For the quintessence dark energy ($\omega=-2/3$), if $0<\kappa\lambda$ and $\kappa\lambda\neq 1$, the maximum of $\alpha$ will decrease with the increase of $\kappa\lambda$; if $-2<\kappa\lambda<0$, the maximum of $\alpha$ will become large with the increase of $\mid\kappa\lambda\mid$. For the scalar field dark matter ($\omega=-1/3$), if $0<\kappa\lambda<1$ and $\kappa\lambda\neq 1/2$, the maximum of $\alpha$ will decrease with the increase of $\kappa\lambda$; if $\kappa\lambda<0$, the maximum of $\alpha$ will become large with the increase of $\mid\kappa\lambda\mid$. We also study the influence of scalar field dark matter and quintessential dark energy on ergosphere size. It is found that scalar field matter has significant effect on ergosphere size, while quintessential dark energy has small influence for ergosphere size. The scalar field does not change the singularity of black hole. We also study the rotation velocity on the equatorial plane for quintessential dark energy ($\omega=-2/3$) and scalar field dark matter ($\omega=-1/3$), the parameters $\alpha$ and $\kappa\lambda$ make the shape of rotation velocity to be more different. These results could explain the diversity of rotation curve theoretically.
