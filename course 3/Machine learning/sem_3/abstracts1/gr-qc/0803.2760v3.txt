This work is a comprehensive investigation of the Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) dark energy (DE) model, which is extended to include the 3-loop quantum corrections. We study its cosmic evolution and the possibility of crossing phantom divide $w=-1$, examine in details the Hubble parameter $H$, the deceleration parameter $q$, the statefinder diagnosis $(r,s)$, and the $w-w^\prime$ diagnosis of the model without and with interaction, and compare our results with other DE models. Besides, by using the observational data of type Ia supernovae (SNIa), the shift parameter from cosmic microwave background (CMB), and the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak from large scale structures (LSS), we give the cosmological constraints on 3-loop YMC model. It is found that the model can naturally solve the coincidence problem, and its prediction of the afore-mentioned parameter is much closer to the $\Lambda$CDM model than other dynamics DE models; the introduction of the matter-DE interaction will make the YMC model deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM model, and will give an equation of state (EOF) crossing -1. Moreover, it is also found that, to fit the latest SNIa data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM model is slightly better than the 3-loop YMC model; but in fitting of the combination of SNIa, CMB and LSS data, the 3-loop YMC model performs better than the $\Lambda$CDM model.
