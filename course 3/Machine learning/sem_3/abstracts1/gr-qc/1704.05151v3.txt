Recently, Borzou et al. (BSSY) generalized the Shiromizu-Maeda-Sasaki (SMS) formulation to f(R)-bulks. BSSY brane projected equation carries an additional stress tensor, besides SMS correction for Einstein's theory on the brane. If we change this perspective, by requiring BSSY tensor in the geometrical side acting as f(R)-brane generator, it is possible to relate f(R)-brane/bulk theories, by using curvature dynamical constraint (CDC), concept that we will developed. Since that brane and bulk are f(R), 5/4D scalar curvatures also play a dynamical role and, thus, a dynamical version to Gauss equation trace, or CDC, must be offered. We will work yet in a specific case to obtain f(R)-unimodular gravity, formally identical with obtained by Nojiri et al. (NOO).
