In this paper we present noncommutative version of scalar field cosmology. We find the noncommutative Friedmann equations as well as the noncommutative Klein-Gordon equation. Interestingly the noncommutative contributions are only present up to second order in the noncommutitive parameter. Finally we conclude that if we want a noncommutative minisuperspace with a constant noncommutative parameter as viable phenomenological model, the noncommuative parameter is very small.
