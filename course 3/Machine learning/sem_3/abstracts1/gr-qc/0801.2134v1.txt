Mathisson's spin-gravity coupling and its Larmor-equivalent interaction, namely, the spin-rotation coupling are discussed. The study of the latter leads to a critical examination of the basic role of locality in relativistic physics. The nonlocal theory of accelerated systems is outlined and some of its implications are described.
