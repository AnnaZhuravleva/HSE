In this paper, we will argue that in the infinite derivative gravity, within the scale of non-locality, $1/r$-type singular solution is not {\it permissible}. Therefore, Schwarzschild-like vacuum solution which is a prediction in Einstein-Hilbert gravity will {\it not} persist in the infinite derivative gravity.
