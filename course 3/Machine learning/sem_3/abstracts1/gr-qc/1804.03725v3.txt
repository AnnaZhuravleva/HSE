This presents an elementary discussion generalizing a Weyl type geometry to allow quaternion valued gauge transformations. Classical Yang-Mills fields are a result. Most of this material is condensed from earlier paper arXix:1101.3606 which includes many additional topics not needed for this simple introduction to quaternionic Weyl type geometries with Yang-Mills Fields. This development will assume that the symmetric metric tensor is real in some gauge, and will develop the left and right handed approaches to quaternion valued gauge transformations. It will also utilize natural definitions of genuinely gauge invariant, dimensionless variables suitable for physics, and for use as a general formalism to describe these geometries, including General Relativity, in rather general circumstances.
