The slow-roll inflation for a single scalar field that couples to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term represents an important higher-order curvature correction inspired by string theory. With the arrival of the era of precision cosmology, it is expected that the high-order corrections become more and more important. In this paper we study the observational predictions of the slow-roll inflation with the GB term by using the third-order uniform asymptotic approximation method. We calculate explicitly the primordial power spectra, spectral indices, running of the spectral indices for both scalar and tensor perturbations, and the ratio between tensor and scalar spectra. These expressions are all written in terms of the Hubble and GB coupling flow parameters and expanded up to the next-to-leading order in the slow-roll expansions. The upper bounds of errors of the approximations at the third-order are $0.15\%$, so they represent the most accurate results obtained so far in the literature. We expect that the understanding of the GB corrections in the primordial spectra and their constraints by forthcoming observational data will provide clues for the UV complete theory of quantum gravity, such as the string/M-theory.
