In our previous works, we have analyzed the evolution of bulk viscous matter dominated universe with a more general form for bulk viscous coefficient, $\zeta=\zeta_{0}+\zeta_{1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}+\zeta_{2}\frac{\ddot{a}}{\dot{a}}$ and also carried out the dynamical system analysis. We found that the model reasonably describes the evolution of the universe if the viscous coefficient is a constant. In the present work we are contrasting this model with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of the universe using the Bayesian method. We have shown that, even though the viscous model gives a reasonable back ground evolution of the universe, the Bayes factor of the model indicates that, it is not so superior over the $\Lambda$CDM model, but have a slight advantage over it.
