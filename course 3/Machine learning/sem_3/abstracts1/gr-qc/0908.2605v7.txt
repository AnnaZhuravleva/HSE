Berezin integration of functions of anticommuting Grassmann variables is usually seen as a formal operation, sometimes even defined via differentiation. Using the formalism of geometric algebra and geometric calculus in which the Grassmann numbers are endowed with a second associative product coming from a Clifford algebra structure, we show how Berezin integrals may be realized in the high dimensional limit as integrals in the sense of geometric calculus.
