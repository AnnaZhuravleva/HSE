Quantum gravity has become a fertile interface between gravitational physics and quantum many-body physics, with its double goal of identifying the microscopic constituents of the universe and their fundamental dynamics, and of understanding their collective properties and how spacetime and geometry themselves emerge from them at macroscopic scales. In this brief contribution, we outline the problem of quantum gravity from this emergent spacetime perspective, and discuss some examples in which ideas and methods from quantum many-body systems have found a central role in quantum gravity research.
