We consider static neutron stars within the framework of $R^2$ gravity. The neutron fluid is described by three different types of realistic equations of state (soft, moderately stiff, and stiff). Using the observational data on the neutron star mass-radius relation, it is demonstrated that the characteristics of the objects supported by the isotropic fluid agree with the observations only if one uses the soft equation of state. We show that the inclusion of the fluid anisotropy enables one also to employ more stiff equations of state to model configurations that will satisfy the observational constraints sufficiently. Also, using the standard thin accretion disk model, we demonstrate potentially observable differences, which allow us to distinguish the neutron stars constructed within the modified gravity framework from those described in Einstein's general relativity.
