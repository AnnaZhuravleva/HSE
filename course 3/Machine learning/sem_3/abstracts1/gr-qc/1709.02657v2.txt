General relativity is incomplete because it cannot describe quantum effects of space-time. The complete theory of quantum gravity is not yet known and to date no observational evidence exists that space-time is quantized. However, in most approaches to quantum gravity the space-time manifold of general relativity is only an effective limit that, among other things like higher curvature terms, should receive corrections stemming from space-time defects. We here develop a modification of general relativity that describes local space-time defects and solve the Friedmann equations. From this, we obtain the time-dependence of the density of defects. It turns out that the defects' density dilutes quickly, somewhat faster even than radiation.
