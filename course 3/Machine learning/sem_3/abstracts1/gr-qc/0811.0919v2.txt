In this work, we find exact wormhole solutions in the context of noncommutative geometry, and further explore their physical properties and characteristics. The energy density of these wormhole geometries is a smeared and particle-like gravitational source, where the mass is diffused throughout a region of linear dimension $\sqrt{\alpha}$ due to the intrinsic uncertainty encoded in the coordinate commutator. Furthermore, we also analyze these wormhole geometries considering that the equation governing quantum fluctuations behaves as a backreaction equation. In particular, the energy density of the graviton one loop contribution to a classical energy in a traversable wormhole background and the finite one loop energy density is considered as a self-consistent source for these wormhole geometries. Interesting solutions are found for an appropriate range of the parameters, validating the perturbative computation introduced in this semi-classical approach.
