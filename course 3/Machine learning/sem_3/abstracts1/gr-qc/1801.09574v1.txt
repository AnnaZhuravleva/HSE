In this paper, we consider a static black hole in $f(R)$ gravity. We recapitulate the expression for corrected thermodynamic entropy of this black hole due to small fluctuations around equilibrium. Also, we study the geometrothermodynamics (GTD) of this black hole and investigate the adaptability of the curvature scalar of geothermodynamic methods with phase transition points of this black hole. Moreover, we point out the effect of $ \alpha $ parameter on thermodynamic behavior of this black hole. As a result, we see that, the singular point of the curvature scalar of Ruppeiner metric is completely coincided with zero point of the heat capacity and by increasing $ \alpha $, this match will be less.
