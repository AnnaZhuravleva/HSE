We investigate the shadow cast or silhouette by rotating dyon black hole, namely Kerr-Newman-Kasuya (KNK) spacetime. It was shown that in addition to the angular momentum of the black hole, the dyon charge also affects the shadow image of the KNK black hole. Moreover, we analyze the weak gravitational lensing by the KNK black hole by using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Finally, we find that extra dyon charge decreases the deflection angle and also shadow of the KNK black hole.
