One of the serious open problems of theoretical physics is to find a consistent quantum gravity theory. Recent developments in thermodynamic phase transition of black holes and their van der Waals like behavior may provide an interesting quantum interpretation of classical gravity. Studying different methods for investigating phase transition can deepen our insight into the nature of quantum gravity. In this paper, we present a new theoretical prescription for finding out thermodynamic phase transition in the extended phase space. Unlike standard method of the usual equation of state which is according to temperature, our new prescription is based on a new typical equation of state which is originating from the slope of temperature versus entropy. This new prescription addresses some of the shortcomings of other usual methods and provides a simple powerful way for studying critical behavior of a thermodynamical system in more details. Among the achievements of the new prescription, we emphasize to addressing the problem of ensemble dependency, analytical demonstration of possible phase transition points and denoting the nonphysical range of horizon radius for the black holes.
