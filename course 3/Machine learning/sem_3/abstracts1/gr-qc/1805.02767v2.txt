Starting from a real scalar quantum field theory with quartic self-interactions and non-minimal coupling to classical gravity, we define four equal-time, spatially covariant phase-space operators through a Wigner transformation of spatially translated canonical operators within a 3+1 decomposition. A subset of these operators can be interpreted as fluctuating particle densities in phase-space whenever the quantum state of the system allows for a classical limit. We come to this conclusion by expressing hydrodynamic variables through the expectation values of these operators and moreover, by deriving the dynamics of the expectation values within a spatial gradient expansion and a 1-loop approximation which subsequently yields the Vlasov equation with a self-mass correction as a limit. We keep an arbitrary classical metric in the 3+1 decomposition which is assumed to be determined semi-classically. Our formalism allows to systematically study the transition from quantum field theory in curved space-time to classical particle physics for this minimal model of self-interacting, gravitating matter. As an application we show how to include relativistic and self-interaction corrections to existing dark matter models in a kinetic description by taking into account the gravitational slip, vector perturbations and tensor perturbations.
