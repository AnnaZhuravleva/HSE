We prove the theorem: The second order quasi-linear differential operator as a second rank divergence free tensor in the equation of motion for gravitation could always be derived from the trace of the Bianchi derivative of the fourth rank tensor, which is a homogeneous polynomial in curvatures. The existence of such a tensor for each term in the polynomial Lagrangian is a new characterization of the Lovelock gravity.
