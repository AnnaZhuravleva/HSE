Interested in the collapse of a radiating star, we study the temporal evolution of a fluid with heat flux and bulk viscosity, including anisotropic pressure. As a starting point, we adopt an initial configuration that satisfies the regularities conditions as well as the energy conditions to a certain range of the mass-radius ratio for the star, defining acceptable models. For this set of models, we verify that the energy conditions remain satisfied during all the process of collapse until the black hole formation. Astrophysical relevant quantities, such as the luminosity perceived by an observer at infinity, the time of event horizon formation and the loss of mass during the collapse are presented.
