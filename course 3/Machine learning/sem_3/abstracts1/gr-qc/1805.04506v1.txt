This work aims to study consequences of \textit{combined variable field theory} developed in [1] by analysing FLRW models of gravity. It shows $\Phi_{q \rightarrow 0} \rightarrow \infty$ is the Big bang in combined variable field theoretic settings. Nature of the Universe depends on the new parameter $k$ appearing in the theory. Flat Universe has two disconnected branches namely expanding and collapsing Universe. Combined variable field for closed Universe is complex in general. Whereas, the theory of open Universe is necessarily self-coupled combined variable field theory. But in the large $r$ limit it reduces to the theory of flat Universe. Resolution of the classical Big bang is a result of quantisation program. Quantum theory predicts that the size of Universe was non-zero in the beginning. Combined variable field quantum in absence of scalar field couplings is interpreted as a quantum of the space. The energy spectrum of this combined variable field quantum varies with time.
