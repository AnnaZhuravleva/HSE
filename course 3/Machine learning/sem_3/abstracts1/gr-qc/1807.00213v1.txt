We investigate the ghost model of dark energy in the framework of DGP braneworld. We explore the cosmological consequences of this model by determining the equation of state parameter, $\omega_D$, the deceleration and the density parameters. We also examine the stability of this model by studying the squared of the sound speed in the presence/absence of interaction term between dark energy and dark matter. We find out that in the absence of interaction between two dark sectors of the Universe we have $\omega_D\rightarrow -1$ in the late time, while in the presence of interaction $\omega_D$ can cross the phantom line $-1$. In both cases the squared of sound speed $v_s^2$ does not show any signal of stability. We also determine the statefinder diagnosis of this model as well as the $\omega_D-{\omega}^{\prime}_{D}$ plane and compare the results with the $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that $\omega_D-{\omega}^{\prime}_{D}$ plane meets the freezing region in the absence of interaction between two dark sectors, while it meets both the thawing and the freezing regions in the interacting case.
