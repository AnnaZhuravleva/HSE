General relativistic quantum interference effects in the slowly rotating NUT space-time as the Sagnac effect and the phase shift effect of interfering particle in neutron interferometer are considered. It was found that in the case of the Sagnac effect the influence of NUT parameter is becoming important due to the fact that the angular velocity of the locally non rotating observer must be larger than one in the Kerr space-time. In the case of neutron interferometry it is found that due to the presence of NUT-parameter an additional term in the phase shift of interfering particle emerges. This term can be, in principle, detected by sensitive interferometer and derived results can be further used in experiments to detect the gravitomagnetic charge. Finally, as an example, we apply the obtained results to the calculation of the UCN (ultra-cold neutrons) energy level modification in the slowly rotating NUT space-time.
