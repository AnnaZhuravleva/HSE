We study the growth rate of matter perturbations in the context of teleparallel dark energy with flat curvature. We investigate the dynamics of different theoretical scenarios based on specific forms of the scalar field potential. Allowing for non-minimal coupling between torsion scalar and scalar field, we perform a phase-space analysis of the autonomous systems of equations through the study of critical points. We thus analyze the stability of the critical points, and discuss the cosmological implications searching for possible attractor solutions at late times. Furthermore, using the latest available growth rate data, we place observational constraints on the cosmological parameters of the models through Monte Carlo numerical method. We find that the scenario with a non-minimal coupling is favoured with respect to the standard quintessence case. Also, the matter fluctuations amplitude is consistent with the most recent findings of the Planck collaboration. Finally, we compared our results with the predictions of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model.
