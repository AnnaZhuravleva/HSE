This paper focuses on the motion of a test particle moving around the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. It deals with circular motion and radial motion of the neutral massive test particles, and shortly handles circular motion of the charged massive test particles. Both neutral and charged particles are affected by black hole's charge, but it is due to the fact that charge of the black hole bends the spacetime more strongly. This procedure has nothing to do with electromagnetic interactions, and these are only considered for charged test particles. However, it only treats mathematically easy, approximated situations and general motions and complex motions will not be discussed. This paper has tried to get some physical information only with the easiest mathematical tools and without difficult concepts that general relativity contains. Contents of this paper would be suitable for those who want to know something about the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, but does not have much knowledge in this field. They can begin their intellectual journey with this paper.
