The purpose of this paper is to obtain exact solutions for charged anisotropic spherically symmetric matter configuration. For this purpose, we consider known solution for isotropic spherical system in the presence of electromagnetic field and extend it to two types of anisotropic charged solutions through gravitational decoupling approach. We examine physical characteristics of the resulting models. It is found that only first solution is physically acceptable as it meets all the energy bounds as well as stability criterion. We conclude that stability of the first model is enhanced with the increase of charge.
