This paper is a reply to the criticism of our work on particle production in modified gravity by D. Gorbunov and A. Tokareva. We show that their arguments against efficient particle production are invalid. $F(R)$ theories can lead to an efficient generation of high energy cosmic rays in contracting systems.
