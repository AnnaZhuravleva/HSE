In the present work, we have made an attempt to investigate the dark energy possibility from the thermodynamical point of view. For this purpose, we have studied thermodynamic stability of three popular dark energy models in the framework of an expanding, homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat FRW Universe filled with dark energy and cold dark matter. The models considered in this work are Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) model, Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model and Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) model. By considering the cosmic components (dark energy and cold dark matter) as perfect fluid, we have examined the constraints imposed on the total equation of state parameter ($w_{T}$) of the dark fluid by thermodynamics and found that the phantom nature ($w_{T}<-1$) is not thermodynamically stable. Our investigation indicates that the dark fluid models (CPL, GCG and MCG) are thermodynamically stable under some restrictions of the parameters of each model.
