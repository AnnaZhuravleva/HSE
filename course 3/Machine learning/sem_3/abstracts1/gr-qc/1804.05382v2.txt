In the celebrated Unruh effect, we learn that a uniformly accelerating detector in a Minkowski vacuum spacetime registers a constant temperature. Building on prior work, we present a technique based on derivative couplings of the two-point Wightman function and the Hadamard renormalization procedure to define an instantaneous temperature for a massive scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity. We find the temperature contains local contributions from the acceleration of the detector, the curvature of spacetime, and the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the field. Our result, which can be considered as a generalized Stefan-Boltzmann law for curved spacetimes, agrees with the familiar expressions found in 4D Rindler, thermal Minkowski, and de Sitter.
