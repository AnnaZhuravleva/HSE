In this article we have investigated the possibility of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in a frame undergoing uniform acceleration or in other wards, in Rindler space associated with the uniformly accelerated frame. We have followed a very simple conventional technique generally used in text book level studies. It has been observed that the critical temperature for BEC increases with the increase in magnitude of acceleration of the frame. Typically the critical temperature in an accelerated frame is of the order of the Unruh temperature. Hence we have concluded that the increase in the magnitude of acceleration of the frame facilitates the formation of condensed phase.
