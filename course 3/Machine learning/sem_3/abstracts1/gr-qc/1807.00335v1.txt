In this work we study certain classes of $F(R,{\cal G})$ gravity which have appealing phenomenological features, with respect to the successful realization of the dark energy and of the inflationary era. Particularly, we discuss the general formalism and we demonstrate how several inflationary and dark energy evolutions can be described in the context of $F(R,{\cal G})$ gravity. Also we propose a unified model, in the context of which the early and late-time dynamics are controlled by the $F(R,{\cal G})$ gravity, thus producing inflation and the dark energy era, while the intermediate era is approximately identical with standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Also we calculate the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations corresponding to the unified $F(R,{\cal G})$ gravity model we propose, which as we demonstrate is nearly scale invariant and compatible with the latest observational data constraints.
