The post-Newtonian approximation is useful to discuss gravitational waveforms for binary inspirals. In this note, for retrograde circular orbits in the equatorial plane, we discuss the region of validity of the post-Newtonian approximation by using the gravitational energy flux derived numerically and analytically in the black hole perturbation approach. It is found that the edge of the allowable region behaves quite intricately, including prograde orbits even if we treat higher post-Newtonian orders.
