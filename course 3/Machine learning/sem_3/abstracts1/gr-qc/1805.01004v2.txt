Regularity singularities are points in spacetime where the gravitational metric tensor of General Relativity fails to be at least two levels more regular than its curvature tensor. Whether regularity singularities exist for shock wave solutions constructed by the Glimm scheme in GR is an open problem. In this paper we address the problem at the general level of connections $\Gamma\in W^{m,p}$ satisfying $d\Gamma\in W^{m,p}$ as well, and ask the question as to whether there always exists a coordinate transformation with Jacobian $J\in W^{m+1,p}$ that smooths the connection by one order. Introducing a new approach to this problem, we derive a system of nonlinear elliptic Poisson equations, which we call the Regularity Transformation equations (RT-equations), with matrix-valued differential forms as unknowns, and prove that the existence of solutions to these equations is equivalent to the Riemann-flat condition, which was shown by authors to be equivalent to the existence of a coordinate transformation smoothing the connection by one order. Different from earlier approaches to optimal metric regularity, our method does not employ any apriori coordinate ansatz. In a forthcoming paper authors establish an existence theory for the RT-equations at the level of smoothness $m\geq1$, and a mathematical framework for extending the existence theory to the $L^{\infty}$ case of shock waves is proposed in the final section.
