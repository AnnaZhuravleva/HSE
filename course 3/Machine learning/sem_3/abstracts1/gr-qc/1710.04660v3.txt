We present a direct, geometric derivation of the generalized Smarr formula for the stationary axially symmetric black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields. The additional term is proven to be proportional to the integral of the trace of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor and can be written as a product of two conjugate variables. From the novel relation we can deduce all previously proposed forms of the generalized Smarr formula, which were derived only for the spherically symmetric black holes, and provide the lowest order quantum correction to the classical relation from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian.
