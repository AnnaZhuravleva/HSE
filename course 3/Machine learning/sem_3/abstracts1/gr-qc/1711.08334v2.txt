One out of many emerging implications from solutions of Einstein's general relativity equations are closed timelike curves (CTCs), which are trajectories through spacetime that loop back on themselves in the form of wormholes. Two main quantum models of computation with the use of CTCs were introduced by Deutsch (D-CTC) and by Bennett and Schumacher (P-CTC). Unlike the classical theory in which CTCs lead to logical paradoxes, the quantum D-CTC model provides a solution that is logically consistent due to the self-consistency condition imposed on the evolving system, whereas the quantum P-CTC model chooses such solution through post-selection. Both models are non-equivalent and imply nonstandard phenomena in the field of quantum computation and quantum mechanics. In this work we study the implications of these two models on the second law of thermodynamics -- the fundamental principle which states that in the isolated system the entropy never decreases. In particular, we construct CTC-based quantum circuits which lead to decrease of entropy.
