We formulate the autonomous dynamical system approach to $f(R)$ gravity in terms of expansion normalized variables for the case of homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi-I spacetimes. We show that, although there are three different scale factors in three different Cartesian directions, there is only one single variable, characterizing the total amount of anisotropy in the metric, that enters into the dynamics. We then proceed to apply this dynamical system approach to analyze the stability of Starobinski's inflationary solution.
