We reexamined the gravitational time delay of light, allowing for various models of modified gravity. We clarify the dependence of the time delay (and induced frequency shift) on modified gravity models and investigate how to distinguish those models, when light propagates in static spherically symmetric spacetimes. Thus experiments by radio signal from spacecrafts at very different distances from Sun and future space-borne laser interferometric detectors could be a probe of modified gravity in the solar system.
