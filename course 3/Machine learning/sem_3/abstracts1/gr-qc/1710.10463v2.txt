We investigate a compact spherically symmetric relativistic body with anisotropic particle pressure profiles. The distribution possesses characteristics relevant to modeling compact stars within the framework of general relativity. For this purpose, we consider a spatial metric potential of Korkina and Orlyanskii [Ukr. Phys. J. 36, 885 (1991)] type in order to solve the Einstein field equations. An additional prescription we make is that the pressure anisotropy parameter takes the functional form proposed by Lake [Phys. Rev. D 67, 104015 (2003)]. Specifying these two geometric quantities allows for further analysis to be carried out in determining unknown constants and obtaining a limit of the mass-radius diagram, which adequately describes compact strange star candidates like Her X-1 and SMC X-1. Using the anisotropic Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we explore the hydrostatic equilibrium and the stability of such compact objects. Then, we investigate other physical features of this models, such as the energy conditions, speeds of sound and compactness of the star in detail and show that our results satisfy all the required elementary conditions for a physically acceptable stellar model. The results obtained are useful in analyzing the stability of other anisotropic compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, and gravastars.
