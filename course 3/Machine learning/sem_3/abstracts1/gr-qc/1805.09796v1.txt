We investigate stationary rotationally symmetric solutions of a particular truncation of Horndeski theory in three dimensions, including a non-minimal scalar kinetic coupling term proportional to the Einstein symmetric tensor. After discussing the special case of a vanishing scalar charge, which includes most of the previously known solutions, we reduce the general case to an effective mechanical model in a three-dimensional target space. We analyze the possible near-horizon behaviors, and conclude that regular black hole solutions with degenerate horizons and constant curvature asymptotics could exist, provided only that the minimal and non-minimal scalar coupling constants have the same sign. In a special case, we find a new analytic regular rotating black hole solution with degenerate horizon. This is geodesically and causally complete, and asymptotic to the extreme BTZ metric. We also briefly discuss soliton solutions in another special case.
