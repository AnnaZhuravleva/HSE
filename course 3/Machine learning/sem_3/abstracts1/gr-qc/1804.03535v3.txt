The Horndeski theories are extended into the Lovelock gravity theory. When the canonical scalar field is uniquely kinetically coupled to the Lovelock tensors, it is named after Lovelock scalar field. The Lovelock scalar field model is a subclass of the new Horndeski theories. A most attractive feature of the Lovelock scalar field is its equation of motion is second order. So it is free of ghosts. We study the cosmology of Lovelock scalar field in the background of $7$ dimensional spacetime and present a class of cosmic solutions. These solutions reveal the physics of the scalar field is rather rich and merit further study.
