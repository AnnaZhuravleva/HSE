Cosmic expansion is expected to influence on the size of black hole shadow observed by comoving observer. Except the simplest case of Schwarzschild black hole in de Sitter universe, analytical approach for calculation of shadow size in expanding universe is still not developed. In this paper we present approximate method based on using angular size redshift relation. This approach is appropriate for general case of any multicomponent universe (with matter, radiation and dark energy). In particular, we have shown that supermassive black holes at large cosmological distances in the universe with matter may give a shadow size approaching to the shadow size of the black hole in the center of our galaxy, and present sensitivity limits.
