Dynamics of eternal inflation on the landscape admits description in terms of the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) effective field theory that is in one-to-one correspondence with vacuum dynamics equations. On those sectors of the landscape, where transport properties of the probability measure for eternal inflation are important, renormalization group fixed points of the MSR effective action determine late time behavior of the probability measure. I argue that these RG fixed points may be relevant for the solution of the gauge invariance problem for eternal inflation.
