In a seminal paper by Brown et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, no. 19, 191301 (2016)] a new conjecture was proposed, namely it was argued that the quantum complexity of a holographic state is equal to action of a Wheeler-DeWitt patch in the late time limit suggesting that the fastest computer in nature are the black holes. Motivated by this conjecture, in the present paper, we study the action growth rate for different types of black holes such as dyonic, nonlinear charge, stringy hair, black hole with a global monopole and a cosmic string. In general we find that action growth rates of the Wheeler-DeWitt patch is finite for these black holes at the late time approach and satisfy the Lloyd bound on the rate of quantum computation. Furthermore, in the case of a charged as well as the neutral black hole with a global monopole and a conical defect we show that the form of the Lloyd bound relation remains unaltered but the energy is modified due to the nontrivial global topology of the spacetime.
