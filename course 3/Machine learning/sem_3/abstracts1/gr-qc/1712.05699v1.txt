In this paper, we examine static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in generalized $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. To do this, we consider three different kind of fluids: anisotropic, barotropic and isotropic. We explore different $f(R,\phi)$ models and inspect the energy conditions for all of those three fluids. It is found that under some models in this theory, it is possible to obtain wormhole solutions without requiring exotic matter. The discussion about the conditions where the standard energy conditions (WEC and NEC) are valid for the fluids is discussed in details. From our results and for our cases, we conclude that for anisotropic and isotropic fluids, realistic wormhole geometries satisfying the energy conditions can be constructed.
