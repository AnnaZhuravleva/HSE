Using three different energy-momentum complexes, the Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, and Papapetrou prescriptions, we calculate the energy of an electrically charged black hole exact solution with a self-interacting, minimally-coupled scalar field and the asymptotic region locally an Anti-deSitter spacetime. Writing the metric in Kerr-Schild Cartesian coordinates, we demonstrate that this metric belongs to the Kerr-Schild class of solutions. Applying each of the three energy-momentum prescriptions and comparing the results, we find consistency among these complexes, suggesting their utility as localized measures of energy.
