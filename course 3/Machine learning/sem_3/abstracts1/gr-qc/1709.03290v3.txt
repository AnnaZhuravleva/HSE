We study the deep connections between the concepts of quantum information theory and cosmology. Employing Fermi normal coordinates and conformal Fermi coordinates, we construct a relation between Friedmann equations of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe and entanglement. Friedmann equations are derived with the first law of entanglement under the assumption that entanglement entropy in a geodesic balls is maximized at fixed volume.
