We investigate bouncing scenario in the modified $f(T)$ gravity, $T$ being the torsion scalar. Attention is attached to the reconstruction of $f(T)$ able to describe type IV singular bouncing evolution, where we adopt as assumption that the bouncing and type IV singularity points coincide. In the context of the reconstructed $f(T)$ model we calculate the Hubble slow-roll parameters in order to determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system under study. The results show that the Hubble slow-roll parameters become singular at the type IV singularity indicating a dynamical instability. Moreover we perform the stability analysis of the $f(T)$ gravity solution where, according to the obtained result, the type IV singularity point is a saddle point in agreement with the bounce scenario.
