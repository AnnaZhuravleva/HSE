We develop a type of Kaluza-Klein formalism in $(4+4)$-dimensions. In the framework of this formalism we obtain a new kind of Schwarzschild metric solutions that via Kruskal-Szequeres can be interpreted as mirror black and white holes. We found that this new type of mirror black and white holes solutions in $(3+1)$-dimensions support the idea that the original space-time can be extended to $(4+4)$-signature.   Using octonions, we also discus linearized gravity in $(4+4)$-dimensions.
