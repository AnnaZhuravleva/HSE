It was known long ago that quantum theory and general relativity, two pillars of modern physics, are in sharp conflict in their foundations. Their fundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the most challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an informationally-complete quantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge fields, and gravity as an elementary trinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. We then argue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework of unifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter entanglement and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's arrow. The trinary field is characterized by dual entanglement and dual dynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical predictions of the theory and allows us to give a correct classical limit (i.e., classical Einstein equation), a theoretical definition of dark energy, and a natural generalization of the holographic principle. We predict the interior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally information-complete.
