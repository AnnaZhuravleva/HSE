We present a new method for constructing conformal Yano-Killing tensors in five-di\-men\-sio\-nal Anti-de Sitter space-time. The found tensors are represented in two different coordinate systems. We also discuss, in terms of CYK tensors, global charges which are well defined for asymptotically (five-dimensional) Anti-de Sitter space-time. Additionally in Appendix we present our own derivation of conformal Killing one-forms in four-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space-time as an application of the Theorem presented in the paper.
