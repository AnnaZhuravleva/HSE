This article is devoted to static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of dRGT (de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley) massive gravity in the presence of cosmological constant. The unitary and non-unitary gauges are used to find the solutions in three, four and five dimensions. We show that there are two general classes of solutions. In one of them, the effect of massive potential is appeared as the effective cosmological constant. By investigating these solutions in different dimensions, we find an expression for effective cosmological constant in arbitrary dimensions.
