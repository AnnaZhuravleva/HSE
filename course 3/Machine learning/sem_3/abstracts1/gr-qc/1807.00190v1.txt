In this study, the mechanism of particle creation using varying gravitational and cosmological constants and deceleration parameter has been studied for Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) at high dimensions. We have considered the ansatz for the scale factor of the form $a(t)=\sqrt{t^{\alpha}e^{t}}$ and $a(t)=\sqrt{\sin h(kt)}$ and used this ansatz to solve the Einstein Field equation. Changes in various cosmological quantities have been studied. Especially with the increase in the number of dimensions, it has seen that additional contributions have been made in the changes in these parameters.
