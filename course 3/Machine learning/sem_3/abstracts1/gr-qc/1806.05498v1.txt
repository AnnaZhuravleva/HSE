The features of correlated Michelson interferometers are for describing the analysis of Einsteinian spacetime models, and the quantum geometries pertinent with descriptions of GR compatible with particle Physics. Such apparati allow for the spectral decomposition of fractional Planck-scale displacements correlations and fractional Plancktime- interval correlations for kinematical investigations in particle Physics on emerging Minkowski background, and for models which admit GR as a limit after cosmological implementations for Poincar\'e particles content.
