We analyse the universe homogeneously filled up by different dark energies. We calculate the relations between time and the scale factor. We thoroughly check the differences to be obtained with the changes of different parameters. $t$ vs $a(t)$ curves are studied. Physical differences between several dark energy models are studied. We conclude about the future singularities to be occurred.
