It has been shown by explicit and exact calculation that the geometric product formula i.e. area (or entropy) product formula of outer horizon (${\cal H}^{+}$) and inner horizon (${\cal H}^{-}$) for charged accelerating black hole (BH) should \emph{ neither be mass-independent nor it be quantized}. This implies that the area (or entropy ) product is mass-indepedent conjecture has been \emph{broken down} for charged accelerating BH. This also further implies that the mass-independent feature of the area product of ${\cal H}^{\pm}$ is \emph{not} a generic feature at all. We also compute that the \emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this BH. Moreover, we compute the specific heat for this BH to determine the local thermodynamic stability of this BH. Under certain criterion, the BH shows the second order phase transition. Furthermore, we compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy for the said BH due to small statistical fluctuations around the thermal equilibrium.
