We study electrically charged compact stars in the framework of extended theory of gravity (ETG). We assume that the charge density is proportional to the energy density. The polytropic equation of state is chosen to describe the state of the charged perfect fluid. We aim to find the Oppenheimer Volkoff (OV) mass limit for charged compact stars. A detailed numerical study is performed. We show the dependence of the mass-radius diagram of the spheres on the values of the perturbatif parameter $\beta$, the polytropic exponent $\gamma$ and the charge fraction $\alpha$. Our results are compared with those found in the literature in the case of applying General Relativity (GR).
