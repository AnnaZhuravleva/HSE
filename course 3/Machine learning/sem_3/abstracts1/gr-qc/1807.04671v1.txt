We discuss the relation between canonical and metric energy-momentum tensors for field theories with actions that can depend on the higher derivatives of tensor fields in a flat spacetime. In order to obtain it we use a modification of the Noether's procedure for curved space-time. For considered case the difference between these two tensors turns out to have more general form than for theories with no more than first order derivatives. Despite this fact we prove that the difference between corresponding integrals of motion still has the form of integral over 2-dimensional surface that is infinitely remote in the spacelike directions.
