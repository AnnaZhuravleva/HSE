In this paper, we have studied the interacting and non-interacting dark energy and dark matter in the spatially homogenous and anisotropic Bianchi type-I model in the Brans- Dicke theory of gravitation. The field equations have been solved by using (i) power-law relation and (ii) by assuming scale factor in terms of redshift. Here we have considered two cases of an interacting and non-interacting dark energy scenario and obtained general results. It has been found that for suitable choice of interaction between dark energy and dark matter we can avoid the coincidence problem which appears in the model. Some physical aspects and stability of the models are discussed in detail. The statefinder diagnostic pair i.e. {r, s} is adopted to differentiate our dark energy models.
