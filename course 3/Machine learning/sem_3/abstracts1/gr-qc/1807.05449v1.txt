We present the first numerical models of differentially rotating stars in alternative theories of gravity. We chose a particular class of scalar-tensor theories of gravity that is indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime but can lead to significant deviations when strong fields are considered. We show that the maximum mass that a differentially rotating neutron star can sustain increases significantly for scalarized solutions and such stars can reach larger angular momenta. In addition, the presence of a nontrivial scalar field has the effect of increasing the required axis ratio for reaching a given value of angular momentum, when compared to a corresponding model of same rest mass in general relativity. We find that the scalar field also makes rapidly rotating models less quasi-toroidal than their general-relativistic counterparts. For large values of the angular momentum and values of the coupling parameter that are in agreement with the observations, we find a second turning point for scalarized models along constant angular momentum sequences, which could have interesting implications for the stability of remnants created in a binary neutron star merger.
