Wormholes are one of the most interesting topological features in spacetime, offering a rat run between two vastly separated regions of the universe. In this paper, we study the deflection angle of light by wormholes, which are supported by electric charge, magnetic charge, and scalar fields in the weak field limit approximation. To this end, we apply new geometric methods -- the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the optical geometry -- to compute the deflection angles. We also verify our findings by using the well-known geodesics method. There exists a similarity between the charge and the quantum corrections on a black hole solution, which has been recently discussed in the context of the relativistic Bohmian quantum mechanics. By replacing classical geodesics with Bohmian trajectories, we introduce a new wormhole solution, whose having matter sources and anisotropic pressure supported by Bohmian quantum effects. The problem of fulfillment of the energy conditions of the Morris-Thorne traversable wormhole is also discussed.
