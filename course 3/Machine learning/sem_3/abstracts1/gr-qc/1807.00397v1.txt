We consider the cosmological models based on Palatini f(R)-theory for the function f(R)=aR-2bR^2-3c/R, which, when only dust visible matter is considered, is called dune cosmology in view of the shape of the function f(R(a)) (being a the scale factor). We discuss about the meaning of solving the model, and interpret it according to Ehlers-Pirani-Schild framework as defining a Weyl geometry on spacetime. Accordingly, we extend the definitions of luminosity distance, proper distance, and redshift to Weyl geometries and fit the values of parameters to SNIa data.
