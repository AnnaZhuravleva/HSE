The Palatini's device is applied to generate teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity. From the latter is discovered an exceptional class which is consistent with a vanishing affine connection. Based on this remarkable property, this Letter proposes a simpler geometrical formulation of General Relativity that is oblivious to the affine spacetime structure, thus fundamentally depriving gravity from any inertial character. The resulting theory is described by the Einstein-Hilbert action purged from the boundary term and is more robustly underpinned by the spin-2 field theory. This construction also provides a novel starting point for modified gravity theories, and the Letter presents new and simple generalisations where analytical self-accelerating cosmological solutions arise naturally in the early and late time universe.
