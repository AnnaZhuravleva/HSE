The rotating Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black holes, apart from mass ($M$) and rotation parameter ($a$), has an additional charge $Q$ and encompassed the Kerr black hole as particular case when $Q=0$. We demonstrate the ergoregions of rotating ABG black holes depend on both rotation parameter $a$ and charge $Q$, and the area of the ergoregions increases with increase in the values of $Q$, when compared with the Kerr black hole and the extremal regular black hole changes with the value of $Q$. Ban{\~a}dos, Silk and West (BSW) demonstrated that an extremal Kerr black hole can act as a particle accelerator with arbitrarily high center-of-mass energy ($E_{CM}$) when the collision takes place at any point in the ergoregion and thus in turn provides a suitable framework for Plank-scale physics. We study the collision of two general particles with different masses falling freely from rest in the equatorial plane of a rotating ABG black hole near the event horizon and find that the $E_{CM}$ of two colliding particles is arbitrarily high when one of the particles take a critical value of angular momentum in the extremal case, whereas for nonextremal case $E_{CM}$ for a pair of colliding particles is generically divergent at the inner horizon, and explicitly studying the effect of charge $Q$ on the $E_{CM}$ for ABG black hole. In particular, our results in the limit $Q\rightarrow 0$ reduce exactly to \emph{vis-$\grave{a}$-vis} those of the Kerr black hole.
