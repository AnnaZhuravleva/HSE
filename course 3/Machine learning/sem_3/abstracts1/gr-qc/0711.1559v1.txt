In this paper we study emergent universe model in the context of a self interacting Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. The model presents a stable past eternal static solution which eventually enters a phase where the stability of this solution is broken leading to an inflationary period. We also establish constraints for the different parameters appearing in our model.
