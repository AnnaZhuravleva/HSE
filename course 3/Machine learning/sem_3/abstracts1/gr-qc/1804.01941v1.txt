We study the behaviour of smooth solutions to the wave equation, $\square_g\psi=0$, in the interior of a fixed Schwarzschild black hole. In particular, we obtain a full asymptotic expansion for all solutions towards $r=0$ and show that it is characterised by its first two leading terms, the principal logarithmic term and a bounded second order term. Moreover, we characterise an open set of initial data for which the corresponding solutions blow up logarithmically on the entirety of the singular hypersurface $\{r=0\}$. Our method is based on deriving weighted energy estimates in physical space and requires no symmetries of solutions. However, a key ingredient in our argument uses a precise analysis of the spherically symmetric part of the solution and a monotonicity property of spherically symmetric solutions in the interior.
