In this paper, we examine a scenario in which late-time cosmic acceleration might arise due to the coupling between baryonic matter and dark matter without the presence of extra degrees of freedom. In this case, one can obtain late-time acceleration in Jordan frame and not in Einstein frame. We consider two different forms of parametrization of the coupling function, and put constraints on the model parameters by using an integrated datasets of Hubble parameter, Type Ia supernova and baryon acoustic oscillations. The models under consideration are consistent with the observations. In addition, we perform the statefinder and $Om$ diagnostics, and show that the models exhibit a distinctive behavior due to the phantom characteristic in future which is a generic feature of the underlying scenario.
