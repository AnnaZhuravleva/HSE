Suppose a one-dimensional isometry group acts on a space, we can consider a submergion induced by the isometry, namely we obtain an orbit space by identification of points on the orbit of the group action. We study the causal structure of the orbit space for Anti-de Sitter space (AdS) explicitely. In the case of AdS$_3$, we found a variety of black hole structure, and in the case of AdS$_5$, we found a static four-dimensional black hole, and a spacetime which has two-dimensional black hole as a submanifold.
