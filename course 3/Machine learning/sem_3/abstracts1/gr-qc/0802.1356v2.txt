Time-varying gravitomagnetic fields are considered within the linear post-Newtonian approach to general relativity. A simple model is developed in which the gravitomagnetic field of a localized mass-energy current varies linearly with time. The implications of this temporal variation of the source for the precession of test gyroscopes and the motion of null rays are briefly discussed.
