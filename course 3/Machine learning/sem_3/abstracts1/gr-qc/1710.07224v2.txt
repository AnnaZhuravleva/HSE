Considering the corrected Unruh temperature as well as the entropic force perspective of gravity, we are able to derive the modification of the Newton's law of gravity. In addition, we also investigate the effects of the highest achievable acceleration correction to the Unruh temperature on the Poisson equation. Moreover, we address modifications to the Newtonian cosmology as well as the Friedmann equations corresponding to the upper bound for acceleration.
