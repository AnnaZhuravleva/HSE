In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity to additional gravitational wave polarization modes of future detectors. We first look at the upcoming Einstein Telescope and its combination with existing or planned Earth-based detectors in the case of a stochastic gravitational wave background. We then study its correlation with a possible future space-borne detector sensitive to high-frequencies, like DECIGO. Finally, we adapt those results for a single GW source and establish the sensitivity of the modes, as well as the localization on the sky.
