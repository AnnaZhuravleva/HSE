In this paper we provide a new model for highly compact star, made with strange quark matter, by employing the MIT bag equation of state (EOS) fol- lowing a particular relation between the quark matter- density and pressure. We have developed the model un- der the framework of f(R; T) gravity using Krori-Barua (KB) metric. Our model satisfies all the stability crite- ria and other physical requirements. The value of the bag constant, calculated from this model, is highly sup- portive to the experimental values of RHIC, CERN-SPS etc, which emphasizes the stable nature of our proposed model.
