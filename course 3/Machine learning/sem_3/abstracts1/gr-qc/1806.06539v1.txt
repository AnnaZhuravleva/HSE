We calculate exactly the QNF of the vector type and scalar type electromagnetic fields propagating on a family of five-dimensional topological black holes. To get a discrete spectrum of quasinormal frequencies for the scalar type electromagnetic field we find that it is necessary to change the boundary condition usually imposed at the asymptotic region. Furthermore for the vector type electromagnetic field we impose the usual boundary condition at the asymptotic region and we discuss the existence of unstable quasinormal modes in the five-dimensional topological black holes.
