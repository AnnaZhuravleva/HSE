We consider the black hole information problem within the context of collapse theories in a scheme that allows the incorporation of the backreaction to the Hawking radiation. We explore the issue in a setting of the two dimensional version of black hole evaporation known as the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius model. We summarize the general ideas based on the semiclassical version of Einstein's equations and then discuss specific modifications that are required in the context of collapse theories when applied to this model.
