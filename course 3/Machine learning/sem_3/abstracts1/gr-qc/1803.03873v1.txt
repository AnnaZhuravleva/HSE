Recent interest on studying possible violations of the Equivalence Principle has led to the development of space satellite missions testing it for bodies moving on circular orbits around Earth. This experiment establishes that the validity of the Equivalence Principle and gravitational acceleration is independent of the composition of bodies. However, the internal dynamics of the bodies (such as spin) has not yet been considered. In this work, it is shown that the circular orbit motion of test bodies do present a violation of the Equivalence Principle when spin effects are not negligible. An exact solution for the circular motion of spinning massive bodies is found showing that the violation manifests itself through different tangential velocities of the test bodies, depending on the orientation of its spin with respect to the total angular momentum of the satellite. Besides, the test bodies present no tangential acceleration, and the E\"otv\"os ratio for tangential accelerations is not a useful parameter to determine the Equivalence Principle validity. We introduce a parameter to determine the difference of tangential velocities, estimating it for the circular motion of a satellite orbiting Earth. It is found that violation of the Equivalence Principle due to spin--gravity coupling may, in principle, be measured within the capabilities of current satellite missions.
