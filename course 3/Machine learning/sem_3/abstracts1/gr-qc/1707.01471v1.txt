The lack of correlations at the long-wavelength scales of the cosmic microwave background spectrum is a long-standing puzzle and it persists in the latest Planck data. By considering the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary wave function as the initial condition of the inflationary universe, we propose that the power suppression can be the consequence of a massive inflaton, whose initial vacuum is the Euclidean instanton in a compact manifold. We calculate the primordial power spectrum of the perturbations, and find that as long as the scalar field is moderately massive, the power spectrum is suppressed at the long-wavelength scales.
