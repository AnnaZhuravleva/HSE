By considering the realization of the emergent universe scenario in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, we study the stability of the Einstein static universe filled with perfect fluid in EiBI theory against both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations in this work. We find that in both the spatially flat and closed cases, the emergent universe scenario is no longer viable, since the Einstein static universe cannot be stable against both the homogeneous and inhomogeneous scalar perturbations simultaneously. However, the emergent universe scenario survives in the spatially open case, while the Einstein static universe can be stable under some conditions.
