We consider a minimal model of rank-2 antisymmetric field with spontaneous Lorentz violation, and obtain a classically equivalent Lagrangian consisting of vector field. The 1-loop effective actions of both theories have been derived, and compared to check their quantum equivalence. We find that the spontaneous Lorentz violating terms disturb the structure of effective action in each of these theories. In flat spacetime, it has been shown that the difference of two effective actions in consideration does not vanish for a given choice of vacuum expectation value of antisymmetric field. However, their quantum equivalence still holds because there is no field dependence in effective action, and therefore they cancel after normalization.
