Killing horizons which can be such for two or more linearly independent Killing vectors are studied. We provide a rigorous definition and then show that the set of Killing vectors sharing a Killing horizon is a Lie algebra $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$ of dimension at most the dimension of the spacetime. We prove that one cannot attach different surface gravities to such multiple Killing horizons, as they have an essentially unique non-zero surface gravity (or none). $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$ always contains an Abelian (sub)-algebra ---whose elements all have vanishing surface gravity--- of dimension equal to or one less than dim $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{H}}$. There arise only two inequivalent possibilities, depending on whether or not there exists the non-zero surface gravity. We show the connection with Near Horizon geometries, and also present a linear system of PDEs, the master equation, for the proportionality function on the horizon between two Killing vectors of a multiple Killing horizon, with its integrability conditions. We provide explicit examples of all possible types of multiple Killing horizons, as well as a full classification of them in maximally symmetric spacetimes.
