We investigate a cosmological model resulting from a dimensional reduction of the higher-dimensional dRGT massive gravity. By using the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, we obtain an effective four-dimensional massive gravity theory with a scalar field. It is found that the resulting theory corresponds to a combined description of mass-varying massive gravity and quasi-dilaton massive gravity. By analyzing the cosmological solution, we found that it is possible to obtain the late-time expansion of the universe due to the graviton mass. By using a dynamical system approach, we found regions of model parameters for which the late-time expansion of the universe is a stable fixed point. Moreover, this also provides a mechanism to stabilize the extra dimensions.
