In metric formalism, Noether symmetry of F(R) theory of gravity in vacuum and in the presence of pressureless dust yields $F(R)\propto R^\frac{3}{2}$ along with the conserved current $\frac{d}{dt} (a\sqrt R)$ in Robertson-Walker metric and nothing else. However, Roshan et.al. had claimed in $\mathrm{Phys. Lett. \textbf{B668}, 238 (2008)}$ \cite{o} that Noether symmetry in the context of Palatini $F(\Re)$ theory of gravity admits $F(\Re)\propto \Re^{s}$, (where $s$ is an arbitrary constant) in matter domain era in Friedmann- Robertson-Walker universe. But, it has been shown that the conserved current obtained under the process does not satisfy the field equations in general. Here, it is shown that Noether Symmetry admits $F(\Re)\propto\Re^\frac{3}{2}$ along with a conserved current $\Sigma_{0} {a}[\frac{\dot a}{a}+ \frac{\dot\Phi}{2\Phi}]$ in Palatini gravity. Thus, their claim is not right.
