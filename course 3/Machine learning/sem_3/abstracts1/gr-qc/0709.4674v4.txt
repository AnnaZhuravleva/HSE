We show that small deviations from spherical symmetry, described by means of exact solutions to Einstein equations, provide a mechanism to "bleach" the information about the collapsing body as it falls through the aparent horizon, thereby resolving the information loss paradox. The resulting picture and its implication related to the Landauer's principle in the presence of a gravitational field, is discussed.
