We investigate the attractor solution in the coupled Yang-Mills field dark energy models with the general interaction term, and obtain the constraint equations for the interaction if the attractor solution exists. The research also shows that, if the attractor solution exists, the equation-of-state of the dark energy must evolve from $w_y>0$ to $w_y\le-1$, which is slightly suggested by the observation. At the same time, the total equation-of-state in the attractor solution is $w_{tot}=-1$, the universe is a de Sitter expansion, and the cosmic big rip is naturally avoided. These features are all independent of the interacting forms.
