The redshift of light is calculated for an anisotropic cosmological spacetime. Two different approaches are considered. In the first one, electromagnetic waves are modeled using the geometrical optics (high--frequency) approximation. This approach considers light rays following null geodesics, being equivalent to the motion followed by pointlike spinless massless particles. It is shown that the redshift for this case depends, in general, on the direction of propagation, and is dispersive (wavelength dependent) for light emitted from different points of an extended object. In the second approach electromagnetic waves are studied using the exact form of Maxwell equations, finding that redshift has dependence on the direction of propagation as well as on the wave polarization. The electromagnetic waves are dispersive and depend on the anisotropic temporal evolution. In this last case, redshifts may become dispersive depending on the relative direction between the light ray propagation vector and the anisotropy axes. The relation of these results with a possible violation of the Equivalence Principle are discussed. In general, both results are set in the context of recent astrophysical redshift observations for anisotropic cosmologies, and new ways of determining redshifts are suggested.
