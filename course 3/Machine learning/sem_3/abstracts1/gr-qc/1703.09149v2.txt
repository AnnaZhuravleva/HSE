This is a review of the results on black hole physics in the framework of loop quantum gravity. The key feature underlying the results is the discreteness of geometric quantities at the Planck scale predicted by this approach to quantum gravity. Quantum discreteness follows directly from the canonical quantization prescription when applied to the action of general relativity that is suitable for the coupling of gravity with gauge fields and specially with fermions. Planckian discreteness and causal considerations provide the basic structure for the understanding of the thermal properties of black holes close to equilibrium. Discreteness also provides a fresh new look at more (at the moment) speculative issues such as those concerning the fate of information in black hole evaporation. The hypothesis of discreteness leads also to interesting phenomenology with possible observational consequences. The theory of loop quantum gravity is a developing program. This review reports its achievements and open questions in a pedagogical manner with an emphasis on quantum aspects of black hole physics.
