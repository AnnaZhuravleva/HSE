This is the main paper in a series of three in which we prove the nonlinear stability of the Schwarzschild spacetime under axially symmetric polarized perturbations, i.e. solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations for asymptotically flat $1+3$ dimensional Lorentzian metrics which admit a hypersurface orthogonal spacelike Killing vectorfield with closed orbits.   While building on the remarkable advances made in last 15 years on establishing quantitative linear stability, the paper introduces a series of new ideas among which we emphasize the \textit{general covariant modulation} (GCM) procedure which allows us to construct, dynamically, the center of mass frame of the final state. The mass of the final state itself is tracked using the well known Hawking mass relative to a well adapted foliation itself connected to the center of mass frame.   Our work here is the first to prove the nonlinear stability of Schwarzschild in a restricted class of nontrivial perturbations, i.e. perturbations for which new ideas, such as our GCM procedure are needed. To a large extent, the restriction to this class of perturbations is only needed to ensure that the final state of evolution is another Schwarzschild space. We are thus confident that our procedure may apply in a more general setting.
