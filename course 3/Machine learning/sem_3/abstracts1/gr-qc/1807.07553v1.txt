We have studied cosmological solutions in Einstein-Aether (EA) theory with an isotropic fluid where the energy density is constant. Assuming a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric for the spacetime, we have obtained a contracting, expanding and static universes, depending on the parameters of EA theory and the metric. In the case of null energy density, we have obtained a vacuum solution for the spacetime for which the Kretschmann scalar is not null but singular at the initial time. We have shown that the universe can be only accelerated. This accelerated behavior is due to the existence of dark energy and phantom energy during the evolution of the universe. This characteristic is in contrast with the results found in the previous work showing that the aether field always slows the universe down.
