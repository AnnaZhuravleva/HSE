We study the cosmic history of the scalaron in $F(R)$ gravity with constructing the time evolution of the cosmic environment and discuss the chameleonic dark matter based on the chameleon mechanism in the early and current Universe. We then find that the scalaron can be a dark matter. We also propose an interesting possibility that the $F(R)$ gravity can address the coincidence problem.
