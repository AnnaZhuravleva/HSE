Scalar-tensor theories are one of the most natural and well-constrained alternative theories of gravity, while still allowing for significant deviations from general relativity. We present the equations of motion of nonspinning compact binary systems at the third post-Newtonian (PN) order in massless scalar-tensor theories. We adapt the Fokker action of point particles in harmonic coordinates in general relativity to the specificities of scalar-tensor theories. We use dimensional regularisation to treat both the infrared and ultraviolet divergences, and we consistently include the tail effects that contribute by a non-local term to the dynamics. This work is crucial in order to compute the scalar gravitational waveform and the energy flux at 2PN order.
