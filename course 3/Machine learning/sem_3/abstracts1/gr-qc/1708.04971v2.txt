Spacetimes, which are representations of a bridge-like geometry in gravity theory, are constructed as vacuum solutions to the first order equations of motion. Each such configuration consists of two copies of an asymptotically flat sheet, connected by a bridge of finite extension where tetrad is noninvertible. These solutions can be classified into static and non-static spacetimes. The associated SO(3,1) invariant fields, namely the metric, affine connection and field-strength tensor, are all continuous across the hypersurfaces connecting the invertible and noninvertible phases of tetrad and are finite everywhere. These regular spacetime-bridge solutions do not have any analogue in Einsteinian gravity in vacuum.
