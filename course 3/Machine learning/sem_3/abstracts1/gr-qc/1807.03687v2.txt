The spinning-hairy black holes that occur in Einstein gravity supplemented by a doublet of complex scalar fields are constructed within an extension of the model by a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry involving a massless vector potential. The hairy black holes then acquire an electric charge and a magnetic moment; their domain of existence is discussed in terms of the gauge coupling constant.
