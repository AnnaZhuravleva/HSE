We show Zeeman-like splitting in the energy of spinors propagating in the background gravitational field, analogous to the spinors in electromagnetic field, otherwise termed as Gravitational Zeeman Effect. These spinors are also found to acquire a geometric phase, in a similar way as they do in the presence of magnetic fields. Based on this result, we investigate geometric phases acquired by neutrinos propagating in a strong gravitational field. We also explore entanglement of neutrino states due to gravity which could induce neutrino-antineutrino oscillation in the first place. We show that entangled states also acquire geometric phases which are determined by the relative strength between gravitational field and neutrino masses.
