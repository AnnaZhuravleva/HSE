We show that the complex dynamics of the general Bianchi IX universe in the vicinity of the spacelike singularity can be approximated by a simplified system of equations. Our analysis is mainly based on numerical simulations. The properties of the solution space can be studied by using this simplified dynamics. Our results will be useful for the quantization of the general Bianchi IX model.
