We show that the parametric resonance of gravitational waves occurs due to the axion coherent oscillation and the circular polarization of gravitational waves is induced by the Chern-Simons coupling. However, we have never observed these signatures in the data of gravitational waves. Using this fact, we give stringent constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $\ell$ and the abundance of the light string axion. In particular, we improved the current bound $\ell\leq10^{8}\,\,{\rm km}$ by many orders of magnitude.
