We study condensation of scalar fields around compact reflecting stars in a box. We propose no light scalar hair behaviors that the neutral compact star cannot support the existence of small single positive mass scalar field in it's exterior spacetime for very general self-interacting potentials. Moreover, we find that this no light scalar hair property can be violated by including an additional Maxwell field coupled to the scalar field in a charged compact reflecting star background.
