Quantum field theory on curved spacetimes lacks an obvious distinguished vacuum state. We review a recent no-go theorem that establishes the impossibility of finding a preferred state in each globally hyperbolic spacetime, subject to certain natural conditions. The result applies in particular to the free scalar field, but the proof is model-independent and therefore of wider applicability. In addition, we critically examine the recently proposed "SJ states", that are determined by the spacetime geometry alone, but which fail to be Hadamard in general. We describe a modified construction that can yield an infinite family of Hadamard states, and also explain recent results that motivate the Hadamard condition without direct reference to ultra-high energies or ultra-short distance structure.
