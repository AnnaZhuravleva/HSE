We consider bound geodesic orbits of test masses in the exterior gravitational field of a rotating astronomical source whose proper angular momentum varies linearly with time. The linear perturbation approach of Lense and Thirring is herein extended to the nonstationary case. In particular, we investigate the instability of Lense-Thirring precessing orbits due to the slow temporal variation of the gravitomagnetic field of the source.
