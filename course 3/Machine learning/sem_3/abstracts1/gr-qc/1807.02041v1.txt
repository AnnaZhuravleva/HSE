We prove that a conserved effective energy-momentum tensor for Einstein-Cartan theory can be identified from the Noether identities of the matter Lagrangian, using the torsion field equations relating them. More precisely, a one-parameter family labelled by the Immirzi parameter. We use this result and the contorsion description to show that Jacobson's thermodynamical derivation of the Einstein equations follows as in the metric theory, namely from the equilibrium Clausius relation and the fact that a Killing horizon is metric-geodetic. Our derivation works for an arbitrary torsion field. In the course of our discussion we review the laws of black hole mechanics and their dependence on torsion.
