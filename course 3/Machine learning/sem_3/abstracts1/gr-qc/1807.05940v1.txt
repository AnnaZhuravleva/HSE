A new branch of quasinormal modes for a massless scalar field propagating on the Schwarzschild spacetime was recently announced [gr-qc:1807.04513]. We show that this 'new branch' belongs to a larger class of complex frequencies already identified in [gr-qc.1604.02261]. By reviewing some results/techniques from [gr-qc.1604.02261], we argue that the announced new frequencies should not be considered as quasinormal modes. We provide further arguments against the new branch by discussing the larger class of complex frequencies within Chandrasekhar's characterization of quasinormal modes. Finally, we approach the problem in the time domain and show that the only frequencies/decay time scales present in the scalar field's time evolution are those of the well-established quasinormal modes.
