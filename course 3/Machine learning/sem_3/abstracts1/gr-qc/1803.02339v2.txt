It is a standard fact that trapped or marginally trapped surfaces are not visible from conformal infinity, under the usual set of conditions on matter fields and the conformal completion, provided that the cosmological constant is non-positive. In this note we show that the situation is more delicate in the presence of a positive cosmological constant: we present examples of visible marginally trapped surfaces, and we provide a set of natural conditions which guarantee non-visibility.
