It is believed that in any number of dimensions the off-shell Kerr-NUT-(A)dS metric represents a unique geometry admitting the principal (rank 2, non-degenerate, closed conformal Killing-Yano) tensor. The original proof relied on the Euclidean signature and therein natural assumption that the eigenvalues of the principal tensor have gradients of spacelike character. In this paper we evade this common wisdom and construct new classes of Lorentzian (and other signature) off-shell metrics admitting the principal tensor with null eigenvalues, uncovering so a much richer structure of spacetimes with principal tensor in four and higher dimensions. A few observations regarding the Kerr-Schild ansatz are also made.
