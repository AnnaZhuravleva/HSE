In this paper, we study some dynamical properties of neutral and charged particles around a weakly magnetized five dimensional black string. In addition, we calculate the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) of this metric in the presence of a magnetic field by perturbation. We also derive the escape velocity of neutral and charged particles around the black string. It has been shown that adding an extra dimension had slight influences on the effective potential and one component of effective force. The magnitude of the new constant of motion $(J)$ affects on the shape of the potential and thereby the chance of existence of the stable circular orbits. We also found some values of $J$ that vanishes the escape velocity for neutral particles in a specific distance from the center of the black string. In general, by comparing a black hole and a black string, we realized that the magnitude of a new constant of motion causes slight but interesting differences.
