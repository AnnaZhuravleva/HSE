In this paper, we study the weak gravitational lensing in the spacetime of rotating regular black hole geometries such as Ayon-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG), Bardeen, and Hayward black holes. We calculate the deflection angle of light using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) and show that the deflection of light can be viewed as a partially topological effect in which the deflection angle can be calculated by considering a domain outside of the light ray applied to the black hole optical geometries. Then, we demonstrate also the deflection angle via the geodesics formalism for these black holes to verify our results and explore the differences with the Kerr solution. These black holes have in addition to the total mass and rotation parameter, different parameters as electric charge, magnetic charge, and deviation parameter. Newsworthy, we find that the deflection of light has correction terms coming from these parameters which generalizes the Kerr deflection angle.
