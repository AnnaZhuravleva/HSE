We consider static spherically symmetric self-gravitating configurations of the perfect fluid within the framework of the torsion-based extended theory of gravity. In particular, we use the covariant formulation of $f(T)$ gravity with $f(T) = T + \frac{\alpha}{2} T^2$, and for the fluid we assume the polytropic equation of state with the adiabatic exponent $\Gamma = 2$. The constructed solutions have sharply defined radius (as in GR) and can be considered as models of nonrotating compact stars. The particle number-to-stellar radius curves reveal that with positive (negative) values of $\alpha$ smaller (greater) number of particles can be supported against gravity then in GR. For the interpretation of the energy density and the pressure within the star we adopt the GR picture where the effects due to nonlinearity of $f(T)$ are seen as a $f(T)$-fluid, which together with the polytropic fluid contributes to the effective energy-momentum. We find that sufficiently large positive $\alpha$ gives rise to an abrupt sign change (phase transition) in the energy density and in the principal pressures of the $f(T)$-fluid, taking place within the interior of the star. The corresponding radial profile of the effective energy density is approximately constant over the central region of the star, mimicking an incompressible core. This interesting phenomenon is not found in configurations with negative $\alpha$.
