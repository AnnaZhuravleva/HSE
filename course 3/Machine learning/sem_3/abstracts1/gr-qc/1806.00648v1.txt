A new effective quantum theory of macroscopic Kruskal black holes is presented, encompassing both the 'interior' region that contains classical singularities and the 'exterior' asymptotic region. Singularities are naturally resolved by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity, and the resulting quantum extension of the full Kruskal space-time is free of all the known limitations of previous investigations [1-11] of the Schwarzschild interior. We compare and contrast our results with these investigations and also with the expectations based on the AdS/CFT duality [12].
