In this paper I shall consider various possible scalar-vector-tensor field theories which might be used to describe the Universe. After imposing numerous constraints of a physical and mathematical nature on the theories under consideration, we shall see that there still exists a plethora of viable theories from which to choose. But hopefully I shall be able to convince you that a scalar-vector-tensor field theory involving five scalar fields provides a promising cosmological model. The advantage of this theory is that there is no energy-momentum tensor for the matter fields, nor arbitrary functions, only dimensionless constants, that need to be determined. I shall also construct the most general multiple-scalar-vector-tensor field theory which is dimensionally consistent and free of dimensioned constants. It turns out that this field theory yields second-order field equations.
