The massless minimally coupled scalar field in de Sitter ambient space formalism might play a similar role to what the Higgs scalar field accomplishes within the electroweak standard model. With the introduction of a "local transformation" for this field, the interaction Lagrangian between the scalar field and the spinor field can be made similar to a gauge theory. In the null curvature limit, the Yukawa potential can be constructed from that Lagrangian. Finally the one-loop correction of the scalar-spinor interaction is presented, which is free of any infrared divergence.
