We present a family of exact black-hole solutions on a static spherically symmetric background in second-order generalized Proca theories with derivative vector-field interactions coupled to gravity. We also derive non-exact solutions in power-law coupling models including vector Galileons and numerically show the existence of regular black holes with a primary hair associated with the longitudinal propagation. The intrinsic vector-field derivative interactions generally give rise to a secondary hair induced by non-trivial field profiles. The deviation from General Relativity is most significant around the horizon and hence there is a golden opportunity for probing the Proca hair by the measurements of gravitational waves (GWs) in the regime of strong gravity.
