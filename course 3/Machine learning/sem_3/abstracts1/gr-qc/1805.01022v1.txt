We study the thermodynamical features and dynamical evolutions of various apparent horizons associated with the Vaidya evaporating black hole surrounded by the cosmological fields of dust, radiation, quintessence, cosmological constant-like and phantom. In this regard, we address in detail how do these surrounding fields contribute to the characteristic features of a surrounded dynamical black hole in comparison to a dynamical black hole in an empty background.
