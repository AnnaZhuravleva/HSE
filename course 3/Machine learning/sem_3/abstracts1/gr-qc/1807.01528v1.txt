We construct a rotating wormhole jointed two BTZ spacetimes with a thin shell filled with a barotropic fluid at a throat by a Darmois-Israel method. The thin shell at the throat and both sides of the throat corotate. We investigate the linear stability of the thin shell of the rotating wormhole against radial perturbations. We show that the wormhole becomes more and more stable as larger its angular momentum be until the angular momentum reaches a critical value and that the behavior of a condition for stability significantly changes when the angular momentum exceeds the critical value. We find that the over-critical rotating wormhole has the radius of the thin shell which is stable regardless of the equation of state for the barotropic fluid.
