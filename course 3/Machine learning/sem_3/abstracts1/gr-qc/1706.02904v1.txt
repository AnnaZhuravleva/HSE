We consider scalar-vector-tensor gravity [1,2] to solve dynamical equations of anisotropic Bianchi I metric. Methodology of this paper is similar to the work [3] in which we use dynamical system approach to obtain stability nature of obtained metric solutions in $\Lambda$CDM, dust and radiation eras. We obtain anisotropic metric solutions for $\Lambda$CDM era which nature of its critical point is obtained as quasi stable (saddle sink). The latter solution is fixed for particular value of the Brans Dicke (BD) parameter as $\omega=0.38$ and linear self interaction BD potential $V(\phi)\sim\phi.$ In dust era we obtain $\omega$ dependent critical point. By setting ansatz $\omega=0,\pm40000$ critical points of dust era take nature as quasi stable (saddle sink) with corresponding potentials $V_{\omega=0}(\phi) \sim \phi^{-6.9}$, $V_{\omega=-40000}(\phi) \sim -\phi^{6.67\times10^5}$ and $V_{\omega=40000}(\phi) \sim \phi^{0.63}$ respectively. In radiation era, we obtained general form of the critical points which are depended to the Brans Dicke parameter $\omega$ and directional barotropic indexes $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\frac{1}{3}.$ By setting the ansatz $\omega=0,\pm40000,\alpha=+\frac{1}{9}=-\beta,\gamma=\frac{1}{3},$ radiation era critical points read nature of quasi stable (saddle sink) for $\omega=+40000$ with $V_{\omega=40000}\sim-\phi^{-19}.$ Results of this work predict that the additional dynamical vector field of the model together with the BD scalar field behave as source of mixture fluid. It contains two components called as visible radiation with directional barotropic indexes $(\frac{p_x}{\rho_r},\frac{p_z}{\rho_r})=(\alpha,\gamma)= (\frac{1}{9},\frac{1}{3})$ and dark matter with directional barotropic index $\frac{p_y}{\rho}=\beta=-\frac{1}{9}$ respectively.
