In this paper it is shown that in Brans - Dicke theory, if one considers a non-minimal coupling between the matter and the scalar field, it can give rise to a late time accelerated expansion for the universe preceded by a decelerated expansion for very high values of the Brans - Dicke parameter $\omega$.
