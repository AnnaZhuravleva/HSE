We conduct a preliminary investigation into the phenomenological implications of Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG), a 4-dimensional theory of gravity cubic in curvature of interest for its unique formulation and properties. We find an analytic approximation for a spherically symmetric black hole solution to this theory using a continued fraction ansatz. This approximate solution is valid everywhere outside of the horizon and we use it to study the orbit of massive test bodies near a black hole, specifically computing the innermost stable circular orbit. We compute constraints on the ECG coupling parameter imposed by Shapiro time delay. We then compute the shadow of an ECG black hole and find it to be larger than its Einsteinian counterpart in general relativity for the same value of the mass. Applying our results to Sgr A*, we find that departures from general relativity are small but in principle distinguishable.
