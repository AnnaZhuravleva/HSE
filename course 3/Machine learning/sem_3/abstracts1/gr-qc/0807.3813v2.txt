In this paper we fully calculate the non-Gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbation of island universe by using the second order perturbation equation. We find that for the spectral index $n_s\simeq 0.96$, which is favored by current observations, the non-Gaussianity level $f_{NL}$ seen in island will generally lie between 30 $\sim$ 60, which may be tested by the coming observations. In the landscape, the island universe is one of anthropically acceptable cosmological histories. Thus the results obtained in some sense means the coming observations, especially the measurement of non-Gaussianity, will be significant to make clear how our position in the landscape is populated.
