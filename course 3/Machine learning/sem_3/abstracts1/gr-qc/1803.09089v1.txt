Hairy black holes (BHs) have macroscopic degrees of freedom which are not associated with a Gauss law. As such, these degrees of freedom are not manifest as quasi-local quantities computed at the horizon. This suggests conceiving hairy BHs as an interacting system with two components: a "bald" horizon coupled to a "hairy" environment. Based on this idea we suggest an effective model for hairy BHs -- typically described by numerical solutions -- that allows computing analytically thermodynamic and other quantities of the hairy BH in terms of a fiducial bald BH. The effective model is universal in the sense that it is only sensitive to the fiducial BH, but not to the details of the hairy BH. Consequently, it is only valid in the vicinity of the fiducial BH limit. We discuss, quantitatively, the accuracy of the effective model for asymptotically flat BHs with synchronised hair, both in $D=4$ (including self-interactions) and $D=5$ spacetime dimensions. We also discuss the applicability of the model to synchronised BHs in $D=5$ asymptotically $AdS$ and static $D=4$ coloured BHs, exhibiting its limitations.
