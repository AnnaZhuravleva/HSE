In this study, the quantum gravity effect on the tunnelling radiation of charged massive particles with spin-0, spin-1/2 and spin-1 from 2+1 dimensional charged rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole is looked into by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. For this, we calculate the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole by using the modified Klein-Gordon, the Dirac and the vector boson equations based on the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), and we notice that the modified Hawking temperature of the black hole depends not only on the black hole properties, but also on the angular (orbital+spin) momentum, energy, charge and mass of the tunnelling particle. Furthermore, we discuss the stability of the black hole in the context of the modified heat capacity, and observe that it undergoes a second-type phase transition in the presence of the quantum gravity effect, but a first-type transition in the absence of the quantum gravity effect.
