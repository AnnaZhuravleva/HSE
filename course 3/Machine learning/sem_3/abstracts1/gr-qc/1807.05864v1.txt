The black hole information paradox and the black hole entropy are currently extensively researched. The consensus about the solution of the information paradox is not yet reached, and it is not yet clear what can we learn about quantum gravity from these and the related research. It seems that the apparently irreducible paradoxes force us to give up on at least one well-established principle or another. Since we are talking about a choice between the principle of equivalence from general relativity, and some essential principles from quantum theory, both being the most reliable theories we have, it is recommended to proceed with caution and search more conservative solutions. These paradoxes are revisited here, as well as the black hole complementarity and the firewall proposals, with an emphasis on the less obvious assumptions. Some arguments are presented, some less considered less radical possibilities are discussed, and a conservative solution, which is more consistent with both the principle of equivalence from general relativity and the unitarity from quantum theory, is discussed.
