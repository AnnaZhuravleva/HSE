In recent years, investigations of gravitational interactions has led us to discover new facets of the fundamental force. With these discoveries the general theory of relativity is under greater scrutiny now than it was 100 years ago. Development of a more advanced theory is needed for experimental tests and extensive predictions of gravitational interactions in local and cosmological settings. In this work, we present axioms of a novel theory that describes spacetime as a relativistic viscoelastic continuum; retaining the properties of the natural ${}^{+}\Lambda$-CDM vacuum. With these axioms, we provide a foundation for a tensor field theory of Gravitational Strain; introduced as an advanced formulation of an elastic interpretation of gravitational interactions. This viscoelastic definition of gravity is a natural advancement of general relativity to an observable measure of a proper relativistic gravitational field.
