We study the bounce and cyclicity realization in the framework of new gravitational scalar-tensor theories. In these theories the Lagrangian contains the Ricci scalar and its first and second derivatives, in a specific combination that makes them free of ghosts, and transformed into the Einstein frame they are proved to be a subclass of bi-scalar extensions of general relativity. We present analytical expressions for the bounce requirements, and we examine the necessary qualitative behavior of the involved functions that can give rise to a given scale factor. Having in mind these qualitative forms, we reverse the procedure and we construct suitable simple Lagrangian functions that can give rise to a bounce or cyclic scale factor.
