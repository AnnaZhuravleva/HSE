We find non-commutative inspired electrically and magnetically charged black hole solutions in Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics. For these solutions, we determine the non-commutative corrections to the horizon radius for the general and extremal case. We also analyse the weak, dominant and strong energy conditions and the shadow associated with these metrics.
