East and Pretorius (arXiv:1704.04791) have successfully evolved, using fully non-linear numerical simulations, the superradiant instability of the Kerr black hole (BH) triggered by a massive, complex vector field. Evolutions terminate in stationary states of a vector field condensate synchronised with a rotating BH horizon. We show these end points are fundamental states of Kerr BHs with synchronised Proca hair. Motivated by the "experimental data" from these simulations we suggest a universal (i.e. field-spin independent), analytic model for the subset of BHs with sychronised hair that possess a quasi-Kerr horizon, applicable in the weak hair regime. Comparing this model with fully non-linear numerical solutions of BHs with synchronised scalar or Proca hair, we show the model is accurate for hairy BHs that may emerge dynamically from superradiance, whose domain we identify.
