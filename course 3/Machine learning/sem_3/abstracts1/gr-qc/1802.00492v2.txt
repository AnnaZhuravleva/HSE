Einstein's celebrated theory of gravitation can be presented in three forms: general relativity, teleparallel gravity, and the rarely considered before symmetric teleparallel gravity. Extending the latter, we introduce a new class of theories where a scalar field is coupled nonminimally to nonmetricity $Q$, which here encodes the gravitational effects like curvature $R$ in general relativity or torsion $T$ in teleparallel gravity. We point out the similarities and differences with analogous scalar-curvature and scalar-torsion theories by discussing the field equations, role of connection, conformal transformations, relation to $f(Q)$ theory, and cosmology. The equations for spatially flat universe coincide with those of teleparallel dark energy, thus allowing to explain accelerating expansion.
