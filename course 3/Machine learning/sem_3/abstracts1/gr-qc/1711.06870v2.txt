We investigate the models of cosmological inflation in generalized scalar-tensor gravity, which we consider as a source of deviation from de Sitter dynamics in the case of GR. Within the framework of the proposed approach, the exact equations of cosmological dynamics and parameters of cosmological perturbations are obtained.
