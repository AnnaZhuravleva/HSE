In this article are computed magnetic solutions of Einstein Maxwell Chern-Simons theory coupled to a dilaton-like scalar field. These solutions are computed by applying a space-time duality suggested by the author to known electric solutions of the same theory. As a redundancy check for the space-time duality it is explicitly shown that the magnetic configurations obtained are, as expected, solutions of the equations of motion. The magnetic configurations have metric determinant $\sqrt{-g}\sim r^p$ for the range of the parameter $p\in]-\infty,+\infty[/\{-1\}$ and are interpreted either as magnetic string-like configurations, configurations driven by an externally applied magnetic field or cosmological-like solutions with background magnetic fields.
