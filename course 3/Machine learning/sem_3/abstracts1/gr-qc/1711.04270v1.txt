The effects of highly relativistic spin-gravity coupling in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter background which follow from the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations are investigated. The dependence of gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic components of gravitational field on the velocity of an observer which is moving in Schwarzschild-de Sitter's background is estimated. The action of gravitomagnetic components on a fast moving spinning particle is considered. Different cases of the highly relativistic circular orbits of a spinning particle which essentially differ from the corresponding geodesic orbits are described.
