We extend our previous studies of head-on collisions of boson stars by considering orbiting binary boson stars. We concentrate on equal mass binaries and study the dynamical behavior of boson/boson and boson/antiboson pairs. We examine the gravitational wave output of these binaries and compare with other compact binaries. Such a comparison lets us probe the apparent simplicity observed in gravitational waves produced by black hole binary systems. In our system of interest however, there is an additional internal freedom which plays a significant role in the system's dynamics, namely the phase of each star. Our evolutions show rather simple behavior at early times, but large differences occur at late times for the various initial configurations.
