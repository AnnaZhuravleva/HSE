Getting signatures of quantum gravity is one of the topical lines of research in modern theoretical physics and cosmology. This short review faces this challenge under a novel perspective. Instead of separating quantum-gravity effects of a specific model between UV and IR regimes, we consider a general feature, possibly common to many frameworks, where all scales are affected and spacetime geometry is characterized by a complex critical exponent. This leaves a log-oscillating modulation pattern in the cosmic microwave background spectrum and gives a unique opportunity, illustrated with the example of a multi-fractional theory, to test quantum gravities at cosmological scales.
