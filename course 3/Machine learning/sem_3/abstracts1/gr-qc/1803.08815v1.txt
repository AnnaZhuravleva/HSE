Energy conditions can play an important role in defining the cosmological evolution. Specifically acceleration/deceleration of cosmic fluid, as well as the emergence of Big Rip singularities, can be related to the constraints imposed by the energy conditions. Here we discuss this issue for $f(R)$ gravity considering also conformal transformations. Cosmological solutions and equations of state can be classified according to energy conditions. The qualitative change of some energy conditions for transformations from the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame is also observed.
