We study and analyze the dynamic properties of both canonical and noncanonical warm inflationary models with dissipative effects. We consider different models of canonical warm inflation with different dissipative coefficients and provide that the behaviour at infinity of quadratic dissipative model distinctly differs from the one of constant dissipative model, which inspires that quadratic dissipative coefficient increases the possibility of the occurrence of inflation. We also show that the different choice of combination of the parameters in noncanonical warm inflation will exhibits dramatically different global phase portraits on Poincar\'{e} disk. We try to illustrate that noncanonical field will not expanse the regime of inflation, but it will increase the possibility of the occurrence of inflation as well and duration of inflation. Then, by dynamic analysis, we can exclude several inflationary models like warm inflation model with negative dissipative coefficient, and explain that the model without potential is almost impossible. With relevant results, we give the condition when reheating occurs.
