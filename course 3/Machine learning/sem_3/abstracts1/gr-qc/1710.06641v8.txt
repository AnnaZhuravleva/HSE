We present a systematic study of the 2nd order scalar, vector and tensor metric perturbations in the Einstein-de Sitter Universe in synchronous coordinates. For the scalar-scalar coupling between 1st order perturbations, we decompose the 2nd order perturbed Einstein equation into the respective field equations of 2nd order scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, and obtain their solutions with general initial conditions. In particular, the decaying modes of solution are included, the 2nd order vector is generated even the 1st order vector is absent, and the solution of 2nd order tensor corrects that in literature. We perform general synchronous-to-synchronous gauge transformations up to 2nd order generated by a 1st order vector field $\xi^{(1)\mu}$ and a 2nd order $\xi^{(2)\mu}$. All the residual gauge modes of 2nd order metric perturbations and density contrast are found, and their number is substantially reduced when the transformed 3-velocity of dust is set be zero. Moreover, we show that only $\xi^{(2)\mu}$ is effective in carrying out 2nd order transformations that we consider, because $\xi^{(1)\mu}$ has been used in obtaining the 1st order perturbations. Holding the 1st order perturbations fixed, the transformations by $\xi^{(2)\mu}$ on the 2nd order perturbations have the same structure as those by $\xi^{(1)\mu}$ on the 1st order perturbations.
