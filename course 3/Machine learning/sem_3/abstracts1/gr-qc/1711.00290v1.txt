We prove a uniqueness theorem for traversable wormhole solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity with a phantom scalar field and a possible phantom electromagnetic field. In a certain region of the parameter space, determined by the asymptotic values of the scalar field and the lapse function, the regular wormholes are completely specified by their mass, scalar charge and electric charge. The argument is based on the positive energy theorem applied on an appropriate conformally transformed Riemannian space.
