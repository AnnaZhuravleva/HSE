We study the behavior of large-scale (cosmological) modes of back-reaction effects during inflation. We find that the group of modes which describes the very large-scale fluctuations of energy density during inflation due to back-reaction effects evolve in phase between them, but there is a tear of these modes with respect to the other modes that describe astrophysical scales. This effect could be the origin for the large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe and could be a manifestation of the existence of dark energy, which is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.
