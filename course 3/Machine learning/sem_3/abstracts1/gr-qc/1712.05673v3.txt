We obtain from the first principles a general-relativistic Keplerian rotation law for self-gravitating disks around spinning black holes. This is an extension of a former rotation law that was designed mainly for toroids around spin-less black holes. We integrate numerically axial stationary Einstein equations with self-gravitating disks around spinless or spinning black holes; that includes the first ever integration of the Keplerian selfgravitating tori. This construction can be used for the description of tight black hole-torus systems produced during coalescences of two neutron stars or modelling of compact active galactic nuclei.
