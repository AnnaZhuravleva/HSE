The original theory of quasi-metric gravity, allowing only a partial coupling between space-time geometry and the active stress-energy tensor, is too restricted to allow the existence of gravitational waves. Therefore, said theory can at best be regarded as a waveless approximation theory. In this paper, it is shown how to relax the restrictions on quasi-metric space-time geometry such that a full coupling between space-time geometry and the active stress-energy tensor becomes possible. The extended field equations are consistent with the general quasi-metric geometric framework, and their dynamical structure is somewhat similar to that of canonical general relativity (GR). Moreover, results from the original quasi-metric gravitational theory are recovered for metrically static vacua and for isotropic cosmology. This means that the current experimental status of the new quasi-metric gravitational theory is the same as for the original theory, except for the prediction of weak GR-like gravitational waves in vacuum.
