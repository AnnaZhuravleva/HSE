We calculate the most general action for a scalar-tensor model up to quadratic order in derivatives with deformed general covariance and non-minimal coupling. We demonstrate how different choices of the free functions recover specific well known scalar-tensor models. We look at the cosmological dynamics and find the general conditions for either inflation or a big bounce. Using this we present a novel non-minimally coupled scalar model which produces a bounce, and describe how to find similar models.
