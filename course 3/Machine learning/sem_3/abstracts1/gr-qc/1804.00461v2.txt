We study weak gravitational lensing around a compact object with arbitrary quadrupole moment in the presence of plasma. The studied compact objects are considered to be spherically symmetric. The additional parameter $\epsilon$ regulating the quadrupole moment in the metric alters the deflection angle of light rays along with the plasma parameters. In the vacuum, the number of images due to the presence of the parameter $\epsilon$ increases and causes the increase of the magnification of the image source. The effects of uniform and nonuniform plasma on gravitational lensing around the compact object are also studied.
