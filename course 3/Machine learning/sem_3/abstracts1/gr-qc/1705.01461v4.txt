We consider the grand canonical thermodynamics of a noninteracting scalar field in a static spacetime. We take the nonrelativistic limit of thermodynamic quantities in a way that leaves the curved structure of the background geometry intact. Using Mellin transform and heat kernel techniques we obtain asymptotic expansions of thermodynamic quantities appropriate for the analysis of Bose-Einstein condensation. We apply our results to investigate gravitational effects on the Bose-Einstein condensation for a scalar field in a finite volume. We also analyze the boundary effects on the depletion coefficient of the scalar field.
