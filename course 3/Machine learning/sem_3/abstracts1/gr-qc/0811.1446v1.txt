Observational data from supernovae type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters, and the growth factor are used to reconstruct the the interaction rate of the holographic dark energy model recently proposed by Zimdahl and Pav\'{o}n [1] in the redshift interval $0 < z < 1.8$. It shows a reasonable behavior as it increases with expansion from a small or vanishing value in the far past and begins decreasing at recent times. This suggests that the equation of state parameter of dark energy does not cross the phantom divide line.
