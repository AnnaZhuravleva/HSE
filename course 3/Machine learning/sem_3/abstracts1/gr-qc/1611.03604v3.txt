In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of Schwarzschild-Beltrami-de Sitter black hole introduced by Mu-Lin Yan \textit{et al.} in 2013 by introducing inertial Beltrami coordinates to traditional non-inertial Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric which is the exact static spherical symmetry solution of Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Based on this new metric, we compute entropy on all horizons and we give the entropy bound of the black hole. Hawking temperatures are calculated by considering a perturbation to entropy relations due to that the spacetime described by this inertial coordinates is no longer a stationary spacetime in which surface gravity related to Hawking temperature is defined well on killing horizon. We also get the Smarr relations and the first law of thermodynamics. We find that the Schwarzschild-Beltrami-de Sitter black hole seems to have similar thermodynamical properties to Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole in the comparison between their corresponding thermodynamical quantities, although the new black hole metric is described by inertial coordinates which exclude the effects of inertial force.
