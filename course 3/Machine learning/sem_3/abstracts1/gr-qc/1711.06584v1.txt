In recent years, the dynamics of particles around the black holes surrounded by weak magnetic field is an interesting matter to study. We investigate here the dynamics of charged particles around charged accelerating AdS (Anti-de-Sitter) black hole in the absence and presence of magnetic field by computing $Euler-Lagrange$ equations of motion. We further calculate the escape energy, escape velocity for both cases and a comparative analysis being done. Moreover we investigate the center of mass energy of colliding particles for the same. Finally, we compute the effective force acting on the charged particles in the curved background and study its dependence on the radius of black bole graphically.
