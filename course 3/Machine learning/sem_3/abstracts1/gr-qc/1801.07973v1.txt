We investigate spherically symmetric, steady state, adiabatic accretion onto a Tangherlini-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in arbitrary dimensions by using $D$-dimensional general relativity. We obtain basic equations for accretion and determine analytically the critical points, the critical fluid velocity, and the critical sound speed. We lay emphasis on the condition under which the accretion is possible. This condition constrains the ratio of mass to charge in a narrow limit, which is independent of dimension for large dimension. This condition may challenge the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture since a naked singularity is eventually produced as the magnitude of charge increases compared to the mass of black hole.
