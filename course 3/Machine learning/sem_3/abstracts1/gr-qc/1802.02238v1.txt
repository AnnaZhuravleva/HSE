In this work we extend the results of [1] where, Semiclassical Selfconsistent Configurations (SSC) formalism was introduced. The scheme combines quantum field theory on a background space-time, semiclassical treatment of gravitation and spontaneous collapse theories. The approach is applied to the context of early universe cosmology using a formal description of the transition from an initial inflationary stage characterized by a spatially homogeneous and isotropic (H & I) universe, to another where inhomogeneities are present in association with quantum fluctuations of the field driving inflation. In that work two constructions are produced. One of them describes a universe that is completely spatially homogeneous and isotropic, and the other is characterized by a slight excitation of the particular inhomogeneous and anisotropic perturbation. Finally, a characterization of their gluing to each other is provided as representing the transition as a result from a spontaneous collapse of the state of the quantum field, following the hypothesis originally introduced in [2].   We revisit these issues working this time up to second order perturbation theory. We find that the self consistent construction now requires consideration of the so called tensor modes.
