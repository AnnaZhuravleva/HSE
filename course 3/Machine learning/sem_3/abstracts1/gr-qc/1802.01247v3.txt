Here we concisely review the nonminimal coupling dynamics of a single scalar field in the context of purely affine gravity and extend the study to multifield dynamics. The coupling is performed via an affine connection and its associated curvature without referring to any metric tensor. The latter arises a posteriori and it may gain an emergent character like the scale of gravity. What is remarkable in affine gravity is the transition from nonminimal to minimal couplings which is realized by only field redefinition of the scalar fields. Consequently, the inflationary models gain a unique description in this context where the observed parameters, like the scalar tilt and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are invariant under field reparametrization. Overall, gravity in its affine approach is expected to reveal interesting and rich phenomenology in cosmology and astroparticle physics.
