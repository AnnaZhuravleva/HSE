The dynamical system behaviour of a homogeneous and isotropic dissipative universe is analysed. The dissipation is driven by the bulk viscous pressure and the evolution of the bulk viscous pressure is described using the full causal Israel-Stewart theory. We found that, the model possess unstable prior decelerated and stable future accelerated solution. All the solutions corresponding to the critical points obey dominant energy condition, but the future one violate strong energy condition consequent to the late acceleration. The best estimated values of the model parameters have used for analysing the asymptotic properties of the model. The equation of state parameter and the deceleration parameter quantifies the stiff fluid character of the viscous fluid in the early evolutionary phase of the universe and in later phase the fluid become negative pressure fluid. From the thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the local as well as the generalised second law of thermodynamics is satisfied throughout in the evolution of the universe. Whereas the convexity condition $S''<0$ is satisfied in the late time accelerating expansion of the universe, but it is violated during the early stage of evolution. Thereby, the present model will have a tendency to maximise the entropy, like an ordinary macroscopic system to achieve thermodynamic stability.
