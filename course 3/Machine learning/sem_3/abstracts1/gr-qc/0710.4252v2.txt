We consider the scattering of a low-frequency gravitational wave by a massive compact body in vacuum. We apply partial-wave methods to compute amplitudes for the helicity-conserving and helicity-reversing contributions to the cross section, accurate to first order in $M\omega$. Contrary to previous claims, we find that the partial-wave cross section agrees with the cross section derived via perturbation-theory methods.
