The full metric describing a stationary axisymmetric system of two arbitrary Kerr sources, black holes or hyperextreme objects, located on the symmetry axis and kept apart in equilibrium by a massless strut is presented in a concise explicit form involving five physical parameters. The binary system composed of a Schwarzschild black hole and a Kerr source is a special case not covered by the general formulas, and we elaborate the metric for this physically interesting configuration too.
