Random non-commutative geometries are a novel approach to taking a non-perturbative path integral over geometries. They were introduced in arxiv.org/abs/1510.01377, where a first examination was performed. During this examination we found that some geometries show indications of a phase transition. In this article we explore this phase transition further for geometries of type $(1,1)$, $(2,0)$, and $(1,3)$. We determine the pseudo critical points of these geometries and explore how some of the observables scale with the system size. We also undertake first steps towards understanding the critical behaviour through correlations and in determining critical exponents of the system.
