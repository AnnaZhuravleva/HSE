We study a particular realization of the cosmological bounce scenario proposed recently by Ijjas and Steinhardt. First, we find that their bouncing solution starts from a divergent sound speed and ends with its vanishing. Thus, the solution connects two strongly coupled configurations. These pathologies are separated from the bouncing regime by only a few Planck times. We then reveal the exact structure of the Lagrangian, which reproduces this bouncing solution. This reconstruction allowed us to consider other cosmological solutions of the theory and analyze the phase space. In particular, we find other bouncing solutions and solutions with superluminal sound speed. These stable superluminal states can be continuously transformed into the solution constructed by Ijjas and Steinhardt. We discuss the consequences of this feature for a possible UV-completion.
