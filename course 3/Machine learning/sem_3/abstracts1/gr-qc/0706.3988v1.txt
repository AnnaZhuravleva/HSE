A 5-dimensional cosmological solution in the model with two 2-forms and two ``phantom'' scalar fields is considered. The model contains two dilatonic coupling vectors obeying certain restrictions. It is shown that there exists a time interval where accelerating expansion of ``our'' 3-dimensional space is compatible with a small value of effective gravitational ``constant'' variation.
