We present results from the first study of critical behavior in 3-d gravitational collapse. The source of the gravitational field is a massless scalar field. This is a well-studied case for spherically symmetric gravitational collapse, allowing us to understand the reliability and accuracy of the simulations. We study both supercritical and subcritical evolutions to see if one provides more accurate results than the other. We find that even for highly non-spherical initial data, the critical solution is the same as in spherical symmetry.
