We compute the quasi-normal (QN) frequencies for the regular Bardeen de Sitter (BdS) black hole due to electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. We analyse the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of QN frequencies by varying the black hole parameters. A study on the dynamics of the perturbation as well as the scattering from the BdS black holes using WKB approach is performed. Greybody factors and their variations with black hole parameters are investigated.
