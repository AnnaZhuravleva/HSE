We discuss dynamical aspects of gravitational plane waves in Einstein theory with massless scalar fields. The general analytic solution describes colliding gravitational waves with constant polarization, which interact with scalar waves and, for generic initial data, produce a spacetime singularity at the focusing hypersurface. There is, in addition, an infinite family of regular solutions and an intriguing static geometry supported by scalar fields. Upon dimensional reduction, the theory can be viewed as an exactly solvable two-dimensional gravity model. This provides a new viewpoint on the gravitational dynamics. Finally, we comment on a simple mechanism by which short-distance corrections in the two-dimensional model can remove the singularity.
