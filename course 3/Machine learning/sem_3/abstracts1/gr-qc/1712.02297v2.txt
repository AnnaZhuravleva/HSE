Inhomogeneous cosmological models such as the Stephani universes could, in principle, provide an explanation for the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Working with a concrete, popular model of the Stephani cosmology -- the Stephani-Dabrowski model, we found that it is entropically viable. We also comment on the energy conditions and the two-sheeted geometry of the spacetime. However, similar to the LTB models, despite satisfying the holographic principle, Stephani cosmology has difficulty satisfying all the constraints from observations.
