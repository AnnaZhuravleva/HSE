Bardeen regular black hole is commonly considered as a solution of general relativity coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. In this letter, it is shown that Bardeen solution may be interpreted as a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. This new interpretation is obtained by means of a generalized uncertainty principle applied to Hawking temperature. Moreover, using the regular black hole of Bardeen, it is possible to evaluate the quantum gravity parameter of the generalized uncertainty principle or, assuming the recent upper bounds for such a parameter, verify an enormous discrepancy between a cosmological constant and that measured by recent cosmological observations $(\sim 10^{120})$.
