The speed of gravitational waves provides us a new tool to test alternative theories of gravity. The constraint on the speed of gravitational waves from GW170817 and GRB170817A is used to test some classes of Horndeski theory. In particular, we consider the coupling of a scalar field to Einstein tensor and the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet theory to a scalar field. The coupling strength of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling is constrained to be in the order of $10^{-15}$, and the mass scale $M$ introduced in the non-minimally derivative coupling is constrained to be in the range $10^{15}\text{GeV}\gg M \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-35}$GeV taking also under consideration the early times upper bound for the mass scale $M$.
