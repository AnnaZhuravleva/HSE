We investigate the tidal deformability of a superfluid neutron star. We calculate the equilibrium structure in the general relativistic two-fluid formalism with entrainment effect where we take neutron superfluid as one fluid and the other fluid is comprised of protons and electrons, making it a charge neutral fluid. We use a relativistic mean field model for the equation of state of matter where the interaction between baryons is mediated by the exchange $\sigma$, $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons. Then, we study the linear, static $l=2$ perturbation on the star to compute the electric-type Love number following Hinderer's prescription.
