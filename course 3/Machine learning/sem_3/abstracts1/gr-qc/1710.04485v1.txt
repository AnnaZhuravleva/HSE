In this work, following the approach of Kiselev for the static black holes, we seek a realistic solution for classical description of the evaporating-accreting Vaidya black hole in the generic dynamical backgrounds of dust, radiation, quintessence, cosmological constant and phantom field, and classify them according to their behaviors under imposing the positive energy condition. This condition imposes some severe restrictions on the background field dynamics, and gives a particular distance at which there is no effective radiation-accretion density contribution.
