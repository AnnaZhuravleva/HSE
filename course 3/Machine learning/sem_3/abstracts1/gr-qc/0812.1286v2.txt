In this work we review some of the theoretical efforts and experimental evidences related to Dark matter and Dark energy problems in the universe. These dilemmas show us how incomplete our knowledge of gravity is, and how our concepts about the universe must at least be revised. Mainly, on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) fifth year, the data indicates that more than 90% of the total energy density of the universe is dark. Here we discuss the impact of these phenomena imprint on gravitational and quantum field theory's standard history. Moreover, we point out some recent and upcoming projects on Cosmology intended to shed light on these problems.
