Black holes in $d < 3$ spatial dimensions are studied from the perspective of the corpuscular model of gravitation. We show that the occupation number of gravitons in the condensate scales holographically in all dimensions as $N_d \sim \left(L_d/\ell_{\rm p}\right)^{d-1}$, where $L_d$ is the relevant length for the system in the $(d+1)$-dimensional space-time. In particular, this analysis shows that black holes cannot contain more than a few gravitons in $d=1$. Since dimensional reduction is a common feature of many models of quantum gravity, this result can shed light on the end of the Hawking evaporation.
