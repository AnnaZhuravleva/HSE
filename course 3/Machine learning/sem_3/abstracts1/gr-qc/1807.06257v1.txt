The mass lower bound of the Maxwell field (linear hair) has been studied in asymptotically flat black holes in PRD 84(2011)124030. Similar to this approach, we also use the Maxwell field as a linear limit to disclose properties of genuine black hole hair. We extend the discussion to asymptotically dS and asymptotically AdS black holes. And we obtain upper and lower bounds for the linear hair mass with analytical methods. The bounds show that the non-zero behaviors of the linear hair must begin below the photonsphere and extend above the photonsphere for black hole spacetimes with various cosmological constants. The result of the limiting case of linear hair leads us to conjecture that genuine hairy black holes (such as EYM black hole and EBI black hole) also have the similar no short hair behavior and satisfy the similar mass bounds with various cosmological constants.
