We study the quantum cosmology of a quadratic $f(R)$ theory with a FRW metric, via one of its equivalent Horndeski type actions, where the dynamics of the scalar field is induced. The classical equations of motion and the Weeler-deWitt equation, in their exact versions, are solved numerically. From the choice of a free parameter in the action follow two cases, inflation + exit and inflation alone. The numerical solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation depends strongly on the boundary conditions, which can be chosen so that the resulting wave function of the universe seems to be normalizable and consistent with hermitian operators.
