Non-canonical scalar fields with the Lagrangian ${\cal L} = X^\alpha - V(\phi)$, possess the attractive property that the speed of sound, $c_s^{2} = (2\,\alpha - 1)^{-1}$, can be exceedingly small for large values of $\alpha$. This allows a non-canonical field to cluster and behave like warm/cold dark matter on small scales. We demonstrate that simple potentials including $V = V_0\coth^2{\phi}$ and a Starobinsky-type potential can unify dark matter and dark energy. Cascading dark energy, in which the potential cascades to lower values in a series of discrete steps, can also work as a unified model. In all of these models the kinetic term $X^\alpha$ plays the role of dark matter, while the potential term $V(\phi)$ plays the role of dark energy.
