Dragging of inertial frames is one of the most surprising and quintessential effects of General Relativity.   In its simplest version, a particle which is directed radially towards a rotating source acquires non-radial components of motion as it falls freely in the gravitational field.   Here, by considering analytical exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell field equation, it is shown that this purely general relativistic effect is capable of reconstructing KAM tori from initial highly chaotic configurations around static gravitational sources.   Since signatures of chaotic dynamics in gravitational waves have been suggested to test the validity of General Relativity in the strong field regime, chaos suppression by inertial frame dragging may undermine present proposals to verifying the no-hair theorem and validity of General Relativity
