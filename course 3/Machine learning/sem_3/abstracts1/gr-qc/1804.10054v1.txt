In the framework of extended Einstein-aether-axion theory we establish the model, which describes a stiff regulation of the behavior of axionic dark matter by the dynamic aether. The aether realizes this procedure via the modified Higgs potential, designed for modeling of nonlinear self-interaction of pseudoscalar (axion) field; the modification of this potential is that its minima are not fixed, and their positions and depths depend now on the square of the covariant derivative of the aether velocity four-vector. Exact solutions to the master equations, modified correspondingly, are obtained in the framework of homogeneous isotropic cosmological model. The analysis of the acceleration parameter has shown that it possesses one zero, thus guaranteeing the existence of one transition point in the Universe history, which separates the epoch of decelerated expansion and the late-time epoch of accelerated expansion; the asymptotic regime of expansion is of the quasi-de Sitter type (Pseudo-Rip). During the epoch of accelerated expansion the aether pressure is shown to be negative, i.e., the dynamic aether plays the role of dark energy. The effective equation of state for axionic dark matter is of the stiff type. Homogeneous perturbations of the pseudoscalar (axion) field, of the Hubble function and of the scale factor are shown to fade out with cosmological time, there are no growing modes, the model of stiff regulation is stable.
