We provide an important new insight on the radiation dominated stage of the early universe after expressing it in a novel coordinate system. In these coordinates the radiation dominated stage is a spherically symmetric, inhomogeneous spacetime. A simple analysis shows the appearance of observer dependent horizons in this new spacetime. While none of the observers with constant radial velocity encounter a horizon, all observers, except the fundamental cosmological observer, with constant radial acceleration, encounter horizons due to coordinate singularities. Closer analysis, using the new coordinates, leads us to a strikingly new result - a compulsory gravitational particle creation for the fundamental cosmological observers.
