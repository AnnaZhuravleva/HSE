Following up on our recent study, we consider the regime of graviton masses and gravitational wave propagation distances at which decoherence of the wave packets plays a major role for phenomenology. This regime is of particular interest, as it can lead to very striking phenomena of echo events in the gravitational waves coming from coalescence events. The power of the experimental search in this case lies in the fact that it becomes sensitive to a large range of graviton masses, while not relying on a specific production mechanism. We are thus able to place new relevant limits on the parameter space of the graviton mixing angle.
