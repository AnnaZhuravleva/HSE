It is well known that the Noether symmetry approach proves to be very useful not only to fix physically viable cosmological models but also to reduce dynamics and achieve exact solutions. In this work, We examine a formal framework of nonlocal f(T) theory of gravity through the Noether symmetry approach. The Noether equations of the nonlocal f(T) theory are obtained for flat FLRW universe. We analyse the dynamics of the field in a nonlocal f(T) gravity admitted by the Noether symmetry. We observe that there exists a transition from a deceleration phase to the acceleration one in our present analysis. We check statefinder parameters for the obtained solutions. Remarkably, our analysis shows that the present model is comparable with the Lambda-CDM model.
