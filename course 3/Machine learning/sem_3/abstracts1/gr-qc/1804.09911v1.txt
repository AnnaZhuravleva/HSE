We find a new traversable wormhole solution in the framework of the bumblebee gravity theory in which the Lorentz symmetry violation arises from the dynamics of the bumblebee vector field non-minimally coupled to gravity. To this end, we check the flare-out and energy conditions (null, weak, and strong). Then we study the deflection angle of light in the weak limit approximation using the Gibbons-Werner method. In particular, we show that the bumblebee gravity effect leads to a non-trivial global topology of the wormhole spacetime. By using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, it is shown that the obtained (non-asymptotically flat) wormhole solution yields a topological term in the deflection angle of light which is proportional to the coupling constant, but independent from the impact factor parameter. Significantly, it is shown that the bumblebee wormhole solutions, under specific conditions, support the normal matter wormhole geometries, which satisfy both the energy and the flare-out conditions.
