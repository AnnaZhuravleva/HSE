We make a generalization of a self-consistent first-order perturbation scheme, being suitable for all (sub-horizon and super-horizon) scales, which has been recently constructed for the concordance cosmological model and discrete presentation of matter sources, to the case of extended models with extra perfect fluids and continuous presentation. Namely, we derive a single equation determining the scalar perturbation and covering the whole space as well as define the corresponding universal Yukawa interaction range. We also demonstrate explicitly that the structure growth is suppressed at distances exceeding this fundamental range.
