We highlight how the existence of an ultraviolet completion for interacting Standard-Model type matter puts constraints on the viable microscopic dynamics of asymptotically safe quantum gravity within truncated Renormalization Group flows. A first constraint -- the weak-gravity bound -- is rooted in the destruction of quantum scale-invariance in the matter system by strong quantum-gravity fluctuations. A second constraint arises by linking Planck-scale dynamics to the dynamics at the electroweak scale. Specifically, we delineate how to extract a prediction of the top quark mass from asymptotically safe gravity and stress that a finite top mass could be difficult to accommodate in a significant part of the gravitational coupling space.
