We consider the possibility that the primordial fluctuations (scalar and tensor) might have been standing waves at their moment of creation, whether or not they had a quantum origin. We lay down the general conditions for spatial translational invariance, and isolate the pieces of the most general such theory that comply with, or break translational symmetry. We find that, in order to characterize statistically translationally invariant standing waves, it is essential to consider the correlator $\langle c_0({\mathbf k}) c_0({\mathbf k}')\rangle$ in addition to the better known $\langle c_0({\mathbf k}) c_0^\dagger({\mathbf k}')\rangle$ (where $c_0({\mathbf k})$ are the complex amplitudes of travelling waves). We then examine how the standard process of "squeezing" (responsible for converting travelling waves into standing waves while the fluctuations are outside the horizon) reacts to being fed primordial standing waves. For translationally invariant systems only one type of standing wave, with the correct temporal phase (the "sine wave"), survives squeezing. Primordial standing waves might therefore be invisible at late times -- or not -- depending on their phase. Theories with modified dispersion relations behave differently in this respect, since only standing waves with the opposite temporal phase survive at late times.
