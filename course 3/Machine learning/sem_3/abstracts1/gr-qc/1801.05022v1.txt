This paper investigates the geometry of static traversable wormhole through Noether symmetry approach in $f(R)$ gravity. We take perfect fluid distribution and formulate symmetry generators with associated conserved quantities corresponding to general form, power-law and exponential $f(R)$ models. In each case, we evaluate wormhole solutions using constant and variable red-shift functions. We analyze the behavior of shape function, viability of constructed $f(R)$ model and stability of wormhole solutions graphically. The physical existence of wormhole solutions can be examined through null/weak energy conditions of perfect fluid and null energy condition of the effective energy-momentum tensor. The graphical interpretation of constructed wormhole solutions ensures the existence of physically viable and traversable wormholes for all models. It is concluded that the constructed wormholes are found to be stable in most of the cases.
