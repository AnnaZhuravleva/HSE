We investigate a large class of gravity theories that respect to spatial covariance, and involve kinetic terms for both the spatial metric and the lapse function. Generally such kind of theories propagate four physical degrees of freedom, one of which is a ghost mode. Through a detailed Hamiltonian analysis, we derive two conditions that the Lagrangian must satisfy in order to ensure that there are at most three physical degrees of freedom. By employing the Stueckelberg trick, our formalism provides us a much broader framework for "healthy"4 generally covariant scalar-tensor theories. We also give an explicit example to show how our formalism works.
