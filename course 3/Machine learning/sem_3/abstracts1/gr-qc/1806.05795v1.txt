The study of the interior of black holes in the quantum regime is important, not only with regard to the singularity avoidance, but also to get more insight into their behavior in connection with quantum gravity. We introduce several extensions and new improvements regarding the previous works on the effective behavior of the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole using loop quantization, considered as a bouncing Kantowski-Sachs model. First, the path integral method is employed to systematically derive an effective Hamiltonian constraint for the model. As a direct consequence of this approach, further inverse triad corrections appear in the Hamiltonian. These corrections present well-known problems, among them the dependence of the physical quantities on the fiducial-volume parameters, or their rescalings. To cure these issues, we put forward two prescriptions, and further show how some physical quantities, including the "minimum radius at the bounce", are modified due to the presence of these new corrections, in each of the two prescriptions. Our proposal may pave the way to incorporate these kinds of corrections systematically in other models and resolve the issues raised by them.
