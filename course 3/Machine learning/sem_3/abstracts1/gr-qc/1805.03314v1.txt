Continuous gravitational-wave signals from isolated non-axisymmetric rotating neutron stars may undergo episodic spin-up events known as glitches. If unmodelled by a search, these can result in missed or misidentified detections. We outline a semicoherent glitch-robust search method that allows identification of glitching signal candidates and inference about the model parameters.
