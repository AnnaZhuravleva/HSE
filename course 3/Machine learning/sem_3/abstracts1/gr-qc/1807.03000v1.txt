We work out the most general theory for the interaction of spacetime geometry and given source fields, commonly referred to as geometrodynamics. The minimum set of postulates to be introduced is that (i) the action principle should apply and that (ii) the total action should by form-invariant under the diffeomorphism group. The second postulate thus implements the Principle of General Relativity. According to Noether's theorem, this symmetry gives rise to a conserved Noether current, from which the complete set of possible theories can be deduced. This finally results in a new generic Einstein-type equation, which comprises the \emph{canonical} energy-momentum tensor as the relevant source quantity.
