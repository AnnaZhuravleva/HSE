In cosmology, the cosmic curvature $K$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ are two important parameters, and the values have strong influence on the behavior of the universe. In the context of normal cosmology, under the ordinary assumptions of positive mass-energy and initial negative pressure, we find the initial singularity of the universe is certainly absent and we have $K=1$. This means total spatial structure of the universe should be a 3-dimensional sphere $S^3$. For the cyclic cosmological model, we have $\Lambda\lesssim 10^{-24} {\rm ly}^{-2}$. Obviously, such constraints would be helpful for the researches on the properties of dark matter and dark energy in cosmology.
