This paper discusses the possible existence of traversable wormholes in f(R) modified gravity while assuming a noncommutative-geometry background, as well as zero tidal forces. The first part of the paper aims for an overview via several shape functions by determining the corresponding wormhole solutions and their properties. The solutions are made complete by deriving the modified-gravity functions F(r) and f(R), where F=df/dR. It is subsequently shown that the violation of the null energy condition can be attributed to the combined effects of f(R) gravity and noncommutative geometry. The second part of the paper reverses the strategy by starting with a special form of f(R) and determining the wormhole solution and the concomitant F(r). The approach in this paper differs in significant ways from that of Jamil et al.
