In our previous article [Rad16], we investigated the asymptotic behaviour of orthogonal Bianchi class B perfect fluids close to the initial singularity and proved the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture in this setting. In several of the statements, the case of a stiff fluid had to be excluded. The present paper fills this gap.   We work in expansion-normalised variables introduced by Hewitt-Wainwright and find that solutions converge, but show a convergence behaviour very different from the non-stiff case: All solutions tend to limit points in the two-dimensional Jacobs set. A set of full measure, which is also a countable intersection of open and dense sets in the state space, yields convergence to a specific subset of the Jacobs set.
