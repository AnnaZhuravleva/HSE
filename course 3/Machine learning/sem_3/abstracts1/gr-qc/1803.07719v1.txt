The solutions for the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation bring valuable informations about the macroscopical features of compact astrophysical objects. They are sensitive to both the equation of state considered for nuclear matter and the background gravitational theory. In this work we construct the TOV equation for a conservative version of the $f(R,T)$ gravity. While the non-vanishing of the covariant derivative of the $f(R,T)$ energy-momentum tensor yields, in a cosmological perspective, the prediction of creation of matter throughout the universe evolution as shown by T. Harko, in the analysis of the hydrostatic equilibrium of compact astrophysical objects, this property still lacks a convincing physical explanation. The imposition of $\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=0$ demands a particular form for the function $h(T)$ in $f(R,T)=R+h(T)$, which is here derived. We construct and solve the TOV equation for this case and the macroscopical properties of compact stars, derived within this approach, are presented and discussed.
