With the motivation in mind to evaluate the contribution of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ on the foam like patterns formation process in the distribution of galaxies, we investigate the Newtonian dynamics of a spherical void embedded in an uniform medium which undergoes a Hubble expansion. We use a covariant approach for deriving the evolution with time of the shell (S) acting as a boundaries condition for the inside and outside media. As a result, with the usual values for the cosmological parameters, S expands with a huge initial burst that freezes up to matching Hubble flow. With respect to Friedmann comoving frame, its magnification increases nonlinearly with $\Lambda$, with a maximal growth rate at redshift $z\sim 1.7$. The velocity field inside S shows an interesting feature which enables us to disentangle a spatially closed from open universe. Namely, the void region are swept out in the first case, what can be interpreted as a stability criterion.
