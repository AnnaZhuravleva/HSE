The suggestion of running gravitational coupling which tends to a non--Gaussian fixed point at high energies, keeps the theory safe from divergences at such a scale. We propose a way of improving the action using Kretschmann invariant as the cutoff identification parameter. The improved equations of motion and its spherically symmetric vacuum solution are obtained. Then the effects on the massive particles' trajectory and the black hole thermodynamics are studied.
