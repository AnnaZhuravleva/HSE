Several space missions such as GRACE, GRAIL, ACES and others rely on intersatellite com- munications (ISC) between two satellites at a large distance one from another. This is not only a technical problem because for example for the GRAIL-mission all the observables for the two radio links at the K and Ka- bands (26 GHz and 32 GHz) for intersatellite ranging and also the navigation observables for the S- and X- bands ( 2 GHz and 8 GHz) should be formulated within the General Relativity Theory (GRT). The same approach should be applied to the inter- satellite GPS-communications (in perspective also between the GPS, GLONASS and Galileo satellite constellations). In this paper a theoretical approach has been developed for ISC between two satellites moving on (one-plane) elliptical orbits based on the introduction of two gravity null cones with origins at the emitting-signal and receiving-signal satellites. The two null cones account for the variable distance between the satellites and their uncorrelated motion. The most important consequence of the theory is the obtained condition for ISC. This theory places also a restriction on the ellipticity e of the orbit (e less or equal than 0.816496580927726). For the typical GPS orbital parameters the condition for ISC gives a value E = 45.00251 [deg] for the eccentric anomaly angle, which is surprisingly close to the value for the true anomaly angle f = 45.54143 [deg] and also to the angle of disposition of the satellites in the GLONASS satellite constellation (the Russian analogue of the American GPS) - 8 satellites within one and the same plane equally spaced at 45 deg. The paper is the first step towards constructing a new and consistent relativistic physical theory of ISC between moving (non-stationary) satellites.
