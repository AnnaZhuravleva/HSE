We present a theory of quantum gravity that combines a geometrical formulation of quantum field theory in space-time with classical Einstein's general relativity. This approach is based on the geometrization of quantum mechanics proposed in refs.[1,2] and combines quantum and gravitational effects into a global curvature of the Finsler's space associated to the 4N-dimensional configuration space of a N-particle system. In order to make this theory compatible with general relativity, the quantum effects are described in the framework of quantum field theory, where a covariant definition of 'simultaneity' for many-body systems is introduced through the definition of a suited foliation of space-time. As for Einstein's classical gravitation theory, the particles dynamics is finally described by means of a geodesic equation in a curved space-time manifold.
