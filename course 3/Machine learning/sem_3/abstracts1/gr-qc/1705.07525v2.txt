Lorentz gauge theory (LGT) is a feasible candidate for theory of quantum gravity in which routine field theory calculations can be carried out perturbatively without encountering too many divergences. In LGT spin of matter also gravitates. The spin-generated gravity is expected to be extremely stronger than that generated by mass and could be explored in current colliders. In this article the observable signals of the theory in an electron-positron collider is investigated. We specifically study pair annihilation into two gravitons, and LGT corrections to processes like $e^-+e^+\rightarrow \mu^-+\mu^+$ and $e^-+e^+\rightarrow e^-+e^+$.
