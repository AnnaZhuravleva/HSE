The relative classical motion of membranes is governed by an equation of the form D(hessian D separation)=riemann times separation times momentum. This is a generalization of the geodesic deviation equation and can be derived from a simple lagrangian. Quantum mechanically the picture is less clear. Some quantizations of the classical equations are attempted so that the question as to whether the Universe started with a quantum fluctuation can be addressed.
