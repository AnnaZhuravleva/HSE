A five-dimensional cosmological model including a single perfect fluid is studied in the framework of dynamical system analysis. All the critical points of the system with their stability properties are listed and some representative phase diagrams are explicitly shown. It is found that the stabilization of the extra dimension is possible and the observed flatness of the three-dimensional space is provided for certain ranges of the equation of state parameter of the fluid during the evolution of the universe. The model suggested here can be considered as a simplified model for examining the possible effects of the extra dimensions in the early universe.
