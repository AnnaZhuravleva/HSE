This work is focused in the study of analytic anisotropic solutions to Einstein's field equations, describing spherically symmetric and static configurations by way of the gravitational decoupling through the method of Minimal Geometric Deformation (MGD). For this we apply MGD to Heintzmann's solution obtaining two new analytic and well behaved anisotropic solutions, in which all their parameters such as the effective density, the effective radial and tangential pressure, as well as radial and tangential sound speed, fulfill each of the requirements for the physical acceptability available in the literature.
