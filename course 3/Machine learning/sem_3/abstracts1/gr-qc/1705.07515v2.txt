We present in detail an Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulation for the essential case of spinning objects as the components of inspiralling compact binaries. We review its implementation, carried out in a series of works in recent years, which leveled the high post-Newtonian (PN) accuracy in the spinning sector to that, recently attained in the non-spinning sector. We note a public package, "EFTofPNG", that we recently created for high precision computation in the EFT of PN Gravity, which covers all sectors, and includes an observables pipeline.
