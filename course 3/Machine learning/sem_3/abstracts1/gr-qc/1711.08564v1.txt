In this work, we propose a new class of smooth thick string-like braneworld in six dimensions. The solutions of the Einstein equations exhibit near-brane internal features and an AdS asymptotic behavior. The brane-core geometry is parametrized by the Bulk cosmological constant, the brane width and by a geometrical deformation parameter. The source satisfies the dominant energy condition for the undeformed solution and has an exotic asymptotic regime for the deformed solution. This scenario provides a normalized massless Kaluza-Klein mode for the scalar, gravitational and gauge sectors. The near-brane geometry allows massive resonant modes at the brane for the $s$ state and nearby the brane for l=1.
