We generalize our unique continuation results recently established for a class of linear and nonlinear wave equations $\Box_g \phi + \sigma \phi = \mathcal{G} ( \phi, \partial \phi )$ on asymptotically anti-de Sitter (aAdS) spacetimes to aAdS spacetimes admitting non-static boundary metrics. The new Carleman estimates established in this setting constitute an essential ingredient in proving unique continuation results for the full nonlinear Einstein equations, which will be addressed in forthcoming papers. Key to the proof is a new geometrically adapted construction of foliations of pseudoconvex hypersurfaces near the conformal boundary.
