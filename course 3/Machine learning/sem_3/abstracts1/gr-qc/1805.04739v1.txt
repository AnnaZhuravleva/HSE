We consider a noncommutative standard model with a minimal coupling scalar field and a dynamical deformation between the canonical momenta of its scale factor and scalar field, and a chameleon model with a non-minimally coupling scalar field. We indicate that there is a correspondence between these two models, more specific, actually between the noncommutative parameter and the chameleon coupling strength, and also between the matter density of the chameleon model and the noncommutative geometry. In addition, the analogy constrains the type of the matter field in the chameleon model to be nearly a cosmic string-like during the inflation. Thus, the scenario enables the evolution of the universe being described by one single scalar field. That is, the effects of the chameleon and the inflaton can be described by one single scalar field which plays the role of inflaton in the very early universe and then, acts as a chameleon field. Moreover, the proposed correspondence procedure not~only sets some constraints on the noncommutative parameter and the chameleon coupling constant, but also nearly specifies functions of the scalar field and its potential.
