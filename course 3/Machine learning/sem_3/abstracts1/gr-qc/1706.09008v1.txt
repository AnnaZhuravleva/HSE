We study conditions on a generic connection written in terms of first-order derivatives of the vielbein in order to obtain (possible) equivalent theories to Einstein Gravity. We derive the equations of motion for these theories which are based on the new connections. We recover the Teleparallel Gravity equations of motion as a particular case. The analysis of this work might be useful to Double Field Theory to find other connections determined in terms of the physical fields.
