Using the Wald formalism, we investigate the thermodynamics of charged black holes in D-dimensional stationary spacetimes with or without rotations in Einstein-\ae ther-Maxwell theory. In particular, assuming the existence of a scaling symmetry of the action, we obtain the Smarr integral formula, which can be applied to both Killing and universal horizons. When restricted to 4-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetimes, previous results obtained by a different method are re-derived.
