Non-minimal interactions in the pp-wave Einstein - Yang - Mills - Higgs (EYMH) model are shown to give rise to color cross-effects analogous to the magneto-electricity in the Maxwell theory. In order to illustrate the significance of these color cross-effects, we reconstruct the effective (associated, color and color-acoustic) metrics for the pp-wave non-minimal seven-parameter EYMH model with parallel gauge and scalar background fields. Then these metrics are used as hints for obtaining explicit exact solutions of the non-minimally extended Yang-Mills and Higgs equations for the test fields propagating in the vacuum interacting with curvature. The influence of the non-minimal coupling on the test particle motion is interpreted in terms of the so-called trapped surfaces, introduced in the Analog Gravity theory.
