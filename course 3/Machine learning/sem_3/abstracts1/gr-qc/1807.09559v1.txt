The quasinormal modes of charged and uncharged massive scalar fields and also of charged Dirac fields against the background of a charged spherical black hole endowed with a scalar hair have been investigated. Special emphasis has been given to the case where negative scalar charge dominates over the electric charge of the black hole which mimics an Einstein-Rosen bridge. Except for the complete monotonic behaviour of the damping (imaginary part of the quasinormal mode) against the charge of the black hole as opposed to the existence of a peak for the pure RN case, the qualitative behaviour does not appreciably change due to the presence of scalar hair.
