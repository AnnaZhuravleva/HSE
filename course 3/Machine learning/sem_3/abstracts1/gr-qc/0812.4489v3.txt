Unparticle physics has been an active field since the seminal work of Georgi. Recently, many constraints on unparticles from various observations have been considered in the literature. In particular, the cosmological constraints on the unparticle dark component put it in a serious situation. In this work, we try to find a way out of this serious situation, by including the possible interaction between dark energy and the unparticle dark component.
