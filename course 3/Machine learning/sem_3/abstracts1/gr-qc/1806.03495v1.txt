We compute gravitational self-force corrections to tidal invariants for spinning particles moving along circular orbits in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In particular, we consider the square and the cube of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal tensor and the square of the gravitomagnetic quadrupolar tidal tensor. Our results are accurate to first-order in spin and through the 9.5 post-Newtonian order. We also compute the associated electric-type and magnetic-type eigenvalues.
