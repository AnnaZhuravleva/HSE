In this paper, we have studied the new exact model of anisotropic star in $f(T)$ theory of gravity. The dynamical equations in $f(T)$ theory with the anisotropic fluid have been solved by using Krori-Barua solution. We have determined that all the obtained solutions are free from central singularity and potentially stable. The observed values of mass and radius of the different strange stars RX J 1856-37, Her X-1, and Vela X-12 have been used to calculate the values of unknown constants in Krori and Barua metric. The physical parameters like anisotropy, stability and redshift of the stars have been investigated in detail.
