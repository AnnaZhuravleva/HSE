In this paper, we derive closed formulas for the mass $M$ and the spin parameter $a=J/M$ (here $J$ is the black hole angular momentum in natural units) of a Kerr black hole in terms of a minimal quantity of observational data, namely, the red-/blueshifts of photons emitted by massive particles (stars or gas) moving on geodesics around the black hole and their respective orbital radius. It turns out that given a set of two (three) stars revolving around the Kerr black hole, the aforementioned formulas involve just eight (twelve) observational data.
