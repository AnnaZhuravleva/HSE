In this work, we study the dynamical systems analysis of phantom dark energy models considering a general potential. The stability analysis of the system shows that there is only one fixed point which could be the beginning of the universe but there could be many options for our future destiny. A detail numerical analysis of the system is also done using three different schemes and it shows that the late time behavior of the system is consistent with the recent observations.
