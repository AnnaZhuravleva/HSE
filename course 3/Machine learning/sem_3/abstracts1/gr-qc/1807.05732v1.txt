We study inflation with the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) noncanonical scalar field in both the cold and warm scenarios. In the cold DBI setting, the 95\% CL constraint of Planck 2015 T+E data on the primordial non-Gaussianity parameter provides the lower bound $c_{s}\geq0.087$ on the sound speed of the model. We consider the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) warp factor $f(\phi)=f_{0}/\phi^{4}$ within this framework and check viability of the quartic potential $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^{4}/4$ in light of the Planck 2015 observational results. We find that in the cold DBI setting, the prediction of this potential in the $r-n_s$ plane is in conflict with Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data. Then, we focus on the warm DBI inflation with the AdS warp factor and examine the quartic potential $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^{4}/4$ in the presence of constant sound speed. We conclude that the $r-n_s$ result of this model can be compatible with the 68\% CL constraints of Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data in the intermediate and high dissipation regimes of warm DBI inflation, whereas it fails to be observationally viable in the weak dissipation regime. Moreover, the prediction of this model for the running of the scalar spectral index $dn_s/d\ln k$ is in good agreement with the constraint of Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP data.
