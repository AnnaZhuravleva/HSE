In this short note we present the solution of Rastall gravity equations sourced by a Gaussian matter distribution. We find that the black hole metric shares all the common features of other regular, General Relativity BH solutions discussed in the literature: there is no curvature singularity and the Hawking radiation leaves a remnant at zero temperature in the form of a massive ordinary particle.
