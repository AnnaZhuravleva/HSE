The dynamics of compact binary systems at the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) approximation of general relativity has been recently completed in a self-consistent way. In this paper, we compute the ten Poincar\'e constants of the motion and present the equations of motion in the frame of the center of mass (CM), together with the corresponding CM Lagrangian, conserved energy and conserved angular momentum. Next, we investigate the reduction of the CM dynamics to the case of quasi-circular orbits. The non local (in time) tail effect at the 4PN order is consistently included, as well as the relevant radiation-reaction dissipative contributions to the energy and angular momentum.
