We study a 5-dimensional $f({\cal R})$ brane gravity within the framework of scalar-tensor type theories. We show that such a model predicts, for a certain choice of $f({\cal R})$ and a spatially flat universe, an exponential potential, leading to an accelerated expanding universe driven solely by the curvature of the bulk space. This result is consistent with the observational data in the cosmological scale.
