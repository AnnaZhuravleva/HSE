A crucial property of Weyl gravity is its conformal invariance. It is shown how this gauge symmetry is exactly reflected by the two constraints in the Hamiltonian framework. Since the spatial 3-metric is one of the configuration variables. The phase space of Weyl gravity can be extended to include internal gauge freedom by triad formalism. Moreover, by a canonical transformation, we obtain a new Hamiltonian formulation of Weyl gravity with an SU(2) connection as one of its configuration variables. This connection dynamical formalism lays a foundation to quantize Weyl gravity nonperturbatively by applying the method of loop quantum gravity.
