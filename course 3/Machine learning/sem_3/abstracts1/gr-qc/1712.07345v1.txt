The merger of binary neutron star encodes rich physics of extreme states of matter. Probing it through gravitational-wave observations requires the detectors to have high sensitivity above 1 kHz. Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable gap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high frequencies. Here we propose a detector design that explores such a gap by pushing down the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter, frequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power. The resulting noise level from 1 kHz to 4 kHz approaches the current facility limit, and is a factor of 20 to 30 below the design of existing advanced detectors at these frequencies. It will allow for precision measurements of (i) the post-merger signal of binary neutron star, with electromagnetic counterparts such as short gamma-ray burst and kilonovae, (ii) late-time inspiral, merger, and ringdown of low-mass black hole-neutron star systems, and (iii) high frequency modes during supernovae explosions and/or magnetar giant flares. This design tries to maximize the science return of current facilities by achieving a sensitive frequency band that is complementary to proposed longer-baseline third-generation detectors: 10 km Einstein Telescope, and 40 km Cosmic Explorer. We have highlighted the main technical challenges towards realizing the design, which requires dedicated research programs. If demonstrated in current facilities, the technique can be transferred to new facilities with longer baseline.
