It is shown that the timelike, spacelike and null versions of the Ehlers identity, as well as ensuing Raychaudhuri equations, might be all derived within a single geometrical approach based on the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor specified with respect to the corresponding congruence. Still, spacelike and null cases have a number of non-trivial peculiarities deserving special attention.
