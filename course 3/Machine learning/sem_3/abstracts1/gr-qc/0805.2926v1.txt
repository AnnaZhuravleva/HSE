In the special theory of relativity, Lorentz invariance is extended in Minkowski spacetime from ideal inertial observers to actual observers by means of the hypothesis of locality, which postulates that accelerated observers are always pointwise inertial. A critical examination of the locality assumption reveals its domain of validity: it is true for pointwise coincidences, but is in conflict with wave-particle duality. To remedy this situation, a nonlocal theory of accelerated systems is presented that reduces to the standard theory in the limit of small accelerations. Some of the main consequences of nonlocal special relativity are briefly outlined.
