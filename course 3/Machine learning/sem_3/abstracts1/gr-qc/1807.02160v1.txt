As a group-theoretic foundation of gravity, in an arbitrary world manifold there is consistently constructed an affine-Goldstone nonlinear model based on the nonlinear realization of the global affine symmetry spontaneously broken to the Poincare one at the Planck scale. Below this scale, the model is shown to incorporate an earlier introduced effective field theory of the quartet-metric gravity, with the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson in the role of the tensor graviton supplemented by the extra gravity components treated as the candidates on the dark matter and dark energy. Beyond the Planck scale, the model is argued to pave the way towards an underlying theory of the emergent gravity and spacetime.
