We present in this work, the calculations of corrections in the Newton's law of gravitation due to Kaluza-Klein gravitons in five-dimensional warped thick braneworld scenarios. We consider here a recently proposed model, namely, the hybrid Bloch brane. This model couples two scalar fields to gravity and is engendered from a domain wall-like defect. Also, two other models the so-called asymmetric hybrid brane and compact brane are considered. As a matter of fact, these models are obtained from deformations of the phi4 and sine-Gordon topological defects. Then, we constructed the branes upon such defects, and the corresponding corrections in Newton's law of gravitation are computed. In order to attain the mass spectrum and its corresponding eigenfunctions which are the essential quantities for computing the correction to the Newtonian potential, we develop a suitable numerical technique.
