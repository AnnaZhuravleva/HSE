In the large coupling regime of the 5-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell--Chern--Simons theory, charged and rotating cohomogeneity-1 black holes form sequences of extremal and non-extremal radially excited configurations. These asymptotically global Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$) black holes form a discrete set of solutions, characterised by the vanishing of the total angular momenta, or the horizon angular velocity. However, the solutions are not static. In this paper, we study the branch structure that contains these excited states, and its relation with the static Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS black hole. Thermodynamic properties of these solutions are considered, revealing that the branches with lower excitation number can become thermodynamically unstable beyond certain critical solutions that depend on the free parameters of the configuration.
