The equation of state of the electron degenerate gas in a white dwarf is usually treated by employing the ideal dispersion relation. However, the effect of quantum gravity is expected to be inevitably present and when this effect is considered through a non-commutative formulation, the dispersion relation undergoes a substantial modification. In this paper, we take such a modified dispersion relation and find the corresponding equation of state for the degenerate electron gas in white dwarfs. Hence we solve the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium and find that this leads to the possibility of the existence of excessively high values of masses exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit although the quantum gravity effect is taken to be very small. It is only when we impose the additional effect of neutronization that we obtain white dwarfs with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit with nonzero radii at the neutronization threshold. We demonstrate these results by giving the numerical estimates for the masses and radii of $^4He$ and $^{12}C$, and $^{16}O$ white dwarfs.
