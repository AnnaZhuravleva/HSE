In this paper, we explore the properties of white dwarfs with the modified TOV in gravity's rainbow, this shows that modified gravity effect is quite non-negligible for white dwarfs, and could be significant depending on the value of rainbow function and cosmological constant. We study the rainbow function and cosmological constant on the properties of white dwarf such as $M-\rho_c$ relation, $M-R$ relation, Schwarzschild radius, average density, compactness, and gravitational redshift. An interesting result is that the maximum mass, radius and Schwarzschild radius in the gravity's rainbow equal the value in Einstein gravity times rainbow function $H(\varepsilon)$, this rule also be suitable for neutron stars in gravity's rainbow. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae(SNeIa), are believed to be triggered in white dwarfs having mass close to the Chandrasekhar limit. However, observations of several peculiar, under- and over-luminons SNeIa argue for exploding masses widely different from this limit. Our results indicate that the rainbow function induced sub-($H(\varepsilon)<1$) and super-Chandrasekhar($H(\varepsilon)$>1) limiting mass white dwarfs lead to under-and over-luminous SNeIa respectively.
