Motivated by the importance of observational results by advanced LIGO concerning the existence massive gravitons, interesting results of massive gravity and the possibility of massive white dwarfs more than the Chandrasekhar limit ($1.44M_{\odot }$, in which $M_{\odot }$ is mass of the sun), we study white dwarfs in massive gravity. Firstly, we consider the modified TOV equation in massive gravity and solve this equation by numerically by using the Chandrasekhar's equation of state. Our results show that the maximum mass of white dwarfs in massive gravity can be more than $3M_{\odot }$. Then we investigate the effects of parameters of massive gravity on other interesting properties of white dwarfs such as mass-radius relation, mass-central density relation, Schwarzschild radius, average density and compactness. Finally, we study the dynamical stability condition for massive white dwarfs in this gravity and show that these stars have dynamical stability.
