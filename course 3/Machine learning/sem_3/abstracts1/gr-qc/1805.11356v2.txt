We compute the predictions for the power spectrum of scalar perturbations from a recent new proposal for the effective Hamiltonian of loop quantum cosmology. The model provides an attractive picture of the early cosmos, in which our classical Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe emerges from a quantum phase where the spacetime curvature remains constant and of Planckian size. We compare the predictions for the cosmic microwave background with previous results obtained within loop quantum cosmology, and discuss the differences and similarities. The analysis provides an example of the way differences between quantization schemes can be translated to physical observables.
