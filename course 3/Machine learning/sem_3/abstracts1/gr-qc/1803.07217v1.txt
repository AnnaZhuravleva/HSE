We analyze the constraints of gauge theories on Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes, which contain one or more horizons. We find that the constraints are modified on such backgrounds through the presence of additional surface charges and currents at the horizon. As a concrete example, we consider the Maxwell field and determine the role of the horizon contributions on the dynamics of the theory.
