This paper aims to explore some realistic configurations of anisotropic spherical structures in the background of metric $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar. The solutions obtained by Krori and Barua are used to examine the nature of particular compact stars with three different modified gravity models. The behavior of material variables is analyzed through plots and the physical viability of compact stars is investigated through energy conditions. We also discuss the behavior of different forces, equation of state parameter, measure of anisotropy and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in the modeling of stellar structures. The comparison from our graphical representations may provide evidences for the realistic and viable $f(R)$ gravity models at both theoretical and astrophysical scale.
