Most of the properties of black holes can be mimicked by horizonless compact objects such as gravastars and boson stars. We show that these ultra-compact objects develop a strong ergoregion instability when rapidly spinning. Instability timescales can be of the order of 0.1 seconds to 1 week for objects with mass M=1-10^6 solar masses and angular momentum J> 0.4 M^2. This provides a strong indication that ultra-compact objects with large rotation are black holes. Explosive events due to ergoregion instability have a well-defined gravitational-wave signature. These events could be detected by next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Advanced LIGO or LISA.
