The covariant canonical transformation theory applied to the relativistic theory of classical matter fields in dynamical space-time yields a new gauge field theory of gravitation. The emerging field equations embrace a quadratic Riemann curvature term added to Einstein's linear equation. The quadratic term facilitates a momentum field which generates a dynamic response of space-time to its deformations. The theory reproduces the current value of the cosmological constant.   Dark Energy emerges as a balanced mix of three contributions, space-time curvature plus the residual vacuum energy of space-time and matter. The so called Cosmological Constant Problem is resolved.
