An alternative approach introducing a 3 dimensional Ricci scalar curvature quantum operator given in terms of volume and area as well as new edge length operators is proposed. An example of monochromatic 4-valent node intertwiner state (equilateral tetrahedra) is studied and the scalar curvature measure for a regular tetrahedron shape is constructed. It is shown that all regular tetrahedron states are in the negative scalar curvature regime and for the semi-classical limit the spectrum is very close to the Euclidean regime.
