In this work we present the general differential geometry of a background in which the space-time has both torsion and curvature with internal symmetries being described by gauge fields, and that is equipped to couple spinorial matter fields having spin and energy as well as gauge currents: torsion will turn out to be equivalent to an axial-vector massive Proca field and because the spinor can be decomposed in its two chiral projections, torsion can be thought as the mediator that keeps spinors in stable configurations; we will justify this claim by studying some limiting situations. In what will look like a second introduction, we present in historical manner the way in which quantum principles have come to be mathematically implemented in physical theories, with the aim of isolating the main problems of the quantization protocols; we will do this with the goal of presenting possible solutions and improvements that are based on the concept of spin, and therefore describable within the theory that has been introduced in the first part. Further we present some of the most recent open problems in physics, again with the idea of proposing solutions that are based on the interaction between the spin and the torsion tensor. Finally we briefly sketch a discussion about the existence of some exact solutions and a few of their possible consequences.
