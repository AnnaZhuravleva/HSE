The parabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraints {is} integrated numerically. The applied numerical stencil is $4^{th}$ order accurate (in the spatial directions) while 'time'-integration is made by using the method of lines with a $4^{th}$ order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme. The proper implementation of the applied numerical method is verified first by monitoring the relative and absolute error{s} determined by comparing numerical and analytically known solutions of the constraints involving boosted and spinning {vacuum} black hole configurations. The main part of our investigations is, however, centered on construction of initial data for distorted black holes which, in certain cases, have non-negligible gravitational wave content. Remarkably the applied new method is unprecedented in that it allows to construct initial data for highly boosted and spinning black holes, essentially for the full physical allowed range{s} of these parameters. In addition, the use of the evolutionary form of the constraints is free from applying any sort of boundary condition{s} in the strong field regime.
