In this paper, a general FRW cosmological model has been constructed in $f(R,T)$ gravity reconstruction with variable cosmological constant. A number of solutions to the field equations has been generated by utilizing a form for the Hubble parameter that leads to Berman's law of constant deceleration parameter $q=m-1$. The possible decelerating and accelerating solutions have been investigated. For ($q>0$) we get a stable flat decelerating radiation-dominated universe at $q=1$. For ($q<0$) we get a stable accelerating solution describing a flat universe with positive energy density and negative cosmological constant. Nonconventional mechanisms that are expected to address the late-time acceleration with negative cosmological constant have been discussed.
