We present analytical solutions for two different relativistic generalizations of our recently introduced nonrelativistic cosmological model with dynamical curvature (NRCM). These relativistic models are characterized by two inequivalent extensions of the FLWR metric with a time-dependent curvature function and a geodesic fluid flow. Both contain two functions of time, a scale factor a(t) and a curvature function K(t). The inhomogeneous solutions of the corresponding Einstein equations will agree in leading order at small distances with the NRCM if a(t) and K(t) are each identical with those determined in the NCRM. Then the metric is completely fixed by three constants. The arising energy momentum tensor contains a nontrivial energy flow vector. Volume averaging leads to explicit expressions for the effective scale factor and Hubble function. The large scale (relativistic) corrections to the NCRM results are small for the particular case of scenario 2 presented in [1].
