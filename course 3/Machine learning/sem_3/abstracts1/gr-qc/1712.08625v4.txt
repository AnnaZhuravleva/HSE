Relativistic quantum mechanics of a Proca (spin-1) particle in Riemannian spacetimes is constructed. Covariant equations defining electromagnetic interactions of a Proca particle with the anomalous magnetic moment and the electric dipole moment in Riemannian spacetimes are formulated. The relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation with allowance for terms proportional to the zero power of the Planck constant is performed. The Hamiltonian obtained agrees with the corresponding Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonians derived for scalar and Dirac particles and with their classical counterpart. The unification of relativistic quantum mechanics in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation is discussed.
