The problem of time reparameterization is addressed at both the classical and quantum levels in a Bianchi-I universe in which the matter source is a massive Dirac spinor field. We take the scale factors of the metric as the intrinsic time and their conjugate momenta as the extrinsic time. A scalar character of the spinor field is identified as a representation of the extrinsic time. The construction of the field equations and quantization of the model is achieved by solving the Hamiltonian constraint after time identification has been dealt with. This procedure leads to a true Hamiltonian whose exact solutions for the above choices of time are presented
