An original way of presentation of the Schwarzschild black hole in the form of a point-like mass with making the use of the Dirac $\delta$-function, including a description of a continuous collapse to such a point mass, is given. A maximally generalized description restricted by physically reasonable requirements is developed. A so-called field-theoretical formulation of general relativity, being equivalent to the standard geometrical presentation of general relativity, is used. All of the dynamical fields, including the gravitational field, are considered as propagating in a background (curved or flat) spacetime. Namely these properties allow us to present a non-contradictive picture of the point mass description. The results can be useful for studying the structure of the black hole true singularities and could be developed for practical calculations in models with black holes.
