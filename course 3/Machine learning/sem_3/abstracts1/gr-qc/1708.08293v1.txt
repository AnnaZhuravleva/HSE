In this paper, we consider $2+1$ dimensional gravitational theory including a Dirac field that is minimally coupled to New Massive Gravity. We investigate cosmological solutions of the field equations by using the self-interaction potential form obtained by the existence of Noether symmetry. In this context, we obtain cosmological solutions that corresponds to inflationary as well as the oscillationary epochs of the universe. Moreover, we have seen that the Dirac field behaves like a dark energy in these epochs of the universe.
