The parity violation at the level of weak interactions and other similar discrete symmetries breaking show that the invariance of laws under the full group of Lorentz transformations can not be taken granted. We examine the principle of Lorentz invariance under the general theory of relativity, and demonstrate the importance of a concept of the spacetime orientation as part of the causal structure of spacetime.
