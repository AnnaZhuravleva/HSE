The model of Physics resulting from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction procedure offers very good dark matter candidates in the form of Light Kaluza-Klein Particles, and thus becomes relevant to Cosmology. In this work we recover a late-time cosmological picture, similar to that of the $\Lambda$CDM, in a multidimensional scenario, in the general framework of Universal Extra Dimensions. This is achieved by utilizing a special, Kasner-type solution that is analytically known, and acts as an attractor for a plethora of pairs of initial conditions of the usual and extra spatial Hubble parameters. The phenomenology of fundamental interactions dictates the stabilization of the extra dimensional evolution from a very early epoch in these scenarios. Without an explicit mechanism, this is achieved through particular behaviors of the usual and extra spatial fluids, which have to be motivated by a more fundamental theory.
