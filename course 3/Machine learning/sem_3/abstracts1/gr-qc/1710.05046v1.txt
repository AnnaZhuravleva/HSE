In the present work we study a warm inflationary model defined by a quasi-exponential inflaton potential and an inflaton decay rate proportional to the Hubble rate. The model is characterized by three free parameters. We compute the power spectrum, the scalar spectral index as well as the tensor-to-scalar ratio within the framework of the model, and we compare with the latest Planck data. On the $r-n_s$ plane we show both the theoretical curves and the contour plots allowed by observations, and we constrain the parameters of the model accordingly. The non-linear parameter $f_{NL}$, corresponding to primordial non-Gaussianities, is also discussed and we found that the value predicted by our model is within the bounds imposed by current observational data.
