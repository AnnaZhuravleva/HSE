Kelso, Hooper and Buckley [arXiv:1110.5338] found CRESST, CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA results are consistent with 10 - 15 GeV dark matter particles. Hennawi and Ostriker [arXiv:astro-ph/0108203] analyzed supermassive black hole formation in the centers of galaxies, finding a best fit for dark matter (self-interaction cross-section)/mass ratio = 0.02 cm^{2}/g, with round-off error of 25%. Combining the Hennawi/Ostriker result with the "strong gravity" model for dark matter [arXiv:0706.3050] requires dark matter particles with mass between 10.5 GeV and 17.5 GeV, overlapping the Kelso/Hooper/Buckley dark matter particle mass range.
