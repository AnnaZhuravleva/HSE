The scalar and vector cosmological perturbations at all length scales of our Universe are studied in the framework of the phantom braneworld model. The model is characterized by the parameter $\Omega_M\equiv M^3/2m^2H_0$, with $M$ and $m$ the 5- and 4-dimensional Planck scales, respectively, and $H_0$ the Hubble parameter today, while $\Omega_M\rightarrow 0$ recovers the $\Lambda\rm CDM$ model. Ignoring the backreaction due to the peculiar velocities and also the bulk cosmological constant, allows the explicit computation of the gravitational potentials, $\Phi$ and $\Psi$. They exhibit exponentially decreasing screening behaviour characterized by a screening length which is a function of the quasidensity parameter $ \Omega_M$.
