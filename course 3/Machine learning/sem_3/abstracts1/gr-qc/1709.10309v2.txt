We describe a solution-generating technique that will map a static charged solution of the Einstein-Maxwell theory in four (or five) dimensions to a five-dimensional solution of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory. As examples of this technique first we show first how to construct the dilatonic version of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in five dimensions and then we consider the more general case of the double black hole solutions and describe some of their properties. We found that in the general case the value of the conical singularities in between the black holes is affected by the dilaton's coupling constant to the gauge field and only in the particular case when all charges are proportional to the masses this dependence cancels out.
