A new idea of deriving a cosmological term from an underlying theory has been proposed in order to explain the expansion history of the universe. We obtain the scale factor with this derived cosmological term and demonstrate that it reflects all the characteristics of the expanding universe in different era so as to result in a transition from inflation to late acceleration through intermediate decelerating phases by this single entity. We further discuss certain observational aspects of this paradigm.
