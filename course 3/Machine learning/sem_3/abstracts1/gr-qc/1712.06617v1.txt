Several physical problems involving quantum field theory in an external, homogeneous, time-dependent background can be reduced to the study of harmonic oscillators with time-dependent frequency and mass. These include, for example, the case of (i) scalar field in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime and (ii) charged scalar field in a time-dependent electric field (viz. generalized Schwinger effect). It is, however, possible to perform this reduction of quantum field theory (QFT) to a harmonic oscillator in many different ways for the \textit{same} system, leading to either a normal oscillator or an inverted oscillator (i.e., one with imaginary frequency). These two representations are connected by field redefinitions and the choice of time coordinate. The representation in which the field modes are described by a normal oscillator allows interpretation in terms of particles and the production of the particles will contribute to backreaction on the classical source. Such an interpretation is \textit{not} possible when the \textit{same} system is described by an inverted oscillator. We study the relation between these two representations in detail, both in Heisenberg and Schr\"{o}dinger picture. We also provide a simple prescription for backreaction, based on energy conservation, which allows the dynamics to be described consistently in both the representations. The result has implications for several problems involving QFT in external fields, especially to the study of QFT in FRW background.
