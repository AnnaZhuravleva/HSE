The existence of spacetime singularities is one of the biggest problems of nowadays physics. According to Penrose, each physical singularity should be covered by a "cosmic censor" which prevents any external observer from perceiving their existence. However, classical models describing the gravitational collapse usually results in strong curvature singularities, which can also remain "naked" for a finite amount of advanced time. This proceedings studies the modifications induced by Asymptotically Safe Gravity on the gravitational collapse of generic Vaidya spacetimes. It will be shown that, for any possible choice of the mass function, Quantum Gravity makes the internal singularity gravitationally weak, thus allowing a continuous extension of the spacetime beyond the singularity.
