We present a new class of solutions to Einstein equations for the spherical collapse of dustlike matter coupled with heat flux. In this family of solutions spacetime shear is necessarily non-zero. Also these solutions have an interesting property that there is always a bounce before the singularity, which is caused entirely due to the dissipative processes. We show there exist open sets of initial data for which the bounce occurs before any trapped surface formation, making the star explode away to infinity. We also discuss the role of heat flow in generating spacetime shear and in modifying the effective inertial mass of the matter cloud.
