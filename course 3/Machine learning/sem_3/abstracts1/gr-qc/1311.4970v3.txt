We construct a class of spacetimes (without symmetry assumptions) satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations with singular boundaries on two null hypersurfaces intersecting in the future on a 2-sphere. The metric of these spacetimes extends continuously beyond the singularities while the Christoffel symbols fail to be square integrable in a neighborhood of any point on the singular boundaries. The construction shows moreover that the singularities are stable in a suitable sense. These singularities are stronger than the impulsive gravitational spacetimes considered by Luk-Rodnianski and conjecturally they are present in the interior of generic black holes arising from gravitational collapse.
