In this work, by combining the holographic principle with the graviton Bose-Einstein condensates hypothesis of gravitational backgrounds, we provide a buoyancy model of gravity. The surface gravity of a black hole is a result of the surface tension of its horizon.An object's gravity is its buoyancy in the space, which is composite of N soft constituent gravitons. After obtaining the energy density and background gravitational pressure of the space, the equipartition theorem is found to stand up in the 2-D holographic screen. The mutual transformation between the gravitons of the horizon and the gravitons of black hole is a second-order phase transition.
