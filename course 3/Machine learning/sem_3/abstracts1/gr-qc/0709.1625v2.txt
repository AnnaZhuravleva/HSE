We present a method for approximating the effective consequence of generic quantum gravity corrections to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We show that in many cases these corrections can produce departures from classical physics at large scales and that this behaviour can be interpreted as additional matter components. This opens up the possibility that dark energy (and possible dark matter) could be large scale manifestations of quantum gravity corrections to classical general relativity. As a specific example we examine the first order corrections to the Wheeler-De Witt equation arising from loop quantum cosmology in the absence of lattice refinement and show how the ultimate breakdown in large scale physics occurs.
