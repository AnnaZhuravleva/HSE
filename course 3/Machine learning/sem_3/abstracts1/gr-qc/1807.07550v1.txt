The Brown-York quasi-local energy of a rotating black hole described by the Kerr metric is calculated by direct computation. No special assumptions on the angular momentum were placed, i.e. the presented results are valid not only for slowly rotating black holes. They may be relevant for applications in astrophysics, for modeling elementary particles or for extensions of the framework of quasi-local quantities.
