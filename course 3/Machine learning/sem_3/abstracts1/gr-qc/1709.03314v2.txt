In this paper we determine the cosmological constant as a topological invariant by applying certain techniques from low dimensional differential topology. We work with a small exotic $R^{4}$ which is embedded into the standard $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. Any exotic $R^4$ is a Riemannian smooth manifold with necessary non-vanishing curvature tensor. To determine the invariant part of such curvature we deal with a canonical construction of $R^4$ where it appears as a part of the complex surface $K3\#\overline{CP(2)}$. Such $R^{4}$'s admit hyperbolic geometry. This fact simplifies significantly the calculations and enforces the rigidity of the expressions. In particular, we explain the smallness of the cosmological constant with a value consisting of a combination of (natural) topological invariant. Finally, the cosmological constant appears to be a topologically supported quantity.
