Epistemic models of nature prove to be problematic in many relativistic settings as well as in settings in which measurement procedures are ill-defined. By contrast, in ontological models of nature, measurement results are independent of the procedure used to obtain them. If we assume that all measurement results can be expressed in terms of pointer readings, then any useful ontology would need to unambiguously specify the positions of things. Proposals for such ontologies have included the lattice fermion number density as proposed by Bell, and a relational specification of position as proposed by Smolin. In this article we first show that Bell's choice of ontology is unsuitable due to the ambiguity of particle number as a result of the Unruh effect, and due to the fact that lattice fermions suffer from the problem of fermion doubling. We then show that Smolin's alternative does not unambiguously specify position. This motivates us to develop an alternative set of ontologies based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation that does not suffer from these problems and we provide a set of constraints for the geometry, matter field, and action for such a model to be deterministic.
