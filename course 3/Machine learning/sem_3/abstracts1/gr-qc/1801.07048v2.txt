The behavior of quasi-local black hole horizons in a binary black hole merger is studied numerically. We compute the horizon multipole moments, fluxes and other quantities on black hole horizons throughout the merger. These lead to a better qualitative and quantitative understanding of the coalescence of two black holes; how the final black hole is formed, initially grows and then settles down to a Kerr black hole. We calculate the rate at which the final black hole approaches equilibrium in a fully non-perturbative situation and identify a time at which the linear ringdown phase begins. Finally, we provide additional support for the conjecture that fields at the horizon are correlated with fields in the wave-zone by comparing the in-falling gravitational wave flux at the horizon to the outgoing flux as estimated from the gravitational waveform.
