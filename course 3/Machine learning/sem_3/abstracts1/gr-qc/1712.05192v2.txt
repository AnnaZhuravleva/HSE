We consider a stationary metric immersed in a uniform magnetic field and determine general expressions for the epicyclic frequencies of charged particles. Applications to the Kerr--Newman black hole is reach of physical consequences and reveals some new effects among which the existence of radially and vertically stable circular orbits in the region enclosed by the event horizon and the so-called {\textquotedblleft innermost\textquotedblright} stable circular orbit in the plane of symmetry.
