In this paper, we discuss the charged anti-de Sitter(AdS) black holes where metric depends on the energy of a probe. By the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the modified dispersion relation, we achieve deformed temperature. Moreover, in rainbow gravity we calculate the heat capacity in a fixed charge and discuss the thermal stability. We also achieve similar behaviour with this system of the liquid-gas system in extending phase space (including $P$ and $r$) and study its critical behavior with the pressure given by the cosmological constant and with a fixed black hole charge $Q$. Furthermore, we study the Gibbs function and find characteristic swallow tail behavior, which indicates there is the phase transition. We also find there is a special value about the the mass of test particle which would make the black hole zero temperature and diverging heat capacity with fixed charge.
