In the interface between general relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics, we analyse rotating effects on the scalar field subject to a hard-wall confining potential. We consider three different scenarios of general relativity given by the cosmic string spacetime, the spacetime with space-like dislocation and the spacetime with a spiral dislocation. Then, by searching for a discrete spectrum of energy, we analyse analogues effects of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for bound states and the Sagnac effect.
