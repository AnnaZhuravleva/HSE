We study the condensation of static massive scalar fields around reflecting shells in the asymptotically AdS gravity. We consider two types of Dirichlet and Neumann reflecting boundary conditions for the scalar field at the surface of the shell. We find that no-scalar-hair theorems exist for the case of neutral scalar fields and also cases of charged scalar fields around neutral shells. For charged scalar fields along with charged Dirichlet reflecting shells, we provide upper bounds for the radii of the hairy shells. We further show that the charged scalar field can exist around charged reflecting shells with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries and in particular, the radii of the hairy shells are discrete, which is similar to cases in the asymptotically flat space. We also study effects of parameters and surface boundary conditions on the largest hairy shell radii and obtain approximate formulae for the largest radii.
