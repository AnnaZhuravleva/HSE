The evolution of the luminosity distance in a contracting universe is studied. It is shown that for quite a lot of natural dynamical evolutions, its behavior is far from trivial and its value can even decrease with an increasing time interval between events. The consequences are investigated and it is underlined that this could both put stringent consistency conditions on bouncing models and open a new observational window on "pre Big Bang" physics using standard gravitational waves.
