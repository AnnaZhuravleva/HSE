In this paper, we consider the phase transition of black hole in power Maxwell invariant by means of Maxwell's equal area law. First, we review and study the analogy of nonlinear charged black hole solutions with the Van der Waals gas-liquid system in the extended phase space, and obtain isothermal $P$-$v$ diagram. Then, using the Maxwell's equal area law we study the phase transition of AdS black hole with different temperatures. Finally, we extend the method to the black hole in the canonical (grand canonical) ensemble in which charge (potential) is fixed at infinity. Interestingly, we find the phase transition occurs in the both ensembles. We also study the effect of the parameters of the black hole on the two-phase coexistence. The results show that the black hole may go through a small-large phase transition similar to those of usual non-gravity thermodynamic systems.
