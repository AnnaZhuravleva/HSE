Here we present a simple model of cosmic evolution in Einstein gravity, with the cosmic substratum being composed of an inhomogeneous and anisotropic fluid. The scale factor is supposed to be of Gaussian type. In this framework we show the existence of a continuously evolving eternal universe with no singularity, beginning or end.
