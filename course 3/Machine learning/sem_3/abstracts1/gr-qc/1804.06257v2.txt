Provided that tests of the expansion history would not suffice to discriminate the best model of gravity at cosmological scales, upcoming high precision measurements of the structure of galaxies at very large scales will be a key piece of evidence that will allow us to break such a degeneracy. In order to test the predicted structure formation that comes from cosmological perturbation theory, the Parametrized Post-Friedmann (PPF) formalism provides an excellent theoretical framework to carry out such analysis as it parametrizes the cosmological perturbation theory of a collection of Modify Gravity (MG) models. In this work, we carry out a dynamical analysis of the PPF in order to shed some light on the fate and evolution of the structure formation for some MG models by writing the modified field equations using properly normalized variables. A Universe filled with only dark matter and dark energy is considered, represented by an effective equation of state and a negligible anisotropic stress. We consider different cases: cold dark matter (CDM) model, $\Lambda$CDM and the scale-independent and -dependent parametrizations of MG theories, in particular $f(R)$ and Chameleon-like theories. For the last two cases we found that the critical points and stability features of the dynamical systems are the same as those found in the fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. However the behavior of the dynamics around them suffers important modifications. We find that signatures of these MG arise either in measurements of the modes of the lensing potential and velocity perturbations while the density contrast itself turns out to be less sensitive to the parametrization taken into consideration. We also provide a percentage estimation of the extent of the modification of perturbations in the MG models considered in comparison to the fiducial model along the expansion history and for a number of scale-lengths.
