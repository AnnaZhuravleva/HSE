We develop an approach to quantum dynamics based on quantum phase space trajectories. The latter are built from a unitary irreducible representation of the symmetry group of the respective classical phase space. We use a quantum action functional to derive the basic equations. In principle, our formulation is equivalent to the Hilbert space formulation. However, the former allows for consistent truncations to reduced phase spaces in which approximate quantum dynamics can be derived. We believe that our approach can be very useful in the domain of quantum cosmology and therefore, we use the cosmological phase space example to establish the basic equations of this formalism.
