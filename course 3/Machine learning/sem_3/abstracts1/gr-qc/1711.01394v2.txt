In an ever-expanding spatially closed universe, the fractional change of the volume is the preeminent intrinsic time interval to describe evolution in General Relativity. The expansion of the universe serves as a subsidiary condition which transforms Einstein's theory from a first class to a second class constrained system when the physical degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) are identified with transverse traceless excitations. The super-Hamiltonian constraint is solved by eliminating the trace of the momentum in terms of the other variables, and spatial diffeomorphism symmetry is tackled explicitly by imposing transversality. The theorems of Maskawa-Nishijima appositely relate the reduced phase space to the physical variables in canonical functional integral and Dirac's criterion for second class constraints to nonvanishing Faddeev-Popov determinants in the phase space measures. A reduced physical Hamiltonian for intrinsic time evolution of the two physical d.o.f. emerges. Freed from the first class Dirac algebra, deformation of the Hamiltonian constraint is permitted, and natural extension of the Hamiltonian while maintaining spatial diffeomorphism invariance leads to a theory with Cotton-York term as the ultraviolet completion of Einstein's theory.
