It was recently shown by Feldbrugge et al. that the no-boundary proposal, defined via a Lorentzian path integral and in minisuperspace, leads to unstable fluctuations, in disagreement with early universe observations. In these calculations many off-shell geometries summed over in the path integral in fact contain singularities, and the question arose whether the instability might ultimately be caused by these off-shell singularities. We address this question here by considering a sum over purely regular geometries, by extending a calculation pioneered by Halliwell and Louko. We confirm that the fluctuations are unstable, even in this restricted context which, arguably, is closer in spirit to the original proposal of Hartle and Hawking. Elucidating the reasons for the instability of the no-boundary proposal will hopefully show how to overcome these difficulties, or pave the way to new theories of initial conditions for the universe.
