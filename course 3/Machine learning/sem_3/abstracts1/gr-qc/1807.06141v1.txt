Space-time quantum contributions to the classical Einstein equations of General Relativity are determined. The theoretical background is provided by the non-perturbative theory of manifestly-covariant quantum gravity and the trajectory-based representation of the related quantum wave equation in terms of the Generalized Lagrangian path formalism. To reach the target an extended functional setting is introduced, permitting the treatment of a non-stationary background metric tensor allowed to depend on both space-time coordinates and a suitably-defined invariant proper-time parameter. Based on the Hamiltonian representation of the corresponding quantum hydrodynamic equations occurring in such a context, the quantum-modified Einstein field equations are obtained. As an application, the quantum origin of the cosmological constant is investigated. This is shown to be ascribed to the non-linear Bohm quantum interaction of the gravitational field with itself in vacuum and to depend generally also on the realization of the quantum probability density for the quantum gravitational field tensor. The emerging physical picture predicts a generally non-stationary quantum cosmological constant which originates from fluctuations (i.e., gradients) of vacuum quantum gravitational energy density and is consistent with the existence of quantum massive gravitons.
