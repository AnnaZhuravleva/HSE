Hadamard-Papapetrou method of field discontinuities is here employed in order to determine the effective metric that describes the propagation of acoustic perturbations in isentropic fluids. It is shown that, when dissipative effects are present, small perturbations in fastly moving fluids have a natural description in terms of an effective acoustic geometry. As an application of our results, a model for an acoustic black hole in viscous fluid is investigated.
