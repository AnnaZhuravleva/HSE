The apparent properties of distant objects encode information about the way the light they emit propagates to an observer, and therefore about the curvature of the underlying spacetime. Measuring the relationship between the redshift $z$ and the luminosity distance $D_{\rm L}$ of a standard candle, for example, yields information on the Universe's matter content. In practice, however, in order to decode this information the observer needs to make an assumption about the functional form of the $D_{\rm L}(z)$ relation; in other words, a cosmological model needs to be assumed. In this work, we use numerical-relativity simulations, equipped with a new ray-tracing module, to numerically obtain this relation for a few black-hole--lattice cosmologies and compare it to the well-known Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker case, as well as to other relevant cosmologies and to the Empty-Beam Approximation. We find that the latter provides the best estimate of the luminosity distance and formulate a simple argument to account for this agreement. We also find that a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker model can reproduce this observable exactly, as long as a time-dependent cosmological constant is included in the fit. Finally, the dependence of these results on the lattice mass-to-spacing ratio $\mu$ is discussed: we discover that, unlike the expansion rate, the $D_{\rm L}(z)$ relation in a black-hole lattice does not tend to that measured in the corresponding continuum spacetime as $\mu \to 0$.
