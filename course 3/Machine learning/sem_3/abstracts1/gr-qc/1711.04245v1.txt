The Dirac equation for charged fermions interacting with an electromagnetic field can be algebraically inverted, so as to obtain an explicit rational expression of the four-vector potential of the gauge field in terms of the spinors. Substitution of this expression into Maxwell's equations yields the tensor form of the self-interactive Maxwell-Dirac equations. We demonstrate here, how an analogous inversion can be performed on the Dirac equation in curved space-time to obtain \emph{two} four-vector expressions which are gravitational analogues of the electromagnetic vector potential. These potentials appear as irreducible summand components of the spin connection, along with a traceless residual term of mixed symmetry. When taking the torsion field equation into account, the residual term can be written as a function of the object of anholonomity. The vector potentials are comprised from Dirac bilinears, which are interrelated via a rich set of Fierz identities. Furthermore, a local vierbein frame can be chosen in terms of a set of four Dirac bilinear vector fields, normalized by two scalar fields. A corollary of this local frame choice is that the spin connection can be written as an explicit function of the Dirac bilinears. This work constitutes a novel formulation of the self-coupled Einstein-Cartan-Dirac equations in terms of Dirac bilinears, and may provide new insights into the nature of the interaction of Dirac matter with gravity.
