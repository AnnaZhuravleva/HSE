Modified Chaplygin Gas has been successful in describing the cosmic history of the universe from radiation to $\Lambda$CDM in standard cosmology, while particle creation mechanism in nonlinear thermodynamics can be used to explain inflation as well as late time acceleration. The present work is an attempt to explore the possibilities of obtaining an alternative explanations to cosmic evolution when modified Chaplygin gas is used in the context of particle creation mechanism.
