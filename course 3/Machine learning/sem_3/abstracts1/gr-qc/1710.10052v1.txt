I review some standard theory of convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and rephrase it in a formalism of Ted Newman to show the relation between the St\"utzfunktion of the former theory and the cut function introduced by Ted. This leads to a conjectured inequality for space-like two-spheres in Minkowski space that generalises Minkowski's inequality and is implied by Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis.
