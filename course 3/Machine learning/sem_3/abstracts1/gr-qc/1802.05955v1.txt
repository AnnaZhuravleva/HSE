The main purpose of this paper is to investigates structure scalars in the context of $f(\mathcal{G}, T)$ gravity, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Gauss-Bonnet invariant and $T$ is the trace of stress energy tensor. For this aim, we have considered the spherically symmetric spacetime and dissipative anisotropic fluid coupled with radiation and heat ejecting shearing matter distributions. We have found these scalar variables by orthogonally decomposing the Riemann curvature tensor in $f(\mathcal{G}, T)$ gravity. Moreover, the evolution equations of shear and expansion are also developed with the help of these scalar functions. We have also analyzed these scalars by taking constant $\mathcal{G}$ and $T$ for dust cloud. The physical behavior of structure scalars for radiating matter distributions has been examined in the presence of modified gravity. It is shown that the evolutionary stages of relativistic stellar structures can be explored via modified scalar functions.
