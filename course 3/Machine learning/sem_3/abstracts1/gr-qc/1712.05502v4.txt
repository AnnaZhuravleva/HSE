A strong gravity naked singular region can give important clues towards understanding classical as well as spontaneous nature of General Relativity. We propose here a model for energy emission from a naked singular region in a self-similar dust spacetime by gluing two self-similar dust solutions at the Cauchy horizon. The energy is defined and evaluated as a surface energy of a null hypersurface, the null shell. Also included are scenarios of spontaneous creation or disappearance of a singularity, end of inflation, black hole formation and bubble nucleation. Our examples investigated here explicitly show that one can model unlimitedly luminous and energetic objects in the framework of General Relativity.
