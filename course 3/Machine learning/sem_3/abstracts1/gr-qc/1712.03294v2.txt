Two new methods have been proposed for solving the gravitational constraints without using elliptic solvers by formulating them as either an algebraic-hyperbolic or parabolic-hyperbolic system. Here, we compare these two methods and present a unified computational infrastructure for their implementation as numerical evolution codes. An important potential application of these methods is the prescription of initial data for the simulation of black holes. This paper is meant to support progress and activity in that direction.
