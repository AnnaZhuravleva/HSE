Constructing an exact correspondence between a black hole model, formed from the most simple solution of Einstein's equations, and a particular moving mirror trajectory, we investigate a new model that preserves unitarity. The Bogoliubov coefficients in 1+1 dimensions are computed analytically. The key modification limits the origin of coordinates (moving mirror) to sub-light asymptotic speed. Effective continuity across the metric ensures that there is no information loss. The black hole emits thermal radiation and the total evaporation energy emitted is finite without backreaction, consistent with the conservation of energy.
