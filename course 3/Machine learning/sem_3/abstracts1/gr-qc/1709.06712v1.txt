In (2+1)-dimensional pure gravity with cosmological constant, the dynamics of double torus universe with pinching parameter is investigated. Each mode of affine stretching deformation is illustrated in the context of horizontal foliation along the holomorphic quadratic differential. The formulation of the Einstein Hilbert action for the parameters of the affine stretching is developed. Then the dynamics along one holomorphic quadratic differential will be solved concretely.
