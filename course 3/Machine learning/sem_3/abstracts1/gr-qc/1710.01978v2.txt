In this thesis we present detailed analyses on various running vacuum models (RVM's), in which the vacuum energy density "runs" with the cosmic expansion. The RVM's are motivated from the renormalization group formalism of Quantum Field Theory in curved spacetime. In this theoretical framework, the vacuum energy density depends explicitly on the Hubble function and its time derivative and thus does not remain constant, in contradistinction to the standard $\Lambda$CDM picture. Upon studying how these models fit the data, we can determine whether this dynamical behavior is favored by observations or not. Is the vacuum energy density (or more generically, the DE density) dynamical? One of the main conclusions of this dissertation is that we have indeed strong evidences in favor of the variability of the DE density throughout the cosmic history. It is shown that this variation can also be traced through other (purely phenomenological) dynamical vacuum models, together with different parametrizations of the DE (as the XCDM and CPL), and scalar field models as the Peebles-Ratra one. The statistical confidence level of these evidences reaches in some cases the 3-4$\sigma$ c.l., something that is unprecedented in the literature. An exhaustive explanation of the reasons why large collaborations as BOSS, Planck and DES have not been able to detect such signal in favor of the DE dynamics is provided in this thesis too.
