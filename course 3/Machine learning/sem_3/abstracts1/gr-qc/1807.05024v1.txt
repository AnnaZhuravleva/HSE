We investigate the quasinormal modes of a class of static and spherically symmetric black holes with the derivative coupling. The derivative coupling has rarely been paid attention to the study of black hole quasinormal modes. Specifically, we study the effect of derivative coupling on the quasinormal modes for four kinds of black holes. They are Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, Bardeen black holes, noncommunicative geometry inspired black holes and dilaton black holes. These black holes are not the solutions of vacuum Einstein equations which guarantees the effect of derivative coupling is not trivial. We find the influence of derivative coupling on the quasinormal modes exactly mimics the overtone numbers. Thus the presence of derivative coupling brings the QNMs a degeneracy with the overtone numbers. This degeneracy can perhaps be identified in future gravitational waves observations.
