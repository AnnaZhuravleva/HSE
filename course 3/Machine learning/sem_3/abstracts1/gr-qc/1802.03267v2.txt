The analog acoustic metric has been originally derived for adiabatic acoustic perturbations propagating in an isentropic irrotational ideal fluid. In the framework of a Lagrangian hydrodynamic description we demonstrate that under certain conditions the usual acoustic metric can be derived for nonisentropic fluids. In a special case when the pressure takes a special form and the nonadiabatic perturbations are neglected the adiabatic acoustic perturbations corresponding to massless phonons propagate in an analog metric of the usual type.
