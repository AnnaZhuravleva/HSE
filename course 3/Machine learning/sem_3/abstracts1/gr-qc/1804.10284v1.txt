A hypersurface composed of two null sheets, or "light fronts", swept out by the two congruences of future null normal geodesics emerging from a spacelike 2-disk can serve as a Cauchy surface for a region of spacetime. Already in the 1960s free (unconstrained) initial data for vacuum general relativity were found for hypersurfaces of this type. Here the Poisson brackets of such free initial data are calculated from the Hilbert action. The brackets obtained can form the starting point for a constraint free canonical quantization of general relativity and may be relevant to holographic entropy bounds for vacuum gravity. Several of the results of the present work have been presented in abbreviated form in the letter [Rei08].
