In this paper we consider the Dirac oscillator in the context of Doubly General Relativity or Gravity's Rainbow. In order to obtain the energy levels of the Dirac oscillator, we solve the Dirac equation in the cosmic string spacetime modified by gravity's rainbow scenarios described by two rainbow functions. We then obtain that, as a consequence of the modification of the cosmic string line element by the two rainbow functions, the energy levels of the Dirac oscillator are appreciable altered. The results are plotted and compared with the standard case, without gravity's rainbow effects.
