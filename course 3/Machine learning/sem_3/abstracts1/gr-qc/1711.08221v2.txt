We present the first results on the construction of an exascale hyperbolic PDE engine (ExaHyPE), a code for the next generation of supercomputers with the objective to evolve dynamical spacetimes of black holes, neutron stars and binaries. We solve a novel first order formulation of Einstein field equations in the conformal and constraint damping Z4 formulation (CCZ4) coupled to ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD), using divergence-cleaning. We adopt a novel communication-avoiding one-step ADER-DG scheme with an a-posteriori subcell finite volume limiter on adaptive spacetrees. Despite being only at its first stages, the code passes a number of tests in special and general relativity.
