We discuss semiclassical Nariai black holes in the framework of $f(T)$-gravity. For a diagonal choice of tetrades, stable Nariai metrics can be found, emitting Bekenstein-Hawking radiation in semiclassical limit. However, for a non-diagonal choice of tetrades, evaporation and antievaporation instabilities are turned on. In turn, this causes a back-reaction effect suppressing the Bekenstein-Hawking radiation. In particular, evaporation instabilities produce a new radiation -- different by Bekenstein-Hawking emission -- non-violating unitarity in particle physics sector.
