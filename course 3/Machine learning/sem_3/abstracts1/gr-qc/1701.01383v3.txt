We establish a dictionary between group field theory (thus, spin networks and random tensors) states and generalized random tensor networks. Then, we use this dictionary to compute the R\'{e}nyi entropy of such states and recover the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, in two different cases corresponding to two different truncations/approximations, suggested by the established correspondence.
