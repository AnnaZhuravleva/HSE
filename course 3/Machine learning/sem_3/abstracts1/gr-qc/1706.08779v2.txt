A novel idea is proposed for a natural solution of the dark energy and its cosmic coincidence problem. The existence of local antigravity sources, associated with astrophysical matter configurations distributed throughout the universe, can lead to a recent cosmic acceleration effect. Various physical theories can be compatible with this idea, but here, in order to test our proposal, we focus on quantum originated spherically symmetric metrics matched with the cosmological evolution through the simplest Swiss cheese model. In the context of asymptotically safe gravity, we have explained the observed amount of dark energy using Newton's constant, the galaxy or cluster length scales, and dimensionless order one parameters predicted by the theory, without fine-tuning or extra unproven energy scales. The interior modified Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric allows us to approximately interpret this result as that the standard cosmological constant is a composite quantity made of the above parameters, instead of a fundamental one.
