We obtain an analytic solution for accretion of a gaseous medium with a adiabatic equation of state ($P=\rho$) onto a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole which moves at a constant velocity through the medium. We obtain the specific expression for each component of the velocity and present the mass accretion rate which depends on the mass and the electric charge. The result we obtained may be helpful to understand the physical mechanism of accretion onto a moving black hole.
