The question of whether the universe is eternal or if it had a singular moment of creation is deeply intriguing. Although different versions of steady state and oscillatory models of eternal universe have been envisaged, empirical evidence suggests a singular moment of creation at the big bang.Here we analyze the oscillatory solutions for the universe in a modified theory of gravity THED (Torsion Hides Extra-Dimension) and evaluate them by fitting Type 1a supernovae redshift data. THED-gravity exactly mimics General Relativity at the kinematical level, while the modifications in its dynamical equations allow the universe to bounce between a minimum size and a maximum size with a zero average energy within each oscillation.The optimally fit oscillatory solutions correspond to a universe with (i) a small matter density requiring little to no dark matter, (ii) a significantly negative spatial curvature, (iii) a tiny negative dark energy, (iv) and an arbitrarily large maxima and small minima whose exact values depend on the tinyness of the dark energy. Alternatively, there exists non-oscillating solutions that appear as an ever-expanding universe from a single bounce at some minimum size preceded by a collapse from the infinite past. These ever-expanding solutions indeed fit the redshift data marginally better than the oscillating solutions and are at par with the best fit of standard big bang theory. They accommodate a range of matter densities requiring dark matter, positive dark energy and positive spatial curvature. A qualitative analysis of CMB power spectrum with the modified dynamical equations predicts a negative spatial curvature for the universe, in stark contrast to a near-zero curvature in the standard big bang theory. An independent constraint on the spatial curvature can further shed light on discriminating the ever expanding and oscillatory universe scenarios.
