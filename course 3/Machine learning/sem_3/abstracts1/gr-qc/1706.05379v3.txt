The phenomenon of quantum vacuum polarization in the presence of a gravitational field is well understood and is expected to have a physical reality, but studies of its back-reaction on the dynamics of spacetime are practically non-existent outside the specific context of homogeneous cosmologies. Building on previous results of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes, in this letter we first derive the semiclassical equations of stellar equilibrium in the s-wave Polyakov approximation. It is highlighted that incorporating the polarization of the quantum vacuum leads to a generalization of the classical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Despite the complexity of the resulting field equations, it is possible to find exact solutions. Aside from being the first known exact solutions that describe relativistic stars including the non-perturbative backreaction of semiclassical effects, these are identified as a non-trivial combination of the black star and gravastar proposals.
