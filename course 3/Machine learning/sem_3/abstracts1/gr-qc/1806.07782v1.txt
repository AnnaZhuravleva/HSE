The study of shadow continues to be a major source of insight into compact astrophysical objects. Depending on the nature of compact objects and due to the strong gravitational lensing effect that casts a shadow on the bright background. We consider the Kerr-like wormholes spacetime \cite{Bueno:2017hyj} which is a modification of Kerr black holes that turns into the wormholes for nonzero values of deformation parameter $\lambda^2$. The results suggest that the Kerr spacetime can reproduce far away from the throat of the wormhole. We obtain the shapes of the shadow for the Kerr-like wormholes and discuss the effect of spin $a$ and deformation parameter $\lambda^2$ on the size of the shadow. As a consequence, it is discovered that the shadow is distorted due to the rotation and that the radius of the shadow monotonically increases with $\lambda^2$.
