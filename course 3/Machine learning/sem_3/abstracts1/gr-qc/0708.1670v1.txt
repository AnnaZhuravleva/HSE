We shall first discuss motivation for higher dimension even for classical description of gravitational dynamics and then construct a black hole out of an anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetime by prescribing a coupling between Gauss-Bonnet parameter, constant curvature of extra dimensional space and $\Lambda$. This is a creation of pure curvature which establishes the fundamental reciprocity between matter and gravity/curvature.
