We calculate the thermodynamical features of rotational Kiselev black holes, specifically we use one order approximate of horizon to calculate thermodynamical features for all $\omega$ (state parameter). The thermodynamical features include areas, entropies, horizon radii, surface gravities, surface temperatures, Komar energies and irreducible masses at the Cauchy horizon and Event horizon. The products of these features have been studied, we find that the products are determined by $\omega$ and $\alpha$. The products of surface gravity, the surface temperatures and the Komar energy are related to the mass of black hole for different $\omega$. This property is the similar with that of spherically symmetric black hole ($a=0$). The product of area and entropy is independent on the mass in the case of $\alpha=0$. The features in the situations of $\omega=-2/3,1/3$ and $0$ (quintessence matter, radiation and dust) have been discussed in detail. We also generalize the Smarr mass formula and Christodoulou-Ruffini mass formula to these black holes. Finally we study the phase transition and thermodynamical geometry of the black hole with $\omega=1/3$. We find that the phase transition is a second order phase transition, and also obtain the scalar curvature by the thermodynamical geometry, indicating that the quintessential dark energy will change the phase transition condition and thermodynamically critical phenomena in rotational Kiselev black hole.
