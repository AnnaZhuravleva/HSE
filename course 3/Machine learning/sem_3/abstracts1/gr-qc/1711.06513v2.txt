In this work, we have illustrated the difference between both Tsallis and Kaniadakis entropies through cosmological models obtained from the formalism proposed by Padmanabhan, which is called holographic equipartition law. Similarly to the formalism proposed by Komatsu, we have obtained an extra driving constant term in the Friedmann equation if we deform the Tsallis entropy by Kaniadakis' formalism. We have considered initially Tsallis entropy as the Black Hole (BH) area entropy. This constant term may lead the universe to be in an accelerated mode. On the other hand, if we start with the Kaniadakis entropy as the BH area entropy and then by modifying the Kappa expression by Tsallis' formalism, the same constant, which shows that the universe have an acceleration is obtained. In an opposite limit, no driving inflation term of the early universe was derived from both deformations.
