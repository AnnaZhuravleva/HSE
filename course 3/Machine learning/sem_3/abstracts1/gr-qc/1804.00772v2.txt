The thermodynamics of the Universe in Eddington-Born-Infeld (EBI) theory is restudied by utilizing the holographic-style gravitational equations that dominate the dynamics of the cosmical apparent horizon $\Upsilon_{A}$ and the evolution of Universe. We started from applying the Bigravity method to rewrite the EBI action of the Palatini approach into the Bigravity-type action with an extra metric $q_{\mu\nu}$. With the help of the holographic-style dynamical equations, we discussed the properties of the cosmical apparent horizon $\Upsilon_{A}$ including timelike, spacelike and null characters, which depend on the value of the parameter of state $w_{m}$ in EBI Universe. We also obtained the unified first law for the gravitational thermodynamics and the total energy differential for the open system enveloped by $\Upsilon_{A}$ in EBI Universe. Finally, we used the Gibbs equation in the positive-heat-out sign convention to derive the generalized second laws of the nondecreasing entropy $S_{tot}^{(A)}$ enclosed by $\Upsilon_{A}$ in EBI universe.
