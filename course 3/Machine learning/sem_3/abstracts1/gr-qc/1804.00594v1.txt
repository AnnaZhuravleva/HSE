We show that spinor fields nonminimally coupled to gravity can grow spontaneously in the presence of matter. We name this phenomenon spontaneous spinorization after the spontaneous scalarization scenario in scalar-tensor theories. Underlying reason for the growth of the spinor is an instability similar to the tachyon of spontaneous scalarization. We first present the structure of a tachyonic Dirac equation, and incorporate it into the matter coupling in gravity. This causes the zero-spinor solution to be unstable and leads to spontaneous growth. We investigate the behaviour of the resulting theory for a spherically symmetric neutron star that has grown a spinor cloud. Spontaneous spinorization has the potential to lead to order-of-unity deviations from general relativity in strong fields in a similar manner to its close relative spontaneous scalarization. This makes the theory especially relevant to gravitational wave science and neutron star astrophysics.
