The possibility that a black hole could tunnel into a white hole has recently received attention. Here we present a metric that improves the 'firework' metric: it describes the entire process and solves the Einstein equations everywhere except on a small transition surface that corresponds to the quantum tunnelling. We compute the corresponding ray-tracing map from past infinity to future infinity explicitly.
