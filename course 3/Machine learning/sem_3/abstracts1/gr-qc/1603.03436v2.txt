We present a simple and complete classification of static solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell system with a massless scalar field in arbitrary $n(\ge 3)$ dimensions. We consider spacetimes which correspond to a warped product $M^2 \times K^{n-2}$, where $K^{n-2}$ is a $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein space. The scalar field is assumed to depend only on the radial coordinate and the electromagnetic field is purely electric. The general solution with a non-constant real scalar field consists of nine solutions for $n\ge 4$ and three solutions for $n=3$. None of them are endowed of a Killing horizon in accordance with the no-hair theorem. Unlike the case with a vanishing electromagnetic field or constant scalar field, the asymptotically flat solution for $n\ge 4$ is not unique. Moreover, the solutions for $n\ge 4$ can asymptotically approach the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime depending on the integrations constants.
