Current study highlights the physical characteristics of charged anisotropic compact stars by exploring some exact solutions of modified field equations in $f(R,G)$ gravity. A comprehensive analysis is performed from the obtained solutions regarding stability, energy conditions, regularity, sound velocity and compactness. These solutions can be referred to model the compact celestial entities. In particular, a compact star named, $Her X-1$ has been modeled which indicates that current solution fits and is in conformity to the observational data as well. A useful and interesting fact from this model arises that relative difference between two forces of anisotropic pressure and electromagnetic force may occur inside the aforementioned compact star. This is another mechanism which is essential for stability of the compact object and prevent stellar object to annihilate.
