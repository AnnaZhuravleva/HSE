General Relativity is usually formulated as a theory with gauge invariance under the diffeomorphism group, but there is a "dilaton" formulation where it is in addition invariant under Weyl transformations, and a "unimodular" formulation where it is only invariant under the smaller group of special diffeomorphisms. Other formulations with the same number of gauge generators, but a different gauge algebra, also exist. These different formulations provide examples of what we call "inessential gauge invariance", "symmetry trading" and "linking theories"; they are locally equivalent, but may differ when global properties of the solutions are considered. We discuss these notions in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism.
