The minimal metagravity theory, explicitly violating the general covariance but preserving the unimodular one, is applied to study the evolution of the isotropic homogeneous Universe. The massive scalar graviton, contained in the theory in addition to the massless tensor one, is treated as a source of the dark matter and/or dark energy. The modified Friedmann equation for the scale factor of the Universe is derived. The question wether the minimal metagravity can emulate the LCDM concordance model, valid in General Relativity, is discussed.
