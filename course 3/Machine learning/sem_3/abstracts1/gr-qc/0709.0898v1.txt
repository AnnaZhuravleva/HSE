Operational definition of space-time in light of quantum mechanics and general relativity inevitably indicates an intrinsic imprecision in space-time structure which has to do with space-time dimension as well. The operational dimension of space-time turns out to be a scale dependent quantity slightly smaller than four at distances $\gg l_P$. Close to the Planck length the deviation of space-time dimension from four becomes appreciable. The experimental bounds on the deviation of space-time dimension from four coming from the electron ${\tt g} - 2$ factor, Lamb shift in hydrogen atom and the perihelion shift in the planetary motion are still far from the theoretical predictions.
