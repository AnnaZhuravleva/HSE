In this work we intend to address the matter-antimatter asymmetry via the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism in the background of a quantum theory of gravity. We investigate this mechanism under the framework of Ho$\check{r}$ava-Lifshitz gravity. We will compute the baryon-to-entropy ratio in the chosen framework and investigate its physical viability against the observational bounds. We also conduct the above study for various sources of matter like scalar field and Chaplygin gas as specific examples. We speculate that quantum corrections from the background geometry will lead to interesting results.
