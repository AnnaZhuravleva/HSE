We investigate the problem of metric fluctuations in the presence of the vacuum fluctuations of matter fields and critically assess the usual assertion that vacuum energy implies a Planckian cosmological constant. A new stochastic classical approach to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime is developed. The work extends conceptually Boyer's random electrodynamics to a theory of random gravity but has a considerably richer structure for inheriting nonlinearity from general relativity. Attention is drawn to subtleties in choosing boundary conditions for metric fluctuations in relation to their dynamical consequences. Those compatible with the observed Lorentz invariance must allow for spontaneous conformal fluctuations, in addition to stochastic gravitational waves due to zero point gravitons. This is implemented through an effective metric defined in terms of the random spacetime metric modulo a fluctuating conformal factor. It satisfies an effective Einstein equation coupled to an effective stress-energy tensor incorporating gravitational self energy of metric fluctuations as well as matter fields. The effective Einstein equation is expanded up to second order nonlinearity. A UV-cutoff is introduced whose specific value, however, does not enter into the resulting description of random gravity. The averaged effective metric satisfies the empty space Einstein equation with an effective cosmological constant. This vanishes when only the massless matter fields are included. More generally, a finite effective cosmological constant compatible with the observational constraints can be obtained as long as the bare masses of the massive matter fields are nearly zero, or the conformal invariance of matter is restored at some high energy scale.
