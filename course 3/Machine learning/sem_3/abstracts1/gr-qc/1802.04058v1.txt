Equations of spinning objects are obtained in Absolute Parallelism Geometry [AP], a special class of non-Riemannian geometry admitting an alternative non-vanishing curvature and torsion simultaneously. This new set of equations is the counterpart of the Papapetrou equations in the Riemannian geometry. Applying, the concept of geometerization of physics, it may give rise to describe the spin tensor as parameterized commutation relation between path and path deviation equations in both Riemannian and non-Riemannian geometries.
