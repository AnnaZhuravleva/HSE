In a former paper we proposed a model for the quantization of gravity by working in a bundle $E$ where we realized the Hamilton constraint as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. However, the corresponding operator only acts in the fibers and not in the base space. Therefore, we now discard the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and express the Hamilton constraint differently, either with the help of the Hamilton equations or by employing a geometric evolution equation. There are two possible modifications possible which both are equivalent to the Hamilton constraint and which lead to two new models. In the first model we obtain a hyperbolic operator that acts in the fibers as well as in the base space and we can construct a symplectic vector space and a Weyl system.   \nd In the second model the resulting equation is a wave equation in $\so \times (0,\infty)$ valid in points $(x,t,\xi)$ in $E$ and we look for solutions for each fixed $\xi$. This set of equations contains as a special case the equation of a quantized cosmological Friedmann universe without matter but with a cosmological constant, when we look for solutions which only depend on $t$. Moreover, in case $\so$ is compact we prove a spectral resolution of the equation.
