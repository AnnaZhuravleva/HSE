In this paper the $f(R)$ global monopole is reexamined. We provide an exact solution for the modified field equations in the presence of a global monopole for regions outside its core, generalizing previous results. Additionally, we discuss some particular cases obtained from this solution. We consider a setup consisting of a possible Schwarzschild black hole that absorbs the topological defect, giving rise to a static black hole endowed with a monopole's charge. Besides, we demonstrate how the asymptotic behavior of the Higgs field far from the monopole's core is shaped by a class of spacetime metrics which includes those ones analyzed here. In order to assess the gravitational properties of this system, we analyse the geodesic motion of both massive and massless test particles moving in the vicinity of such configuration. For the material particles we set the requirements they have to obey in order to experience stable orbits. On the other hand, for the photons we investigate how their trajectories are affected by the gravitational field of this black hole.
