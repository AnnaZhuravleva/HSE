In the spatially flat case of loop quantum cosmology, the connection $\bar{k}$ is usually replaced by the holonomy $\frac{\sin(\bar{\mu}k)}{\bar{\mu}}$ in the effective theory. In this paper, instead of the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme, we use a generalised, undertermined function $g(\bar{k},\bar{p})$ to represent the holonomy and by using the approach of anomaly free constraint algebra we fix all the counter terms in the constraints and find the restriction on the form of $g(\bar{k},\bar{p})$, then we derive the gauge invariant equations of motion of the scalar, tensor and vector perturbations and study the inflationary power spectra with generalised holonomy correction.
