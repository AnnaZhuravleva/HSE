Loop quantum gravity is one of the leading candidate theory to non-perturbatively quantize gravity. In this framework, holonomy corrections to the equation of propagation of gravitons in a FLRW background have been derived. We investigate the consequences of those corrections on the tensor power spectrum in de-Sitter and slow-roll inflations, for n=-1/2. Depending on the value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, several observational features could be expected.
