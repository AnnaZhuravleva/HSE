In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric wormhole solutions in the background of $F(T,T_\mathcal{G})$ gravity ($T$ is the torsion scalar and $T_{\mathcal{G}}$ represents teleparallel equivalent of the Gauss-Bonnet term). We study the wormhole solutions by assuming four different matter contents, a specific redshift function and a particular $F(T,T_\mathcal{G})$ model. The behavior of null/weak energy conditions for these fluids is analyzed graphically. It turns out that wormhole solutions can be obtained in the absence of exotic matter for some particular regions of spacetime. We also explore stability of wormhole solutions through equilibrium condition. It is concluded that there exist physically acceptable wormhole solutions for anisotropic, isotropic and traceless fluids.
