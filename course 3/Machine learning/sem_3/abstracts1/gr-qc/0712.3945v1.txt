Black holes monopolize nowadays the center stage of fundamental physics. Yet, they are poorly understood objects. Notwithstanding, from their generic properties, one can infer important clues to what a fundamental theory, a theory that includes gravitation and quantum mechanics, should give. Here we review the classical properties of black holes and their associated event horizons, as well as the quantum and thermodynamic properties, such as the temperature, derived from the Hawking radiation, and the entropy. Then, using the black hole properties we discuss a universal bound on the entropy for any object, or for any given region of spacetime, and finally we present the arguments, first given by 't Hooft, that, associating entropy with the number of quantum degrees of freedom, i.e., the logarithm of quantum states, via statistical physics, leads to the conclusion that the degrees of freedom of a given region are in the area A of the region, rather than in its volume V as naively could be thought. Surely, a fundamental theory has to take this in consideration.
