There is ongoing interest in adopting various tools and ideas from general relativity for optical applications and the study of light propagation through natural or engineered media. Here, the covariant kinematics of light propagating through arbitrary dielectric media in curved space-times are derived, allowing for analysis and tracing of congruences of light through media that may smoothly vary in character between vacuum, positively refracting, and negatively refracting; or null, timelike, and spacelike with respect to the background metric. The kinematics are then used to generalize the Raychaudhuri equation -- an important tool in general relativity that describes the focus of a congruence. These results will be useful for the analysis of optical devices, particularly those designed using transformation optics, and serve as theoretical tools to study generalized concepts in general relativity.
