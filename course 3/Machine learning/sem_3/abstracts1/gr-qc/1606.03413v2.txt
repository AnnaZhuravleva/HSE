Magnetic and vorticity fields evolution equations are known to obey the same equation when effects of dissipation and sources terms are negligible. We investigate the analogy between the two fields for non-vanishing dissipation and sources. In addition to the Reynolds (Re)and Prandtl (Pr_M) numbers, we define a new number (S_M) that is given by the ratio of the diffusive term to the Biermann battery term and which allows for a different classification of magnetised fluid behaviour. Numerical simulations of the two fields are then carried out given a parameter space made of Reynolds, Prandtl and Source numbers. We find it appropriate to present and discuss the findings against Prandtl numbers given that these provide the link between viscous and magnetic diffusion. Our simulations indicate that there exists a range of Prandtl numbers for which the fields remain analogues which raises the important question of how far the analogy goes.
