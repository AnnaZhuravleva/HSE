In this work we explore the CPT symmetry breaking and the birefringence in the gravitational sector. The CPT symmetry breaking forces two polarization modes of gravitational waves to travel at slightly different velocities, leading to the birefringence of gravitational waves. Different phase evolution of the two modes induced by the birefringence can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors, and thus an absence of such modifications in a given gravitational-wave detection can place an upper limit on the CPT violation. Using the Fisher information matrix, we estimate the projected constraints on the CPT violation and hence on the birefrigence of gravitational waves from advanced ground- and space-based gravitational-wave interferometers, including the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, the Einstein Telescope, and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.
