The dynamical features of Bianchi type $VI_h$ $(BVI_h)$ universe are investigated in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity. The field equations and the physical properties of the model are derived considering a power law expansion of the universe. The effect of anisotropy on the dynamics of the universe as well on the energy conditions are studied. The assumed anisotropy of the model is found to have substantial effects on the energy condition and dynamical parameters.
