A novel approach to quantization is shown to allow for superpositions of the cosmological constant in isotropic and homogeneous mini-superspace models. Generic solutions featuring such superpositions display: i) a unitary evolution equation; ii) singularity resolution; iii) a cosmic bounce. Explicit cosmological solutions are constructed. These exhibit characteristic bounce features including a 'super-inflation' regime with universal phenomenology that can naturally be made to be insensitive to Planck-scale physics.
