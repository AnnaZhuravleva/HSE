Among many alternative gravitational theories to General Relativity (GR), $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor) has been widely studied recently. By adding a matter contribution to the gravitational Lagrangian, $f(R,T)$ theories have become an interesting extension to GR displaying a broad phenomenology in astrophysics and cosmology. In this paper, we discuss however the difficulties appearing in explaining a viable and realistic cosmology within the $f(R,T)$ class of theories. Our results challenge the viability of $f(R,T)$ as an alternative modification of gravity.
