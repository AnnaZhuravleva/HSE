We present a one-parameter family of stationary, asymptotically flat solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with only a mild singularity, which are endowed with mass, angular momentum, a dipole magnetic moment and a quadrupole electric moment. We briefly analyze the structure of this solution, which we interpret as a system of two extreme co-rotating black holes with equal masses and electric charges, and opposite magnetic and gravimagnetic charges, held apart by an electrically charged, magnetized string which also acts as a Dirac-Misner string.
