We examine the effects of the Rastall parameter on the behaviour of spherically symmetric static distributions of perfect fluid matter. It was claimed by Visser [ arXiv:1711.11500 ] that the Rastall proposition is completely equivalent to the Einstein theory. While many authors demonstrated the objection, our intention is to analyze the properties of Rastall gravity through variation of the Rastall parameter in the context of perfect fluids spheres that may be used to model neutron stars or cold fluid planets. This analysis also serves to counter the claim that Rastall gravity is equivalent to the standard Einstein theory. It turns out that the condition of pressure isotropy is exactly the same as for Einstein gravity and hence that any known solution of the Einstein equations may be used to study the effects of the Rastall dynamical quantities. Moreover, by choosing the well studied Tolman metrics, we discover that in the majority of cases there is substantial deviation from the Einstein case when the Rastall parameter vanishes and in cases where the Einstein model displays defective behaviour, certain Rastall models obey the well known elementary requirements for physical plausibility.
