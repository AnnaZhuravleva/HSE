In the $\Lambda$CDM framework, presenting nonrelativistic matter inhomogeneities as discrete massive particles, we develop the second-order cosmological perturbation theory. Our approach relies on the weak gravitational field limit. The derived equations for the second-order scalar, vector and tensor metric corrections are suitable at arbitrary distances including regions with nonlinear contrasts of the matter density. We thoroughly verify fulfilment of all Einstein equations as well as self-consistency of order assignments. In addition, we achieve logical positive results in the Minkowski background limit. Feasible investigations of the cosmological backreaction manifestations by means of relativistic simulations are also outlined.
