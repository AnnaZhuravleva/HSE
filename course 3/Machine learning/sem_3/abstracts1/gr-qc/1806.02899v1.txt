Recent cosmological parameters estimations still have discrepancy in values given by different research teams. It was argued that additional contributions to our redshift measurements from non cosmological origins are responsible for this bias. But, gravitational redshift contribution couldn't account for all bias estimated. Several effects contribute to observed redshifts and a new effect is predicted to be the result of the gravitational interaction between photons and magnetic fields creating gravitational waves. The energy carried by these waves is manifested as redshifts of the photons. Contributions from this effect were not considered by previous studies and are mis-interpreted as caused from Doppler Effect or gravitational redshift. The significant impact of our effect is discussed along with possible mis-interpretations of several cosmological and astrophysical observations.
