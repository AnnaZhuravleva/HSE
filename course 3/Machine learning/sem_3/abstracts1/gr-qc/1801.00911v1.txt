In this paper, we review modified $f(R)$ theories of gravity in Palatini formalism. In this framework, , we use the Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that the gravity is attractive, which holds for any geometrical theory of gravity to discuss the energy conditions. Then, to derive these conditions, we obtain an expression for effective pressure and energy density by considering FLRW metric. Energy conditions derived in Palatini version of $f(R)$ Gravity differ from those derived in GR. We will see that the WEC (weak energy condition) derived in Palatini formalism has exactly the same expression in its metric approach.
