We show that the dynamical realization of the acceleration-enlarged Galilean symmetry leads to nonrelativistic massless particles whose energy may be negative. We present a fluid mechanical generalisation of this observation and use it to contruct a nonrelativistic two-dimensional fluid model which possesses solutions with a negative energy density. Considering this model as describing dark energy in a baby universe (two space dimensions) we show that its negative energy density leads to a repulsive gravitational interaction of the fluid with any test body.
