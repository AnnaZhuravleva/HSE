The loss of orbital energy and angular momentum to gravitational waves produced in a binary inspiral forces the orbital eccentricity to evolve. For comparable-mass binaries, the eccentricity is thought to decrease monotonically in the inspiral, circularizing the binary. Contrary to this, we here show that, once the eccentricity is small enough, radiation reaction forces the eccentricity to grow secularly before the binary reaches the last stable orbit and merges. We explore this behavior, its physical consequences, and its potential impact on future gravitational wave observations.
