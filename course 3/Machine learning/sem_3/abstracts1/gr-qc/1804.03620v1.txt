The generalized uncertainty principle and a minimum measurable length arise in various theories of gravity and predict Planck-scale modifications of the canonical position-momentum commutation relation. Postulating a similar modified commutator between the canonical variables of the electromagnetic field in quantum optics, we compute Planck-scale corrections to the radiation pressure noise and shot noise of Michelson-Morley interferometers, with particular attention to gravity wave detectors such as LIGO. We show that advanced LIGO is potentially sensitive enough to observe Planck-scale effects and thereby indirectly a minimal length. We also propose estimates for the bounds on quantum gravity parameters from current and future advanced LIGO experiments.
