The notion of Double Convexity for a foliation of a Null Cone was introduced to give a proof, if satisfied, of the Null Penrose Inequality. In this paper, for a class of strictly stable, Weakly Isolated Horizons we show the existence of a unique foliation by Doubly Convex Marginally Outer Trapped Surfaces (MOTS). Moreover, we show that any sufficiently small metric perturbation continues to support the existence of a Doubly Convex MOTS. Using this, and a lemma of S. Alexakis, we verify that the Null Penrose Inequality remains satisfied for a class of physically reasonable metric perturbations off of the standard Schwarzschild Null Cone.
