In this paper we investigate a new phenomenological parameterization for unified dark matter and dark energy based on the polynomial expansion of the barotropic equation of state parameter $w$. Our parameterization provides well-behaving evolution of $w$ for both small and big redshifts as well as in the far future. The dark fluid described by our parameterization behaves for big redshifts like a dark matter. Therefore one can parameterize dark energy and dark matter using a single dark fluid, like in the case of the Chaplygin gas. Within this parameterization we consider 2 models: one with DE barotropic parameter fixed to be $-1$ and the second one, where $w \neq -1$ is chosen to match the best fit to the data. We study main cosmological properties of these models at the expansion and perturbation levels. Based on Markov chain Monte Carlo method with currently available cosmic observational data sets, we constrain these models to determine the cosmological parameters at the level of background and clustering of matter. We consider the interaction between DM and DE which directly affects the evolution of matter and its clustering. Our model appears to be perfectly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, while providing unification of DE and DM.
