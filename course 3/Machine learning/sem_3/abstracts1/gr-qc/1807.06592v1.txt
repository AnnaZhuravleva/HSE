In this paper, we will consider a subclass of models of Horndeski theories of gravity and we will check for several Static Spherically Symmetric solutions. We will find a model which admits an exact black hole solution and we will study its thermodynamics by using the Euclidean Action. We will see that, in analogy with the case of General Relativity, the integration constant of the solution can be identified with the mass of the black hole itself. Other solutions will be discussed, by posing a special attention on the possibility of reproducing the observed profiles of the rotation curves of galaxies.
