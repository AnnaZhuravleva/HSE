We present Friedmann flat spacetime uncertainty relations (STUR) together with some cosmological implications. An interesting link between the Principle of "gravitational stability against localization of events" (PGSL) and the holographic Bekenstein entropy bound (HEB) is also investigated. The same theorems leading to our STUR are used to calculate, thanks to the holographic principle, the entropy of the universe at its apparent horizon. The generalized entropy formula can be used to discuss interesting links with a quantum spacetime.
