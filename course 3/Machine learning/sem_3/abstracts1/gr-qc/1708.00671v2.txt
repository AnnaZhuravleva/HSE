Certain alternative theories of gravity predict that gravitational waves will disperse as they travel from the source to the observer. The recent binary black hole observations by Advanced-LIGO have set limits on a modified dispersion relation from the constraints on their effects on gravitational-wave propagation. Using an identical modified dispersion, of the form $E^2=p^2c^2+{\mathbb A}\; p^{\alpha} c^{\alpha}$, where ${\mathbb A}$ denotes the magnitude of dispersion and $E$ and $p$ are the energy and momentum of the gravitational wave, we estimate the projected constraints on the modified dispersion from observations of compact binary mergers by third- generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer as well as the space-based detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find that third-generation detectors would bound dispersion of gravitational waves much better than their second-generation counterparts. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, with its extremely good low-frequency sensitivity, would place stronger constraints than the ground-based detectors for $\alpha \leq 1$, whereas for $\alpha > 1$, the bounds are weaker. We also study the effect of the spins of the compact binary constituents on the bounds.
