In this article, we study regular scale-dependent black holes as gravitational lenses. We obtain the deflection angle in the strong deflection limit, from which we calculate the positions and the magnifications of the relativistic images. We compare our results with those corresponding to the Schwarzschild spacetime, and as an example, we apply and discuss these results to the particular case of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.
