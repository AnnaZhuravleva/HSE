In this work, we present a regular black hole solution, in the context of scale-dependent General Relativity, satisfying the weak energy condition. The source of this solution is an anisotropic effective energy-momentum tensor which appears when the scale dependence of the theory is turned-on. In this sense, the solution can be considered as a semiclassical extension of the Schwarzschild one.
