We explore cosmological solutions to Lorentz breaking gravity using the gravitational sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). By using a simple toy model for Lorentz violation and under the assumption that the so-called $\mathfrak{T}$-tensor is covariantly constant, we show that the gravity sector SME influences basic cosmology. If the approach used in this toy model is valid these results should point the way for more sofisticated studies.
