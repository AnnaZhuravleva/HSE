Over the years, the so-called black hole information loss paradox has generated an amazingly diverse set of (often radical) proposals. However, forty years after the introduction of Hawking's radiation, there continues to be a debate regarding whether the effect does, in fact, lead to an actual problem. In this paper we try to clarify some aspect of the discussion by describing two possible perspectives regarding the landscape of the information loss issue. Moreover, we advance a fairly conservative point of view regarding the relation between evaporating black holes and the rest of physics, which leads us to advocate a generalized breakdown of unitarity. We conclude by exploring some implications of our proposal in relation with conservation laws.
