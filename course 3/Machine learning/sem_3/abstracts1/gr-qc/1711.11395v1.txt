In this article we study the nature of the particle horizon, event horizon and the Hubble radius in a cosmological model which accommodates a cosmological bounce. The nature of the horizons and their variation with time are presented for various models of the universe. The effective role of the Hubble radius in affecting causality in such kind of models is briefly discussed.
