We have realized a stationary transcritical flow of water in a flume that possesses the analogue of a black hole horizon for long-wavelength surface waves. The horizon has been probed via the scattering of an incident co-current wave, which partially scatters into counter-current waves on either side of the horizon, yielding three outgoing waves (of which one is anomalous) rather than two in the absence of transcriticality. The measured scattering coefficients are in good agreement with the predictions of the non-dispersive theory, where the kinematical description in terms of an effective spacetime metric is exact. We also show the emergence of characteristic peaks in the two-point correlation function of free surface deformations, one of which indicates the presence of a horizon and in quantum settings would be used to demonstrate the presence of the thermal analogue Hawking effect.
