We propose boundary terms appropriate for the general Lanczos-Lovelock action in a spacetime volume bounded by null surfaces when Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed. We believe that these boundary terms have been derived for the first time in literature. In this derivation, we rely only on the structure of the boundary variation of the action for Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We also derive the boundary term for Gauss-Bonnet gravity separately as an illustration of our method.
