We make use of the Lagrangian description of fluid motion to highlight certain features in the context of spacetime geometry as emergent phenomena in fluid systems. We find by using Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), that not all kind of perturbations on a steady state flow can produce analogue spacetime effect. We also explore the manifold structure of emergent spacetime by using the Lagrangian description of fluid motion. We restrict ourselves to nonrelativistic flows.
