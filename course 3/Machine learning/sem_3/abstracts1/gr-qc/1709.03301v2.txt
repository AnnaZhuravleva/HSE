For most initial conditions, cosmologically relevant physical modes were trans-planckian at the bounce time, often by many magnitude orders. We improve the usual loop quantum cosmology calculation of the primordial power spectra -- in the inflationary framework -- by accounting for those trans-planckian effects through modified dispersion relations. This can induce drastic changes in the spectrum, making it either compatible or incompatible with observational data, depending on the details of the choices operated.
