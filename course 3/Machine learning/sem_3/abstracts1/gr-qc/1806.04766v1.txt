The energy dependence of deflection angel is a common prediction in some quantum gravity theories. For low energy photons, the deflection angel recovers to the prediction of GR. But it reduced to zero for infinite energy photons. In this paper, we develop an effective approach to calculate the trajectory of photons and other deflection-related quantities semiclassically by replacing $h_{\mu \nu}$ with $h_{\mu \nu} \times f(E)$ to include the correction of quantum gravity. This approach could provide more information for photons traveling in external gravitational field. We compute the Einstein radius of gravitational lensing and the horizon of black hole with this method and find that they are all energy dependent and decrease to zero as energy increases to infinity.
