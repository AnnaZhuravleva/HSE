In this paper we study the Chaplygin gas model as a candidate for inflation in the framework of the Randall Sundrum type-II braneworld model. We consider the original and generalized Chaplygin gas model in the presence of monomial potential. The inflationary spectrum perturbation parameters are reformulated and evaluated in the high-energy limit and we found that they depend on several parameters. We also showed that these perturbation parameters are widely compatible with the recent Planck data for a particular choice of the parameters space of the model. A suitable observational central value of $n_{s}\simeq $ $0.965$ is also obtained in the case of original and generalized Chaplygin gas.
