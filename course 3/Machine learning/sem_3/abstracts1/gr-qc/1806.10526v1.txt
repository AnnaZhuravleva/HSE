Motivated by the cosmic censorship conjecture in mathematical relativity, we establish the precise mass lower bound for an asymptotically flat Riemannian 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature and minimal surface boundary, in terms of angular momentum and charge. In particular this result does not require the restrictive assumptions of simple connectivity and completeness, which are undesirable from both a mathematical and physical perspective.
