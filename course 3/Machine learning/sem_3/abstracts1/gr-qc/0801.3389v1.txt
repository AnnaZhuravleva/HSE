The quasinormal modes (QNMs) and the late-time behavior of arbitrary spin fields are studied in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole (SBHGM). It has been shown that the real part of the QNMs for a SBHGM decreases as the symmetry breaking scale parameter $H$ increases but imaginary part increases instead. For large overtone number $n$, these QNMs become evenly spaced and the spacing for the imaginary part equals to $-i(1-H)^{3/2}/(4M)$ which is dependent of $H$ but independent of the quantum number $l$. It is surprisingly found that the late-time behavior is dominated by an inverse power-law tail $t^{-2[1+\sqrt{(s+1/2)^{2}+ (l-s)(l+s+1)/(1-H)}]}$ for each $l$, and as $H\to0$ it reduces to the Schwarzschild case $t^{-(2l+3)}$ which is independent of the spin number $s$.
