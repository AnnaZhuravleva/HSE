Accelerating mirrors provide a simple conceptual laboratory for studying particle production and the relation between trajectory and particle, energy, and entropy fluxes. We focus on the relation between energy and entropy, studying some special cases with finite total energy but infinite integrated entropy (though the entropy flux may be finite at any particular moment). We present a new asymptotically static moving mirror trajectory with solvable beta Bogolyubov coefficients, total energy and fully relativistic particle count. The integrated entropy diverges despite finite global radiative particle and energy emission. Another class of models includes exponentially accelerated mirrors in proper time; one of its unexpected behaviors is finite energy emission but divergent entropy. We compare mirrors exponentially accelerated in other coordinates as well, showing their close relation and an interesting duality property.
