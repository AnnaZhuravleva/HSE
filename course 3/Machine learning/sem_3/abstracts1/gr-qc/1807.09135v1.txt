We obtain the exact solutions of both angular and radial parts of the Klein-Gordon equation describing a charged massive scalar fields in the Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole spacetime, which are given in terms of the spherical harmonics and the confluent Heun functions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the physical phenomena related to the resonant frequency associated to this field, and also some aspects related to its thermodynamics and Hawking radiation.
