The most simple superrenormalizable model of quantum gravity is based on the general local covariant six-derivative action. In addition to graviton such a theory has massive scalar and tensor modes. It was shown recently that in the case when the massive poles emerge in complex conjugate pairs, the theory has also unitary $S$-matrix and hence can be seen as a candidate to be a consistent quantum gravity theory. In the present work we construct the modified Newton potential and explore the gravitational light bending in a general six-derivative theory, including the most interesting case of complex massive poles. In the case of the light deflection the results are obtained within classical and semiclassical approaches.
