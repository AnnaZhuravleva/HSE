We discuss the asymmetry of cosmic background evolution in time with respect to the quantum bounce in the Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), employing the newly proposed bouncing parameter $\alpha_{\rm s}$. We use the Chaotic and the $R^2$ potentials to demonstrate that a possible deflation before the bounce may counteract the inflation that is needed for resolving the cosmological conundrums, so a certain level of time asymmetry is required for the models in LQC. This $\alpha_{\rm s}$ is model dependent and closely related to the amounts of deflation and inflation, so we may use observations to confine $\alpha_{\rm s}$ and thus the model parameters. With further studies this formalism should be useful in providing an observational testbed for the LQC models.
