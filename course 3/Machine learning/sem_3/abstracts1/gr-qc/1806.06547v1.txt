Based on the well known fact that the quasinormal frequencies are the poles of the frequency domain Green's function we describe a method that allows us to calculate exactly the quasinormal frequencies of the Klein-Gordon field moving in the three-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole. These quasinormal frequencies are already published and widely explored in several applications, but we use this example to expound the proposed method of computation. We think that the described procedure can be useful to calculate exactly the quasinormal frequencies of classical fields propagating in other backgrounds. Furthermore, we compare with previous results and discuss some related facts.
