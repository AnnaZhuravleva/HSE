Recently there has been a proposal for modified gravitational f(R) actions which include a direct coupling between the matter action and the Ricci scalar, R. Of particular interest is the specific case where both the action and the coupling are linear in R. It is shown that such an action leads to a theory of gravity which includes higher order derivatives of the matter fields without introducing more dynamics in the gravity sector and, therefore, cannot be a viable theory for gravitation.
