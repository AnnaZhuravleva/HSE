A gauge invariant metric fluctuations formalism from a non-compact Kaluza-Klein (NKK) theory of gravity is presented in this talk notes. In this analysis we recover the well-known result $\frac{delta \rho}{\rho}\simeq 2\Phi$ obtained typically in the standard 4D semiclassical approach to inflation and also the spectrum of this fluctuations becomes dependent of the fifth (space-like) coordinate. This fact allows to establish an interval of values for the wave number associated with the fifth dimension.
