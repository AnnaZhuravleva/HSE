The semi-classical nature of braneworld cosmological models does not account for any quantum gravitational effects. In this letter we use the gauge/gravity correspondence to argue that quantum string corrections cannot be ignored in any study of braneworld stability. As an example, we find, by analysing the quantum gravitational backreaction, that a closed universe is unstable to radiation into the bulk.
