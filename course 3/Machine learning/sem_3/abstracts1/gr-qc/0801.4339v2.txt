In order for a modified gravity model to be a candidate for cosmological dark energy it has to pass stringent local gravity experiments. We find that a Brans-Dicke (BD) theory with well-defined second order corrections that include the Gauss-Bonnet term possess this feature. We construct the generic second order theory that gives, to linear order, a BD metric solution for a point-like mass source. We find that these theories interpolate between general relativity (GR) and BD gravity. In particular it is found that the relevant Eddington parameter, that is commonly heavily constrained by time delay experiments, can be arbitrarily close to the GR value of 1, with an arbitrary BD parameter. We find the region where the solution is stable to small timelike perturbations.
