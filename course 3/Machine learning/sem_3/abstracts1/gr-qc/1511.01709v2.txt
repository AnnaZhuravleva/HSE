Quasilocal formulations of black hole are of immense importance since they reveal the essential and minimal assumptions required for a consistent description of black hole horizon, without relying on the asymptotic boundary conditions on fields. Using the quasilocal formulation of Isolated Horizons, we construct the Hamiltonian charges corresponding to local Lorentz transformations on a spacetime admitting isolated horizon as an internal boundary. From this construction, it arises quite generally that the \emph{area} of the horizon of an isolated black hole is the Hamiltonian charge for local Lorentz boost on the horizon. Using this argument further, it is shown that, observers at a fixed proper distance $l_{0}$, very close to the horizon, may define a notion of horizon energy given by $E=A/8\pi G l_{0}$, the surface gravity is given by $\kappa=1/l_{0}$, and consequently, the first law can be written in the quasilocal setting as $\delta E=(\kappa/8\pi G)\delta A$..
