We consider a modified gravity model of the form $ f(R,\phi)=R e^{h(\phi)R} $, where $\phi$ is a non-interacting massive scalar field. We show that the conformal transformation of this model to Einstein frame leads to non-canonical kinetic term and negates the advantage of the Einstein frame. We obtain exact solutions for the background and show that the model leads to inflation with exit. We obtain scalar and tensor power-spectrum in Jordan frame and show that the model leads to blue-tilt. We discuss the implications of the same in the light of cosmological observations.
