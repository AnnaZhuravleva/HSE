In this paper we derive a general solution for the most general rotating and twisting locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes. This is achieved in three steps. First we decompose the manifold via 1+1+2 semi-tetrad formalism that yields a set of geometrical and thermodynamic scalars for the spacetime. We then recast the Einstein field equations in terms of evolution and propagation of these scalars. It is then shown that this class of spacetimes must possess self similarity and we use this property to solve for these scalars, thus obtaining a general solution. This solution has a number of very interesting cosmological or astrophysical consequences which we discuss in detail.
