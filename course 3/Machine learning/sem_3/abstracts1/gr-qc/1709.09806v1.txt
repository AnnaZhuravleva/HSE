Quantum field theory successfully explains the origin of all fundamental forces except gravity due to the renormalizability and ultraviolet(UV) completion puzzles. The ADS/CFT correspondence conjecture might naturally resolve the above two puzzles for ADS space gravity. In this paper, we propose a topological scenario to resolve the above two puzzles for generic cases(e.g., with or without cosmological constant term). First, we propose a $3+1$D topological (quantum) gravity theory which is perturbatively renormalizable and potentially UV complete, this step can be regarded as a straightforward generalization of Edward Witten's Chern-Simons theory proposal for $2+1$D topological gravity. Then, we show that Einstein-Cartan equation and classical space-time naturally emerge from topological (quantum) gravity via loop condensation. The second step is a unique feature in $3+1$D and it might even naturally explain why our space-time is four dimensional. Experimentally measurable low energy predictions are also discussed.
