Spherically gravitational collapse towards a black hole with non-zero tangential pressure is studied. Exact solutions corresponding to different equations of state are given. We find that when taking the tangential pressure into account, the exact solutions have three qualitatively different endings. For positive tangential pressure, the shell around a black hole may eventually collapse onto the black hole, or expand to infinity, or have a static but unstable solution, depending on the combination of black hole mass, mass of the shell and the pressure parameter. For vanishing or negative pressure, the shell will collapse onto the black hole. For all eventually collapsing solutions, the shell will cross the event horizon, instead of accumulating outside the event horizon, even if clocked by a distant stationary observer.
