The study of shadow is quite prominent nowadays because of the ongoing Event Horizon Telescope observations. We construct the shadow images of charged wormholes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) theory. The spacetime metric of the charged wormholes contains three charges: magnetic charge $P$, electric charge $Q$, and dilaton charge $\Sigma$. We evaluate the photon geodesics around the charged wormholes. Also we calculate the effective potential and discuss its behavior with angular momentum $L$ and different values of charges $P$, $Q$, and $\Sigma$. A study of the shadow of charged wormholes reveals that the shadow is a perfect circle, and it has an effect of the charges $P$ and $Q$. We find that the radius of the shadow monotonically increases with magnetic charge $P$ as well as electric charge $Q$.
