In the framework of Einstein's the theory of general relativity we present a new interior solution with a perfect fluid, this is constructed from the proposal of a gravitational redshift factor. The geometry is regular and its density and pressure are monotonic decrescent functions, furthermore the sound speed is smaller than the light speed and monotonic crescent. The solution depends on a parameter $w \in (0, 2.0375509325]$ related to the compactness of the star $u = GM/c^2 R$, the maximum value $u = 0.2660858316$ which allow to describe compact stars like quark stars or neutron stars. Although there is a diversity of stars for which the model can be used, we only apply this solution to describe the interior of a neutron star PSR J0348$+$0432. According to the observations, it is known that its mass $M = (2.01 \pm 0.04)M_{\odot}$ and its radius is between 12.062Km and 12.957Km, so the value of the compactness is in the range $u \in [0.2244845, 0.2509338]$. In addition to the decreasing behavior of the mentioned pressure and density functions, the results are consistent with the density values range typical of neutron stars and the maximal central density of the star result to be 1.283818 $\times 10^{18} Kg/m^{3}$.
