We explain the necessity of application of semi-metric in general relativity. A detailed discussion on the energy-momentum conservation in the general relativity is presented using the mathematical tool of semi-metric. By means of the general covariant spacetime translation transformation, the most general covariant conservation law of energy-momentum is obtained, which is valid for any coordinates and overcomes the flaws of the expressions of Einstain, Landau and Moller.
