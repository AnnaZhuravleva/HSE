There are theories which implement the idea that the constants of nature may be "time dependent." These introduce new fields representing "evolving constants," in addition to physical fields. We argue that dynamical matter coupling constants can arise naturally in non-perturbative matter-gravity theories, after a choice of global time is made. We illustrate the idea in scalar field cosmology with spatial volume as a global clock, and compute the time dependence of the scalar mass and self-interaction coupling constants.
