A novel constraint on $f(R)$ theories of gravity is obtained from the uncertainty in the observed chirp mass associated to the gravitational wave emitted from the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. The $f(R)$ theories possess an additional massive scalar degree of freedom apart from the massless spin-2 modes. The corresponding scalar field contributes an additional attractive, short-ranged ``fifth" force affecting the gravitational wave radiation process. We found that chameleon screening is necessary to conform with the observation. We obtained a model independent bound $\vert f'(R_0) -1\vert < 3\times 10^{-3}$ where the prime denotes the derivative with respect $R$ and $R_0$ is the curvature of our Universe at present. Though our calculation is nonrelativistic, still the bound is stronger/equivalent compared to some earlier other bounds such as from the Cassini mission in the Solar-System, Supernova monopole radiation, the observed CMB spectrum, galaxy cluster density profile, etc. Using the bound obtained, we also constrain the parameter space in the Hu-Sawicki, Starobinsky, and Tsujikawa models as the alternatives to dark energy.
