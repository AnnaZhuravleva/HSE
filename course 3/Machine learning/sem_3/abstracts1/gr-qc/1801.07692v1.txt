We present our Finsler spacetime formalism which extends the standard formulation of Finsler geometry to be applicable in physics. Finsler spacetimes are viable non-metric geometric backgrounds for physics; they guarantee well defined causality, the propagation of light on a non-trivial null structure, a clear notion of physical observers and the existence of physical field theories determining the geometry of space-time dynamically in terms of an extended gravitational field equation. Here we give the precise definition of Finsler spacetimes and the notion of well-defined observers, their measurements, the transformations between them and how to formulate action based field theories.
