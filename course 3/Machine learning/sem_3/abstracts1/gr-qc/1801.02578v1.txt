In this work we use the Loop Quantum Cosmology modified scalar-tensor reconstruction techniques in order to investigate how bouncing and inflationary cosmologies can be realized. With regard to the inflationary cosmologies, we shall be interested in realizing the intermediate inflation and the Type IV singular inflation, while with regard to bouncing cosmologies, we shall realize the superbounce and the symmetric bounce. In all the cases, we shall find the kinetic term of the LQC holonomy corrected scalar-tensor theory and the corresponding scalar potential. In addition, we shall include a study of the effective equation of state, emphasizing at the early and late time eras. As we demonstrate, in some cases it is possible to have a nearly de Sitter equation of state at the late-time era, a result that could be interpreted as the description of a late-time acceleration era. Also, in all cases we shall examine the dynamical stability of the LQC holonomy corrected scalar-tensor theory, and we shall confront the results with those coming from the corresponding classical dynamical stability theory. The most appealing cosmological scenario is that of a Type IV singular inflationary scenario, in which the singularity may occur at the late-time era. As we demonstrate, for this model, during the dark energy era, a transition from non-phantom to a phantom dark energy era occurs.
