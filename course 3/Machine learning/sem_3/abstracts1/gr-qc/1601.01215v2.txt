In this paper, we discuss inflationary scenario via scalar field and fluid cosmology for anisotropic homogeneous universe model in $f(R)$ gravity. We consider an equation of state which corresponds to quasi-de Sitter expansion and investigate the effect of anisotropy parameter for different values of deviation parameter. We evaluate potential models like linear, quadratic and quartic which correspond to chaotic inflation. We construct the observational parameters for power-law model of $f(R)$ gravity and construct the graphical analysis of tensor-scalar ratio and spectral index which indicates consistency of these parameters with Planck 2015 data.
