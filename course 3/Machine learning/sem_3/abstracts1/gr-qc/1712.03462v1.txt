We review a recent formalism which derives the functional forms of the primordial -- tensor and scalar -- power spectra of scalar potential inflationary models. The formalism incorporates the case of geometries with non-constant first slow-roll parameter. Analytic expressions for the power spectra are given that explicitly display the dependence on the geometric properties of the background. Moreover, we present the full algorithm for using our formalism, to reconstruct the model from the observed power spectra. Our techniques are applied to models possessing "features" in their potential with excellent agreement.
