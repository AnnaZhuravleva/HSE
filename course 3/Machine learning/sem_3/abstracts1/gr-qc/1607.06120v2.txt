In this article, we shed some light on the field theoretic aspect of the spherically symmetric trapping horizon in Vaidya spacetime. The effective field equations are that of a Chern-Simons theory coupled to bulk sources through two different couplings, one is purely geometric and the other is matter dependent. This is an effective generalization of the equilibrium horizon scenario where the Chern-Simons theory is coupled to the bulk geometry through a constant matter-independent coupling. Further, we note that the field equations pulled-back to a cross-section of the horizon is inadequate to manifest the nature of the horizon. Hence, contrary to the usual practice, the evolution equation needs to be considered at least while passing on to the quantum theory.
