In this paper we investigate conformal symmetries in Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) spacetimes using a semitetrad covariant formalism. We demonstrate that a general LRS spacetime which rotates and spatially twists simultaneously has an inherent homothetic symmetry in the plane spanned by the fluid flow lines and the preferred spatial direction. We discuss the nature and consequence of this homothetic symmetry showing that a null Killing horizon arises when the heat flux has an extremal value. We also consider the special case of a perfect fluid and the restriction on the conformal geometry.
