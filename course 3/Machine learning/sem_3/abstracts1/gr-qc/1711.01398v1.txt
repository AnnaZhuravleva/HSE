We consider the field equations for a flat FRW cosmological model, in a generic $f(R)$ gravity model and cast them into a, completely normalized-dimensionless, system of O.D.Es for the scale factor and the function $f(R)$, with respect to the scalar curvature $R$. It is shown that under reasonable assumptions one can produce simple analytical and numerical solutions describing bouncing cosmological models where in addition there are late-time accelerating. Possibility of extending these results is briefly discussed.
