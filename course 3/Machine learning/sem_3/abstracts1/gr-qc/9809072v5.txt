It is now possible to partially deflect gravitation away from an object so that the gravitational attraction on the object is reduced. That effect makes it possible to extract energy from the gravitational field, which makes the generation of gravito-electric power technologically feasible. Such plants would be similar to hydro-electric plants and would have their advantages of not needing fuel and not polluting the environment.   Physically, the action of deflecting away gravitational attraction, which of course is directed toward the gravitation source, produces an equal but opposite reaction on the mechanism that produces the deflection of the gravitational action [the deflector], a reaction directed away from the gravitation source.   The result is the combination of reducing the gravitational attractive acceleration of the object toward the gravitation source plus the introducing of a reactive acceleration on the object in the direction away from the gravitation source.   Such a deflector, engineered to enable controlled adjustment of the amount and the direction of its action, could provide for a spacecraft both launch levitation and deep space travel acceleration. It could provide both levitation and horizontal motion for a flying vehicle over a planet surface.   This technology, which uses readily abundantly available materials and techniques, is ready now for research and engineering refinement.
