In the general theory of relativity, gravitational waves have two possible polarizations, which are transverse and traceless with helicity $\pm 2$. Some alternatives theories contain additional helicity $0$ and helicity $\pm 1$ polarization modes. Here, we consider a hypothetical "pure vector" theory in which gravitational waves have only two possible polarizations, with helicity $\pm 1$. We show that if these polarizations are allowed to rotate as the wave propagates, then for certain source locations on the sky, the strain outputs of three ideal interferometric gravitational wave detectors can exactly reproduce the strain outputs predicted by general relativity.
