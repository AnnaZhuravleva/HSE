It has recently been proved that horizonless compact stars with reflecting boundary conditions {\it cannot} support spatially regular matter configurations made of minimally coupled scalar fields, vector fields, and tensor fields. In the present paper we extend this intriguing no-hair property to the physically interesting regime of scalar fields with {\it nonminimal} coupling to gravity. In particular, we prove that static spherically symmetric configurations made of nonminimally coupled massless scalar fields cannot be supported by compact reflecting stars.
