In the present work we study the scale--dependence of polytropic non-charged black holes in (3+1)-dimensional space--times assuming a cosmological constant. We allow for scale--dependence of the gravitational and cosmological couplings, and we solve the corresponding generalized field equations imposing the null energy condition. Besides, some properties, such as horizon structure and thermodynamics, are discussed in detail.
