We consider spinning generalizations of the Ellis wormhole in scalar-tensor theory. Analogous to other compact objects these wormholes can carry a non-trivial scalarization. We determine the domain of existence of the scalarized wormholes and investigate the effect of the scalarization on their properties. Depending on the choice of the coupling function, they may possess multiple throats and equators in the Jordan frame, while possessing only a single throat in the Einstein frame.
