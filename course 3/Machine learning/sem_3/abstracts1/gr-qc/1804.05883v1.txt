We investigate periodic orbits and zoom-whirl behaviors around a Kerr Sen black hole with a rational number $q$ in terms of three integers $(z,w,v)$, from which one can immediately read off the number of leaves (or zooms), the ordering of the leaves, and the number of whirls. The characteristic of zoom-whirl periodic orbits is the precession of multi-leaf orbits in the strong-field regime. This feature is analogous to the counterpart in the Kerr spacetime. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of the charge parameter $b$ on the zoom-whirl periodic orbits. Compared to the periodic orbits around the Kerr black hole, it is found that typically lower energies are required for the same orbits in the Kerr Sen black hole.
