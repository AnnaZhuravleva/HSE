By using a method improved with a generalized optical metric, the deflection of light for an observer and source at finite distance from a lens object in a stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime has been recently discussed [Ono, Ishihara, Asada, Phys. Rev. D 96, 104037 (2017)]. By using this method, in the weak field approximation, we study the deflection angle of light for an observer and source at finite distance from a rotating Teo wormhole, especially by taking account of the contribution from the geodesic curvature of the light ray in a space associated with the generalized optical metric. Our result of the deflection angle of light is compared with a recent work on the same wormhole but limited within the asymptotic source and observer [Jusufi, Ovgun, Phys. Rev. D 97, 024042, (2018)], in which they employ another approach proposed by Werner with using the Nazim's osculating Riemannian construction method via the Randers-Finsler metric. We show that the two different methods give the same result in the asymptotic limit. We obtain also the corrections to the deflection angle due to the finite distance from the rotating wormhole.
