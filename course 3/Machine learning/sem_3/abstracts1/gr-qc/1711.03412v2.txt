In this article we perform a detailed theoretical analysis for a class of new exact solutions with anisotropic fluid distribution of matter for compact objects in hydrostatic equilibrium. To achieve this we call the relation between the metric functions, namely, embedding class one condition. The investigation is carried out by generalising the properties of a spherical star with an emphasis on hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, in our understanding of these compact objects. We match the interior solution to an exterior Reissner-Nordstrom solution, and study some physical features of this models, such as the energy conditions, speeds of sound, and mass - radius relation of the star. We also show that obtained solution is compatible with observational data for compact object Her X-1.
