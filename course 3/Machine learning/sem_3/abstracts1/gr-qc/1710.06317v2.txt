The Asymptotically Safe Gravity provides a framework for the description of gravity from the trans-Planckian regime to cosmological scales. According to this scenario, the cosmological constant and Newton's coupling are functions of the energy scale whose evolution is dictated by the renormalization group equations. The formulation of the renormalization group equations on foliated spacetimes, based on the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism, furnishes a natural way to construct the RG energy scale from the spectrum of the laplacian operator on the spatial slices. Combining this idea with a Renormalization Group improvement procedure, in this work we study quantum gravitational corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action on Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) backgrounds. The resulting quantum-corrected Friedmann equations can give rise to both bouncing cosmologies and emergent universe solutions. Our bouncing models do not require the presence of exotic matter and emergent universe solutions can be constructed for any allowed topology of the spatial slices.
