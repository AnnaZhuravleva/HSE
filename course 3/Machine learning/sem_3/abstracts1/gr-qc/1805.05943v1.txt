We analyze the polymer representation of quantum mechanics within the deformation quantization formalism. In particular, we construct the Wigner function and the star-product for the polymer representation as a distributional limit of the Schr\"odinger representation for the Weyl algebra in a Gaussian weighted measure, and we observe that the quasi-probability distribution limit of this Schr\"odinger representation agrees with the Wigner function for Loop Quantum Cosmology. Further, the introduced polymer star-product fulfills Bohr's correspondence principle even though not all the operators are well defined in the polymer representation. Finally, within our framework, we also derive a generalized uncertainty principle which is consistent to the ones usually obtained in theories assuming a fundamental minimal length in their formulation.
