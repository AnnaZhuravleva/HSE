Closed FLRW universe of Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant in three dimensions is investigated by using the Collins-Williams formalism in Regge calculus. Spherical Cauchy surface is replaced with regular polyhedrons. The Regge equations are reduced to differential equations in continuum time limit. Numerical solutions to the Regge equations well approximate the continuum FLRW universe during the era of small edge length. The deviation from the continuum solution becomes larger and larger with time. Unlike the continuum universe the polyhedral universe expands to infinite within finite time. To remedy the shortcoming of the model universe we introduce geodesic domes and pseudo-regular polyhedrons. It is shown that the pseudo-regular polyhedron model can well approximate the results of the Regge calculus for the geodesic domes. The pseudo-regular polyhedron model approaches to the continuum solution in the infinite frequency limit.
