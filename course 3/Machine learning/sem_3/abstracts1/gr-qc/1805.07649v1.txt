In recent years, it was found that the energy $E_{c.m.}$ in the centre of mass frame of two colliding particles can be unbounded near black holes. If collision occurs exactly on the horizon, $E_{c.m.}$ is formally infinite. We analyze briefly different scenarios of such a kind and show that in every act of collision $E_{c.m.}$ is finite (although it can be as large as one likes). The factors preventing infinite energy are diverse: the necessity of infinite proper rime, infinite tidal forces, potential barrier, etc. This prompts us to formulate a general principle according to which the limits in which $E_{c.m.}$ becomes infinite are never achieved.
