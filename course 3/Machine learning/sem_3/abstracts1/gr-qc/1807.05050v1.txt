The present work is devoted to investigate the Noether symmetries of the locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I space time in $f(T,B)$ gravity theory which depends on the torsion scalar $T$ and the boundary term $B$. In this theory, we consider some particular models and investigate their Noether symmetry generators. Besides, we get exact cosmological solutions of the considering models including the matter dominant universe using the Noether symmetry technique. The obtained results are coincide with the accelerated expansion behaviour of the universe.
