Spherically symmetric relativistic stars with the polytropic equation of state, which possess the local pressure anisotropy, are considered in the context of general relativity. The modified Lane-Emden equations are derived for the special ansatz for the anisotropy parameter $\Delta$ in the form of the differential relation between $\Delta$ and the metric function $\nu$. The analytical solutions of the obtained equations are found for incompressible fluid stars. The dynamical stability of incompressible anisotropic fluid stars against radial oscillations is studied.
