We study characteristic (quasinormal) modes of a $D$-dimensional Schwarzshild black hole. It proves out that the real parts of the complex quasinormal modes, representing the real oscillation frequencies, are proportional to the product of the number of dimensions and inverse horizon radius $\sim D r_{0}^{-1}$. The asymptotic formula for large multipole number $l$ and arbitrary $D$ is derived. In addition the WKB formula for computing QN modes, developed to the 3rd order beyond the eikonal approximation, is extended to the 6th order here. This gives us an accurate and economic way to compute quasinormal frequencies.
