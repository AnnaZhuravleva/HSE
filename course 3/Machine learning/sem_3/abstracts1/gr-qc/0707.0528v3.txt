Based on the asymptotic analysis of ordinary differential equations, we classify all spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the Einstein equations which are asymptotically Friedmann at large distances and contain a perfect fluid with equation of state $p=(\gamma -1)\mu$ with $0<\gamma<2/3$. This corresponds to a ``dark energy'' fluid and the Friedmann solution is accelerated in this case due to anti-gravity. This extends the previous analysis of spherically symmetric self-similar solutions for fluids with positive pressure ($\gamma>1$). However, in the latter case there is an additional parameter associated with the weak discontinuity at the sonic point and the solutions are only asymptotically ``quasi-Friedmann'', in the sense that they exhibit an angle deficit at large distances. In the $0<\gamma<2/3$ case, there is no sonic point and there exists a one-parameter family of solutions which are {\it genuinely} asymptotically Friedmann at large distances. We find eight classes of asymptotic behavior: Friedmann or quasi-Friedmann or quasi-static or constant-velocity at large distances, quasi-Friedmann or positive-mass singular or negative-mass singular at small distances, and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs at intermediate distances. The self-similar asymptotically quasi-static and quasi-Kantowski-Sachs solutions are analytically extendible and of great cosmological interest. We also investigate their conformal diagrams. The results of the present analysis are utilized in an accompanying paper to obtain and physically interpret numerical solutions.
