We consider a quantum circuit model describing the evaporation process of black holes. We specifically examine the behavior of the multipartite entanglement represented by this model, and find that the entanglement structure depends on the black hole mass $M$ and the frequency of the Hawking radiation $\omega$. For sufficiently small values of $M\omega$, the black hole and the radiation system becomes a separable state after the Page time and a firewall-like structure appears. On the contrary, for larger values of $M\omega$, the entanglement between the black hole and the radiation is not lost. These behaviors imply that owing to the monogamy property of the multipartite entanglement, low frequency modes of the Hawking radiation destroys the quantum correlation between the black hole and the emitted Hawking radiation.
