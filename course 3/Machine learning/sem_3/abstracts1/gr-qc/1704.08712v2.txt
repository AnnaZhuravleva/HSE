Exact solutions construction in scalar fields cosmology is of growing interest. In this work we review the results which obtained with the help of one of the most effective method. Namely, the method of generating functions for exact solutions construction in the scalar field cosmology. We also included into debate the superpotential method which may be considered as the bridge to slow roll approximation equations. Basing on the review, we suggested classification for the generating functions and found connection for all of them with the superpotential.
