We systematically examine the compactness of neutron stars as Tolman VII solutions in scalar-tensor theory of gravity. As a result, when the coupling constant is confined to values provided by astronomical observations we show that the maximum compactness of neutron stars in general relativity is higher than that in scalar-tensor gravity. In addition, we show that although ultra-compact stars, with radius smaller than the Regge-Wheeler potential peak, can exist in general relativity (e.g., Tolman VII solution), their scalarized counterparts cannot {be constructed} even in the limiting case of uniform density stars.
