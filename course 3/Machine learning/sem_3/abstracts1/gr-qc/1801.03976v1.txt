In the external field approximation (EFA) gravity and inertia are represented by a two-point vector that is the byproduct of symmetry breaking. The vector is accompanied by the appearance of classical, vortical structures. Its interaction range is, in general, that of the metric tensor, but, in the context of a simple symmetry breaking model, the range can be made finite by the presence of massive scalar particles. Vortices can then be produced that conceal matter making it effectively "dark". In EFA fermion relativistic vortices can be induced, in particular, by rotation.
