The propagators of the Dirac fermions are studied on both the configuration and momentum representations on the expanding portion of the (1+3)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime considering a fixed vacuum of Bunch-Davies type. In the configuration representation the method of Koksma and Prokopec [J. F. Koksma and T. Prokopec, Class. Quant. Grav. {\bf 26}, 125003 (2009)] is applied recovering thus the form of the propagators in the massive case but obtaining a different result for the left-handed massless fermions. The principal new result reported here is the integral representation of the Feynman propagators of the massive and left-handed massless Dirac fields one needs for calculating the Feynman diagrams of our de Sitter QED in Coulomb gauge [I.I. Cotaescu and C. Crucean Phys. Rev. D. {\bf 87}, 044016 (2013)] or of a larger QFT.
