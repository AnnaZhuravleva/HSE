Recent results based on renormalization group approaches to Quantum Gravity suggest that the Newton's and cosmological constants should be treated as dynamical variables whose evolution depend on the characteristic energy scale of the system. An open question is how to embed this modified Einstein's theory in the Dirac constrained dynamics. In this work, the Hamiltonian formalism for a renormalization-group scale dependent Einstein-Hilbert action is discussed paying particular attention to Dirac's constraint analysis. It is shown that the algebra of the Dirac's constraints, in some cases, is closed. Applications to the physics of the Early Universe are explicitly discussed assuming the framework of Asymptotic Safety. In particular, it is shown that in the minisuperspace with FLRW metric, RG-improved Friedmann equations have bouncing and emergent Universes solutions also for flat and negative curvature.
