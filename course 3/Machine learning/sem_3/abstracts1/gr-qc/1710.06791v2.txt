The paper deals with an extensive study of null and timelike geodesics in the background of wormhole geometries. Starting with a spherically symmetric spacetime, null geodesics are analyzed for the Morris-Thorne wormhole(WH) and photon spheres are examined in WH geometries. Both bounded and unbounded orbits are discussed for timelike geodesics. A similar analysis has been done for trajectories in a dynamic spherically symmetric WH and for a rotating WH. Finally, the invariant angle method of Rindler and Ishak has been used to calculate the angle between radial and tangential vectors at any point on the photon's trajectory.
