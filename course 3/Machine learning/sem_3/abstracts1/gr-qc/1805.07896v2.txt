The theory of Ratio Gravity (RG) proposes that the curvature of 3+1 spacetime originates from a deformation of a Cross Ratio, where similar mathematical structure to general relativity emerges. This paper studies RG using the framework of the Newman-Penrose spin formalism. After proposing the general formalism, we move on to study a homogeneous and isotropic universe with RG. It is noted that the theory contains a component of dynamical dark energy with novel equation of state.
