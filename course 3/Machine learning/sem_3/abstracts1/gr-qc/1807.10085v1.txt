The Wigner rotations arising from the combination of boosts along two different directions are rederived from a relative boost point of view and applied to gyroscope spin precession along timelike geodesics in a Kerr spacetime, clarifying the geometrical properties of Marck's recipe for describing parallel transport along such world lines expressed in terms of the constants of the motion. His final angular velocity isolates the cumulative spin precession angular velocity independent of the spacetime tilting required to keep the spin 4-vector orthogonal to the gyro 4-velocity. As an explicit example the cumulative precession effects are computed for a test gyroscope moving along both bound and unbound equatorial plane geodesic orbits.
