In order to study if the anisotropy of the spacetime may induce differences in the cosmic shear or in deceleration parameter we investigate in Bianchi I Universe the most general expression for the cosmic shear and we study the connections between deceleration parameter and cosmic shear. We also consider a shear parametric approach to measure the transition from decelerating to an accelerating Universe. We also study the connection between jerk parameter and ellipsoidal Universe.
