Within the framework of the Einstein's standard equations of the general theory of relativity, flat galactic rotational curves of galaxies cannot be explained without hypothesis attracting the dark matter, the particles of which had not yet been identified. The vacuum central-symmetric solution of the equations of conformal gravitation is well known as metrics of Mannheim-Kazanas, on the basis of which these curves receive purely geometrical explanation. We show in our work that the metrics of Mannheim-Kazanas is the solution of not only Bach equations received from conformal-invariant Weyl Lagrangian, but also the solution of equations of the conformal geometrodynamics at a nonzero vector of Weyl. In this connection the hypothesis is formulated that the space on galactic scales can be described not only by Riemannian geometry, but with geometry of Weyl.
