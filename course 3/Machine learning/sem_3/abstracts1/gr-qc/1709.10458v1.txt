We investigate a class of cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous $\Lambda$-dust spacetimes which have a regular axis and some zero expansion component. For $\Lambda\ne 0$, we obtain new exact solutions to the Einstein equations and show that they are unique, within that class. For $\Lambda=0$, we recover the Senovilla-Vera metric and show that it can be locally matched to an Einstein-Rosen type of exterior. Finally, we explore some consequences of the matching, such as trapped surface formation and gravitational radiation in the exterior.
