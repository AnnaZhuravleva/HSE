A new approximate metric representing the spacetime of a rotating deformed body is obtained by perturbing the Kerr metric to include til the second order of the quadrupole moment. It has a simple form, because is Kerr-like. Its Taylor expansion form coincides with second order quadrupole metrics with slow rotation already found. Moreover, it can be transformed to an improved Hartle-Thorne metric, this guarantees its validity to be useful in studying compact object, and that it is possible to find an inner solution.
