We consider the most general renormalizable theory of propagating torsion in Einstein gravity for the Dirac matter distribution and we demonstrate that in this case torsion is a massive axial-vector field whose coupling to the spinor gives rise to conditions in terms of which gravitational singularities are not bound to form; we discuss how our results improve those that are presented in the existing literature, and that no further improvement can be achieved unless one is ready to re-evaluate some considerations on the renormalizability of the theory.
