In the Entropic Dynamics framework quantum theory is derived as an application of the method of maximum entropy. In previous work the entropic dynamics of relativistic quantum scalar fields was formulated in the Schroedinger functional representation in which the Lorentz symmetry is not manifest. Here the formalism is extended to curved spacetimes. We develop a manifestly covariant approach inspired by the Hamiltonian methods of Dirac, Kuchar, and Teitelboim. The key ingredient is the adoption of a local notion of entropic time in which instants are defined on curved three-dimensional surfaces and time evolution consists of the accumulation of changes induced by local deformations of these surfaces.
