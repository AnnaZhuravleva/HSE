The cosmological constant sets certain scales important in cosmology. We show that Lambda in conjunction with other parameters like the Schwarzschild radius leads to scales relevant not only for cosmological but also for astrophysical applications. Of special interest is the extension of orbits and velocity of test particles traveling over Mpc distances. We will show that there exists a lower and an upper cut-off on the possible velocities of test particles. For a test body moving in a central gravitational field Lambda enforces a maximal value of the angular momentum if we insist on bound orbits of the test body which move at a distance larger than the Schwarzschild radius.
