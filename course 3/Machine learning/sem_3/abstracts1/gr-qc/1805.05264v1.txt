The quantum fluctuations of the geodesic deviation equation in a flat background spacetime are discussed. We calculate the resulting mean squared fluctuations in the relative velocity and separation of test particles. The effect of these quantum fluctuations of the spacetime geometry is given in terms of the Riemann tensor correlation function. Three different sources of the Riemann tensor fluctuations are considered: a thermal bath of gravitons, gravitons in a squeezed state, and the graviton vacuum state.
