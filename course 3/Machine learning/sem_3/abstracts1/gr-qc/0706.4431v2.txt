Loop Quantum Cosmology strongly modifies the high-energy dynamics of Friedman-Robertson-Walker models and removes the big-bang singularity. We investigate how LQC corrections affect the stability properties of the Einstein static universe. In General Relativity, the Einstein static model with positive cosmological constant Lambda is unstable to homogeneous perturbations. We show that LQC modifications can lead to a centre of stability for a large enough positive value of Lambda.
