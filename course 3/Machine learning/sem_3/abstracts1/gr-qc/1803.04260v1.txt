We present a procedure to build a single time model for the equations of motion of relativistic retarded systems composed of several particles; at any desired level of accuracy. We treat the especial case of a binary system.   We apply this model to the classical electromagnetic binary particle system.   We mentioned some differences with previous approaches and discussed the implications for linear gravitational models.
