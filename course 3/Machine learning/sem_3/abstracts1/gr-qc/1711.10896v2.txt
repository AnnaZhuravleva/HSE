We establish the existence of $1$-parameter families of $\epsilon$-dependent solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations with a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda >0$ and a linear equation of state $p=\epsilon^2 K \rho$, $0<K\leq 1/3$, for the parameter values $0<\epsilon < \epsilon_0$. These solutions exist globally on the manifold $M=(0,1]\times \mathbb{R}^3$, are future complete, and converge as $\epsilon \searrow 0$ to solutions of the cosmological Poisson-Euler equations. They represent inhomogeneous, nonlinear perturbations of a FLRW fluid solution where the inhomogeneities are driven by localized matter fluctuations that evolve to good approximation according to Newtonian gravity.
