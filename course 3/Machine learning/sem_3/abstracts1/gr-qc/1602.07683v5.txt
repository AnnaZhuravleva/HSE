A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type I universe is studied with the interacting holographic and new agegraphic scalar fields models of dark energy. Given, the f framework of the anisotropic model, both the dynamics and potential of these scalar field models according to the evolutionary behavior of both dark energy models are reconstructed. We also investigate the cosmological evolution of interacting dark energy models, and compare it with observational data and schematic diagram. In order to do so, we focus on observational determinations of the expansion history $H(z)$. Next, we evaluate effects of anisotropy on various topics, such as evolution of the growth of perturbations in the linear regime, statefinder diagnostic, Sandage-Loeb (SL) test and distance modulus from holographic and new agegraphic dark energy models and compare the results with standard FRW and $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models. Our numerical result show the effects of the interaction and anisotropy on the evolutionary behavior the new agegraphic scalar field models.
