We study relativistic stars in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories that evade the constraint on the speed of gravitational waves imposed by GW170817. It is shown that the exterior metric is given by the usual Schwarzschild solution if the lower order Horndeski terms are ignored in the Lagrangian and a shift symmetry is assumed. However, this class of theories exhibits partial breaking of Vainshtein screening in the stellar interior and thus modifies the structure of a star. Employing a simple concrete model, we show that for high-density stars the mass-radius relation is altered significantly even if the parameters are chosen so that only a tiny correction is expected in the Newtonian regime. We also find that, depending on the parameters, there is a maximum central density above which solutions cease to exist.
