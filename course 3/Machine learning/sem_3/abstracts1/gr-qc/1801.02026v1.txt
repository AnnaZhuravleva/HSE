We studied the thermodynamics and spectroscopy of a $4$-dimensional, $z=0$ Lifshitz black hole ($Z0$LBH). Using the Wald's entropy formula and the Hawking temperature, we derived the quasilocal mass of the $Z0$LBH. Based on the exact solution to the near-horizon Zerilli equation of the massive scalar waves, we computed the quasinormal modes of the $Z0$LBH via employing the adiabatic invariant quantity for the $Z0$LBH. This study shows that the entropy and area spectra of the $Z0$LBH are equally spaced.
