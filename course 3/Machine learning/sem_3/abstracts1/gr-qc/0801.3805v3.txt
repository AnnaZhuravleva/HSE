This is a study of the scattering and absorption of planar gravitational waves by a Kerr black hole in vacuum. We apply the partial wave method to compute cross sections for the special case of radiation incident along the rotation axis. A catalogue of numerically-accurate cross sections is presented, for a range of incident wavelengths $M\omega \le 4$ and rotation rates $a \le 0.999M$. Three effects are studied in detail: polarization, helicity-reversal and glory scattering. First, a new approximation to the polarization in the long-wavelength limit is derived. We show that black hole rotation distinguishes between co- and counter-rotating wave helicities, leading to a term in the cross section proportional to $a\omega$. Second, we confirm that helicity is not conserved by the scattering process, and show that superradiance amplifies the effect. For certain wavelengths, the back-scattered flux is enhanced by as much as $\sim 35$ times for a rapidly-rotating hole (e.g. for $a = 0.999M$ at $M\omega = 0.945$). Third, we observe regular glory and spiral scattering peaks in the numerically-determined cross sections. We show that the angular width and intensity of the peaks may be estimated via a semi-classical approximation. We conclude with a discussion of the observable implications of our results.
