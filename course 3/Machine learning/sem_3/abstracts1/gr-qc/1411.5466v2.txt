Quantum gravity may shed light on the prehistory of the universe. Quantum corrections to gravity affect the dynamics of the expansion of the universe. Their influence is studied on the example of the exactly solvable quantum model. The corrections to the energy density and pressure lead to the emergence of an additional attraction (like dark matter) or repulsion (like dark energy) in the quantum system of the gravitating matter and radiation. The model explains the accelerating expansion (inflation) in the early universe (the domain of comparatively small values of quantum numbers) and a later transition from the decelerating expansion to the accelerating expansion of the universe (the domain of the very large values of quantum numbers) from a single approach. The generation of primordial fluctuations of the energy density at the expense of the change of sign of the quantum correction to the pressure is discussed.
