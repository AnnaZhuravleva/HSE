We show that the coupled two-fluid gravitating system (e.g. stiff matter and 'vacuum energy') could trap nonlinear gravitational waves (e.g. Einstein-Rosen waves). The gravitational wave amplitude varies harmonically in time transferring the energy coherently to the stiff matter wave, and then the process goes to the backward direction. This process mimics the behaviour of trapped electromagnetic waves in two-level media. We have defined the limits for the frequency of this energy transfer oscillations.
