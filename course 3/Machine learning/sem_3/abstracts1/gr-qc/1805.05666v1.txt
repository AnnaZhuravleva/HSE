We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I model in the presence of stiff matter, an ultrarelativistic component and a small negative cosmological constant. We quantize this model in the framework of the polymer quantum mechanics, in order to introduce cut-off features in the minisuperspace dynamics.   We then apply to the polymer Wheeler-DeWitt equation, emerging from the Dirac constraint, an adiabatic approximation a la Vilenkin, which treats the Universe volume as a quasi-classical variable, becoming de facto the dynamical clock for the pure quantum degrees of freedom, here identified in the Universe anisotropies.   The main issue of the present analysis consists of determining a cyclical evolution for the Bianchi I model, oscillating between the Big-Bounce induced by the cut-off physics and the turning point due to the small cosmological constant. Furthermore, the mean value of the Universe anisotropy variables remains finite during the whole evolution, including the phase across the Big-Bounce. Such a feature, according to a suitable choice of the initial conditions makes the present cosmological paradigm, a viable scenario for the description of a possible primordial and late phases of the actual Universe.
