For a particle in linear acceleration, the up and down transition probabilities between its excited state and ground state is found to meet the fluctuation theorem. If the external force is absent, the up transition, an entropy reduction process, will be inhibited by the principle of entropy increase. As a result, the particle will tend to be in the ground state and maintain an inertial motion. In other word, the inertia principle is a result of the second law of thermodynamics. This implies that a particle in inertial motion or free fall motion is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its local spacetime.
