We discuss the interpretation of the angles in the Geodesic Light-Cone (GLC) coordinates. In particular, we clarify the way in which these angles can be identified with the observed ones. We show that, although this identification is always possible in principle, one cannot implement it in the usual gauge-fixing way, i.e. through a set of conditions on the GLC metric. Rather, one needs to invoke a tetrad at the observer and a Cartesian-like coordinate system in order to obtain the desired map globally on the observed sky.
