We report a method of solving for canonical scalar field exact solution in a non-flat FLRW universe with barotropic fluid using non-linear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS)-type formulation in comparison to the method in the standard Friedmann framework. We consider phantom and non-phantom scalar field cases with exponential and power-law accelerating expansion. Analysis on effective equation of state to both cases of expansion is also performed. We speculate and comment on some advantage and disadvantage of using the NLS formulation in solving for the exact solution.
