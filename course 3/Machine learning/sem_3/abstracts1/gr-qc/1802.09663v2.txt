Given an initial-boundary value problem for an anti-de Sitter-like spacetime, we analyse conditions on the conformal boundary ensuring the existence of Killing vectors in the spacetime arising from this problem. This analysis makes use of a system of conformal wave equations describing the propagation of the Killing equation first considered by Paetz. We identify an obstruction tensor constructed from Killing vector candidate and the Cotton tensor of the conformal boundary whose vanishing is a necessary condition for the existence of Killing vectors in the spacetime. This obstruction tensor vanishes if the conformal boundary is conformally flat.
