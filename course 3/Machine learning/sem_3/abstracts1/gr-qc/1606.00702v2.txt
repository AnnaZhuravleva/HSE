In the framework of Brans-Dicke theory, a cosmological model has been formulated by considering an inter-conversion between matter and dark energy in a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe in the era of pressureless dust. A function of time f(t) has been incorporated into the expression of the density of matter to account for the non-conservation of the matter content of the universe. This function is proportional to the matter content of the universe. Its functional form has been determined from the field equations by using empirical expressions of the scale factor and the scalar field. This scale factor has been chosen to generate a signature flip of the deceleration parameter with time. The function f(t) has been found to decrease with time monotonically, indicating a conversion of matter into dark energy. This study enabled us to derive the expressions of the proportions of matter and dark energy of the universe. Dependence of various cosmological parameters upon the matter content has been explored. The interaction term between matter and dark energy has been calculated and f(t) has been expressed as a function of this term. The dependence of the equation-of-state (EoS) parameter for dark energy upon f(t) has been determined.
