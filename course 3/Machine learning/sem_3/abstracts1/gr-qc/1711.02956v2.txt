The geodesics on the $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime are considered studying how their parameters are determined by the conserved quantities in the conformal Euclidean, Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker, de Sitter-Painlev\'e and static local charts with Cartesian space coordinates. Moreover, it is shown that there exist a special static chart in which the geodesics are genuine hyperbolas whose asymptotes are given by the conserved momentum and the associated dual momentum.
