I point out a simple expression for the "Hubble" parameter $H$ defined by Borde, Guth and Vilenkin (BGV) in their proof of past incompleteness of inflationary spacetimes. I show that $H$ is equal to the fractional rate of change of the magnitude of the Jacobi field $\xi^i$ of the congruence $u^i$ used by BGV, measured along the points of intersection of an arbitrary observer $O$ with $u^i$.
