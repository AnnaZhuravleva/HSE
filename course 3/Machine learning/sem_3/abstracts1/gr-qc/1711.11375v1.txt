In this work we analyse the similarities and differences between the equations of motion for the center of mass and intrinsic angular momentum for isolated sources of gravitational radiation obtained by two different formulations. One approach is based on the asymptotic formulation of the GR whereas the other relies on Post- Newtonian methods. Several conclusions are obtained which could be useful for further developments in both approaches.
