In this work we show that single horizon black hole behaves as a "laser". It is in many aspects conceptually analogous to Corley and Jacobson work on the two horizon black hole "laser". We started by proposition that circumference of the black hole horizon holds the natural (integer) quantum number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length of some boson systems in great canonical ensemble. For macroscopic black hole ground state is practically totally occupied while other states are practically totally unoccupied which is a typical Bose condensation. Number of the systems in this condensate represents black hole entropy. For microscopic black hole few lowest energy levels are occupied with almost equivalent population (with negative chemical potential) while all other energy states (with positive chemical potential) are practically unoccupied. It implies that here not only spontaneous but also stimulated emission of radiation comparable with spontaneous emission occurs. By Hawking evaporation any macroscopic black hole turns out in a microscopic black hole that yields, in a significant degree, coherent stimulated emission of the radiation. It implies that by total black hole evaporation there is no decoherence, i.e. information loss. Finally, a mass duality characteristic for suggested black hole model corresponding to string T-duality is discussed.
