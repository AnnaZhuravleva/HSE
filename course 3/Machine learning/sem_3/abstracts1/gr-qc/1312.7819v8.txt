We find new classes of exact solutions of the initial momentum constraint for vacuum Einstein's equations. Considered data are either invariant under a continuous symmetry or they are assumed to have the exterior curvature tensor of a simple form. In general the mean curvature $H$ is non-constant and $g$ is not conformally flat. In the generic case with the symmetry we obtain general solution in an explicit form. In other cases solutions are given up to quadrature. We also find a class of explicit solutions without symmetries which generalizes data induced by the Kerr metric or other metrics related to the Ernst equation. The conformal method of Lichnerowicz, Choquet-Bruhat and York is used to prove solvability of the Hamiltonian constraint if $H$ vanishes. Existence of marginally outer trapped surfaces in initial manifold is discussed.
