We show initial data for gravitational axial waves, that are twice differentiable but which are not $C^{2}$. They generate wave pulses that interact with matter in the radiation cosmological era. This forces the radiation matter to rotate. This rotation is permanent - it persists after the passage of the gravitational pulse. The observed inhomogeneities of the cosmic microwave background radiation put a bound onto discontinuities of superhorizon metric perturbations. We explicitly show that a class of smooth initial metrics that are at least $C^{2}$ gives rise to gravitational wave pulses that do not interact with the background during the radiation epoch.
