Recently observations of Gravitational Waves (GW) generated by black-hole collisions have opened a new window to explore the universe in diverse scales. It is expected that in the following years be possible the detection of primordial gravitational waves. However this formalism is developed for weak gravitational waves, when the dynamics of the waves can be linearized. In this work we develop a non-perturbative formalism to describe GW using the Unified Spinor Fields (USF) theory. The tensor index is calculated and we obtain that this must be $n_T=0$ in order to the $+$ and $\times$ polarisations modes can take the same spectrum. This impose some restriction on the constant of self-interaction $\xi$ of the fermionic source. We obtain that the amplitude of the signals today must be $\sim 10^{-112}$ times more weak than the amplitude generated during inflation, which is of the order of $\left.\Delta_{GW}\right|_{Infl} \simeq 10^{-11}$.
