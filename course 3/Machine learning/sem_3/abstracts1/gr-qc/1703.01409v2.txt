We investigate the observational signatures of quantum cosmology in the Cosmic Microwave Background data provided by Planck collaboration. We apply the warm inflationary paradigm with a tachyon scalar field to the loop quantum cosmology. In this context, we first provide the basic cosmological functions in terms of the tachyon field. We then obtain the slow-roll parameters and the power spectrum of scalar and tensor fluctuations respectively. Finally, we study the performance of various warm inflationary scenarios against the latest Planck data and we find a family of models which are in agreement with the observations.
