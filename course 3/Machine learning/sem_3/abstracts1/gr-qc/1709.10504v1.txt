In this work we examine what are the cosmological implications of allowing the geometrical curvature density to behave independently from the energy density contents. Using the full data extracted by Planck mission from CMB, combined with BAO and SNIa measurements, we derive, in the light of this approach, new constraints on the cosmological parameters. In particular we determine the behavior of the curvature dark energy degeneracy when allowing a varying equation of state for the latter. We also examine whether this approach could bridge the gap recently found between the Hubble parameter value determined from CMB and that from the local universe measurements
