The hypothesis that dark matter is converted into visible particles in active galactic nuclei is investigated. If dark matter consists of stable superheavy neutral particles and active galactic nuclei are rotating black holes, then, due to the Penrose process, superheavy particles can decay into unstable particles with larger mass, whose decay into quarks and leptons leads to events in cosmic rays observed by the Auger group. Similar processes of decay of superheavy particles of dark matter into visible matter occurred in the early Universe. Numerical estimates of the processes in active galactic nuclei and in the early Universe are given.
