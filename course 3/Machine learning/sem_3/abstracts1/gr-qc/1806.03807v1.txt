We derive the full set of field equations based on Hossenfelder's recent covariant formulation of the emergent gravity model, along with an exact solution. The solution describes a static, spherically-symmetric spacetime with a non-trivial vector field which plays the role of dark matter under the emergent gravity paradigm. Equations of motion of relativistic test masses are derived and are shown to reduce to Modified Newtonian Dynamics with additional relativistic corrections. It is also shown that the presence of the vector field gives an additional positive contribution to the bending angle in the deflection of light.
