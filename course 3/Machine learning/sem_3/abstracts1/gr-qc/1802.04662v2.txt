We present a regularisation approach to the study of the quantum dynamics of the Mixmaster universe which allows to approximate the anisotropy potential with the explicitly integrable periodic 3-particle Toda system. This approach is based on a covariant Weyl-Heisenberg integral quantization. Such a procedure naturally amplifies the dynamical role of the underlying Toda system by smoothing out the three canyons of the anisotropy potential. Since the respective eigenfunctions can be explicitly constructed, our finding paves the way to a novel perturbative approach to the quantum Mixmaster dynamics.
