Synchronization of finite spike sequences is the way two brain regions compare their content and extract the most suitable sequence. This is the core of the linguistic comparison between a word and a previous one retrieved by memory. Classifying the information content of neural spike trains, an uncertainty relation emerges between the bit size of a word and its duration. This uncertainty affects the task of synchronizing spike trains of different duration representing different words, entailing the occurrence of entangled sequences, so that word comparison amounts to a measurement based quantum computation. Entanglement explains the inverse Bayes inference that connects different words in a linguistic search. The behaviour here discussed provides an explanation for other reported evidences of quantum effects in human cognitive processes lacking a plausible framework, since either no assignment of an appropriate quantum constant had been associated, or speculating on microscopic processes dependent on Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic de-coherence times.
