In quantum physics there are well-known situations when measurements of the same property in different contexts (under different conditions) have the same probability distribution, but cannot be represented by one and the same random variable. Such systems of random variables are called contextual. More generally, true contextuality is observed when different contexts force measurements of the same property (in psychology, responses to the same question) to be more dissimilar random variables than warranted by the difference of their distributions. The difference in distributions is itself a form of context-dependence, but of another nature: it is attributable to direct causal influences exerted by contexts upon the random variables. We present a series of crowdsourcing experiments that reveal true contextuality in human decision making. Their analysis is based on the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory, one that allows one to separate true contextuality from direct influences in the overall context-dependence. The design of our experiments is an elaboration of one introduced in the "Snow Queen" experiment (Decision 5, 193-204, 2018), where contextuality was for the first time demonstrated unequivocally. The CbD analysis of many previous attempts to demonstrate contextuality in human judgments shows that they were unsuccessful because direct influences in them were all one needed to account for context-dependence.
