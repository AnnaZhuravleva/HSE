Quantum Cognition has delivered a number of models for semantic memory, but to date these have tended to assume pure states and projective measurement. Here we relax these assumptions. A quantum inspired model of human word association experiments will be extended using a density matrix representation of human memory and a POVM based upon non-ideal measurements. Our formulation allows for a consideration of key terms like measurement and contextuality within a rigorous modern approach. This approach both provides new conceptual advances and suggests new experimental protocols.
