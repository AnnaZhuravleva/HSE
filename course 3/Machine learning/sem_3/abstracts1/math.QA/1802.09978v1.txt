We give a combinatorial model for r-spin surfaces with parametrised boundary based on Novak (2015). The r-spin structure is encoded in terms of $\mathbb{Z}_r$-valued indices assigned to the edges of a polygonal decomposition. With the help of this model we count the number of mapping class group orbits on r-spin surfaces with parametrised boundary and fixed r-spin structure on each boundary component, extending (and giving a different proof of) results in Geiges, Gonzalo (2012) and Randal-Williams (2014).   We use the combinatorial model to give a state sum construction of two-dimensional topological field theories on r-spin surfaces. We show that an example of such a topological field theory computes the Arf-invariant of an r-spin surface as introduced in Geiges, Gonzalo and Randal-Williams. This implies in particular that the r-spin Arf-invariant is constant on orbits of the mapping class group, providing an alternative proof of that fact.
