In our earlier article [Lett. Math. Phys. 107 (2017), 475-503, arXiv:1409.8188], we explicitly described a topological Hopf algebroid playing the role of the noncommutative phase space of Lie algebra type. Ping Xu has shown that every deformation quantization leads to a Drinfeld twist of the associative bialgebroid of h-adic series of differential operators on a fixed Poisson manifold. In the case of linear Poisson structures, the twisted bialgebroid essentially coincides with our construction. Using our explicit description of the Hopf algebroid, we compute the corresponding Drinfeld twist explicitly as a product of two exponential expressions.
