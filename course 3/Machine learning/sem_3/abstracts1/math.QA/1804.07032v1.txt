We present examples of noncommutative four-spheres that are base spaces of $SU(2)$-principal bundles with noncommutative seven-spheres as total spaces. The noncommutative coordinate algebras of the four-spheres are generated by the entries of a projection which is invariant under the action of $SU(2)$. We give conditions for the components of the Connes--Chern character of the projection to vanish but the second (the top) one. The latter is then a non zero Hochschild cycle that plays the role of the volume form for the noncommutative four-spheres.
