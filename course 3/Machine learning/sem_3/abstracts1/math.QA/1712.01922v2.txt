We present a model-independent study of boundary states in the Cardy case that covers all conformal field theories for which the representation category of the chiral algebra is a - not necessarily semisimple - modular tensor category. This class, which we call finite CFTs, includes all rational theories, but goes much beyond these, and in particular comprises many logarithmic conformal field theories.   We show that the following two postulates for a Cardy case are compatible beyond rational CFT and lead to a universal description of boundary states that realizes a standard mathematical setup: First, for bulk fields, the pairing of left and right movers is given by (a coend involving) charge conjugation; and second, the boundary conditions are given by the objects of the category of chiral data. For rational theories our proposal reproduces the familiar result for the boundary states of the Cardy case. Further, with the help of sewing we compute annulus amplitudes. Our results show in particular that these possess an interpretation as partition functions, a constraint that for generic finite CFTs is much more restrictive than for rational ones.
