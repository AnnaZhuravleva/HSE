We study embeddings of the simple admissible affine vertex algebras $V_k(sl(2))$ and $V_k(osp(1,2))$, $k \notin {\Bbb Z}_{\ge 0}$, into the tensor product of rational Virasoro and $N=1$ Neveu-Schwarz vertex algebra with lattice vertex algebras.   We prove that the admissible affine vertex algebra $V_k(sl(2))$ can be embedded into vertex algebra $L^{Vir} (c_{p,p'}, 0) \otimes \Pi(0)$ where   $L^{Vir} (c_{p,p'}, 0) $ is suitable minimal Virasoro vertex algebra and $\Pi(0)$ is a vertex algebra of lattice type.   By using these realizations we construct a family of weight, logarithmic and Whittaker $\widehat{sl(2)}$ and $\widehat{osp(1,2)}$--modules. As an application, we construct all irreducible degenerate Whittaker modules for $V_k(sl(2))$.
