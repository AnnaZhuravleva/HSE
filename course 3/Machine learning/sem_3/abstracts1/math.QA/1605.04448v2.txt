We point out that results of Shimizu on internal characters imply a useful non-semisimple variant of the categorical Verlinde formula for factorisable finite tensor categories. When combined with results on pseudo-trace functions by Miyamoto and Arike-Nagatomo, one can make a precise conjecture for a non-semisimple modular Verlinde formula which relates modular properties of pseudo-trace functions and the product in the Grothendieck ring of the corresponding vertex operator algebra.
