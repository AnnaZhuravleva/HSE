We introduce a family of factorisable ribbon quasi-Hopf algebras $Q(N)$ for $N$ a positive integer: as an algebra, $Q(N)$ is the semidirect product of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{Z}_2$ with the direct sum of a Grassmann and a Clifford algebra in $2N$ generators. We show that $Rep Q(N)$ is ribbon equivalent to the symplectic fermion category $SF(N)$ that was computed by the third author from conformal blocks of the corresponding logarithmic conformal field theory. The latter category in turn is conjecturally ribbon equivalent to representations of $V_{ev}$, the even part of the symplectic fermion vertex operator super algebra.   Using the formalism developed in our previous paper we compute the projective $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-action on the centre of $Q(N)$ as obtained from Lyubashenko's general theory of mapping class group actions for factorisable finite ribbon categories. This allows us to test a conjectural non-semisimple version of the modular Verlinde formula: we verify that the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-action computed from $Q(N)$ agrees projectively with that on pseudo trace functions of $V_{ev}$.
