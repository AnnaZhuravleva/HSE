Kitaev's model [1,2] is usually defined in terms of the Drinfeld double. We propose a new version defined in terms of the mirror bicrossproduct quantum group [3]. By some aspects, even though the bicrossproduct quantum group is more complicated than the Drinfeld double, the construction of the new model is actually simpler and relies on the use of a covariant system. We also provide the definition of the ground state of the new Hamiltonian in terms of a tensor network representation.
