We introduce the notion of \emph{almost commutative Q-algebras} and demonstrate how the derived bracket formalism of Kosmann-Schwarzbach generalises to this setting. In particular, we construct `almost commutative Lie algebroids' following Va\u{\i}ntrob's Q-manifold understanding of classical Lie algebroids. We show that the basic tenets of the theory of Lie algebroids carry over verbatim to the almost commutative world.
