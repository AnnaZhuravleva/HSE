We first show that hypergeometric functions appear naturally as spectral functions when applying pseudo-differential calculus to decipher heat kernel asymptotic in the situation where the symbol algebra is noncommutative. Such observation leads to a unified (works for arbitrary dimension) method of computing the modular curvature on toric noncommutative manifolds. We show that the spectral functions that define the quantum part of the curvature have closed forms in terms of hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we are able to obtained explicit expressions (as functions in the dimension parameter) for those spectral functions without using symbolic integration. A surprising geometric consequence is that the functional relations coming from the variation of the associated Einstein-Hilbert action still hold when the dimension parameter takes real values.
