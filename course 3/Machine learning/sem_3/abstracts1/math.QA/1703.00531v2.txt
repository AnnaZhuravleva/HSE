This paper is a continuation of arXiv:1405.1707. We present certain new applications and generalizations of the free field realization of the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra ${\mathcal H}$ at level zero.   We find explicit formulas for singular vectors in certain Verma modules. A free field realization of self-dual modules for ${\mathcal H}$ is presented by combining a bosonic construction of Whittaker modules from arXiv:1409.5354 with a construction of logarithmic modules for vertex algebras. As an application, we prove that there exists a non-split self-extension of irreducible self-dual module which is a logarithmic module of rank two.   We construct a large family of logarithmic modules containing different types of highest weight modules as subquotients. We believe that these logarithmic modules are related with projective covers of irreducible modules in a suitable category of ${\mathcal H}$-modules.
