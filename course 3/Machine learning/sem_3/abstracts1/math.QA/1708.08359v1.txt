Orbifold equivalence is a notion of symmetry that does not rely on group actions. Among other applications, it leads to surprising connections between hitherto unrelated singularities. While the concept can be defined in a very general category-theoretic language, we focus on the most explicit setting in terms of matrix factorisations, where orbifold equivalences arise from defects with special properties. Examples are relatively difficult to construct, but we uncover some structural features that distinguish orbifold equivalences -- most notably a finite perturbation expansion. We use those properties to devise a search algorithm, then present some new examples including Arnold singularities.
