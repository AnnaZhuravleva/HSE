The smallest known example of a family of modular categories that is not determined by its modular data are the rank 49 categories $\mathcal{Z}(\text{Vec}_G^{\omega})$ for $G=\mathbb{Z}_{11} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{5}$. However, these categories can be distinguished with the addition of a matrix of invariants called the $W$-matrix that contains intrinsic information about punctured $S$-matrices. Here we show that it is a common occurrence for knot and link invariants to carry more information than the modular data. We present the results of a systematic investigation of the invariants for small knots and links. We find many small knots and links that are complete invariants of the $\mathcal{Z}(\text{Vec}_G^{\omega})$ when $G=\mathbb{Z}_{11} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{5}$, including the $5_2$ knot.
