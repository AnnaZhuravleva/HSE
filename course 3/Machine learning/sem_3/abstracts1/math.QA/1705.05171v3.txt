An equivariant topological field theory is defined on a cobordism category of manifolds with principal fiber bundles for a fixed (finite) structure group. We provide a geometric construction which for any given morphism $G \to H$ of finite groups assigns in a functorial way to a $G$-equivariant topological field theory an $H$-equivariant topological field theory, the pushforward theory. When $H$ is the trivial group, this yields an orbifold construction for $G$-equivariant topological field theories which unifies and generalizes several known algebraic notions of orbifoldization.
