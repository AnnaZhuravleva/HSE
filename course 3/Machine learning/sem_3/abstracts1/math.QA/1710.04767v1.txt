Motivated by the study of indecomposable, nonsimple modules for a vertex operator algebra $V$, we study the relationship between various types of $V$-modules and modules for the higher level Zhu's algebras for $V$, denoted $A_n(V)$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We resolve some issues that arise in a few theorems previously presented in the literature, and give examples illustrating the need for certain modifications of previous statements. We establish that whether or not $A_{n-1}(V)$ is isomorphic to a direct summand of $A_n(V)$ affects the types of indecomposable $V$-modules which can be constructed by inducing from an $A_n(V)$-module, and we give some characterizations of the $V$-modules that can be constructed from such inducings. To illustrate these results, we give examples of $A_1(V)$ when $V$ is either the Heisenberg or the Virasoro vertex operator algebra. For these two examples, we show how the structure of $A_1(V)$ in relationship to $A_0(V)$ determines what types of indecomposable $V$-modules can be induced. We construct a family of indecomposable modules for the Virasoro that are logarithmic modules and are not highest weight modules.
