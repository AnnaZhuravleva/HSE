We construct the skein category $\mathcal{S}$ of the annulus and show that it is equivalent to the affine Temperley-Lieb category of Graham and Lehrer. It leads to a skein theoretic description of the extended affine Temperley-Lieb algebras. We construct an endofunctor of $\mathcal{S}$ that corresponds, on the level of tangle diagrams, to the insertion of an arc connecting the inner and outer boundary of the annulus. We use it to define and construct towers of extended affine Temperley-Lieb algebra representations. It allows us to construct a tower of representations acting on spaces of link patterns on the punctured disc which play an important role in the study of loop models. We finally describe this tower in terms of fused extended affine Temperley-Lieb algebra representations.
