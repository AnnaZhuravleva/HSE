We prove that the parallel transport of a flat (higher) gerbe on any given target space gives rise to an extended homotopy quantum field theory. In case the target space is the classifying space of a finite group, we provide explicit formulae for this homotopy quantum field theory in terms of transgression. Moreover, we use the geometric theory of orbifolds to give a dimension-independent version of twisted and equivariant Dijkgraaf-Witten models. Finally, we introduce twisted equivariant Dijkgraaf-Witten theories which in the 3-2-1-dimensional case give us a new class of equivariant modular tensor categories.
