We propose an encoding for topological quantum computing with mapping class group representations, which is obviously not universal without leakage. We are interested in whether or not some generalized version of the Knill-Gottesmann theorem holds for such a quantum computing scheme, and how to make universal gate sets with supplemental primitives. As a first step, we prove that for abelian anyons, all gates from mapping class group representations are generalized Clifford gates, and this theorem does not hold for the Fibonacci anyon.
