An important problem in the theory of cluster algebras is to compute the fundamental group of the exchange graph. A non-trivial closed loop in the exchange graph, for example, generates a non-trivial identity for the classical and quantum dilogarithm functions. An interesting conjecture, partly motivated by dilogarithm functions, is that this fundamental group is generated by closed loops of mutations involving only two of the cluster variables. We present examples and counterexamples for this naive conjecture, and then formulate a better version of the conjecture for acyclic seeds.
