The aim of this paper is to establish the main properties of the loop algebra and of the handle algebra, which are the building blocks of the graph algebras introduced by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus and Buffenoir-Roche in the combinatorial quantization of Chern-Simons theory. Here we assume that the gauge Hopf algebra $H$ is finite-dimensional, factorizable and ribbon, but not necessarily semi-simple. We show how the handle algebra gives rise to a projective representation of the mapping class group of the torus, namely $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, on $\text{SLF}(H)$ (the space of symmetric linear forms on $H$). This projective representation is shown to be equivalent to that found by Lyubaschenko and Majid. We finally apply these results to the case of the restricted quantum group $H = \overline{U}\!_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$. We give explicit formulas for the action of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ on the Arike basis of $\text{SLF}\!\left(\overline{U}\!_q(\mathfrak{sl}(2))\right)$ and determine the structure of the projective representation in this case. This is the first step towards a general theory for surfaces of arbitrary genus.
