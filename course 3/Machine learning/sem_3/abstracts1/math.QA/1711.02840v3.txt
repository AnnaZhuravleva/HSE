Let $V$ be a unitary vertex operator algebra (VOA) satisfying the following conditions: (1) $V$ is of CFT type. (2) Every $\mathbb N$-gradable weak $V$-module is completely reducible. (3) $V$ is $C_2$-cofinite. Let $\mathrm{Rep}^{\mathrm{u}}(V)$ be the category of unitary $V$-modules, and let $\mathcal C$ be a subcategory of $\mathrm{Rep}^\mathrm{u}(V)$ whose objects are closed under taking tensor product. Then $\mathcal C$ is a ribbon fusion category. For any objects $W_i,W_j$ of $\mathcal C$, we define a sesquilinear form on the tensor product $W_i\boxtimes W_j$. We show that if these sesquilinear forms are positive definite (i.e., when they are inner products), then the ribbon fusion category $\mathcal C$ is unitary. We show that if the unitary $V$-modules and a generating set of intertwining operators in $\mathcal C$ satisfy certain energy bounds, then these sesquilinear forms are positive definite. Our result can be applied to the modular tensor categories of unitary Virasoro VOAs, and unitary affine VOAs of type $A_n,D_n,G_2$, and more.
