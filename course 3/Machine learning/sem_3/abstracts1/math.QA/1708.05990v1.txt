We provide a novel and simple description of Schellekens' seventy-one affine Kac-Moody structures of self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 by utilizing cyclic subgroups of the glue codes of the Niemeier lattices with roots. We also discuss a possible uniform construction procedure of the self-dual vertex operator algebras of central charge 24 starting from the Leech lattice. This also allows us to consider the uniqueness question for all non-trivial affine Kac-Moody structures. We finally discuss our description from a Lorentzian viewpoint.
