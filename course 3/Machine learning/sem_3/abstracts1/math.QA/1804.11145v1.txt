We prove the first nontrivial reconstruction theorem for modular tensor categories: the category associated to any twisted Drinfeld double of any finite group, can be realised as the representation category of a completely rational conformal net. We also show that any twisted double of a solvable group is the category of modules of a completely rational vertex operator algebra. In the process of doing this, we identify the 3-cocycle twist for permutation orbifolds of holomorphic conformal nets: unexpectedly, it can be nontrivial, and depends on the value of the central charge modulo 24. In addition, we determine the branching coefficients of all possible local (conformal) extensions of any finite group orbifold of holomorphic conformal nets, and identify their modular tensor categories. All statements also apply to vertex operator algebras, provided the conjecture holds that finite group orbifolds of holomorphic VOAs are rational, with a category of modules given by a twisted group double.
