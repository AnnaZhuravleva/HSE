A bosonization of the quantum affine superalgebra $U_q(\widehat{sl}(M|N))$ is presented for an arbitrary level $k \in {\bf C}$.The Wakimoto realization is given by using $\xi-\eta$ system. The screening operators that commute with $U_q(\widehat{sl}(M|N))$ are presented for the level $k \neq -M+N$. New bosonization of the affine superalgebra $\widehat{sl}(M|N)$ is obtained in the limit $q \to 1$.
