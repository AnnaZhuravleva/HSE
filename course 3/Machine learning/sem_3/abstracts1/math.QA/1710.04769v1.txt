We give a rigorous notion and study of screening operators and screening pairs for a vertex operator superalgebra associated to an abelian intertwining algebra. Screening pairs arising from weight one primary vectors associated to a lattice vertex operator algebra are classified into five general types, one type of which has been shown to play an important role in the construction study of certain interesting $\mathcal{W}$-vertex algebras. These types of screening pairs we go on to study in detail through the notion of a system of screeners which are a kind of set of generalized roots. We classify screening systems for all positive definite integral lattices of rank two, and for all positive definite even lattices of arbitrary rank when these lattices are generated by a screening system.
