R-matrices are the solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. At the origin of the quantum group theory, they may be interpreted as intertwining operators. Recent advances have been made independently in different directions. Maulik-Okounkov have given a geometric approach to R-matrices with new tools in symplectic geometry, the stable envelopes. Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh proved a conjecture on the categorification of cluster algebras by using R-matrices in a crucial way. Eventually, a better understanding of the action of transfer-matrices obtained from R-matrices led to the proof of several conjectures about the corresponding quantum integrable systems.
