The equivalence between dg duality and Verdier duality has been established for cyclic operads earlier. We propose a generalization of this correspondence from cyclic operads and dg duality to twisted modular operads and Feynman transform. Specifically, for each twisted modular operad $\mathcal{P}$ (taking values in a dg-vector space over a field $k$) there is a certain sheaf $\mathcal{F}$ associated with it on the moduli space of stable metric graphs such that the Verdier dual sheaf $D\mathcal{F}$ is associated with the Feynman transform $F\mathcal{P}$ of $\mathcal{P}$. This geometric interpretation in operad theory is of fundamental importance, and we believe this result will illuminate many aspects of the theory of modular operads and find many applications in the future. We illustrate an application of this result, by giving another proof of the homotopy properties of Feynman transform, which is quite intuitive and simpler than the original proof and clearly reflect the essence.
