The twined almost commutative structure of the standard spectral triple on the noncommutative torus with rational parameter is exhibited, by showing isomorphisms with a spectral triple on the algebra of sections of certain bundle of algebras, and a spectral triple on a certain invariant subalgebra of the product algebra. These isomorphisms intertwine also the grading and real structure. This holds for all four inequivalent spin structures, which are explicitly constructed in terms of double coverings of the noncommutative torus (with arbitrary real parameter). These results are extended also to a class of curved (non flat) spectral triples, obtained as a perturbation of the standard one by eight central elements.
