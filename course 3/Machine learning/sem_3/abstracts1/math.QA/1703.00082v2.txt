Using the BV-formalism of mathematical physics an explicit construction for the minimal model of a quantum L-infinity-algebra is given as a formal super integral. The approach taken herein to these formal integrals is axiomatic; they can be approached using perturbation theory to obtain combinatorial formulae as shown in the appendix. Additionally, there exists a canonical differential graded Lie algebra morphism mapping formal functions on homology to formal functions on the whole space. An L-infinity-algebra morphism inverse to this differential graded Lie algebra morphism on the level of homology is constructed as a formal super integral.
