We give a criterion for the complete reducibility of modules of finite length satisfying a composability condition for a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V$ using the first cohomology of the algebra. For a $V$-bimodule $M$, let $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)$ be the first cohomology of $V$ with the coefficients in $M$. If $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)= 0$ for every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$, or equivalently, if every derivation from $V$ to every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$ is inner, then every $V$-module of finite-length satisfying a composability condition is completely reducible. In particular, since a lower-bounded $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebra $V$ is a special meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left $V$-modules are in fact what has been called generalized $V$-modules with lower-bounded weights (or lower-bounded generalized $V$-modules), this result provides a cohomological criterion for the complete reducibility of lower-bounded generalized modules of finite length for such a vertex algebra. We conjecture that the converse of the main theorem above is also true. We also prove that when a grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ contains a subalgebra satisfying some familiar conditions, the composability condition for grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules always holds and we need $\hat{H}^{1}_{\infty}(V, M)= 0$ only for every $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $V$-bimodule $M$ generated by a grading-restricted subspace in our complete reducibility theorem.
