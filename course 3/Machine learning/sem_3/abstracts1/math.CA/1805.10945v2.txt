We develop the theory of quantization of spectral curves via the topological recursion. We formulate a quantization scheme to spectral curves which is not necessarily admissible in the sense of Bouchard-Eynard 2017. Our main result establishes a relation between the Voros coefficient for quantum curves and the free energies are formulated for spectral curves associated with a confluent family of Gauss hypergeometric differential equations. As an application, we find explicit formulas of free energies for those spectral curves in terms of the Bernoulli numbers.
