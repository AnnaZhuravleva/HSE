It is well-known that one-dimensional time fractional diffusion-wave equations with variable coefficients can be reduced to ordinary fractional differential equations and systems of linear fractional differential equations via scaling transformations. We then derive exact solutions to classes of linear fractional differential equations and systems thereof expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions, generalized Wright functions and Fox H-functions. These solutions are invariant solutions of diffusion-wave equations obtained through certain transformations, which are briefly discussed. We show that the solutions given in this work contain previously known results as particular cases.
