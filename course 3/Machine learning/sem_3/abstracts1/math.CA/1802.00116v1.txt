We focus on Fuchsian equations with four accessory parameters and three singular points. We see that the Fuchsian equations admit a "degeneration scheme" in some sense, which is expected to give rise to a degeneration scheme of discrete isomodromic deformation equations with four-dimensional phase space. We compute an example of discrete isomonodromic deformation equations of a certain Fuchsian equation.
