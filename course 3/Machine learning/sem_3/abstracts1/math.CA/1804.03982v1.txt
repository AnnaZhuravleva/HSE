The paper is an investigation of the analytic properties of the recently introduced Melnikov's $\Xi$-functions $\Xi_N^{[\bf k]}(x)$ for $N=1,2$. These functions play an important role in understanding the spectral characteristics of a class of operators underlying the dynamics of matter relaxation processes in attractive fields, as they generate the kernels of the principal parts of these operators. We reveal the representations of $\Xi$-functions in terms of the Gauss and Clausen hypergeometric functions. Differential-difference and differential equations satisfied by these functions are found. The results represent both a fundamental contribution to the theory of special functions and potentially useful tools in matter relaxation in a field, nanoelectronic electrolyte-based systems, charge carriers dynamics in media with obstacles.
