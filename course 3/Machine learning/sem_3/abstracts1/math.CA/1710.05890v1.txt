This paper indicates a new theoretical connection between two classical theories; elastic curves and phase transitions. Using this observation, we reveal the asymptotic shape of planar curves of clamped endpoints minimizing the modified total squared curvature as tension tends to infinity. More precisely, we prove that any sequence of minimizing curves converges to the borderline elastica near the endpoints in a rescaled sense and elsewhere becomes almost straight. The borderline elastica is well-known as a typical solution to the equation of elastica, but our analogy indicates that it can also be regarded as a transition layer. Applying our convergence result, we also obtain more qualitative properties on the shapes of global minimizers as self-intersections and inflection points. As a byproduct, the uniqueness of global minimizers is proved in a certain region of constraint parameters. In addition, we also prove that a similar convergence holds in a straightening process for one of the most classical elastic rod problems, which is posed by D. Bernoulli and L. Euler in the 18th century.
