In this paper, Poisson wavelets on $n$-dimensional spheres, derived from Poisson kernel, are introduced and characterized. We compute their Gegenbauer expansion with respect to the origin of the sphere, as well as with respect to the field source. Further, we give recursive formulae for their explicit representations and we show how the wavelets are localized in space. Also their Euclidean limit is calculated explicitly and its space localization is described. We show that Poisson wavelets can be treated as wavelets derived from approximate identities and we give two inversion formulae.
