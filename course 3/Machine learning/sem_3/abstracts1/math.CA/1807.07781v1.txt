We present a conspicuous number of indefinite integrals involving Heun functions and their products obtained by means of the Lagrangian formulation of a general homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation. As a by-product we also derive new indefinite integrals involving the Gauss hypergeometric function and products of hypergeometric functions with elliptic functions of the first kind. All integrals we obtained cannot be computed using Maple and Mathematica.
