Drawing on Vanhove's contributions to mixed Hodge structures for Feynman integrals in two-di\-men\-sion\-al quantum field theory, we compute two families of determinants whose entries are Bessel moments. Via explicit factorizations of certain Wro\'nskian determinants, we verify two recent conjectures proposed by Broadhurst and Mellit, concerning determinants of arbitrary sizes. With some extensions to our methods, we also relate two more determinants of Broadhurst--Mellit to the logarithmic Mahler measures of certain polynomials.
