We examine topological solitons in a minimal variational model for a chiral magnet, so-called chiral skyrmions. In the regime of large background fields, we prove linear stability of axisymmetric chiral skyrmions under arbitrary perturbations in the energy space, a long-standing open question in physics literature. Moreover, we show strict local minimality of axisymmetric chiral skyrmions and nearby existence of moving soliton solution for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation driven by a small spin transfer torque.
