Gasper & Rahman's multivariate $q$-Racah polynomials are shown to arise as connection coefficients between families of multivariate $q$-Hahn or $q$-Jacobi polynomials. The families of $q$-Hahn polynomials are constructed as nested Clebsch--Gordan coefficients for the positive-discrete series representations of the quantum algebra $su_q(1,1)$. This gives an interpretation of the multivariate $q$-Racah polynomials in terms of $3nj$ symbols. It is shown that the families of $q$-Hahn polynomials also arise in wavefunctions of $q$-deformed quantum Calogero--Gaudin superintegrable systems.
