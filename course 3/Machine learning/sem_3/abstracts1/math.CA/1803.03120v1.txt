Directional Poisson wavelets, being directional derivatives of Poisson kernel, are introduced on $n$-dimensional spheres. It is shown that, slightly modified and together with another wavelet family, they are an admissible wavelet pair according to the definition derived from the theory of approximate identities. We investigate some of the properties of directional Poisson wavelets, such as recursive formulae for their Fourier coefficients or explicit representations as functions of spherical variables (for some of the wavelets). We derive also an explicit formula for their Euclidean limits.
