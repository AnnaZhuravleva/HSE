We provide new representations for the finite parts at the poles and the derivative at zero of the Barnes zeta function in any dimension in the general case. These representations are in the forms of series and limits. We also give an integral representation for the finite parts at the poles. Similar results are derived for an associated function, which we term homogeneous Barnes zeta function. Our expressions immediately yield analogous representations for the logarithm of the Barnes Gamma function, including the particular case also known as multiple Gamma function.
