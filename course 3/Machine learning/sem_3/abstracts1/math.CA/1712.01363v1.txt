A representation for the kernel of the transmutation operator relating the perturbed Bessel equation with the unperturbed one is obtained in the form of a functional series with coefficients calculated by a recurrent integration procedure. New properties of the transmutation kernel are established. A new representation of the regular solution of the perturbed Bessel equation is given presenting a remarkable feature of uniform error bound with respect to the spectral parameter for partial sums of the series. A numerical illustration of application to the solution of Dirichlet spectral problems is presented.
