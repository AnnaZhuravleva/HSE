First some definite integrals of W. H. L. Russell, almost all with trigonometric function integrands, are derived, and many generalized. Then a list is given in Russell-style of generalizations of integral identities of Amdeberhan and Moll. We conclude with a brief and noncomprehensive description of directions for further investigation, including the significant generalization to elliptic functions.
