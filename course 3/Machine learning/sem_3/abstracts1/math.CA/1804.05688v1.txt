Some of the main results of reference [12], concerning non-generic isomonodromy deformations of a certain linear differential system with irregular singularity and coalescing eigenvalues, are reviewed from the point of view of Pfaffian systems, making a distinction between weak and strong isomonodromic deformations. Such distinction has a counterpart in the case of Fuchsian systems, which is well known as Schlesinger and non-Schlesinger deformations, reviewed in the Appendix.
