We introduce a nine-parameter Heun-type differential equation and obtain three classes of its solutions as series of square integrable functions written in terms of the Jacobi polynomial. The expansion coefficients of the series satisfy three-term recursion relations, which are solved in terms of orthogonal polynomials with continuous and/or discrete spectra. Some of these are well-known polynomials while others are either new or modified versions of known ones.
