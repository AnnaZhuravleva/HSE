Explicit expressions for associated spherical functions of $SO(p,q)$ matrix groups are obtained using a generalized hypergeometric series of two variables. In this paper, we present explicit expressions for zonal functions of de Sitter groups and the group of conformal invariance. Moreover, we present a theorem on the transformation of derivative of distributions, concentrated on smooth surfaces, with respect to infinite-dimensional Lie group $C^{\infty}\left(\mathbb{R^{\mathit{n}}},GL(n)\right)$.
