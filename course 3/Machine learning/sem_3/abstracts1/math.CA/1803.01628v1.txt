The major goal of the paper is to prove that discrete frames of (directional) wavelets derived from an approximate identity exist. Additionally, a kind of energy conservation property is shown to hold in the case when a wavelet family is not its own reconstruction family. Although an additional constraint on the spectrum of the wavelet family must be satisfied, it is shown that all the wavelets so far defined in the literature possess this property.
