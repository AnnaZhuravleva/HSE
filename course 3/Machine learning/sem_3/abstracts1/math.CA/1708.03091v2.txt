A perturbation series solution is constructed in terms of Airy functions for a nonlinear two-point boundary-value problem arising in an established model of steady electrodiffusion in one dimension, for two ionic species carrying equal and opposite charges. The solution includes a formal determination of the associated electric field, which is known to satisfy a form of the Painlev\'e II differential equation. Comparisons with the numerical solution of the boundary-value problem show excellent agreement following termination of the series after a sufficient number of terms, for a much wider range of values of the parameters in the model than suggested by previously presented analysis, or admitted by previously presented approximation schemes. These surprising results suggest that for a wide variety of cases, a convergent series expansion is obtained in terms of Airy functions for the Painlev\'e transcendent describing the electric field. A suitable weighting of error measures for the approximations to the field and its first derivative provides a monotonically decreasing overall measure of the error in a subset of these cases. It is conjectured that the series does converge for this subset.
