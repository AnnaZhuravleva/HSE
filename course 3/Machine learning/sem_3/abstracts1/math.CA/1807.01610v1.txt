This work presents a geometrical formulation of the Clairin theory of conditional symmetries for higher-order systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). We devise methods to obtain Lie algebras of conditional symmetries from known ones, and unnecessary previous assumptions of the theory are removed. As a byproduct, new insights into other types of conditional symmetries arise. Then, we apply the so-called PDE Lie systems to the derivation and analysis of Lie algebras of conditional symmetries. In particular, we develop a method to obtain solutions of a higher-order system of PDEs via the solutions and geometric properties of a PDE Lie system, whose form gives a Lie algebra of conditional symmetries of Clairin type. Our methods are illustrated with physically relevant examples such as nonlinear wave equations, Gauss--Codazzi equations for minimal soliton surfaces, and generalised Liouville equations.
