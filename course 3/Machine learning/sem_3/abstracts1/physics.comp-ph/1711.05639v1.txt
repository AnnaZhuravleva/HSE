Our manuscript investigates a self-consistent solution of the statistical atom model proposed by Berthold-Georg Englert and Julian Schwinger (the ES model) and benchmarks it against atomic Kohn-Sham and two orbital-free models of the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD)-$\lambda$vW family. Results show that the ES model generally offers the same accuracy as the well-known TFD-$\frac{1}{5}$vW model; however, the ES model corrects the failure in Pauli potential near-nucleus region. We also point to the inability of describing low-$Z$ atoms as the foremost concern in improving the present model.
