We present a new interface called FeynHelpers that connects FeynCalc, a Mathematica package for symbolic semi-automatic evaluation of Feynman diagrams and calculations in quantum field theory (QFT) to Package-X and FIRE. The former provides a library of analytic results for scalar 1-loop integrals with up to 4 legs, while the latter is a general-purpose tool for reduction of multi-loop scalar integrals using Integration-by-Parts (IBP) identities. With this add-on many types of calculations that were difficult or hardly feasible with FeynCalc previously, can now be done in a much simpler way. This is demonstrated with four different examples from QED, QCD and Higgs physics.
