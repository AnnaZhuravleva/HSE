We present a numerical method for the accurate and efficient simulation of strongly localized light sources, such as quantum dots, embedded in dielectric micro-optical structures. We apply the method in order to optimize the photon extraction efficiency of a single-photon emitter consisting of a quantum dot embedded into a multi-layer stack with further lateral structures. Furthermore, we present methods to study the robustness of the extraction efficiency with respect to fabrication errors and defects.
