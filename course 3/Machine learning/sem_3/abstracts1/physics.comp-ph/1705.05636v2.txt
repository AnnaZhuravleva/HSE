We discuss a backward Monte-Carlo technique for muon transport problem, with emphasis on its application in muography. Backward Monte-Carlo allows exclusive sampling of a final state by reversing the simulation flow. In practice it can be made analogous to an adjoint Monte-Carlo, though it is more versatile for muon transport. A backward Monte-Carlo was implemented as a dedicated muon transport library: PUMAS. It is shown for case studies relevant for muography imaging that the implementations of forward and backward Monte-Carlo schemes agree to better than 1%.
