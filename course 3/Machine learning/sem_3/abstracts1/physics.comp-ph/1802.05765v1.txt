In this article we describe the Java library that we have recently constructed to automatize the S-expansion method, a powerful mathematical technique allowing to relate different Lie algebras. An important input in this procedure is the use of abelian semigroups and thus, we start with a brief review about the classification of non-isomorphic semigroups made in the literature during the last decades, and explain how the lists of non-isomorphic semigroups up to order 6 can be used as inputs in many of the methods of our library. After describing the main features of the classes that compose our library we present a new method called fillTemplate which tuns out to be very useful to answer whether two given algebras can be S-related.
