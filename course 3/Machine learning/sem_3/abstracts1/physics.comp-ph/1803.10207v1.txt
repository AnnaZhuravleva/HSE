Many codes have been developed to study highly relativistic, magnetized flows around and inside compact objects. Depending on the adopted formalism, some of these codes evolve the vector potential $\mathbf{A}$, and others evolve the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}$ directly. Given that these codes possess unique strengths, sometimes it is desirable to start a simulation using a code that evolves $\mathbf{B}$ and complete it using a code that evolves $\mathbf{A}$. Thus transferring the data from one code to another would require an inverse curl algorithm. This paper describes two new inverse curl techniques in the context of Cartesian numerical grids: a cell-by-cell method, which scales approximately linearly with the numerical grid, and a global linear algebra approach, which has worse scaling properties but is generally more robust (e.g., in the context of a magnetic field possessing some nonzero divergence). We demonstrate these algorithms successfully generate smooth vector potential configurations in challenging special and general relativistic contexts.
