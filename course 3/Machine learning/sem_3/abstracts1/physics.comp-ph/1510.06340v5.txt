Understanding event-by-event correlations and fluctuations is crucial for the comprehension of the dynamics of heavy ion collisions. Relativistic hydrodynamics is an elegant tool for modeling these phenomena; however, such simulations are time-consuming, and conventional CPU calculations are not suitable for event-by-event calculations. This work presents a feasibility study of a new hydrodynamic code that employs graphics processing units together with a general MUSTA-FORCE algorithm (Multi-Stage Riemann Algorithm - First Order Centered scheme) to deliver a high-performance yet universal tool for event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. We also investigate the performance of selected slope limiters that reduce the amount of numeric oscillations and diffusion in the presence of strong discontinuities and shock waves. The numerical results are compared to the exact solutions to assess the code's accuracy.
