Coexistence of topological elements in a topological metal/semimetal (TM) has gradually attracted attentions. However, the non-topological factors always mess up the Fermi surface and cover interesting topological properties. Here, we find that Ba3Si4 is a "clean" TM in which coexists nodal-chain network, intersecting nodal rings (INRs) and triple points, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Moreover, the nodal rings in the topological phase exhibit diverse types: from type-I, type-II to type-III rings according to band dispersions. All the topological elements are generated by crossings of three energy bands, and thus they are correlated rather than mutual independence. When some structural symmetries are eliminated by an external strain, the topological phase evolves into another phase including Hopf link, one-dimensional nodal chain and new INRs.
