Within the framework of linear-scaling Kohn-Sham density functional theory, a robust method for maintaining compact localized orbitals close to the ground state is coupled with nuclear dynamics. This allows to obviate the commonly employed optimization of the one-electron density matrix and thus create an efficient orbital-only molecular dynamics method for weakly-interacting systems. An application to liquid water demonstrates that the low computational overhead of the method makes it well-suited for routine simulations whereas its linear-scaling complexity allows to extend first-principle dynamical studies of molecular systems to previously inaccessible length scales.
