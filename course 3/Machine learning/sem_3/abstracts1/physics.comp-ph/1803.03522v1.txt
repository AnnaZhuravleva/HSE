Neutron oscillation into mirror neutron, a sterile state exactly degenerate in mass with the neutron, could be a very rapid process, even faster than the neutron decay itself. It can be observed by comparing the neutron lose rates in Ultra-cold neutron trapping experiment for different experimental magnetic fields. We developed a Monte Carlo code that simulate many of the features of this kind of experiment with non-uniform magnetic field. The aim of the simulation is to provide all necessary tools, needed for analyzing experimental results for neutron traps with different geometry and different configurations of magnetic field.
