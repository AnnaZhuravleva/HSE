Starting from Brenier's relaxed formulation of the incompressible Euler equation in terms of geodesics in the group of measure-preserving diffeomorphisms, we propose a numerical method based on Sinkhorn's algorithm for the entropic regularization of optimal transport. We also make a detailed comparison of this entropic regularization with the so-called Bredinger entropic interpolation problem. Numerical results in dimension one and two illustrate the feasibility of the method.
