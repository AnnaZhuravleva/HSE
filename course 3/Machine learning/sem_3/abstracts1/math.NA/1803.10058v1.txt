Using the method of equivariant moving frames, we present a procedure for constructing symmetry-preserving finite element methods for second-order ordinary differential equations. Using the method of lines, we then indicate how our constructions can be extended to (1+1)-dimensional evolutionary partial differential equations, using Burgers' equation as an example. Numerical simulations verify that the symmetry-preserving finite element schemes constructed converge at the expected rate and that these schemes can yield better results than their non-invariant finite element counterparts.
