We propose a finite element discretisation approach for the incompressible Euler equations which mimics their geometric structure and their variational derivation. In particular, we derive a finite element method that arises from a nonholonomic variational principle and an appropriately defined Lagrangian, where finite element H(div) vector fields are identified with advection operators; this is the first successful extension of the structure-preserving discretisation of Pavlov et al. (2009) to the finite element setting. The resulting algorithm coincides with the energy-conserving scheme presented in Guzm\'an et al. (2016). Through the variational derivation, we discover that it also satisfies a discrete analogous of Kelvin's circulation theorem. Further, we propose an upwind-stabilised version of the scheme which dissipates enstrophy whilst preserving energy conservation and the discrete Kelvin's theorem. We prove error estimates for this version of the scheme, and we study its behaviour through numerical tests.
