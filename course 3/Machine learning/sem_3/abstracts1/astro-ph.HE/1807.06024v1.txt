We discuss the possibility of receiving a radio signal from extra-Galactic intelligence, around the time when we observe a binary neutron star merger in their galaxy. High precession measurements of the binary parameters allow them to send the signal ~ $10^4$ years before they themselves observe the merger signal. Using the SKA, we might receive ~ $10^4$ bits of data, transmitted from 40Mpc distance with the output power of ~ 1 TW. We also discuss related topics for GW170817 and mention potential roles of future gravitational wave detectors in relation to this transmission scheme.
