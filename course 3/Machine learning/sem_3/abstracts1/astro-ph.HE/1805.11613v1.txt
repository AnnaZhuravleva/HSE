The observations of a macronova/kilonova accompanied by gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger (GW170817) confirmed that neutron star coalescences produce copious ejecta. The coincident gamma-ray detection implies the existence of a relativistic jet in this system. During the jet's propagation within the ejecta, high-energy photons and neutrinos can be produced. The photons are absorbed by the ejecta, while the neutrinos escape and can be detected. Here, we estimate such trans-ejecta neutrino emission, and discuss how neutrino observations could be used to differentiate between gamma-ray burst emission scenarios. We find that neutrinos from the internal shocks inside the ejecta may be detectable by IceCube within a few years of operation, and will likely be detected with IceCube-Gen2. The neutrino signals coincident with gravitational waves would enable us to reveal the physical quantities of the choked jets even without electromagnetic signals.
