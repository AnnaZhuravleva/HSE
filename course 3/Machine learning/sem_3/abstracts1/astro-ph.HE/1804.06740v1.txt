We propose a mechanism that can convert a sizeable fraction of neutron stars into black holes with mass $\sim 1M_\odot$, too light to be produced via standard stellar evolution. We show that asymmetric fermionic dark matter of mass $\sim$ TeV, with attractive self-interaction within the range that alleviates the problems of collisionless cold dark matter, can accumulate in a neutron star and collapse, forming a seed black hole that converts the rest of the star to a solar mass black hole. We estimate the fraction of neutron stars that can become black holes without contradicting existing neutron star observations. Like neutron stars, such solar mass black holes could be in binary systems, which may be searched for by existing and forthcoming gravitational wave detectors. The (non-)observation of binary mergers of solar mass black holes may thus test the specific nature of the dark matter.
