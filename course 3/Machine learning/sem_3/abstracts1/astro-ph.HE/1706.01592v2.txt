Compact stars may contain quark matter in their interiors at densities exceeding several times the nuclear saturation density. We explore models of such compact stars where there are two first-order phase transitions: the first from nuclear matter to a quark-matter phase, followed at higher density by another first-order transition to a different quark matter phase [e.g., from the two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase). We show that this can give rise to two separate branches of hybrid stars, separated from each other and from the nuclear branch by instability regions and, therefore, to a new family of compact stars, denser than the ordinary hybrid stars. In a range of parameters, one may obtain twin hybrid stars (hybrid stars with the same masses but different radii) and even triplets where three stars, with inner cores of nuclear matter, 2SC matter, and CFL matter, respectively, all have the same mass but different radii.
