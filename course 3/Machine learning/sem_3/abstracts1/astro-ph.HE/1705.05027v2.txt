We perform Monte Carlo simulations of transrelativistic shear acceleration dedicated to a jet-cocoon system of active galactic nuclei. A certain fraction of galactic cosmic rays in a halo is entrained, and sufficiently high-energy particles can be injected to the reacceleration process and further accelerated up to 100 EeV. We show that the shear reacceleration mechanism leads to a hard spectrum of escaping cosmic rays, $dL_E/dE\propto E^{-1}-E^0$, distinct from a conventional $E^{-2}$ spectrum. The supersolar abundance of ultrahigh-energy nuclei is achieved due to injections at TeV-PeV energies. As a result, we find that the highest-energy spectrum and mass composition can be reasonably explained by our model without contradictions with the anisotropy data.
