We consider the Keplerian, radial and vertical fundamental frequencies in the Schwarzschild spacetime to study the so-called kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations from low-mass X-ray binary systems. We show that, within the Relativistic Precession Model, the interpretation of observed kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations in terms of the fundamental frequencies of test particles in the Schwarzschild spacetime, allows one to infer the total mass $M$ of the central object, the internal $R_{in}$ and external $R_{ex}$ radii of accretion disks, and innermost stable circular orbits $r_{ISCO}$ for test particles in a low-mass X-ray binary system. By constructing the relation between the upper and lower frequencies and exploiting the quasi-periodic oscillation data of the Z and Atoll sources we perform the non-linear model fit analysis and estimate the mass of the central object. Knowing the value of the mass we calculate the internal $R_{in}$ and external $R_{ex}$ radii of accretion disks and show that they are larger than $r_{ISCO}$, what was expected.
