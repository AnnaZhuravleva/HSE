Measuring the rotation of core-collapse supernovae (SN) and of their progenitor stars is extremely challenging. Here it is demonstrated that neutrinos can be employed as stellar gyroscopes. This is shown by comparing the neutrino emission properties of self-consistent, three-dimensional (3D) SN simulations of a 15 M_sun progenitor without rotation as well as slow and fast rotation compatible with observational constraints. The explosion of the fast rotating model gives rise to long-lasting, massive polar accretion downflows with stochastic time-variability. This creates power uniformly spread over all frequencies of the Fourier spectrum of the neutrino event rate, e.g. detectable in the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. In contrast, the non-rotating model is characterized by the well-known sharp peak due to the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and lower-amplitude, high-frequency convective activity in the Fourier spectrum; the SASI and convective peaks exhibit a pronounced broadening in the slowly rotating model. These distinct rotational imprints will be detectable even for a SN at the edge of our Galaxy and for all observer directions.
