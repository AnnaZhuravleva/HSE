The pulse profile from a neutron star in scalar-tensor theory of gravity is examined for several stellar models, where we assume the existence of the antipodal hot spots on the neutron star based on the polar cap model. Then, we find that the pulse profile from the scalarized neutron star in scalar-tensor gravity is almost the same as that in general relativity, i.e., without a scalar field, if the stellar compactness of the both stars is very similar. That is, the existence of the scalar field does not directly change the pulse profile from the neutron star, while the stellar compactness is crucial for determining the pulse shape even in the scalar-tensor gravity. Additionally, we find that the pulse shape from the scalarized neutron star is more or less similar to that from the neutron star with the same mass in general relativity, while the ratio of the minimum amplitude to the maximum amplitude in the pulse profile depend strongly on the coupling constant in scalar-tensor gravity, depending on the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes and the angle between the rotational axis and the direction to the observer. So, the direct observation of the pulse profile together with the additional observation of the stellar mass, one may extract the imprint of the gravitational theory in strong field regime.
