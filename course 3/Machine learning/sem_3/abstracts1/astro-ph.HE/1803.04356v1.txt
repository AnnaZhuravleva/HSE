We present the first three-dimensional (3D) smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of the induced gravitational collapse (IGC) scenario of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae (SNe). We simulate the SN explosion of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{\rm core}$) forming a binary system with a neutron star (NS) companion. We follow the evolution of the SN ejecta, including their morphological structure, subjected to the gravitational field of both the new NS ($\nu$NS) formed at the center of the SN, and the one of the NS companion. We compute the accretion rate of the SN ejecta onto the NS companion as well as onto the $\nu$NS from SN matter fallback. We determine the fate of the binary system for a wide parameter space including different CO$_{\rm core}$ masses, orbital periods and SN explosion geometry and energies. We evaluate, for selected nuclear equations-of-state of NSs, if the accretion process leads the NSs either to the mass-shedding limit, or to the secular axisymmetric instability for gravitational collapse to a black hole (BH), or to a more massive, fast rotating, but stable NS. We also assess whether the binary keeps or not gravitationally bound after the SN explosion, hence exploring the space of binary and SN explosion parameters leading to the formation of $\nu$NS-NS or $\nu$NS-BH binaries. The consequences of our results for the modeling of GRBs via the IGC scenario are discussed.
