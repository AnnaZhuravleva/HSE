Adjusted data on the fraction of protons in the mass composition of primary cosmic rays (PCRs) in the energy range of 10^15-10^17 eV are presented. Adjustments are made according to detailed calculations of the response of the X-ray emulsion chamber in the PAMIR experiment. It is demonstrated that the fraction of protons in a PCR is 16-18% for E0 = 10^15-10^16 eV and does not change within the error for E0 = 10^16-10^17 eV.
