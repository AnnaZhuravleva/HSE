Many cosmic ray (CR) experiments have confirmed the lepton excess in CR lepton spectra at $\gtrsim 30 \mathrm{GeV}$, which can be explained both by astrophysical sources and dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay. A cross check is needed. However, the current direct detection cannot probe the leptonphilic DM particles with mass in the range $100 \mathrm{GeV} - 10 \mathrm{TeV}$ which derived from indirect detection. In this letter, we propose an scenario to provide a cross check on the existence of such DM particles, via hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs (DAVs) in DM-dense environments. An important observable has been proposed and corresponding estimations have been made. The estimation show that the potential sensitivity on the $m_{\chi} - \sigma_{\chi,e}$ plane could be extended to a region with $5 \mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim 10^{4} \mathrm{GeV}$ and $\sigma_{\chi,e} \gtrsim 10^{-40} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, which could give us a cross check on the existence of the leptonphilic DM particles with indirect DM detection in near future.
