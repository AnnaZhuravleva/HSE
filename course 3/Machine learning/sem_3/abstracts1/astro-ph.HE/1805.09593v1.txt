We discuss the properties of stellar mass black hole (BH) mergers induced by tidal encounters with a massive BH at galactic centres or potentially in dense star clusters. The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is known to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not always lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to become hard and eccentric, this process can be a new formation channel of BH mergers. We show that the gravitational wave (GW) merger times become shorter by a factor of more than 10^2 (10^5 ) in 10% (1%) of the surviving cases. We also investigate the effective spins of the surviving binaries, assuming that the spins of BHs in binaries are initially aligned with their binary orbital angular momenta. We find that binary orientations can flip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with large merger time reduction factors of > 10^5 , the effective spin distribution is asymmetric, but rather flat. 39% of these systems have negative effective spins.
