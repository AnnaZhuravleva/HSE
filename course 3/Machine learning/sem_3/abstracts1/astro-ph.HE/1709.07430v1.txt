At the beginning of 2016, LIGO reported the first-ever direct detection of gravitational waves. The measured signal was compatible with the merger of two black holes of about 30 solar masses, releasing about 3 solar masses of energy in gravitational waves. We consider the possible neutrino emission from a binary black hole merger relative to the energy released in gravitational waves and investigate the constraints coming from the non-detection of counterpart neutrinos, focusing on IceCube and its energy range. The information from searches for counterpart neutrinos is combined with the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux in order to put bounds on neutrino emission from binary black hole mergers. Prospects for future LIGO observation runs are shown and compared with model predictions.
