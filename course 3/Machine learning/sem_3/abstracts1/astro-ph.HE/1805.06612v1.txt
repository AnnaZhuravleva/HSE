In this work, we search for $\gamma$-ray emission from the directions of some nearby Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and candidates with the publicly-available Pass 8 data of Fermi-LAT. Our sample includes 12 sources with the distances $<50$ kpc. Very weak $\gamma$-ray excesses ($\sim 2\sigma$) are found in some dSphs/candidates, consistent with that reported in the previous literature. Intriguingly, the peak test statistic (TS) value of the weak emission from the direction of Reticulum II rises continually. If interpreted as dark matter (DM) annihilation, the peak TS value is 13.5 for the annihilation channel of $\chi\chi \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ and the DM mass of $m_\chi \sim 16$ GeV. The combination of all these nearby sources yields a more significant (with local significance $> 4\sigma$) $\gamma$-ray signal.
