In this work, we aim to search for the line-like signals in the Fermi-LAT data. We have searched over 49000 regions of interest (ROIs) that cover the whole sky. No ROI displays a line signal with a test statistic (TS) value above 25, while for 50 ROIs weak line-like excesses with ${\rm TS}>16$ are present. These tentative line signals are most likely due to the statistical fluctuation, though the dark matter annihilation origin of a few of them can not be ruled out. We also use the number of the line signal candidates to constrain the cross section of dark matter annihilating to gamma-ray lines, $\left<\sigma{v}\right>_{\gamma\gamma}$.
