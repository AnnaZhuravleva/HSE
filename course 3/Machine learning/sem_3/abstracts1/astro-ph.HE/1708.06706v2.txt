We present a new method to interpret the $\gamma$-ray data of our inner Galaxy as measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi LAT). We train and test convolutional neural networks with simulated Fermi-LAT images based on models tuned to real data. We use this method to investigate the origin of an excess emission of GeV $\gamma$-rays seen in previous studies. Interpretations of this excess include $\gamma$ rays created by the annihilation of dark matter particles and $\gamma$ rays originating from a collection of unresolved point sources, such as millisecond pulsars. Our new method allows precise measurements of the contribution and properties of an unresolved population of $\gamma$-ray point sources in the interstellar diffuse emission model.
