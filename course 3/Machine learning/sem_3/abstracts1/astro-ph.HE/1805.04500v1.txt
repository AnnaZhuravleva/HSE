We examine the hypothesis of decaying heavy dark matter (HDM) in the context of the IceCube highest energy neutrino events and recent limits on the diffuse flux of high-energy photons. We consider DM particles $X$ of mass $10^{6}~\leq~M_X~\leq~10^{16}$ GeV decaying on tree-level into $X~\rightarrow~\nu\bar{\nu}$, $X~\rightarrow~e^+e^-$ and $X~\rightarrow~q\bar{q}$. The full simulation of hadronic and electroweak decay cascades and the subsequent propagation of the decay products through the interstellar medium allows us to determine the permitted values of $M_X$. We show that for leptonic decay channels it is possible to explain the IceCube highest energy neutrino signal without overproducing high-energy photons for $M_X~\lesssim~5.5 \cdot 10^{7}$ GeV and $1.5 \cdot 10^{8}~\lesssim~M_X~\lesssim~1.5 \cdot 10^{9}$ GeV, while hadronic decays contradict the gamma-ray limits for almost the whole range of $M_X$ values considered. The leptonic hypothesis can be probed by operating and planned gamma-ray observatories: for instance, the currently upgrading Carpet experiment will be capable to test a significant part of the remaining parameter window within one year of observation.
