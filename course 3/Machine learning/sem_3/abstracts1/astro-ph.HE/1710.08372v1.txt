In this work we report briefly on the gravitational wave (GW) signal computed in the context of a self-consistent, 3D simulation of a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion of a 15M$_\odot$ progenitor star. We present a short overview of the GW signal, including signal amplitude, frequency distribution, and the energy emitted in the form of GWs for each phase of explosion, along with neutrino luminosities, and discuss correlations between them.
