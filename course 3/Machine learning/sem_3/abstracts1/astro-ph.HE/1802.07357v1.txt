New data on the absolute value on the inelastic proton-air cross section at 10 PeV are presented. Conclusion is made about the growth with energy of the inelastic proton-air cross section according to comparisons with experimental data were obtained at the Tien Shan complex array on various components of extensive air showers: hadrons, Cherenkov light and electrons with many different calculated models of cosmic rays interactions at the atmosphere. The analysis showed that the rise conforms to 7-9 % per one order of the energy from 0.2 TeV (accelerators with fixed targets) to 10 PeV (EAS cosmic rays). That corresponds to around 350 mb at 1 PeV and 380 mb at 10 PeV of primary cosmic rays. These data corresponds better to the QGSJET-II-04 model version.
