The dark matter in neutron stars can exist from the lifetime of the progenitor or captured by this compact object. The properties of dark matter entered the neutron stars through each step could be different from each other. Here, we investigate the structure of neutron stars which are influenced by the dark matter in two processes. Applying a generalization of two-fluid formalism to three-fluid one and the equation of state from the rotational curves of galaxies, we explore the structure of double dark-matter admixed neutron stars. The behavior of the neutron and dark matter portions for these stars is considered. In addition, the influence of the dark matter equations of state on the stars with different contributions of visible and dark matter is studied. The gravitational redshift of these stars in different cases of dark matter equations of state is investigated.
