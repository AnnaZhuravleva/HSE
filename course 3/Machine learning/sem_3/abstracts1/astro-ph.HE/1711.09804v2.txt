In this work, we report the discovery and characterization of PSR J1411+2551, a new binary pulsar discovered in the Arecibo 327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey. Our timing observations of the radio pulsar in the system span a period of about 2.5 years. This timing campaign allowed a precise measurement of its spin period (62.4 ms) and its derivative (9.6 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times 10^{-20}\, \rm s\, s^{-1}$; from these, we derive a characteristic age of $\sim 10\,$Gyr and a surface magnetic field strength of 2.5 $\times 10^{9}$ G. These numbers indicate that this pulsar was mildly recycled by accretion of matter from the progenitor of the companion star. The system has an eccentric ($e\, = \, 0.17$) 2.61 day orbit. This eccentricity allows a highly significant measurement of the rate of advance of periastron, $\dot{\omega} = 0.07686 \pm 0.00046 ^{\circ}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Assuming general relativity accurately models the orbital motion, this implies a total system mass M = $2.538 \pm 0.022 M_{\odot}$. The minimum companion mass is $0.92\, M_{\odot}$ and the maximum pulsar mass is $1.62\, M_{\odot}$. The large companion mass and the orbital eccentricity suggest that PSR J1411+2551 is a double neutron star system; the lightest known to date including the DNS merger GW 170817. Furthermore, the relatively low orbital eccentricity and small proper motion limits suggest that the second supernova had a relatively small associated kick; this and the low system mass suggest that it was an ultra-stripped supernova.
