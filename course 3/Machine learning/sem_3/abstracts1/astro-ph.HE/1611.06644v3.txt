An anomalous excess emission has been found in Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data covering the centre of the Galaxy. Several theories have been proposed for this `Galactic Centre Excess' (GCE). They include self-annihilation of dark matter particles, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars, an unresolved population of young pulsars, or a series of burst events. We report on new analyses that exploit hydrodynamical modelling to register the position of interstellar gas associated with diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission. We find evidence that the GCE gamma rays are statistically better described by the X-shaped stellar over-density in the Galactic bulge and the nuclear stellar bulge, rather than a spherical excess. Given the non-spherical nature of our findings, we argue that the GCE is not a dark matter phenomenon but rather associated with the stellar population of the Galactic bulge and nuclear bulge.
