Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with a mass $M \lesssim {10^{17}}$g are expected to inject sub-GeV electrons and positrons in the Galaxy via Hawking radiation. These cosmic rays are shielded by the solar magnetic field for Earth-bound detectors, but not for Voyager-1, which is now beyond the heliopause. We use its data to constrain the fraction of PBHs to the dark matter in the Galaxy, finding that PBHs with $M<10^{16}$g cannot contribute more than 0.1% (or less for a lognormal mass distribution). Our limits are based on local galactic measurements and are thus complementary to those derived from cosmological observations.
