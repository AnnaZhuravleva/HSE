Recent cosmic $e^+e^-$ measurement from the {\it DArk Matter Particle Explorer} (DAMPE) satellite confirms the deviation of total cosmic ray electron spectrum above 700-900 GeV from simple power law. In this paper we demonstrate that a $e^\pm$ signal from cascade decay of dark matter can account for DAMPE's TeV $e^+e^-$ spectrum. We select the least constraint DM decay channel into four muons as the benchmark scenario, and perform an analysis with propagation variance in both DM signal and the Milky Way's electron background. A best fit is obtained for joint DAMPE, Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. high energy electron data sets, and with an $O(10^{26})$ second decay lifetime that is consistent with existing gamma ray and cosmic microwave background limits. We compare the spectral difference between popular cascade final states. The least constrained four $\mu$ channel gives a good fit to the electron spectrum's TeV scale down-turn, yet its low energy spectrum has tension with sub-TeV positron data from AMS02. We also consider a more constrained four $\tau$ lepton channel as an example of further softened DM cascade decay signal that is in good agreement with all four data sets.
