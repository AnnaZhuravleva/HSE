In this work, we expand on a previously reported realistic calculation of the magnetic field profile for the equation of state inside strongly magnetized neutron stars. In addition to showing that magnetic fields increase quadratically with increasing baryon chemical potential of magnetized matter (instead of exponentially, as previously assumed), we show here that the magnetic field increase with baryon number density is more complex and harder to model. We do so by the analysis of several different realistic models for the microscopic description of matter in the star (including hadronic, hybrid and quark models) combined with general relativistic solutions by solving Einstein-Maxwell's field equations in a self-consistent way for stars endowed with a poloidal magnetic field.
