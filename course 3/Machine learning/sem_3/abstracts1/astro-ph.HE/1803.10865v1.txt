Massive remnants with lifetimes of at least several seconds are expected to be the result of a sizable fraction of neutron star (NS) mergers. We study their formation using a large set of numerical relativity simulations. We show that long-lived remnants are initially endowed with angular momentum that significantly exceeds the mass-shedding limit for rigidly-rotating equilibrium configurations. Consequently, they need to dispose of a large fraction of their angular momentum before achieving solid body rotation. We find that gravitational-wave (GW) radiation is insufficient to accomplish this, and we argue that the removal of angular momentum is likely accompanied by the ejection of massive winds on the viscous timescale. Long-lived NS merger remnants are also formed with larger gravitational masses than those of rigidly-rotating NSs having the same number of baryons. The excess mass is likely radiated in the form of neutrinos. The evolution of long-lived remnants on the viscous timescale is thus determined by the interplay of finite-temperature effects, mass ejection, and neutrinos with potentially dramatic consequences for the remnants' properties and stability. The rotational period of these remnants at the end of the viscous evolution is also studied. We provide an empirical fit for the spin as a function of the final mass of the remnant and discuss the implications for the magnetar model of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Finally, we investigate the possible electromagnetic signatures associated to the viscous ejecta. Massive outflows possibly resulting from the formation of long-lived remnants would power unusually bright, blue kilonova counterparts to GW events and SGRBs whose detection would provide smoking gun evidence for the formation of long-lived remnants.
