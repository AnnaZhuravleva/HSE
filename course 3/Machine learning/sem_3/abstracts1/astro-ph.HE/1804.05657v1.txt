Isotopes with low-lying long-lived isomers can behave very differently from other isotopes in astrophysical environments. In particular, the assumption of thermal equilibrium in computing the temperature-dependent $\beta$-decay rates of such isotopes can fail below certain temperatures. We focus on the $\beta$-decay of $^{26}$Al since it is one of the most important isotopes in observational astrophysics and has a low-lying isomeric state; we compare and contrast these results with $^{34}$Cl. We rule out recently reported $^{26}$Al effective $\beta$-decay rates that showed large differences from previous calculations, finding that we agree with the earlier results. We conclude that in general, effective $\beta$-decay rates should be defined separately for the ground and isomeric states at temperatures where thermal equilibrium cannot be achieved.
