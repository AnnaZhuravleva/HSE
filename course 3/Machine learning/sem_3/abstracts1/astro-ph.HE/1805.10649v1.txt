We study the propagation and injection models of cosmic rays using the latest measurements of the Boron-to-Carbon ratio and fluxes of protons, Helium, Carbon, and Oxygen nuclei by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and the Advanced Composition Explorer at top of the Earth, and the Voyager spacecraft outside the heliosphere. The ACE data during the same time interval of the AMS-02 data are extracted to minimize the complexity of the solar modulation effect. We find that the cosmic ray nucleus data favor a modified version of the diffusion-reacceleration scenario of the propagation. The diffusion coefficient is, however, required to increase moderately with decreasing rigidity at low energies, which has interesting implications on the particle and plasma interaction in the Milky Way. We further find that the low rigidity ($<$ a few GV) injection spectra are different for different compositions. The injection spectra are softer for lighter nuclei. These results are expected to be helpful in understanding the acceleration process of cosmic rays.
