We investigate the fundamental mode of non-radial oscillations of non-rotating compact stars in general relativity using a set of equations of state (EOS) connecting state-of-the-art calculations at low and high densities. Specifically, a low density model based on the chiral effective field theory (EFT) and high density results based on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are matched through different interpolating polytropes fulfilling thermodynamic stability and subluminality of the speed of sound, together with the additional requirement that the equations of state support a two solar mass star. We employ three representative models (EOS I, II and III) presented in Ref. [1] such that EOS I gives the minimum stellar radius, EOS II the maximum stellar mass, and EOS III the maximum stellar radius. Using this family of equations of state, we find that the frequency and the damping time of the $f$-mode are constrained within narrow quite model-independent windows. We also analyze some proposed empirical relations that describe the $f$-mode properties in terms of the average density and the compactness of the neutron star. We discuss the stringency of these constrains and the possible role of physical effects that cannot be encoded in a mere interpolation between low and high density EOSs.
