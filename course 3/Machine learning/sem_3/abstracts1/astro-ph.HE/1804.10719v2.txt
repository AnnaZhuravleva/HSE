I study the possibility of directly detecting Ultra-high energy (UHE from now on) WIMPs by the WIMPs interaction with the nuclei in the air. Since neutrinos dominate the events from the spherical crown near JEM-EUSO, all the events from this region are ignored in my work. Then I evaluate the numbers of UHE WIMPs and neutrino detected by JEM-EUSO at different energies (1 PeV < E < 100 EeV) in ten years, respectively. If the energy thresholds are taken to be 20 EeV, neutrino events can be almost rejected in the detection of UHE WIMPs. According to my evaluation, O(1) UHE WIMP events can be detected by JEM-EUSO at energies above 20 EeV in ten years.
