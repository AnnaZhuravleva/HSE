In this paper, we first discuss a series of important but puzzling physical mechanisms concerning the energy source, various kinds of core collapsed supernovae explosion mechanisms during central gravitational collapse in astrophysics. We also discuss the puzzle of possible association of $\gamma$-ray burst with gravitational wave perturbation, the heat source for the molten interior of the core of the earth and finally the puzzling problem of the cooling of white dwarfs. We then make use of the estimations for the space flux of magnetic monopoles (hereafter MMs) and nucleon decay induced by MMs (called the Rubakov-Callen(RC) effect) to obtain the luminosity due to the RC effect. In terms of the formula for this RC luminosity, we present a unified treatment for the heat source of the Earth's core, the energy source for the white dwarf interior, various kinds of core collapsed supernovae (Type II Supernova (SNII), Type Ib Supernova (SNIb), Type Ic Supernova (SNIc), Super luminous supernova (SLSN)), and the production mechanism for $\gamma$-ray burst. This unified model can also be used to reasonably explain the possible association of the short $\gamma$-ray burst detected by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Burst Monitoring Satellite (GBM) with the LIGO gravitational wave event GW150914 in September 2015.
