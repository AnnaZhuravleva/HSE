The discovery of GW170817 by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo Collaboration revealed not only that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light to a high degree of accuracy (5 parts in 10$^{16}$), but also this speed is independent of frequency, i.e. if gravitons exist they are massless just like photons. If, as in the case of light, gravitational waves are quantized into gravitons $\hbar\omega$ where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave, it will be possible to estimate the number of gravitons $N$ associated with a LIGO signal of duration $T$, by calculating the total energy of the signal from the oscillation of the mirrors. For the representative values of $T = 1$~s and $\omega = 125$~Hz, we find $N \approx 5\times 10^3$, corresponding to an interaction cross section $\sigma \approx 3 \times 10^{-22}$~cm$^2$, and a spectral strain $\tilde h \approx 7 \times 10^{-24}$~Hz$^{-1/2}$ at all frequencies and wave amplitudes due to graviton shot noise. This strain is on par with the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO. More generally, however, for waves of any frequency the sensitivity threshold at sampling frequency 1~kHz is given by the inequality $M\omega^2 < 8.75 \times 10^7~$g~Hz$^2$ (where $M$ is the mass of the mirror) and favors waves of lower frequencies irrespective of their amplitude, provided the observing time is long enough for some gravitons to be collected. Thus the gravitons of low frequency GW sources not normally accessible by LIGO may also contribute to the 1 kHz band shot noise.
