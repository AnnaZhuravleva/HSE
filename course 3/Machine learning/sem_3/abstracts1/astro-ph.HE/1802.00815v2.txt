The study of the electrodynamics of static, axisymmetric and force-free Kerr magnetospheres relies vastly on solutions of the so called relativistic Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE). Different numerical approaches to the solution of the GSE have been introduced in the literature, but none of them has been fully assessed from the numerical point of view in terms of efficiency and quality of the solutions found. We present a generalization of these algorithms and give detailed background on the algorithmic implementation. We assess the numerical stability of the implemented algorithms and quantify the convergence of the presented methodology for the most established setups (split-monopole, paraboloidal, BH-disk, uniform).
