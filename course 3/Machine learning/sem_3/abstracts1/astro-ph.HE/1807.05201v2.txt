On 22nd September 2017, the IceCube Collaboration detected a neutrino with energy of about 290 TeV from the direction of the gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056, located at a distance of about 1.75 Gpc. During the same time, enhanced gamma-ray flaring was also simultaneously observed from multiple telescopes, giving rise to only the second coincident astrophysical neutrino/photon observation after SN 1987A. We point out that for this event, both neutrinos and photons encountered a Shapiro delay of about 6300 days along the way from the source. From this delay and the relative time difference between the neutrino and photon arrival times, one can constrain violations of Einstein's Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) for TeV neutrinos. We constrain such violations of WEP using the Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter $\gamma$, and is given by $|\gamma_{\rm {\nu}}-\gamma_{\rm{EM}}|<4.8 \times 10^{-3}$, for an arrival time difference of 15 days. This is the first direct proof that TeV neutrinos couple to gravity in the same way as photons.
