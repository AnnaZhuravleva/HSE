We present a comprehensive and pedagogic discussion of the properties of photons in cold and dense nuclear matter based on the resummed one-loop photon self energy. Correlations between electrons, muons, protons and neutrons in beta equilibrium that arise due to electromagnetic and strong interactions are consistently taken into account within the random phase approximation. Screening effects and damping as well as collective excitations are systematically studied in a fully relativistic setup. Our study is relevant to linear response theory of dense nuclear matter, calculations of transport properties of cold dense matter and to investigations of the production and propagation of hypothetical vector bosons such as the dark photons.
