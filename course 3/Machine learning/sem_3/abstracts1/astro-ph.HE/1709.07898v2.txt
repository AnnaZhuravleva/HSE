A novel equation of state with the surface tension induced by particles' interactions was generalized to describe the properties of the neutron stars (NSs). In this equation the interaction between particles occurs via the hard core repulsion by taking into account the proper volumes of particles. Recently, this model was successfully applied to the description of the properties of nuclear and hadron matter created in collisions of nucleons. The new approach is free of causality problems and is fully thermodynamically consistent, which enables us to use it for the investigation of the strongly interacting matter phase-diagram properties in a wide range of temperatures and baryon densities, including NSs. Here, we have calculated the mass-radius relations for a compact star using the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equation for two sets of parameters that satisfy the existing constraints. Accordingly, we found parameter values that are in good agreement with the same ones obtained from the nuclear-nuclear collision data analysis. The astrophysical constraints suggest that the hard core radius of baryons can vary between 0.425 fm and 0.476 fm.
