When a supernova explodes, most of its energy is released in a shell of relativistic neutirnos which changes the surrounding geometry. We calculate the potentially observable responses to such a change in both pulsar scintillation and conventional interferometers. In both cases, the responses are permanent changes due to such a transient event. This is by-definition a memory effect. In addition to the transverse component in the usual gravitational memory (Christodolou effect) effect, it also has a longitudinal component. Furthermore it is different from the Christodolou effect as the transverse component of this memory effect also has a term that grows with time.
