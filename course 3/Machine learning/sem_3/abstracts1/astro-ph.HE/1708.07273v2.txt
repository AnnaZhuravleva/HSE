Galactic diffuse emission has provided us with evidence for cosmic ray acceleration throughout the Galaxy and the background for searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. However, only the very limited measurements of the diffuse flux are available in TeV $\gamma$ rays. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory is well-suited for observing the diffuse emission of very high energy with its unbiased, wide field of view (2 sr). Using data from HAWC, we present techniques for measuring the diffuse flux and show preliminary results.
