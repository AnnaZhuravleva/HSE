Recently, gamma-ray emission in the direction of Coma, with a TS value of $\sim 40$, has been reported. In this work we will discuss the possibility of such a residual emission coming from dark matter annihilation. Our results show that the gamma-ray emission within the Coma region is also spatially correlated to the mass distribution derived from weak gravitational lensing measurements very well. However the dark matter models are not supported by the spectral analysis results and constraints by observations of other targets. Thus we derive the upper limits of the dark matter annihilation cross section according to the observation of the Coma region.
