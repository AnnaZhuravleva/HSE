In the weak-field limit of General Relativity, gravitational waves obey linear equations and propagate at the speed of light. These properties of General Relativity are supported by the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays as well as by LIGO's recent detection of gravitation waves. We argue that two existing relativistic generalizations of Modified Newtonian Dynamics, namely Generalized Einstein-Aether theory and BIMOND, display fatal inconsistencies with these observations.
