Tidal deformability, moment of inertia and quadrupole moment of merger components of GW170817 are investigated using different equations of state (EoSs) involving nucleons, $\Lambda$ hyperons, quarks resulting in $2M_{\odot}$ neutron stars. This calculation is performed for low spin case. It is found from the computations of tidal deformability parameters that soft to moderately stiff equations of state are allowed by the 50\text{\%} and 90\text{\%} credible regions obtained from the gravitational wave observation of binary neutron star merger GW170817, whereas the stiffest hadron-quark EoSs which lie above the upper 90\text{\%} limit, are ruled out. Next moment of inertia and quadrupole moment are calculated for merger component masses (1.58, 1.18) M$_{\odot}$. It follows from the calculation that the upper bounds on moments of inertia of merger components might be constrained in the range $\sim 1-2 \times 10^{45}$ g cm$^2$. As masses and moments of inertia are known, it is possible to estimate the radii of merger components which are $\sim 13$ km. The upper bounds on quadrupole moments of the merger components are found to be 0.29-0.3 $\times 10^{43}$ g cm$^2$.
