The search for the origin of cosmic rays is as active as ever, mainly driven by new insights provided by recent pieces of observation. Much effort is being channelled in putting the so called supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays on firmer grounds, while at the highest energies we are trying to understand the observed cosmic ray spectra and mass composition and relating them to potential sources of extragalactic cosmic rays. Interestingly, a topic that has acquired a dignity of its own is the investigation of the transition region between the galactic and extragalactic components, once associated with the ankle and now increasingly thought to be taking place at somewhat lower energies. Here we summarize recent developments in the observation and understanding of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays and we discuss the implications of such findings for the modelling of the transition between the two.
