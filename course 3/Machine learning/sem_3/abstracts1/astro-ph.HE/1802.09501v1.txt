For more than forty years virtually all work on the theory of type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) has assumed that these explosions were due to the transfer of mass to a degenerate star from a partner in a binary system. In these binary models, when the mass of one partner closely approaches the Chandrasekhar maximum for a stable degenerate system, fusion can be initiated and the star explodes. However, there are now a number of indications that fusion could instead be triggered by a phase transition in a sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf star. Although these indications provide no clue as to what specific phase transition initiates the explosion, it is possible that remarkable and well established host galaxy effects as considered in the present work could point to a specific source of the energy deposition. These host galaxy correlations are, at first glance, surprising since the typical distance scale of white dwarf stars is the earth radius while the typical distance between stars is at the light year scale. Performing a least $\chi^2$ fit to the delay time distribution to fix parameters, we give predictions from the susy phase transition model for the host galaxy effects. In addition we discuss a susy insight into the Phillips relation which is basic to the cosmological importance of the type Ia supernovae.
