Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely argued to originate from binary compact object mergers or core collapses of massive stars. Jets from these systems may have two components, an inner, narrow sub-jet and an outer, wider sub-jet. Such a jet subsequently interacts with its ambient gas, leading to a reverse shock (RS) and a forward shock (FS). The magnetic field in the narrow sub-jet is very likely to be mixed by an ordered component and a random component during the afterglow phase. In this paper, we calculate light curves and polarization evolution of optical afterglows with this mixed magnetic field in the RS region of the narrow sub-jet in a two-component jet model. The resultant light curve has two peaks: an early peak arises from the narrow sub-jet and a late-time rebrightening is due to the wider sub-jet. We find the polarization degree (PD) evolution under such a mixed magnetic field confined in the shock plane is very similar to that under the purely ordered magnetic field condition. The two-dimensional `mixed' magnetic fields confined in the shock plane are essentially the ordered magnetic fields only with different configurations. The position angle (PA) of the two-component jet can change gradually or abruptly by $90^\circ$. In particular, an abrupt $90^\circ$ change of the PA occurs when the PD changes from its decline phase to rise phase.
