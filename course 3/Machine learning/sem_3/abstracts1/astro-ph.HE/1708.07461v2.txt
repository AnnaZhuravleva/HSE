The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory is a wide field-of-view observatory sensitive to 0.5 TeV - 100 TeV gamma-rays and cosmic-rays in the State of Puebla, Mexico at an altitude of 4100m. The HAWC observatory performed an indirect search for dark matter via GeV-TeV photons resulting from dark matter annihilation and decay considering various sources, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), the M31 galaxy and the Virgo cluster, as well as a combined limit using the dSphs. HAWC has not seen statistically significant excess from these sources. We searched for dark matter annihilation and decay at dark matter masses above 1 TeV. We will present the annihilation cross-section and decay lifetime limits.
