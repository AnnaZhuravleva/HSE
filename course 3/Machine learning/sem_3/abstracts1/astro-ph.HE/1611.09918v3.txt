Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG) is a theory that does not require dark components to describe astrophysical data. We aim at constraining the free parameters of STVG based on recent observations of the jet in M87. We derive the equations of motion for particles in STVG-Kerr spacetime, we develop a numerical code that integrates such equations, and apply it to the jet of M87. We find that STVG deviates from GR and we set new upper limits for the free parameters of the former. We conclude that STVG is not contradicted by the observational data of M87, and may help to explain jet formation.
