Neutron stars are the endpoint of the life of intermediate mass stars and posses in their cores matter in the most extreme conditions in the universe. Besides their extremes of temperature (found in proto-neutron stars) and densities, typical neutron star' magnetic fields can easily reach trillions of times higher the one of the Sun. Among these stars, about $10\%$ are denominated \emph{magnetars} which possess even stronger surface magnetic fields of up to $10^{15}-10^{16}\,\mathrm{G}$. In this conference proceeding, we present a short review of the history and current literature regarding the modeling of magnetic neutron stars. Our goal is to present the results regarding the introduction of magnetic fields in the equation of state of matter using Relativistic Mean Field models (RMF models) and in the solution of Einstein's equations coupled to the Maxwell's equations in order to generate a consistent calculation of magnetic stars structure. We discuss how equation of state modeling affects mass, radius, deformation, composition and magnetic field distribution in stars and also what are the open questions in this field of research.
