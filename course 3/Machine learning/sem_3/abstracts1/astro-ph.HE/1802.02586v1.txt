We investigate the ability of ground based gravitational wave observatories to detect gravitational wave lensing events caused by stellar mass lenses. We show that LIGO and Virgo possess the sensitivities required to detect lenses with masses as small as $\sim 30 M_\odot$ provided that the gravitational wave is observed with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim30$. Third generation observatories will allow detection of gravitational wave lenses with masses of $\sim 1 M_\odot$. Finally, we discuss the possibility of lensing by multiple stars, as is the case if the gravitational radiation is passing through galactic nucleus or a dense star cluster.
