After more than forty years since the basic standard model for supernovae Ia was proposed many astronomers are still hopeful that this phenomenon will ultimately be understood in terms of Newtonian gravity plus nuclear and particle physics as they existed in the 1930's. In spite of this fact there are at least six nagging puzzles in supernova physics that suggest some radical new physics input may be necessary. "Radical" in this context means a physics idea that did not exist in the 1930's and that is still not experimentally confirmed in 2017.
