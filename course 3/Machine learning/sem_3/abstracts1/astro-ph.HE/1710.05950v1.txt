We discuss the role of dynamical tidal effects for inspiralling neutron star binaries, focussing on features that may be considered "unmodelled" in gravitational-wave searches. In order to cover the range of possibilities, we consider i) individual oscillation modes becoming resonant with the tide, ii) the elliptical instability, where a pair of inertial modes exhibit a nonlinear resonance with the tide, and iii) the non-resonant p-g instability which may arise as high order p- and g-modes in the star couple nonlinearly to the tide. In each case, we estimate the amount of additional energy loss that needs to be associated with the dynamical tide in order for the effect to impact on an observed gravitational-wave signal. We explore to what extent the involved neutron star physics may be considered known and how one may be able to use observational data to constrain theory.
