We investigate current and future prospects for coincident detection of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves (GWs). Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are believed to originate from mergers of compact star binaries involving neutron stars. We estimate high-energy neutrino fluences from prompt emission, extended emission, X-ray flares, and plateau emission, and show that neutrino signals associated with the extended emission are the most promising. Assuming that the cosmic-ray loading factor is $\sim10$ and the Lorentz factor distribution is lognormal, we calculate the probability of neutrino detection from extended emission by current and future neutrino detectors, and find that the quasi-simultaneous detection of high-energy neutrinos, gamma rays, and GWs is possible with future instruments or even with current instruments for nearby SGRBs having extended emission. We also discuss stacking analyses that will also be useful with future experiments such as IceCube-Gen2.
