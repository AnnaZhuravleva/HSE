Supernovae (SNe) with strong interactions with circumstellar material (CSM) are promising candidate sources of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays, and have been suggested as an important contributor to Galactic cosmic rays beyond 1 PeV. Taking into account the shock dissipation by a fast velocity component of SN ejecta, we present comprehensive calculations of the non-thermal emission from SNe powered by shock interactions with a dense wind or CSM. Remarkably, we consider electromagnetic cascades in the radiation zone and subsequent attenuation in the pre-shock CSM. A new time-dependent phenomenological prescription provided by this work enables us to calculate gamma-ray, hard X-ray, radio, and neutrino signals, which originate from cosmic rays accelerated by the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We apply our results to SN IIn 2010jl and SN Ibn 2014C, for which the model parameters can be determined from the multi-wavelength data. For SN 2010jl, the more promising case, by using the the latest Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8 data release, we derive new constraints on the cosmic-ray energy fraction, <0.05-0.1. We also find that the late-time radio data of these interacting SNe are consistent with our model. Further multi-messenger and multi-wavelength observations of nearby interacting SNe should give us new insights into the diffusive shock acceleration in dense environments as well as pre-SN mass-loss mechanisms.
