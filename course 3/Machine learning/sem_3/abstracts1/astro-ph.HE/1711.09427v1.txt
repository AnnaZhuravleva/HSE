For core-collapse and neutron star merger simulations it is important to have at hand adequate equations of state, describing the underlying dense and hot matter as realistically as possible. Here, we present two newly constructed equation of state (EoS) including the entire baryon octet. Both EoS are compatible with the main constraints from nuclear physics, both experimental and theoretical. One of the EoS is equally describing maximum mass for cold $\beta$-equilibrated neutron stars of $2 M_\odot$ in agreement with recent observations. The predictions obtained with the new EoS are compared with the results obtained with DD2Y, the only presently existing EoS containing the baryon octet, that satisfies the same constraints within uncertainties. The main difference between our new EoS models and DD2Y is the harder symmetry energy of the latter. We show that the density dependence of the symmetry energy has a direct influence on the amount of strangeness inside hot and dense matter and consequently on thermodynamic quantities, e.g. the temperature for given entropy per baryon. We expect these differences to affect the evolution of a protoneutron star or binary neutron star mergers. We also propose several parametrizations calibrated to $\Lambda$ hypernuclei based on the DD2 and SFHo models that satisfy the two solar mass constraint.
