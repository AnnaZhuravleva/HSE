The tentative 1.4 TeV excess in the $e^+e^-$ spectrum measured by The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) motivates the possible existence of one or more local dark matter concentrated regions. In particular, Ultra-compact Micro Halos (UCMHs) seeded by large density perturbations in the early universe, allocated within ~0.3 kpc from the solar system, could provide the potential source of electrons and positrons produced from dark matter annihilation, enough to explain the DAMPE signal. Here we consider a UCMH with density profile assuming radial in-fall and explore the preferred halo parameters to explain the 1.4 TeV "DAMPE excess". We find that typical parameter space of UCMHs can easily explain the "DAMPE excess" with usual thermal-averaged annihilation cross section of WIMP. The fraction of dark matter stored in such UCMHs in the Galactic-scale halo can be reduced to as small as $O(10^{-5})$, well within the current cosmological and astrophysical constraints.
