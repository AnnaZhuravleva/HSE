In this work, we follow several stages of quasi-stationary evolution of a massive and rapidly rotating protoneutron star (PNS) with hyperon content. We use a density-dependent (DD) relativistic mean field theory (RMF) model and calculate different quantities such as mass, equatorial radius, moment of inertia, quadrupole moment etc. to get different rotating configurations. We study the effect of the appearance of the lightest of all hyperons, $\Lambda$, on the evolutionary stages of the PNS. We also check its sensitivity to the inclusion of $\phi$ vector meson as a mediator of $\Lambda-\Lambda$ interaction in detail. Finally, we investigate the universal relations between moment of inertia and compactness in this context of a hot and young compact object.
