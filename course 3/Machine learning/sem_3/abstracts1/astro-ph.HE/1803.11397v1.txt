It is well known that a gravitational wave (GW) experiences the damping effect when it propagates in a fluid with nonzero shear viscosity. In this paper, we propose a new method to constrain the GW damping rate and thus the fluid shear viscosity. By defining the effective distance which incorporates damping effects, we can transform the GW strain expression in a viscous Universe into the same form as that in a perfect fluid. Therefore, the constraints of the luminosity distances from the observed GW events by LIGO and Virgo can be directly applied to the effective distances in our formalism. We exploit the lognormal likelihoods for the available GW effective distances and a Gaussian likelihood for the luminosity distance inferred from the electromagnetic radiation observation of the binary neutron star merger event GW170817. Our fittings show no obvious damping effects in the current GW data, and the upper limit on the damping rate with the combined data is $6.75 \times 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence level. By assuming that the dark matter self-scatterings are efficient enough for the hydrodynamic description to be valid, we find that a GW event from its source at a luminosity distance $D\gtrsim 10^4\;\rm Mpc$ can be used to put a constraint on the dark matter self-interactions.
