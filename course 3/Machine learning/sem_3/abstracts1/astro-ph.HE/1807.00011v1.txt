Gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) signals from the merger of a Neutron Star (NS) and a Black Hole (BH) are a highly anticipated discovery in extreme gravity, nuclear-, and astrophysics. We develop a simple formula that distinguishes between merger outcomes and predicts the post-merger remnant mass, validated with 75 simulations. Our formula improves on existing results by describing critical unexplored regimes: comparable masses and higher BH spins. These are important to differentiate NSNS from NSBH mergers, and to infer source physics from EM signals.
