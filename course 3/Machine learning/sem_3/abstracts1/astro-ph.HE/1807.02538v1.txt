Gravitational wave detectors in the LIGO/Virgo frequency band are able to measure the individual masses and the composite tidal deformabilities of neutron-star binary systems. This paper demonstrates that high accuracy measurements of these quantities from an ensemble of binary systems can in principle be used to determine the high density neutron-star equation of state exactly. This analysis assumes that all neutron stars have the same thermodynamically stable equation of state, but does not use simplifying approximations for the composite tidal deformability or make additional assumptions about the high density equation of state.
