The fraction of halo events among gamma-hadron families with SUM(Egamma) > 500 TeV is analyzed. The comparison of experimental data and Monte-Carlo simulations by MC0 code of quark-gluon string model under various assumptions on the PCR mass composition suggests a slowly increasing contribution of nuclei heavier than protons and alpha-particles to PCR mass composition. Effective atomic number of PCR particles changes in the energy interval 10^15-10^17 eV so that lnA grows from 2 to 2.5.
