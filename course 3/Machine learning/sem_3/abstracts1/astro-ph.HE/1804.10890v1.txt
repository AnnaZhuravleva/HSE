We investigate the impact of charged-current neutrino processes on the formation and evolution of neutrino spectra in simulations of core-collapse supernovae and the deleptonization of proto-neutron stars. We systematically discuss the impact of weak magnetism corrections on $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ spectra. Furthermore, we explore the role of the inverse neutron decay, also known as the direct Urca process, on the emitted spectra of $\bar\nu_e$. This process is commonly considered in cold neutron stars but has so far been neglected in the evolution of hot proto-neutron stars. We find that the inverse neutron decay becomes the dominating opacity source for low-energy $\bar\nu_e$ at timescales of a few seconds. Accurate three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport enables us to relate the magnitude of neutrino fluxes and spectra to details of the treatment of weak processes. This allows us to quantify the corresponding impact on the conditions relevant for the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino-driven wind ejected from the proto-neutron star surface, during the deleptonization phase.
