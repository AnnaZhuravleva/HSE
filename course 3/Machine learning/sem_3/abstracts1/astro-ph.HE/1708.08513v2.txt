We suggest the future detection of neutrinos from a Galactic core-collapse supernova can be used to infer the progenitor's inner mass density structure. We present the results from 20 axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations performed with progenitors spanning initial masses in the range 11--30Msun, and focus on their connections to the progenitor compactness. The compactness is a measure of the mass density profile of the progenitor core and recent investigations have suggested its salient connections to the outcomes of core collapse. Our simulations confirm a correlation between the neutrinos emitted during the accretion phase and the progenitor's compactness, and that the ratio of observed neutrino events during the first hundreds of milliseconds provides a promising handle on the progenitor's inner structure. Neutrino flavor mixing during the accretion phase remains a large source of uncertainty.
