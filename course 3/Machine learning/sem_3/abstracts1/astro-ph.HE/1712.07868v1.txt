Gluons dominate the proton behavior at high energy collisions, they can be condensed at ultra high energy. The collisions of the accelerated high energy protons with interplanetary matter in cosmic rays will produce a huge number of secondary particles at the gluon condensate energy region, which break the primary power-law of cosmic rays. The above predictions seem to be consistent with the recent DAMPE data concerning the electron plus positron spectra. We find that the smoothly broken power-law at $\sim 0.9 TeV$ and $3\sim 4 TeV$ in the DAMPE data can be understood as the gluon condensation effects in proton.
