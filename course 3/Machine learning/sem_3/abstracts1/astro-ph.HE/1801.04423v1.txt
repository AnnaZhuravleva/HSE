The VHE emission from the HBLs H 2356-309 and 1ES 1101-232 were observed by HESS telescopes during 2004--2007. Particularly the observation in 2004 from H 2356-309 and during 2004--2005 from 1ES 1101-232 were analyzed to derive strong upper limits on the EBL which was found to be consistent with the lower limits from the integrated light of resolved galaxies. Here we have used the photohadronic model corroborated by two template EBL models to fit the observed VHE gamma-ray data from these two HBLs and to predict their intrinsic spectra. We obtain very good fit to the VHE spectra of these two HBLs. However, the predicted intrinsic spectra are different for different EBL models. For the HBL H 2356-309, we obtain a flat intrinsic spectrum and for 1ES 1101-232 the spectrum is mildly harder than 2 but much softer than 1.5.
