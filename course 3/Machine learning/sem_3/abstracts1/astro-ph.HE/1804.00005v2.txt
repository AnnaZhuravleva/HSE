Modeling electromagnetic cascades during gamma-ray transport is important in many applications within astrophysics. This document introduces {\gamma}-Cascade, a publicly available Mathematica package which allows users to calculate observed gamma-ray fluxes from point sources as well as from a distribution of sources. {\gamma}-Cascade semi-analytically computes the effects of electromagnetic interactions during gamma-ray transport.
