The gravitational lensing of a finite star moving around a rotating Kerr black hole has been numerically calculated. Calculations for the direct image of the star and for the first and second light echoes have been performed for the star moving with an orbital period of 3.22 h around the supermassive black hole SgrA* at the Galactic Center. Time dependences for the observed star position on the celestial sphere, radiation flux from the star, frequency of detected radiation, major and minor semiaxes of the lensed star image have been calculated and plotted. The detailed observation of such lensing requires a space interferometer such as the Russian Millimetron project.
