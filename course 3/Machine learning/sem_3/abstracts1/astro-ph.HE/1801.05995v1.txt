Markarian 421 is a high-peaked BL Lac object and has undergone many major outbursts since its discovery in 1992. Through dedicated multiwavelength observations, Markarian 421 has been studied intensively and several major multi-TeV flares have been observed by Cherenkov telescope arrays. The major outbursts of April 2004 observed by Whipple telescopes and of February 2010 by HESS telescopes are explained well in this work by using the photohadronic model. To account for the attenuation of these high energy gamma-rays by the extragalactic background light, we use template EBL models. During different epochs of flaring the calculated intrinsic fluxes are not the same due to the change in the power-law dependence of the seed photon densities in the tail region of the SSC band. Our results show that the contemporaneous multiwavelength observations, particularly in the tail region of the SSC band of the source is important to explain the flaring phenomena.
