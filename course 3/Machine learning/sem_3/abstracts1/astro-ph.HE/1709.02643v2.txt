Outcomes of numerical relativity simulations of massive core collapses or binary neutron star mergers with moderate masses suggest formations of rapidly and differentially rotating neutron stars. Subsequent fall back accretion may also amplify the degree of differential rotations. We propose new formulations for modeling differential rotations of those compact stars, and present selected solutions of differentially rotating, stationary, and axisymmetric compact stars in equilibriums. For the cases when rotating stars reach break-up velocities, the maximum masses of such rotating models are obtained.
