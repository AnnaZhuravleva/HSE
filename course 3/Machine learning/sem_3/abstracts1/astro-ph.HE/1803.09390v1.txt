Recently the Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature (EDGES) reported the detection of a 21cm absorption signal stronger than astrophysical expectations. In this paper we study the impact of radiation from dark matter (DM) decay and primordial black holes (PBH) on the 21cm radiation temperature in the reionization epoch, and impose a constraint on the decaying dark matter and PBH energy injection in the intergalactic medium, which can heat up neutral hydrogen gas and weaken the 21cm absorption signal. We consider decay channels DM$\rightarrow e^+e^-, \gamma\gamma$, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $b\bar{b}$ and the $10^{15-17}$g mass range for primordial black holes, and require the heating of the neutral hydrogen does not negate the 21cm absorption signal. For $e^+e^-$, $\gamma\gamma$ final states and PBH cases we find strong 21cm bounds that can be more stringent than the current extragalactic diffuse photon bounds. For the DM$\rightarrow e^+e^-$ channel, the lifetime bound is $\tau_{\rm DM}> 10^{27}$s for sub-GeV dark matter. The bound is $\tau_{\rm DM}\ge 10^{26}$s for sub-GeV DM$\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ channel and reaches $10^{27}$s at MeV DM mass. For $b\bar{b}$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ cases, the 21 cm constraint is better than all the existing constraints for $m_{\rm DM}<20$ GeV where the bound on $\tau_{\rm DM}\ge10^{26}$s. For both DM decay and primordial black hole cases, the 21cm bounds significantly improve over the CMB damping limits from Planck data.
