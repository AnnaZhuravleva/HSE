A simple mixed phase model mimicking so-called "pasta" phases in the quark-hadron phase transition is developed and applied to static neutron stars for the case of DD2 type hadonic and NJL type quark matter models. The influence of the mixed phase on the mass-radius relation of the compact stars is investigated. Model parameters are chosen such that the results are in agreement with the observational constraints for masses and radii of pulsars.
