We derive some of the most stringent constraints on neutrino speed, weak equivalence principle violation, Lorentz invariance violation, and dual lensing from the first high-energy astrophysical neutrino source: TXS 0506+056. Observation of neutrino (IceCube-170922A) and photons in a similar time frame and from the same direction is used to derive these limits. All of these constraints are stronger than those obtained from the observation of SN 1987A. We describe ways in which these constraints can be further improved by orders of magnitude.
