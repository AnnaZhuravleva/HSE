The gravitational wave data of GW170817 favor the equation of state (EoS) models that predict compact neutron stars (NSs), consistent with the radius constraints from X-ray observations. Motivated by such a remarkable progress, we examine the fate of the remnants formed in NS mergers and focus on the roles of the angular momentum and the mass distribution of the binary NSs. In the mass shedding limit (for which the dimensionless angular momentum equals to the Keplerian value, i.e., $j=j_{\rm Kep}$), the adopted { seven EoS models, except H4 and ALF2,} yield supramassive NSs in more than half of the mergers. However, for $j\lesssim 0.7j_{\rm Kep}$, the presence or absence of a non-negligible fraction of supramassive NSs formed in the mergers depends sensitively on both the EoS and the mass distribution of the binary systems. The NS mergers with a total gravitational mass $\leq 2.6M_\odot$ are found to be able to shed valuable light on both the EoS model and the angular momentum of the remnants if supramassive NSs are still absent. We have also discussed the uncertainty on estimating the maximum gravitational mass of non-rotating NSs ($M_{\rm max}$) due to the unknown $j$ of the pre-collapse remnants. With the data of GW170817 and the assumption of the mass loss of $0.03M_\odot$, we have $M_{\rm max}<(2.19,~2.32)M_\odot$ (90\% confidence level) for $j=(1.0,~0.8)j_{\rm Kep}$, respectively.
