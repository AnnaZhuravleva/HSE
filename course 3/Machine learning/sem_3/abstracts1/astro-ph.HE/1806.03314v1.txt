The thermodynamical properties of the equation of state (EoS) of high-density matter (above nuclear saturation density) and the possible existence of exotic states such as phase transitions from nuclear/hadronic matter into quark-gluon plasma, may critically influence the stability and dynamics of compact relativistic stars. From a theoretical point of view, establishing the existence of those states requires the analysis of the "convexity" of the EoS. There are indications of the existence of possible regions in the dense-matter EoS where the thermodynamics may actually be non-convex. Flows subject to non-convex dynamics, dubbed Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (or BZT) flows, are characterized by the appearance of compound waves (rarefaction shocks) during the evolution. Moreover, these fluids may develop a non-monotonic dependence of the sound speed with the rest-mass density. In this paper we investigate the effects of a phenomenological, non-convex EoS on the equilibrium structure of stable compact stars and on the dynamics of unstable neutron stars that collapse gravitationally to black holes, both for spherically symmetric and uniformly-rotating configurations. We show how the dynamics of the collapse with a non-convex EoS greatly departs from the convex case, leaving distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveforms. The astrophysical significance of these results for microphysical EoSs is briefly discussed.
