Floquet symmetry protected topological (FSPT) phases are non-equilibrium topological phases enabled by time-periodic driving. FSPT phases of 1d chains of bosons, spins, or qubits host dynamically protected edge states that can store quantum information without decoherence, making them promising for use as quantum memories. While FSPT order cannot be detected by any local measurement, here we construct non-local string order parameters that directly measure general 1d FSPT order. We propose a superconducting-qubit array based realization of the simplest Ising-FSPT, which can be implemented with existing quantum computing hardware. We devise an interferometric scheme to directly measure the non-local string order using only simple one- and two- qubit operations and single-qubit measurements.
