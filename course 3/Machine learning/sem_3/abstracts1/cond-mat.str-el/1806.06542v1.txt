Quantum spin liquids remain one of the most challenging subjects of quantum magnetism. Characterized by massive degenerate ground states that have long range entanglement and are locally indistinguishable, highly demanding numerical techniques are often needed to describe them. Here we propose an easy computational method based on exact diagonalization with engineered boundary conditions to unveil their most significant features in small lattices. We derive the quantum phase diagram of diverse antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models in the triangular lattice. For all studied cases, our results are in accordance with the previous results obtained by means of sophisticated variational methods.
