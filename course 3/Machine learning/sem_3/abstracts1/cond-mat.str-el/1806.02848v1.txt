We present an ab initio auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo method for studying the electronic structure of molecules, solids, and model Hamiltonians at finite temperature. The algorithm marries the phaseless auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm known to produce high accuracy ground state energies with the finite temperature determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm long used by condensed matter physicists to study model Hamiltonian phase diagrams to yield a phaseless finite temperature method. We demonstrate that the method produces internal energies within chemical accuracy of exact diagonalization results across a wide range of temperatures for H$_{2}$O, C$_{2}$, the one-dimensional hydrogen chain, and the multi-orbital Hubbard model. The phase problem is effectively controlled down to temperatures at which the systems studied near their ground states through importance sampling, often even without invoking the phaseless approximation. Our method entails an important tool for studying the finite temperature phase diagrams of systems whose properties cannot be captured by a Hubbard U term alone. Our results moreover shed light on the relative severity of the phase problem for, and therefore the ultimate computational complexity of, several different classes of Hamiltonians.
