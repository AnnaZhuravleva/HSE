Recently, there has been an increased interest in studying quantum entanglement and quantum coherence. Since both of these properties are attributed to the existence of quantum superposition, it would be useful to determine if some type of correlation between them exists. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore the type of the correlation in several systems with different types of anisotropy. The focus will be on the XY spin chains with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the type of the mentioned bond will be explored using the quantum renormalization group method.
