The concept of Lefschetz thimble decomposition is one of the most promising possible modifications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms aimed at alleviating the sign problem which appears in many interesting physical situations, e.g. in the Hubbard model away from half filling. In this approach one utilizes the fact that the integral over real variables with an integrand containing a complex fluctuating phase is equivalent to the sum of integrals over special manifolds in complex space ("Lefschetz thimbles"), each of them having a fixed complex phase factor. Thus, the sign problem can be reduced if the resulting sum contains terms with only a few different phases. We explore the complexity of the sign problem for the few-site Hubbard model on square lattice combining a semi-analytical study of saddle points and thimbles in small lattices with several steps in Euclidean time with results of test QMC calculations. We check different variants of conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation based on Gaussian integrals. On the basis of our analysis we reveal a regime with minimal number of relevant thimbles in the vicinity of half filling. In this regime we found only two relevant thimbles for the few-site lattices studied in the paper. There is also indirect evidence of the existence of this regime in more realistic systems with large number of Euclidean time slices. In addition, we derive a new non-Gaussian representation of the interaction term, where the number of relevant Lefschetz is also reduced in comparison with conventional Gaussian Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.
