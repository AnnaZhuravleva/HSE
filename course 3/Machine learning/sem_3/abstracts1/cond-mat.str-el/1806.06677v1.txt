We derive the bulk-boundary correspondence for three-dimensional topological insulators with quantized magneto-electric responses using operator algebraic methods. Both the exponential and the index connecting maps of K-theory are used to predict several surface phenomena when halved samples are driven in adiabatic cycles, such as pumping and transfer of Hall states. The surface Hall physics of time-reversal symmetric topological insulators, as well as related anomalous quantum Hall and axion insulators, are investigated using the new tools.
