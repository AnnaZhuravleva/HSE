The variational reduced density matrix theory has been recently applied with great success to models within the truncated doubly-occupied configuration interaction space, which corresponds to the seniority zero subspace. Conservation of the seniority quantum number restricts the Hamiltonians to be based on the SU(2) algebra. Among them there is a whole family of exactly solvable Richardson-Gaudin pairing Hamiltonians. We benchmark the variational theory against two different exactly solvable models, the Richardson-Gaudin-Kitaev and the reduced BCS Hamiltonians. We obtain exact numerical results for the so-called PQGT N-representability conditions in both cases for systems that go from 10 to 100 particles. However, when random single-particle energies as appropriate for small superconducting grains are considered, the exactness is lost but still a high accuracy is obtained.
