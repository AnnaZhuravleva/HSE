We construct an exactly solvable quantum impurity model consists of spin-1/2 conduction fermions and spin-1/2 magnetic moments. The ground-state wave function is a homogeneous Jastrow type polynomial and the parent Hamiltonian has nearest-neighbor hopping terms between the conduction fermions and inverse-square spin-exchange terms between the conduction fermions and the magnetic moments. The spin-spin correlation function between the conduction fermions and the magnetic moments and the low-lying energy levels of the parent Hamiltonian demonstrate that our model captures essential aspects of the spin-1/2 Kondo problem. The low-energy physics of our model is described by a boundary conformal field theory (CFT) and a particular correlator of this CFT reproduces the ground-state wave function. This connection paves the way toward constructing more exactly solvable quantum impurity models using boundary CFT.
