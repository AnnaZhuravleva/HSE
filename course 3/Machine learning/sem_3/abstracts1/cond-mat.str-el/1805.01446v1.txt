Exotic non-Abelian quasiparticles are believed to occur in certain fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states when effective three-body correlations form between spin-polarized electrons in the first excited Landau level. Inspired by recent observations of exotic physics from Floquet engineering, we investigate periodic driving of anisotropic two-body interactions as an alternative route for realizing robust non-Abelian multicomponent FQH states. We develop an analytic formalism to describe this Floquet FQH protocol, which is distinct from previous proposals that modulate single-body hoppings for bandstructure engineering. Our Floquet mechanism is shown to lead to highly-tunable three-body interactions that can be repulsive as well as attractive. We systematically analyze the resulting interactions with generalized pseudopotentials, and numerically demonstrate that they support a variety of non-Abelian multicomponent FQH phases. Finally, we propose a realistic implementation of our Floquet mechanism in optically dressed ultracold polar molecules with modulated Rabi frequencies.
