Tensor networks are often used to accurately represent ground states of quantum spin chains. Two popular choices of such tensor network representations can be seen to implement linear maps that correspond, respectively, to euclidean time evolution and to global scale transformations. In this paper, by exploiting the local structure of the tensor networks, we explain how to also implement local or non-uniform versions of both euclidean time evolution and scale transformations. We demonstrate our proposal with a critical quantum spin chain on a finite circle, where the low energy physics is described by a conformal field theory (CFT), and where non-uniform euclidean time evolution and local scale transformations are conformal transformations acting on the Hilbert space of the CFT. We numerically show, for the critical quantum Ising chain, that the proposed tensor networks indeed transform the low energy states of the periodic spin chain in the same way as the corresponding conformal transformations do in the CFT.
