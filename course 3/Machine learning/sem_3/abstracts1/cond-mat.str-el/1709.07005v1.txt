We study Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions (2D) coupled to strongly fluctuating U(1) gauge fields in the presence of quenched disorder. Such systems are dual to theories of free Dirac fermions, which are vortices of the original theory. In analogy to superconductivity, when these fermionic vortices localize, the original system becomes a perfect conductor, and when the vortices possess a finite conductivity, the original fermions do as well. We provide several realizations of this principle and thereby introduce new examples of strongly interacting 2D metals that evade Anderson localization.
