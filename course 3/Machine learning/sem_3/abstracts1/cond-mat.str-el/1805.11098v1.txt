A mysterious incoherent metallic (IM) normal state with $T$-linear resistivity is ubiquitous among strongly correlated superconductors. Recent progress with microscopic models exhibiting IM transport has presented the opportunity for us to study new models that exhibit direct transitions into a superconducting state out of IM states within the framework of connected Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) "quantum dots". Here local SYK interactions within a dot produce IM transport in the normal state, while local attractive interactions drive superconductivity. Through explicit calculations, we find two features of superconductivity arising from an IM normal state: First, despite the absence of quasiparticles in the normal state, the superconducting state still exhibits coherent superfluid transport. Second, the non-quasiparticle nature of the IM Green's functions produces a large enhancement in the gap ratio $2\Delta/T_c$ with respect to its BCS value of $3.53$.
