Using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, we calculate the dynamic spin structure factor at low temperatures $0<T\ll J$ for the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg kagome model, which at $T=0$ hosts a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid phase. We find that the spin gap rapidly fills with temperature, with robust low-energy spectral weight developing by a temperature of $0.05J$, well below the spin gap itself and before any appreciable rise in spinon density or change in zero-temperature mean-field parameters. At still higher temperatures, the spinon density increases rapidly leading to a breakdown of the Schwinger boson approach. Our results may help to explain the low-energy spectral weight observed in the neutron scattering experiments on kagome Herbertsmithites within a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin-liquid framework.
