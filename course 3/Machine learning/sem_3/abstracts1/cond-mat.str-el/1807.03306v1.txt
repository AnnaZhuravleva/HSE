Herein, we introduce the framework of gauge invariant variables to describe fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, and prove that the wavefunction can be represented by a unique holomorphic multi-variable complex function. Within this framework, we derive the guiding center Schr\"{o}dinger's equation governing FQH states; it has a novel structure. Our framework applies to \emph{all} Landau levels. As a special case, it yields the well-known holomorphic function representation of wavefunctions inside the lowest Landau level. Our formulation is apt for incorporating a new combination of techniques, from symmetric functions, Galois theory and complex analysis, to accurately predict the physics of FQH states.
