In this work, we study the time evolution of entanglement hamiltonian during the process of thermalization in a two dimensional conformal field theory after a quantum quench from a special class of initial states. Based on conformal mappings, the exact forms of both entanglement hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum of the subsystem can be obtained. Aside from some interesting features, it is found that the entanglement hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum are exactly the same as those in a thermal ensemble in the infinite time limit. The entanglement spectrum approaches its steady value exponentially in time. We also study the modular flows generated by the entanglement hamiltonian in Minkowski spacetime, which provides us an intuitive picture on how the entanglement propagates and how the subsystem is thermalized. Furthermore, the effect of a generic initial state is also discussed.
