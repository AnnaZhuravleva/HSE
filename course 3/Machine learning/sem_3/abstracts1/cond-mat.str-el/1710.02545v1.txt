We study boundary conditions of topological sigma models with the goal of generalizing the concepts of anomalous symmetry and symmetry protected topological order. We find a version of 't Hooft's anomaly matching conditions on the renormalization group flow of boundaries of invertible topological sigma models and discuss several examples of anomalous boundary theories. We also comment on bulk topological transitions in dynamical sigma models and argue that one can, with care, use topological data to draw sigma model phase diagrams.
