Gapped interfaces (and boundaries) of two-dimensional (2D) Abelian topological phases are shown to support a remarkably rich sequence of 1D symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states. We show that such interfaces can provide a physical interpretation for the corrections to the topological entanglement entropy of a 2D state with Abelian topological order found in Ref. 29. The topological entanglement entropy decomposes as $\gamma = \gamma_a + \gamma_s$, where $\gamma_a$ only depends on universal topological properties of the 2D state, while a non-zero correction $\gamma_s$ signals the emergence of the 1D SPT state that is produced by interactions along the entanglement cut and provides a direct measure of the stabilizing symmetry of the resulting SPT state. A correspondence is established between the possible values of $\gamma_s$ associated with a given interface - which is named Boundary Topological Entanglement Sequence - and classes of 1D SPT states. We show that symmetry-preserving domain walls along such 1D interfaces (or boundaries) generally host localized parafermion-like excitations that are stable to local symmetry-preserving perturbations.
