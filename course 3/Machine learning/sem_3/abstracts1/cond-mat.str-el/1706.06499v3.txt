We obtain a controlled description of a strongly correlated regime of electronic behaviour. We begin by arguing that there are two ways to characterise the electronic degree of freedom, either by the canonical fermion algebra or the graded Lie algebra su(2|2). The first underlies the Fermi liquid description of correlated matter, and we identify a novel regime governed by the latter. We exploit an exceptional central extension of su(2|2) to employ a perturbative scheme recently developed by Shastry, and obtain a series of successive approximations for the electronic Green's function. We then focus on the leading approximation, which reveals a splitting in two of the electronic dispersion. The Luttinger sum rule is violated, and a Mott metal-insulator transition is exhibited. We offer a perspective.
