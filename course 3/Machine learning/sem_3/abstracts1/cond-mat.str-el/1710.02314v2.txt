Edge theories of symmetry-protected topological phases are well-known to possess global symmetry anomalies. In this work we focus on two-dimensional bosonic phases protected by an on-site symmetry and analyse the corresponding edge anomalies in more detail. Physical interpretations of the anomaly in terms of an obstruction to orbifolding and constructing symmetry-preserving boundaries are connected to the cohomology classification of symmetry-protected phases in two dimensions. Using the tensor network and matrix product state formalism we numerically illustrate our arguments and discuss computational detection schemes to identify symmetry-protected order in a ground state wave function.
