We study the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for equivariant K-theory in the context of band theory. Various notions in the band theory such as irreducible representations at high-symmetric points, the compatibility relation, topological gapless and singular points naturally fits into the AHSS. As an application of the AHSS, we get the complete list of topological invariants for 230 space groups without time-reversal or particle-hole invariance. We find that a lot of torsion topological invariants appear even for symmorphic space groups.
