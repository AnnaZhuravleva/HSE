In recent experiments, time-dependent periodic fields are used to create exotic topological phases of matter with potential applications ranging from quantum transport to quantum computing. These non-equilibrium states, at high driving frequencies, exhibit the quintessential robustness against local disorder that is also seen at equilibrium. However, the existence of topological stability under a general setting is an open problem. We propose an effective theory that leverages on modern free probability theory and ideas in random matrices to analytically capture the existence of the topological phase for finite driving frequencies and across a range of disorder. We predict that, depending on the strength of disorder, such systems may be gapped (topological) or gapless (trivial). The theory can be used to predict properties of the transition between the two phases including the critical point. We corroborate our results by comparing to exact diagonalization for driven-disordered 1D Kitaev chain and 2D Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) models.
