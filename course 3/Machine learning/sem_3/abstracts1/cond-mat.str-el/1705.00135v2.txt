We study interacting Majorana fermions in two dimensions as a low-energy effective model of a vortex lattice in two-dimensional time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors. For that purpose, we implement ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo simulation to the Majorana fermion system in which the path-integral measure is given by a semi-positive Pfaffian. We discuss spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry at finite temperature.
