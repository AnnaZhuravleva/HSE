We study novel three-dimensional quantum phases of matter which support particles with restricted mobility, including immobile "fracton" excitations. Many fracton models may be viewed as generalized Abelian lattice gauge theories. Here, by analogy with Dijkgraaf-Witten topological gauge theories, we discover a natural generalization of fracton models, obtained by twisting the gauge symmetries. Introducing generalized gauge transformation operators carrying extra phase factors depending on local configurations, we construct a large and rich family of exactly solvable three-dimensional models, which we dub "twisted fracton models." A key result of our approach is to demonstrate explicitly the existence of non-Abelian fractons (as well as non-Abelian quasi-particles whose motion is restricted to some dimensions) in a three-dimensional system with local interactions. We further characterize these twisted fracton phases by embedding them on a three-torus and computing their ground state degeneracies, which depend sub-extensively on the system size. Moreover, as an important advance in the study of fracton order, we develop a general mathematical framework which systematically captures the fusion and braiding properties of fractons and other quasi-particles with restricted mobility.
