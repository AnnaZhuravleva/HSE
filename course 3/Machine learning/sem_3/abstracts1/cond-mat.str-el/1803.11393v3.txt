Spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking can be described in the framework of Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) by linearly superposing local tensors belonging to two (or more) symmetry classes of tensors. This is illustrated in the case of a frustrated spin-1 Heisenberg model on the square lattice, which hosts a nematic spin liquid spontaneously breaking lattice $\pi/2$-rotation symmetry. A superposition of SU(2)-symmetric PEPS tensors belonging to two irreducible representations of the lattice point group is shown to capture accurately the properties of the nematic phase, as shown from a comparison to Exact Diagonalisations and Density Matrix Renormalization Group results.
