We studied the ground state of alkaline-earth-metal atoms confined in one-dimensional optical lattices with an effective hybridization generated by a suitable laser field. This system is modeled by the periodic Anderson model plus a quadratic confining potential, and we adopted the density-matrix renormalization group to calculate its ground state. We found a one-to-one correspondence between the local variance, the local von Neumann entropy, and the on-site spin-spin correlation. For low global densities, we observed the formation of local singlets between delocalized and localized atoms and found Kondo spin liquid domains that can be tuned with the confining potential, the hybridization, and the local repulsion. Band insulator, metallic, phase separation, and Kondo spin liquid regions coexist in the ground state.
