Quantum phase transitions (QPTs), including symmetry breaking and topological types, always associated with gap closing and opening. We analyze the topological features of the quantum phase boundary of the XY model in a transverse magnetic field. Based on the results from graphs in the auxiliary space, we find that gapless ground states at boundary have different topological characters. On the other hand, In the framework of Majorana representation, the Majorana lattice is shown to be two coupled SSH chains. The analysis of the quantum fidelity for the Majorana eigen vector indicates the signature of QPT for the gapless state. Furthermore numerical computation shows that the transition between two types of gapless phases associates with divergence of second-order derivative of groundstate energy density, which obeys scaling behavior. It indicates that a continues QPT can occur among gapless phases. The underlying mechanism of the gapless QPT is also discussed. The gap closing and opening are not necessary for a QPT.
