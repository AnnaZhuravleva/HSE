It was recently proposed that an effective space-time supersymmetry emerges at low energies when a Dirac or Weyl semimetal is tuned to a quantum critical point at which the fermion $\psi$ and the bosonic order parameter $\phi$ are both massless. In this paper, we examine under what circumstances could supersymmetry emerge. At the quantum critical point, a bosonic order parameter develops as a result of certain type of fermion pairing, and acquires its own dynamics after integrating out fermions. It is, however, usually dangerous to integrate out massless fermions, as such procedure might yield nonlocal contributions to the $\phi^{2n}$ terms with integer $n > 1$. Such nonlocal terms are non-supersymmetric. Hence, there exists a necessary condition for supersymmetry to be generated in a quantum critical system. We apply this condition to examine some systems that were argued to display supersymmetry at low energies, and demonstrate that no supersymmetry emerges.
