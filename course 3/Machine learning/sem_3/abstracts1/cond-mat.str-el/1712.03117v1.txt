We show how adiabatically varying the driving frequency of a periodically-driven many-body quantum system can induce controlled transitions between resonant eigenstates of the time-averaged Hamiltonian. It is argued that these can be understood as adiabatic transitions in the Floquet spectrum at quasi-degeneracies. Using the central spin model as an illustration, we show how such controlled driving processes can lead to a polarization-based decoupling of the central spin from its decoherence-inducing environment. While it is generally impossible to obtain the exact Floquet Hamiltonian in driven interacting systems, we exploit the integrability of the central spin model to show how techniques from quenches in integrability can be used to explicitly construct the Floquet Hamiltonian in a restricted many-body basis.
