We extend the formalism of Matrix Product States (MPS) to describe one-dimensional gapped systems of fermions with both unitary and anti-unitary symmetries. Additionally, systems with orientation-reversing spatial symmetries are considered. The short-ranged entangled phases of such systems are classified by three invariants, which characterize the projective action of the symmetry on edge states. We give interpretations of these invariants as properties of states on the closed chain. The relationship between fermionic MPS systems at an RG fixed point and equivariant algebras is exploited to derive a group law for the stacking of fermionic phases. The result generalizes known classifications to symmetry groups that are non-trivial extensions of fermion parity and time-reversal.
