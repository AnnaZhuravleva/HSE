A versatile and efficient variational approach is developed to solve in- and out-of-equilibrium problems of generic quantum spin-impurity systems. Employing the discrete symmetry hidden in spin-impurity models, we present a new canonical transformation that completely decouples the impurity and bath degrees of freedom. Combining it with Gaussian states, we present a family of many-body states to efficiently encode nontrivial impurity-bath correlations. We demonstrate its successful application to the anisotropic and two-lead Kondo models by studying their spatiotemporal dynamics and universal behavior in the correlations, relaxation times and the differential conductance. We compare them to previous analytical and numerical results. In particular, we apply our method to study new types of nonequilibrium phenomena that have not been studied by other methods, such as long-time crossover in the ferromagnetic easy-plane Kondo model. The present approach will be applicable to a variety of unsolved problems in solid-state and ultracold-atomic systems.
