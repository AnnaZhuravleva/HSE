We investigate unconventional superconductivity in three-dimensional electronic systems with the chemical potential close to a quadratic band touching point in the band dispersion. Short-range interactions can lead to d-wave superconductivity, described by a complex tensor order parameter. We elucidate the general structure of the corresponding Ginzburg--Landau free energy and apply these concepts to the case of an isotropic band touching point. For vanishing chemical potential, the ground state of the system is given by the superconductor analogue of the uniaxial nematic state, which features line nodes in the excitation spectrum of quasiparticles. In contrast to the theory of real tensor order in liquid crystals, however, the ground state is selected here by the sextic terms in the free energy. At finite chemical potential, the nematic state has an additional instability at weak coupling and low temperatures. In particular, the one-loop coefficients in the free energy indicate that at weak coupling genuinely complex orders, which break time-reversal symmetry, are energetically favored. We relate our analysis to recent measurements in the half-Heusler compound YPtBi and discuss the role of the cubic crystal symmetry.
